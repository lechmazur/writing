<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theo's motivation ("compulsion to discover what ceilings hide") drives him into the office, but once inside his actions are largely responsive to ghost prompts rather than self-generated choices under competing pressures. The climactic decision to open the grate feels inevitable rather than a trade-off with visible cost—he performs a service, the ghosts dissolve, and he pockets a talisman. Interiority leans on label-only emotions ("heart quickened, but he felt no fear") and lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak beats. The gift of seeing ghosts remains a告知 trait rather than a constraint that forces difficult micro-choices on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture (dust patterns, clockwork spirals, ceiling cracks converge to reveal the buried watchmaker). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Decisive Change: Theo lowers the remains, ghosts dissolve, burden lifts. Cost is visible (the burden lifts "fractionally," suggesting partial relief rather than full resolution), but the turn feels procedural—solve the puzzle, release the ghosts—without a high-stakes choice that forecloses another path. The vision-dump ("memories flooded Theo's mind") tells the backstory rather than dramatizing it, softening causal pressure at the pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The circus ticket office is vivid and purposeful: boarded window, residual power, warped counter, cracked ceiling mural all ground the action and provide clues (dust eddies, rusted grate, hidden lock). Dust accumulation patterns function as micro-setting, constraining Theo's investigative path and charging the final reveal. The mainspring barrel under the counter and the grate above create spatial choreography that matters. Sensory detail is selective (mildew, distant popcorn dreams, unraveling-wire moan) and filtered through Theo's professional lens, though the circus atmosphere risks postcard charm without enough friction from the ghosts' desperation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: discover what the ceiling hides, release the trapped ghosts. Pressure accumulates through observation (dust patterns, ceiling cracks, ghost gestures) toward the grate reveal, but escalation is linear—each clue leads to the next without a reversal or complicating choice. The mainspring barrel's discovery and the key inside provide a tightening, yet Theo never risks anything or trades one good for another; he simply completes the task. The ghost moans and vision provide emotional color but do not force a tactical shift. Cost is implied (burden lifts fractionally), but the stakes remain intellectual curiosity rather than a high-wire moral or survival calculus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Cracks in the façade" recurs as image (ceiling cracks, mainspring cracks, circus façade of joy) and accrues thematic weight: brittle appearances conceal buried truth. The final line ("circus's ghosts finally clocked out") offers a non-literal answer to the central question—time stopped for these performers, now released—without moralizing. The theme emerges from particulars (watchmaker's obsession, snapped spring, confetti mechanism), though the vision-dump risks telling rather than showing the thematic payload. Subtext operates in the dust spirals and ghost gestures, but the piece occasionally edges toward symbolic convenience (the mainspring as literalized metaphor for broken time).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Distance modulates appropriately (tight on Theo's observations, slight zoom for ghost memories). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("weightless burden," "unraveling wire," "clocked out"), with purposeful compression in the dust-pattern analysis. The vision sequence ("memories flooded Theo's mind") shifts into summary mode, softening immediacy at a peak beat. Dialogue is minimal (one line: "Who hides above?") and functional. Perceptual signature is clear—Theo notices dust, cracks, mechanical details—though the filter "his eyes tracing" and similar constructions occasionally dull directness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, though several lines loop or paraphrase: "ghosts he saw were his true companions—a weightless burden that clung without weighing him down" restates the same idea; "thick, undisturbed drifts by the walls, but swirling eddies near the center" could compress further. The vision paragraph summarizes backstory ("the watchmaker ticket seller, obsessed with time's precision, had rigged…") where dramatization would sharpen pressure. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "façade begging to crack" and "unraveling wire" work, though "distant popcorn dreams" borders on decorative. Minor filter-verb reliance ("his eyes tracing," "his gaze fixed") in mid-pressure beats. No major loops or scaffold, but the piece could tighten by ~50 words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The elevator-tech-who-sees-ghosts + circus-ticket-office combination is specific and the dust-pattern method feels fresh. The mainspring-as-puzzle-piece and circus-time metaphor are coherent but edge toward symbolic convenience—the watchmaker's broken spring maps too neatly onto "cracks in the façade." The vision-dump backstory is a convenience that tells rather than discovers. Emotional truth (Theo's calm professionalism, fractional burden relief) avoids sentimentality, and the final "clocked out" pun is earned. The piece synthesizes its elements competently but stops short of a bold structural or perspectival risk that would push originality higher.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theo (elevator tech who sees ghosts) is present throughout and his gift enables the entire investigation. His choice to enter, kneel, analyze dust, lift the barrel, and open the grate drive all major beats. The trait "sees ghosts" provides clues (ghost gestures, moans) but does not constrain his choices with visible cost—he feels no fear and proceeds methodically. The ending (lowering remains, burden lifts) is his action, but it feels like task completion rather than a high-stakes decision that forecloses another path. Early signal, three beats (enter/observe, analyze/lift barrel, open grate), closure linkage, but limited causal pressure from the trait itself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mainspring barrel appears mid-story (Theo's boot nudges it), is examined (cracks mirror ceiling cracks), and yields the key that unlocks the grate. It is handled across two beats (discovery/inspection, key extraction) and directly shapes the climax. The object's specifics (tarnished brass, circus emblems, micro-cracks) matter and tie to the watchmaker backstory. Not signaled early (no setup in first third), but development and payoff are strong; the barrel is indispensable to the resolution and its symbolic resonance (broken time) charges the ending. Late introduction caps upside, but causal work and closure linkage are undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Cracks in the façade" recurs across ceiling cracks, mainspring cracks, and the circus's false joy. It shapes Theo's investigation (he traces cracks, notes patterns) and the thematic payload (concealment, brittle surfaces). The concept does not tighten a tactical choice—Theo does not choose between preserving or exposing a façade—but it reweights the ending image (secrets laid bare, cracks sealed in truth). Setup via ceiling description, development through pattern accumulation, payoff in thematic closure. Lyric reprise rather than causal pressure; eligible for mid-6s under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Skillfully observant" is demonstrated through dust-pattern analysis, noting micro-cracks, and spotting the hidden grate. The trait enables the investigation but does not constrain or trade off—Theo's observations cost him nothing and never mislead. No visible price or friction (e.g., missing social cues, tunnel vision under stress). The trait is functional across beats but replaceable with generic detective competence. Label + action, no cost; mid-band at best.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Engage" is dramatized when Theo steps forward, asks "Who hides above?" and follows the ghost's gesture. This beat pivots the story from passive observation to active investigation. The engagement recurs when he pries the barrel, climbs the stool, and lowers the remains. The action is specific to Theo's calm authority and shapes the arc, but it is not irreplaceable—another investigator could engage similarly. Early signal (implied by his entrance and "skillfully observant" stance), two beats (question/follow, pry/lower), closure linkage. Solid integration, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Analyzing dust accumulation patterns is introduced early (second paragraph: "dust accumulation patterns across the floorboards") and applied twice: once to infer spectral traffic, again to spot clockwork spirals near the grate. The method matters—it narrows the search and validates the hidden mechanism—but the second use leans expository ("fine motes aligned in clockwork spirals, not random settling"). Setup, development (spotting anomalies), and payoff (guides to grate) are present, but the method could be replaced with another observational skill (e.g., structural clues, tool marks) without breaking logic. Solid causal work, limited irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office supplies all key resources: the warped counter (hides barrel), the cracked ceiling (hides grate), residual power (fluorescents die to trigger ghost emergence), and spatial constraints (rickety stool for access). The setting pressures Theo's choices (must navigate darkness, climb unstably) and charges the final image (circus façade, ghosts released). Early anchor, multiple beats (entry, counter search, ceiling inspection, grate access), closure participation. The setting is indispensable—remove the ticket office structure and the plot fails. Strong integration across all gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The fluorescent buzz dies "completely" mid-story, plunging the office into shadow and triggering ghost emergence. This single beat matters (darkness enables the supernatural encounter), but the timeframe is not tracked or tightened—no clock pressures Theo's investigation, and the buzz is not revisited. Setup (fluorescents hum), development (they die), but no payoff or constraint on the ending. Functional for one turn, replaceable with any other trigger (storm, sunset). Mid-low band for single-beat involvement without escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To discover what ceilings hide" drives Theo into the office and sustains his investigation through dust analysis, barrel inspection, and grate opening. The motivation is told ("driven by a compulsion") rather than dramatized through competing wants or fears. No friction—Theo never hesitates, weighs retreat, or sacrifices another goal. The desire shapes the arc and lands at closure (ceilings' secrets laid bare), but lacks on-page conflict or cost. Setup, development across beats, payoff; functional but not irreplaceable with another curiosity-driven motive. Desire without friction; mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Weightless burden" is introduced early ("ghosts…a weightless burden that clung without weighing him down") and reprised at closure ("the weightless burden lifting fractionally"). The tone is coherent—melancholy professionalism, calm amid the spectral—and modulates slightly (heart quickens, then steadies). The phrase charges the final image by literalizing relief. Setup and payoff are clear, but mid-story the tone flattens into procedural investigation without tonal deepening. Lyric reprise reweights the stake; eligible for mid-5s under the allowance, not higher without stronger modulation across beats.</comment>
