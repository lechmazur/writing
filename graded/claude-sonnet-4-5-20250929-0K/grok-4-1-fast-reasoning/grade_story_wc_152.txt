<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is present but heavily abstracted through label-like descriptions ("wisdom as foolishness," "motivation burned deeper"). Her choices at the end—slipping the chart into the courier's satchel—feel mechanical rather than embodying internal contradiction under pressure. The disguised-fool persona is told repeatedly but never dramatized through a micro-choice that reveals competing impulses. Embodied emotion is scarce; "eyes sharpened" and "mind raced" replace concrete physical sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph, meeting the test. The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: layers of stitching, flame observation, and chart completion build toward the courier moment. However, the closure—chart delivered, coup "poised to thwart"—occurs off-page in future consequence rather than landing as an on-page reconfiguration with felt cost. The final image ("candle burned eternal, witness to her quiet triumph") asserts triumph without dramatizing the cost or stakes shift that would qualify as Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory and eternal candle anchor setting vividly. Autumn leaves tap-tapping and mist create atmosphere, though sensory detail remains largely visual. The candle's flame constrains one mid-story choice (tilting it closer to reveal phantom stars), meeting the Q3 9+ gate partially. Spatial choreography is minimal—Elara remains at her hoop—so environment pressure is light. The setting charges the final image modestly but does not drive a decisive turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—warning the queen to prevent the coup—is signaled early. However, escalation is weak: Elara completes the chart without meaningful reversal or on-page cost that narrows her options. The courier's arrival is coincidental convenience, and slipping the chart into his satchel requires no sacrifice or risk dramatized on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or reweight; here it remains static from midpoint to end. No tightening choice forecloses a live path with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truth versus official deceit emerges through the forged starlogs and embroidery as counter-narrative. The eternal flame and "adjacent possibilities" offer recurring images, but they do not shift meaning at closure—they remain decorative anchors. The final paragraph moralizes lightly ("stars would not lie"), trending toward statement over resonance. Subtext is thin; Elara's cackled disguise is told rather than implied through gesture or silence. The piece invites modest reflection but lacks a non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic: "eyes sharpened," "mind raced," "ear cocked" repeat across beats without character-specific texture. Diction occasionally elevates ("echoed silence wrapped the domed chamber like a shroud") beyond the focalizer's situational register, creating mild distance drift. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("Silly stars, always drawing blood!") but not distinct or subtext-rich. Voice lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; syntax remains uniform throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Template cadence dominates: "Elara [verb], her [noun]…" and "She [verb], [participle]…" runs pervade the piece. Paraphrase loops recur: "echoed silence" appears at least four times; "adjacent possibilities" and "unheard stories" are repeated without reweighting. Filter-verb stacks ("hearing not sound but absence," "claims knowledge not available") dull immediacy. Purple prose clusters in descriptive beats ("swirling like conspirators' cloaks") without concrete propulsion. Figurative density is high but often mixed or ornamental. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: −1.4 in Q7, and the final-third presence disallows 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The premise—embroiderer as spy, star charts as intelligence tool—offers a fresh synthesis. However, execution leans on stock fantasy tropes: the disguised-wise-fool, the eternal flame, the eleventh-hour warning. Emotional specificity is low; the protagonist's internal arc follows a predictable path without genuine friction or transformation. The "adjacent possibilities" mechanism is mentioned but not integrated into lived detail or moral calculus. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece hedges toward safety in both structure and resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes one key choice (slipping the chart). However, that decision is convenient rather than pressured; no on-page cost or trade-off accompanies it. She observes extensively but agency is low until the final beat, and that beat is not causally constrained by prior refusals or sacrifices. Setup and closure gates are met; development gate is weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The eternal candle appears in setup (ignited at founding), mid-story use (tilted to reveal phantom stars), and final image (witness to triumph). It enables one beat but is largely atmospheric. The flame's mechanics—burning without fuel, synchronizing time—are told but not causally decisive. Closure linkage is present but passive (witness, not agent). Setup, development, closure gates all met; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Unraveling conspiracies drives the plot: Elara deduces forged starlogs and embeds the correction in silk. The concept shapes her tactics (disguising wisdom, listening for unheard stories) and the dominant stake. Setup, development, and closure all hinge on it. Causal pressure is solid; the concept is not easily swappable. Specificity and cost linkage are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The disguise-wisdom-as-foolishness trait is mentioned repeatedly ("feigning a giggle," "cackled aloud," "babbled, spilling tea") but never constrains a choice with visible cost. The courier scene suggests the disguise aids concealment, but no on-page friction tests it. Setup gate met; development and closure gates absent. The trait is label-only and ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Synchronize appears in two contexts: Elara synchronizes stitches with the candle's flame and the chart "synchronized" with the heavens. The action is told rather than dramatized; we do not see the mechanics of how timing alters the embroidery. Setup and development gates met; closure gate weak. The action could be replaced with "align" or "correct" with minor edits. Causal pressure is present but modest.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Adjacent possibilities is mentioned three times as a thematic phrase but never defined or enacted as a method. The candle's flame "illuminating adjacent possibilities" is told; we do not see Elara choosing among alternate star positions or how the method constrains her tactics. Setup gate met (early mention); development and closure gates absent. Ornamental use without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory anchors setting from the opening and recurs in the final image ("cobalt observatory her silent sentinel"). Autumn elements (leaves, chill, mist) create atmosphere and modest temporal pressure. The setting provides the candle and stained glass but does not constrain a key choice. Setup and closure gates met; development gate moderate. Micro-setting (hoop, candle) is more functional than macro-setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "before the coup" is signaled early and mentioned at closure ("two dawns hence"). However, the clock does not tighten on-page decisions; Elara works at her own pace, and the courier's arrival is coincidental rather than deadline-driven. Setup and closure gates met; development gate weak. Time is present but not a live constraint that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Listening for unheard stories is stated as Elara's motivation and recurs thematically. It drives her decision to embed the warning but is not dramatized through on-page friction or competing desires. Setup and closure gates met; development gate weak (no choice tests the motivation against a cost). The motivation is told rather than embodied in contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Echoed silence appears in the opening ("echoed silence wrapped the domed chamber"), mid-story ("In echoed silence, the eternal flame steadied"), and closing ("silence echoing with secrets"). The tone is coherent and modulates mildly with pressure (leaves tapping, wind howling). It charges the final image but does not constrain a choice. Setup, development, and closure gates all met; causal pressure is low but resonance is present.</comment>
