<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Thorne is defined almost entirely through label ("shadow-laced," "calmly intuitive," "courageous anomaly") rather than contradictory impulses or embodied choices under pressure. The parley features stock diplomatic moves—raising a hand, meeting gazes—without micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values or visible cost. The wraith and dryad remain one-note abstractions (isolation, fear) articulated through expository glimpses rather than dramatized friction. Motivation is declared ("map empathy onto action") but never conflicts with a competing want or fear that would force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is severely delayed: who Thorne is, where the vintage store sits relative to the orchard, and what the "weighted breath before reply" timeframe means remain vague well past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The closure—reconstituting the crystal ball via shadow-threading—arrives as convenience: the fragment "hums" and "shards orbit" without prior setup of mechanics or cost, and the holographic map solution appears ex nihilo. The causal link from "aligning glimpses" to "peace sealed" is asserted, not dramatized, leaving the decisive change feeling told rather than earned on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and vintage store offer vivid atmospheric details (gnarled trees, fogged mirrors, aged brass scent), but spatial choreography is unclear—how Thorne moves from orchard to store base, where the table sits relative to the mirrors, and how the ice floes "below" relate to the orchard "above" remain abstract. The mirrors function as thematic devices (glimpses of hidden truths) but do not constrain a tactical choice; they deliver exposition (wraith's loneliness, dryad's terror) rather than forcing Thorne to navigate the room or manipulate objects under pressure. The orchard's frost-kissed fruit at the end is postcard description, not a resource or constraint that altered outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing war between wraiths and orchard—is signaled early, but escalation is missing: the wraith's mockery ("You? A shadow-tainted outlier dares?") deflates immediately when Thorne acts, with no resistance, adaptation, or complication. The reconstitution succeeds in a single uncontested beat, and both sides bow without cost to Thorne—no stamina drain, relational price, or foreclosed option. The "weighted breath before reply" timeframe is invoked but never tightens tactics; Thorne's circling and finger-dancing proceed at leisure, and coincidence (the mirrors happen to hold the exact empathies needed) resolves the conflict without protagonist agency driving a reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Theme is over-articulated through prompt labels ("map empathy onto action," "courageous anomaly," "shadow-laced peacekeeper") repeated in narration and final summary rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The crystal ball and mirrors function as thematic symbols but lack specificity—any mystical device could deliver the same empathy-mapping function. The ending moralizes overtly: "empathy no longer abstract, but etched in crystal and action" and "anomalies like her ensured the fragile weave held" are thesis statements, not resonant images. The wraith's and dryad's emotional arcs (isolation mirroring isolation) are declared symmetries without the friction or asymmetry that would invite ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Thorne, but the prose drifts into elevated, prompt-adjacent register ("shadow-laced peacekeeper whose calm intuition turned mirrors' glimpses into mended worlds") that clashes with the visceral stakes of a war parley. Dialogue is sparse and functional but lacks subtext: the wraith's "You hoard the beam's warmth" and Thorne's "To end this, we reconstitute what was sundered" are thesis-adjacent rather than goal-driven speech acts. Perceptual signature is weak—Thorne's noticing (eyes flicking to mirrors, fingers dancing) is generic rather than character-particular, and the final paragraph recycles the opening's descriptors ("courageous anomaly," "calmly intuitive") in near-identical phrasing, flattening voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "shadow-laced peacekeeper" appears four times, "courageous anomaly" three times, "calmly intuitive" twice, and "map empathy onto action" twice, often in nearly identical clauses. Stock metaphor strings ("eyes flicking," "shadows coiling," "leaf-veined," "bark-skinned") appear in most high-pressure beats without fresh embodiment. Register drifts into abstract exposition mid-scene: "Not illusions, but empathic truths, refracted through the mirrors' antique patina" and "With a breath syncing to the lighthouse pulse above, she channeled the mappings" are tonally disconnected from the immediate threat of war. Simultaneity errors: "Gasps rippled; minions stilled, dryad's leaves unfurled slightly" implies overlapping reactions in a single instant, and the final two paragraphs loop the same closure sentiment across adjacent lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The premise—mystical peacekeeper uses empathy device to avert war—closely follows a familiar template (mediator discovers opponents' hidden pain and brokers harmony) without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The vintage store mirrors, lighthouse orchard, and ice wraiths are vivid but interchangeable: swap mirrors for another scrying device, orchard for another contested resource, and the arc remains unchanged. The "weighted breath before reply" frame is invoked but not exploited for tension, and the reconstitution succeeds without a bold structural or perspectival risk—no failed first attempt, no price paid in Thorne's shadow-nature, no wraith or dryad defecting to complicate the peace.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Thorne (shadow-laced peacekeeper) is present throughout and her decision to place the fragment and thread shadows drives the reconstitution beat, satisfying setup, development, and payoff gates. However, her choices are uncontested: the wraith's mockery dissolves without resistance, and no tactical constraint (e.g., limited shadow reserves, risk of losing herself in the threading) forces a trade-off. Swappable: another mediator with a different mystical trait could perform the same function with minor edits. Band guidance: one key beat + closure presence lifts it above ornamental, but lack of visible cost caps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The broken crystal ball fragment is introduced early (setup), placed on the table and handled in the reconstitution beat (development), and becomes the whole orb that Thorne lifts at closure (payoff), hitting all three gates. It enables the empathy-mapping and appears in the final image, but its specific properties (sharp edges, discordant echoes) do not constrain Thorne's tactics—she threads shadows without cost or complication. Swappability: another mystical artifact (amulet, lens) could serve the same plot function. Band guidance: two beats + closure linkage, but moderate irreplaceability and no visible cost tied to its use limit the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Courageous anomaly" is invoked as a label throughout (opening, mid-scene, closing summary) but does not shape on-page choices with cost. Thorne's anomaly status is asserted ("no flaw but the courage to exist beyond binaries") rather than tested: she does not risk instability, social rejection, or identity fracture when threading shadows. The concept functions as theme claim, not tactical constraint. Missing development gate: the anomaly does not enable or foreclose an option in a middle beat. Band guidance: present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" is mentioned twice (opening, final paragraph) and associated with Thorne sensing "fractures before they widened" and "threading the undercurrents," but these are summary claims. On the page, Thorne's actions (placing the fragment, circling the table, aligning glimpses) are uncontested and do not demonstrate a visible trade-off between calm and urgency or intuition and evidence. Missing middle gate: no beat where intuition constrains her (e.g., misreads a glimpse, must choose between rational plan and gut sense). Band guidance: label-only use with no dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" is signaled in Thorne's declaration ("we reconstitute what was sundered"), executed in the shadow-threading beat where the fragment hums and shards orbit, and completed when the whole orb glows on the table, satisfying all three gates. The action drives the plot's major turn (war to peace) and appears in the final image (Thorne lifts the orb). However, the mechanics are asserted ("shadows knitting light," "empathies flowed now tangible") without prior setup or visible cost, and another mediating action (e.g., merge, harmonize) could replace it with minor edits. Band guidance: essential across beats but moderate irreplaceability and no cost connection prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The vintage store mirrors are introduced early ("walls lined with mirrors salvaged from sunken grandeur") and their function (capturing "glimpses of hidden truths") is signaled before the parley. In the key beat, "Glimpses ignited within the glass: the wraith's core loneliness… the dryad's terror," which Thorne uses to align empathies, satisfying setup, development, and payoff gates. However, the mirrors' mechanics are passive—they deliver exposition without Thorne manipulating them under constraint (e.g., choosing which mirror, risking a false glimpse, shattering one to access deeper truth). Swappability: another scrying method (pool, smoke, psychic link) could serve the same function. Band guidance: one key turn but replaceable and no cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard perched above shifting ice floes is vividly described (opening and closing images) and provides atmospheric pressure (ice floes grinding, frost-kissed fruit), satisfying setup and a lyric payoff. However, it does not constrain a middle choice: the parley occurs in the vintage store, and the orchard's spatial relationship to the floes does not alter Thorne's tactics or options. The floes "whispering thanks below" at closure is postcard resonance, not causal participation. Missing development gate. Band guidance: present and purposeful in framing but not essential to the central conflict's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"The weighted breath before reply" is invoked as the timeframe ("In that weighted breath before reply—the pause heavy as leaden fog") and reprised at closure ("The parley dissolved into murmurs of accord, the weighted breath birthing not reply, but renewal"). Setup and payoff are present, but the timeframe does not tighten Thorne's tactics—she circulates, dances fingers, and threads shadows at leisure without a visible clock or consequence for delay. Missing development gate: the pause does not force a choice (e.g., act before the wraith strikes, choose speed over precision). Band guidance: lyric reprise but no pressure function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To map empathy onto action" is stated as Thorne's duty in the opening, motivates her calling the parley, and is fulfilled at closure ("empathy no longer abstract, but etched in crystal and action"), satisfying all three gates. The motivation drives her decision to place the fragment and thread shadows. However, it is never conflicted—no competing want (self-preservation, doubt in the method, cost to her shadow-nature) creates friction. The motivation is told and aligned with plot convenience rather than dramatized with visible cost. Band guidance: shapes one key turn but lacks friction and cost.</comment>
