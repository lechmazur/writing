<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's trait of tasting memories is label-heavy but does motivate the planting choice. The "informally wise" attribute appears mostly as voice flourish ("Life's like a bad stew") rather than constraining decisions with visible cost. Internal contradiction is minimal; he moves smoothly from reflection to action without genuine struggle or competing impulses that would complicate the peak choice. The final act (planting and first harvest) feels earned by setup but lacks embodied emotional cost—no visceral fear, doubt, or physical toll dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece moves from ruin-pruning to seed-planting to first-shoot emergence, building density through memory-tasting and celestial imagery. Orientation is clear early (rusted greenhouse, celestial alignment, Elias alone). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the tender shoot and the vision of future rebellion crystallize the new state. Cost is implied in "cities blooming" and "Regime might raze it again," but the on-page price is abstract—no immediate forfeiture or visible tactical narrowing. One meaningful deepening occurs (pruning → planting → vision), meeting the length requirement, yet the cost lacks concrete bite.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse is anchored early with vivid detail (corroded panes, twisted vines, shattered frames) and recurs functionally: Elias must prune overgrowth to plant, the celestial light converges on the seed spot, and by dawn the shoot emerges. Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling, digging, covering), and the rusted shears are a micro-tool that enables the action. The alignment's hum and iridescent leaves charge the final image. The environment constrains the central action (must clear space) and supplies the mystical resource (cosmic resonance), meeting the 9+ gate narrowly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: plant the knowledge fruit to enable gentle rebellion. One tightening: Elias must prune the tangle before planting, a tactical hurdle. The alignment provides time pressure (peaks, then fades by dawn), and the Regime's prior destruction establishes external threat. However, no on-page opposition materializes; the pruning is effortful but not conflicted, and the seed germinates without complication. The vision of future rebellion ("minds quietly rebelling") substitutes for present cost—no immediate price paid (stamina, discovery risk, failed first attempt). Escalation under Accumulative lens is present but mild; agency is decision without felt trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of gentle rebellion emerges through Elias's history (forbidden herbs, underground gatherings) and the knowledge fruit's synaptic plasticity. The final image (memory-pruned salad, converts, testament to creation amid decay) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Motifs (pruning, memories, neural rewiring) recur and reweight meaning at closure. However, "synaptic plasticity" and "informally wise" are stated repeatedly rather than fully embodied in scene pressure, and the Regime's flavorless rations feel like exposition rather than lived cost. The piece invites reflection but stops short of full thematic surprise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-person limited. Elias's perceptual signature (tasting memories in air, "faint, plant-borne echoes") is distinct. Dialogue is minimal (two brief lines to the plants), voice-appropriate and informal. Free indirect style is clean. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register mid-sentence ("synaptic plasticity stirring not just in minds but in roots and cells," "inexorable, beautiful") that feels authorial rather than chef-particular. Psychic distance is consistent. The prose modulates with the alignment's peak but does not degrade under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary, rhythm modulates (shorter beats during the planting, longer during reflection). Information density is moderate. However, paraphrase loops appear: "gentle rebellion" is restated three times across the story without added nuance; "synaptic plasticity" recurs as exposition rather than dramatized effect. Template cadence in the memory-tasting beats ("One vine held... another..."). Stock metaphors: "neural spark," "tender shoots," "sprouting thoughts." The final paragraph's list ("memory-pruned salad with knowledge fruit dressing, to awaken the first converts") reads more expository than propulsive. Clarity is maintained, but scaffold and thematic echo reduce line-level tightness. Deductions: paraphrase-loop −0.4, template cadence −0.4, thematic label repetition −0.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The knowledge fruit and synaptic plasticity premise is science-fictional but not deeply fresh; "flavor carries memory" and "plant that rewires minds" are familiar speculative-fiction tropes. The rusted greenhouse and celestial alignment add atmospheric specificity but function as backdrop more than structural surprise. Elias's gentle rebellion (herbs in meals, pruning before planting) is thematically coherent yet predictable in execution—no turn upends expectation. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids hedging, but the arc (ruin → plant → vision of change) follows a template restoration narrative. Transformation test: swap "knowledge fruit" for another consciousness-altering plant and the emotional beats remain intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Chef who can taste memories: present in setup (tasting memories in berries/meats, ripe berries = sweet regrets), middle (tasting plant-borne echoes during pruning: laughter, eviction bitterness), and ending (tasting the first dewdrop, flooding potentials). Shapes one key turn (the memory-tasting during pruning motivates the choice to honor the old gardeners and plant anew). However, the trait is more observational than decision-driving; Elias's choice to plant is motivated by the smuggled seed and rebellion goal, not by what he tastes. The memories color his experience but do not narrow options or impose cost. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle use is atmospheric. Cap guidance: ~6.0 ceiling for two gates. Adjustments: beat involvement +0.4 (two beats: pruning, tasting dewdrop), closure linkage +0.7 (dewdrop vision), causal pressure weak +0.2, swappability −0.6 (could be generic empathy). Final: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Knowledge fruit seed: present in setup (smuggled, pressed into hand with instruction), middle (Elias digs and places it "at the heart"), and ending (shoot emerges, dewdrop tasted). Drives two beats: the planting act and the germination/vision. The seed is the object of the central action (must prune to plant it) and its germination provides the closure image. However, the seed's properties are told ("induced synaptic plasticity") rather than shown constraining a choice. Three gates met. Adjustments: early signal +0.5, beat involvement +0.9 (two beats: planting, emergence), closure linkage +1.2 (ending shoot and vision tied directly to seed), causal pressure +0.8 (planting is the goal), specificity +0.5 (unique mystical properties), summary-only mechanics −0.7 (plasticity explained, not dramatized). Final: 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Gentle rebellion: present in setup (slipping forbidden herbs, "rebelled gently his whole life"), middle (pruning as "kindest rebellion"), and ending ("gentle, inexorable, beautiful"; "minds quietly rebelling"). Frames the dominant stake and thematic lens. However, the concept is declared repeatedly rather than tested by opposing pressure or a moment of temptation toward violence. No on-page cost of choosing gentleness over force; the Regime is absent, so the "gentle" tactic is never pressured. Three gates met but causal constraint is weak. Adjustments: early signal +0.6, beat involvement +0.4 (one: pruning as rebellion metaphor), closure linkage +0.9 (final testament), causal pressure +0.3 (shapes approach but not tested), cost −0.5 (no friction between gentle and forceful options on the page), label-only −0.3 (repeated thematic claim). Final: 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Informally wise: labeled in setup ("Life's like a bad stew"), echoed in middle ("informally wise even to the dead plants"), and implied in ending (plotting the first dish with converts). Functions as voice texture and character tag. Does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost; Elias's wisdom is asserted but not dramatically tested (no moment where his informal approach fails or succeeds against formal knowledge). Present in three locations but no causal role. Adjustments: early signal +0.3, beat involvement +0.4 (one mention per third, no distinct pressure beats), closure linkage +0.0 (absent from final image), causal pressure +0.0, ornamental −0.8, label-only trait −0.3. Cap at 3.8 for swappability (could be "patient" or "street-smart" with identical beats). Final: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prune: present in setup (must clear tangle), middle (the pruning action: drawing shears, severing stems, releasing memories, pausing to taste collective memories), and ending (Elias gathered his shears, tended by pruning stray shoots). Drives the middle sequence and is the enabling action for the planting (must prune to make space). The pruning releases memory-tasting beats that deepen Elias's understanding and commitment. Physical, repeated, and causally necessary. Three gates met. Adjustments: early signal +0.6 (framed as necessary), beat involvement +1.4 (three: drawing shears, pruning sequence, tending shoots), causal pressure +1.2 (must prune to plant), closure linkage +0.9 (shears gathered at end, shoots pruned), specificity +0.6 (shears and act of cutting recur), cost +0.4 (physical effort, memory burden). Final: 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Synaptic plasticity: introduced in setup ("induced synaptic plasticity, the brain's subtle rewiring"), restated at alignment peak ("synaptic plasticity stirring not just in minds but in roots and cells"), and in ending vision ("synaptic plasticity ensured the rebellion endured"). The mechanism is the conceptual payload but is entirely explained rather than shown. No on-page demonstration of a mind rewiring, no moment where Elias or another character experiences the effect and makes a different choice. The method shapes the thematic claim but not the tactics or closure action. Two gates (setup, ending mention). Adjustments: early signal +0.4, beat involvement +0.0 (no dramatized use), closure linkage +0.3 (mentioned in vision), causal pressure +0.0 (tells the fruit's effect, does not shape on-page action), summary-only −0.8, swappability −0.5 (could be "chemical trigger" with same effect). Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development. Final: 3.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse: present in setup (corroded panes, overgrown relic, twisted vines, shattered frames), middle (Elias kneels amid chaos, greenhouse thrummed with energy), and ending (shoot emerges, greenhouse "stood quieter now, but alive"). The setting is the locus of all action: provides the soil, the space to prune, the convergence point for celestial light. Spatial detail is concrete (kneeling, digging, dew-slick leaves). The ruin state creates the need to prune (tangle choking soil) and charges the theme (beauty from ruins). Three gates met. Adjustments: early signal +0.8, beat involvement +1.4 (three: arrival/description, pruning/planting, final emergence), causal pressure +1.4 (must clear space, site enables growth), closure linkage +1.5 (final image: greenhouse alive, testament), specificity +0.7 (corroded, rusted details recur). Final: 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Once-in-a-lifetime celestial alignment: present in setup (seven planets, every millennium, cosmic resonance quickens dormant life), middle (alignment peaked, thrummed with energy, light converged on seed spot), and ending (alignment faded by dawn). Provides atmospheric charge and mystical justification for the seed's rapid germination. However, the alignment does not tighten decisions or create urgency-driven trade-offs; Elias proceeds methodically without a visible clock forcing cuts or errors. The "by dawn" endpoint is mentioned but not pressured (no risk of running out of time). Two gates (setup, ending fade). Adjustments: early signal +0.5, beat involvement +0.4 (one: peak convergence), closure linkage +0.5 (fades as shoot emerges), causal pressure +0.3 (enables mystical growth but does not narrow tactics), swappability −0.6 (could be "rare storm" with minor edits), ornamental −0.5 (provides mood more than constraint). Cap at 4.6 for late/weak middle development. Final: 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Create something beautiful from the ruins: stated in setup ("driven by a single motivation: to create something beautiful from the ruins"), echoed in middle ("sometimes pruning's the kindest rebellion—lets the new stuff breathe"), and in ending ("from ruins he'd forged not just a plant, but a legacy"). Frames the dominant stake and the emotional arc. The pruning and planting are concrete enactments of this desire. However, the motivation is declared and pursued without internal conflict or friction (no moment where beauty competes with safety, speed, or revenge). Three gates met but minimal dramatized cost. Adjustments: early signal +0.7, beat involvement +0.9 (two: pruning choice, planting commitment), closure linkage +1.3 (legacy line, testament), causal pressure +1.0 (drives the planting goal), cost +0.3 (implicit in effort and risk, not viscerally felt), told-only friction −0.5 (no competing want dramatized). Final: 6.7.</comment>
