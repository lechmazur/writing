<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is established early through the frozen clock and his wife's loss, but his interior life consists largely of abstract longing labels ("steely longing," "wistful") rather than embodied contradiction. The discovery-to-action sequence is motivated, yet pivotal beats—deciding to leave the station, climbing the arbor—are narrated as summary rather than lived choice under pressure. The final "smile" and "fingers poised" gesture reads as convenient satisfaction without visible cost that forecloses a path. Micro-choices exist (rigging the projector, navigating by reflected moonlight) but the ending renunciation or transformation remains asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (station, pianist, arbor, cloudsea) within the opening lines. The drive lens reads as Causal-Hybrid: discovery of the film reel → decoding hidden map → navigating arbor → reaching refuge. However, closure collapses into summary: "Tides hushed, compasses glowed steady… her voice, unplanned, eternal" tells the transformation rather than showing a decisive on-page moment with legible cost. The Orientation Test penalty is waived (clear anchors), but the Cost proof test fails—no single sentence at closure demonstrates what Elias gave up or what changed options moving forward. The clock "chiming once, clear and true" is asserted magic, not earned causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The Tidal Arbor and cloudsea are vivid and specific: "bark-woven platforms," "prism-leaves," "tidal surges… spraying foam that shimmered like lost stars." Spatial choreography across the climb is coherent, with Elias wedging the reel to reflect moonlight and using crevices as handholds. The refuge glade—"flowers pulsing in sync with imagined rhythms"—charges the final image with sensory detail. However, the setting does not constrain a meaningful choice at closure; the arbor's obstacles complicate the journey but do not force Elias to trade or sacrifice anything when he arrives. The 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is met only partially via the final image, capping the score at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reaching the refuge where Lira's memory and time bend—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the final tidal surge nearly sweeps Elias, forcing him to wedge into a crevice, but this complication is immediately resolved without altering tactics or foreclosing an option. Escalation reads as geographic (climbing higher) rather than pressure-driven choice under the inferred Causal lens. At closure, the clock's hands moving and the whisper of Lira's voice are coincidental magic, not the result of Elias's agency in the final beat; he plays the piano and the world responds without visible cost or trade-off. The film reel's hidden map drives the journey but does not test Elias's commitment or force a moral calculus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of love defying fate and "surprising destiny" emerges through the recurring clock, film reel, and compasses, which shift from symbols of unreliability to steadied anchors. The final image—"compasses now pointed to him, travelers drawn to the legend blooming above the clouds"—offers a resonant reconfiguration that reweights Elias's role from passive mourner to active maestro. However, the piece leans on overt thematic statements: "fate's cruel jest," "surprise it with an unplanned encore," "longing transmuted to legacy." The clock's chime and the whispered voice verge on sentimentality, asserting emotional closure rather than earning it through specific, non-literal action. The conceptual question (can grief be rewritten into presence?) is clear but answered too tidily without ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable throughout, and perceptual signature is consistent: Elias perceives the world through musical metaphors ("arbor groaning like a colossal organ," "melodies laced with resolve"). Diction is elevated and poetic, fitting a wistful artist, though occasionally slips into generic lyric register ("seductive shadows," "violet horizon") that could belong to any voice. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose modulates with emotional intensity, compressing during the climb and expanding at the refuge. Psychic distance remains close; no unmotivated POV leakage. The final "strategically creative" label feels like prompt-echo rather than lived idiom, and "steely longing" recurs as a formula rather than evolving texture, but the voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Template cadence and scaffold phrasing pervade the piece: multiple paragraphs open with "Elias [verb]" or single-word sentence fragments ("Intrigued." "There."). Stock metaphors cluster in high-pressure beats ("horizon invites night" recurs three times; "steely longing" appears five times unchanged). Paraphrase loops: "strategically creative" and "tactician" restate the same trait across adjacent lines without added pressure. The final third stacks declarative summary—"Fate recoiled; the clock shuddered… Tides hushed, compasses glowed"—that tells transformation rather than showing it through concrete action. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "arbor groaning like a colossal organ," "foam that shimmered like lost stars," "refuge gleamed," all within ten lines, muddling clarity. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 Q7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The core premise—hidden map in a vintage film reel leading to a refuge above clouds—offers a fresh synthesis of steampunk-adjacent imagery and musical longing. The arbor setting and tidal mechanics are specific and non-generic. However, the emotional arc (musician mourning lost love, seeking magical reunion) follows a familiar template, and the resolution (playing music rewinds time and summons the beloved's voice) lacks transformation; swapping names and setting would leave the emotional logic intact. The film-reel projector rigged from piano innards and compass bulbs shows ingenuity in world detail, lifting the score into mid-6s, but the ending retreats into abstraction ("longing transmuted to legacy") rather than committing fully to the premise's implications.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and makes key decisions: rigging the projector, decoding the film, leaving the station, climbing the arbor. These choices create geographic progression (station → arbor → refuge) and shape two major beats (discovery, journey). However, the final beat—playing the piano at the refuge—does not involve a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path; the clock and compasses respond passively to his music without cost or consequence tied to his agency. The character drives setup and development but does not actively transform the closure moment, capping the score in mid-5s despite beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken anniversary clock appears in four distinct beats: propped on the piano (setup), packed for the journey (development), placed center stage at the refuge, and chiming once at closure (payoff). Its hands frozen at 3:17 establish the loss, and the final chime reweights the meaning from stopped time to resumed time. However, Elias does not handle or manipulate the clock in a way that constrains his choices; it remains a symbolic marker rather than a tool or obstacle. The reprise charges the final image with emotional resonance, but specificity is low—any keepsake could serve the same function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Flickering compasses frame the arbor's core unreliability in the opening ("needles twitching erratically… pointing nowhere true"), constrain Elias's navigation tactics mid-journey ("compasses on scavenged chains around his neck flickered wildly, but the film's hidden map burned clear"), and steady at the refuge to signal resolution ("compasses steadied here, needles aligning to a hidden north"). The concept shapes stakes (direction is unreliable, threatening survival) and tactics (Elias must bypass compass guidance using the film map). At closure, steadied compasses pointing to Elias reweight his role from traveler to lodestar, participating causally in the ending image. All three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage present.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Strategically creative" appears as a label three times but is demonstrated in two on-page actions: rigging the projector from piano innards and compass bulbs, and using the reel to reflect moonlight through prism-leaves. These moments show ingenuity under constraint, meeting the development gate. However, the trait does not impose a visible cost or trade-off—Elias's creativity always succeeds without friction. The final beat does not invoke the trait; he simply plays music. Setup and development present, payoff absent, capping the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Refuge" is the explicit goal signaled in the opening third ("sanctuary grove, blooming eternally") and drives every beat: decoding the film to locate it, navigating the arbor to reach it, playing music once there. The action redefines Elias's options from mourning at the station to becoming "the arbor's hidden maestro" at the refuge. The refuge is irreplaceable—no other destination would fulfill the thematic and causal logic (it is where he and Lira first met). All three gates met; strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity. However, the refuge does not impose cost at closure (no trade-off or sacrifice required to stay), preventing a score above 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The black-and-white film reel is discovered in the opening third, rigged into a projector mid-story, slowed strategically to reveal hidden map sections (mechanics signaled), and spun at the refuge to project illusions of Lira. The method drives two major beats (discovery, navigation) and participates in the closure image. However, the reel's mechanics at closure are ornamental—projecting Lira's dance does not constrain Elias's final choice or impose cost. The hidden-map function (the method's core specificity) is abandoned after the journey; swapping the reel for any other map-bearing object in the final beat would leave the closure intact. Setup, development, and closure presence met, but closure causality is weak.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Tidal Arbor supplies vivid sensory grounding and constrains Elias's tactics throughout: "waves of mist crashed rhythmically," platforms require navigation, tidal surges threaten to sweep him (forcing him to wedge into a crevice mid-climb). The arbor's magnetic whims justify the flickering compasses, and the refuge glade within the arbor provides the closure location where "clouds parted, flowers pulsing." The setting is irreplaceable—no generic forest or mountain could supply tidal surges above clouds. All three gates met; the arbor shapes choices in setup, development, and the final image. However, at closure the arbor becomes passive backdrop; Elias's final action (playing piano) is not constrained by the setting's properties, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Until the horizon invites night" is invoked four times as a thematic anchor but does not function as a live ticking clock. Elias departs "one twilight eve," climbs as "hours blurred," and arrives as "dusk crept in" and "stars pierced the firmament," but these markers are atmospheric rather than tactical. No choice is tightened by approaching nightfall; the arbor does not become more dangerous after dark, and Elias does not race the clock. The timeframe participates in tone (the recurring phrase charges the lyric texture) but does not constrain action. Setup present (phrase introduced early), development and payoff weak (vague tracking, no tactical pressure), capping the score in low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To surprise fate with an unplanned encore" is stated explicitly in the opening third and drives Elias's decision to leave the station and reach the refuge. The motivation is dramatized through packing the clock and sheet music, climbing despite tidal surges, and playing the piano at closure. However, the desire is told more than shown under pressure—no moment of doubt or competing want tests Elias's commitment. The "surprise fate" language recurs as a label ("fate recoiled," "surprising destiny") rather than evolving through friction. Setup and development present; closure participation is ornamental (Elias plays, fate responds passively). Lyric reprise reweights slightly but without felt cost, placing the score in low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Steely longing" is invoked five times and permeates the piece through recurring images (the frozen clock, Lira's memory, the wistful station setting). Tone is coherent across turns: even during the climb's urgency, diction remains elevated and yearning ("wistful visions haunted him," "resolve hardened his grip"). However, the tone does not modulate meaningfully under pressure—"steely" and "longing" feel static rather than deepening or cracking. At closure, the tone shifts to triumph ("smiled, fingers poised") without dramatizing the transition from grief to fulfillment. The final image is charged by the tone's consistency but lacks the felt cost that would elevate the score above mid-6s.</comment>
