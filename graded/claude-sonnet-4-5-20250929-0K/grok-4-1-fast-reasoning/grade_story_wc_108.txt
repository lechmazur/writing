<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's phobia-ridden nature is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a choice with visible cost—she simply performs stunts despite terror, making her fears ornamental rather than motivating. The betrayal revelation arrives as exposition dump at the gala rather than through dramatized discovery. The ending's physical confrontation ("shoving him toward the cliff") lacks earned buildup and reads as convenient violence rather than a choice rooted in prior interiority. Multiple self-corrections mid-narrative ("No—word count overrun," "wait, refine to fit") expose scaffolding that should have been removed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is severely delayed: the library setting doesn't anchor clearly until paragraph 7, and the "who" remains murky through heavy exposition. The closure attempt fractures into three abandoned versions within the final paragraphs ("No—word count overrun," "Actually," "But precisely"), breaking causality and leaving no clean decisive change or resonant reconfiguration—Harlan's defeat reads as authorial convenience rather than earned outcome. The seashell's "whispering" mechanics are asserted without prior establishment, violating world rules. The "transformative betrayal" occurs entirely off-page in backstory, robbing the present action of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is vividly sketched ("iron shelves warped by salt air," "constellations piercing the gloom"), and the cliff-edge geography does constrain the final confrontation by making Harlan's thalassophobia tactically relevant. However, spatial choreography collapses in the ending: Elara "lunged not at him, but over the edge" then immediately "swung from a rusted beam" without clear positioning, and the vial's location on the shelf becomes impossible to reach mid-swing. The setting functions as backdrop through most beats rather than shaping choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming her erased identity—is declared early but never tested through on-page choice; Elara simply reacts to Harlan's arrival. No meaningful escalation occurs: the seashell instantly solves the cipher, Harlan conveniently arrives at the perfect moment, and the resolution cycles through three attempts in the final paragraph without landing on earned causality. The "vulnerability is power" claim is asserted ("her phobias not chains, but the key") but never dramatized as a trade-off with visible cost. Coincidence (seashell hum, Harlan's fear, timely yacht) resolves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme "vulnerability is power" is stated explicitly multiple times ("she knew vulnerability was power," "proving vulnerability's unyielding truth") rather than emerging from scene work. The seashell and cast function as symbolic props without thematic resonance—they solve a puzzle but don't reweight the premise. The ending attempts to land thematic closure ("her phobias not gone but powerful allies") through assertion rather than a resonant image that makes the cost undeniable. The transformative betrayal premise never integrates with the vulnerability motif in a way that charges the final moment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Register lurches between pulp-thriller diction ("his smile a rusted blade") and overwrought metaphor ("phobia clawing like old friends") without a stable perceptual signature. Harlan's dialogue ("Elara, my perfect echo—come back, embrace the lie") sounds like a villain audition rather than human speech. The multiple false endings with visible self-correction ("No—word count overrun," "wait, refine to fit," "Actually," "But precisely") shatter any illusion of controlled narrative stance. Psychic distance is unstable: we're told Elara's phobias "quake" her mind yet she executes stunts with "sharp focus" without showing the contradiction act simultaneously.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops: "fears not chains, but the key" / "phobias not gone but powerful allies"; "she knew vulnerability was power" / "proving vulnerability's power" / "vulnerability's unyielding truth." Template cadence dominates the opening ("She leaped... she channeled... he orchestrated"). The visible meta-scaffold in the final third ("No—word count overrun," "wait, refine to fit") is a catastrophic artifact that obliterates momentum. Mixed metaphors: "transformative betrayal" is a label, not an image; "whispers murmuring" / "whispers amplifying" / "seashell murmuring audibly" cycles through synonym churn. The ending's three false starts create structural loops that obscure the intended closure action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The phobia-ridden stunt double premise offers potential, but the execution follows a template: mysterious mentor betrayal, magical decoder object, cliff confrontation. The seashell's whispering mechanics and instant decryption feel like convenience rather than fresh synthesis. The vulnerability-as-power theme is asserted through labels rather than transformed through specific lived detail. The visible self-correction scaffolding ("No—word count overrun," "Actually," "But precisely") exposes the story as a response to a prompt checklist rather than an organic vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elara's phobia-ridden nature is mentioned throughout but never constrains a choice—she simply performs despite fear. The final confrontation involves her "dodging" and "shoving" with "adaptive agility" but no decision alters tactics or options. Label-only trait application; no causal pressure tied to the phobias themselves.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The seashell appears in two beats (discovery, decryption) and returns at the ending ("whispering seashell silent now"). However, its mechanics are asserted without setup, and it functions as a convenience cipher rather than an object whose properties constrain choice. Its "silence" at the end reweights symbolically but not causally. Introduced at the 60% mark; late arrival and swappable function (any magical decoder would serve).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Transformative betrayal" is recounted in backstory ("Harlan confessed over champagne") rather than discovered or confronted on the page. It motivates Elara's flight but does not shape present tactics or alter options in the library scene. Thematic echo without causal participation in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Firmly adaptive" appears as a label in three sentences but never constrains or enables action with visible cost. Elara's "adaptive agility" in the ending is asserted competence, not a tradeoff. The trait is told, not shown through choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Outwit" is declared as the goal ("To outwit him, she needed to prove vulnerability's power") but the enacted resolution cycles through physical confrontation: shoving Harlan toward the cliff. The decryption solves a puzzle but does not constitute outwitting in the peak beat. Swappable with "confront" or "defeat" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The cast and smudged notes appear in two beats (discovery, decryption) and the seashell's whisper decodes them, shaping one middle action. However, the mechanics are asserted without prior setup, and the method does not constrain the ending—Harlan is defeated by physical shove, not by the decoded information. Functional in one beat but does not drive closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars provides the encounter location and the cliff-edge geography makes Harlan's thalassophobia tactically relevant in the ending. The shelves supply the vial. Setting participates in two beats (discovery, confrontation) and pressures the final action through spatial constraint. Eligible for mid-band but spatial choreography collapses (impossible beam-swing logistics), limiting integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after discovering you're not who you thought" is established in backstory (gala confession) and motivates the flight to the library, but does not tighten present decisions—no clock pressure or tactics altered by recency. The discovery itself is recounted, not dramatized, so the "after" frame remains static setup rather than a lived constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"To prove that vulnerability is power" is stated three times ("she knew vulnerability was power," "wield them," "proving vulnerability's unyielding truth") but never dramatized as a conflicted choice with cost. Elara does not choose to be vulnerable in a way that forecloses another path; the theme is asserted in narration rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Trembling certainty" appears in the opening ("trembling certainty, she knew") and recurs at the climax ("Her voice trembled with certainty"). The oxymoron captures the intended tone and modulates with pressure, charging the confrontation dialogue. However, the tone fractures in the meta-scaffold ending ("No—word count overrun") and does not cohere through the final image. Present in setup and peak but collapses at closure.</comment>
