<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena's interior work is concrete—somatic freeze, hands in mulch, the photograph as trigger—but the final encounter with the young artist arrives too smoothly, reading more as demonstration than complication. The therapist-coined "somatic markers" label and the phrase "anchored optimism in realism" edge toward diagnostic self-awareness that flattens mid-crisis interiority. The freeze itself embodies contradiction (terror and stillness coexist), yet the resolution with the visitor lacks an on-page trade-off that costs Elena something specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear (arboretum, seaside cliff, Elena tending plants). The freeze triggered by wind-as-drone-buzz accumulates pressure, and the photograph returns charged at the end when shared with the visitor, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she no longer freezes in fear but freezes to remember). However, the cost remains largely asserted in metaphor ("graft the scars right") rather than shown as a visible forfeiture or tactical constraint that changes her next action on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The arboretum's glass enclosures, gravel trails, and ferns provide strong spatial grounding, and the lighthouse vents deliver the wind-whine that triggers the freeze—environment directly constrains Elena's body and focus. The fireflies at dusk and the automated lighthouse beam frame the closure image, charging the final beat with atmospheric specificity that ties setting to theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: processing trauma without erasure. The freeze is a clear tightening (wind-whine narrows her world to survival response), and the decision to share the photograph with the visitor marks a shift. Yet that final choice arrives without visible prior friction—Elena's move from solitary freeze to mentorship feels smooth rather than forced by an on-page dilemma or cost, weakening escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of rooted endurance through trauma emerges concretely via grafting, freeze-as-adaptation, and the plants' seasonal persistence. However, "anchor optimism in realism" and "Hope without the grit of recurrence was a fool's bloom" veer into direct thematic statement rather than image-led resonance. The final photograph-sharing beat gestures at earned wisdom but the visitor's rapid receptiveness (pencil unclipped, tracing the rose) sidesteps ambiguity, delivering tidy closure that undercuts the piece's own caution against "blind cheer."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is strong: Elena's hands "callused from years of coaxing," her somatic focus on pulse and mulch. The dialogue with the visitor is goal-driven and imagistic ("They freeze too, in frost, but root through it"), though "somatic markers from some strike of life" edges toward exposition. Psychic distance modulates cleanly—close during the freeze, widening to observe the visitor—and diction remains largely character-bound, slipping only slightly into therapeutic register ("method her therapist had named").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully (short fragments during freeze: "She froze there on the path, photograph trembling in her grip, the world narrowing"), and sensory detail is vivid (salt spray, hammering pulse, dew in chest). Yet paraphrase loops appear: "no longer tyrants but guides" / "no longer a wound but a marker," and the phrase "pearl of stillness" recurs four times without functional variation, reading as motif assertion rather than propulsion. Filter-verb stacks ("her body betrayed her first," "her muscles seizing") cluster in the freeze beat, dulling immediacy slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The arboretum-as-sanctuary frame is familiar, and the drone-strike backstory, while specific, leans on template trauma-recovery arcs (isolation → mentorship closure). The grafting metaphor and somatic-freeze mechanism offer fresh angles, yet the visitor's rapid transformation and the tidy firefly-dusk ending retreat from bold risk. The piece synthesizes elements competently but does not transform them into something irreducible or startling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's survivor identity seeds the photograph discovery (~20%), drives the freeze reaction (middle beat), and motivates the final mentorship gesture when she shares the photo and grafting wisdom. Three distinct beats with causal linkage to closure. The trait enables her empathy ("I've seen that hesitation before") and the final image would lack its charge without her lived cost. Strong integration but the final turn feels slightly inevitable rather than hard-won, capping just below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The photograph is unearthed early (~15%), triggers the freeze (middle beat: "photograph trembling in her grip"), and reappears at closure ("lay between them now, its image shared without tears"). Three touches with escalating weight. The object constrains Elena's emotional state and the final sharing reconfigures its meaning from "secret regret" to "marker of endurance." Essential across beats and ending, though swappable with another wedding artifact (ring, veil) with minor edits, preventing higher score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"A pearl of stillness" appears first at ~40% ("something rare emerged—a pearl of stillness"), recurs three more times, and anchors the final line. Setup is late. The concept is named and described ("luminous core untouched by the chaos") but never constrains a tactical choice or alters Elena's options on the page—it functions as thematic label rather than dramatized stake or method. Mid-band at best for lyric resonance without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Quietly talented" is mentioned early (~12%: "quietly talented in grafting stems") and returns when Elena applies it to the visitor ("You're quietly talented, I can tell"). Two beats. The trait enables her credibility as mentor but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost—no moment where her quiet approach fails or forces a trade-off. Functional but replaceable with "skilled" or "gifted" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The freeze is signaled early via somatic response, dominates the middle beat (wind-whine → muscle seizing → tunneled vision), and redefines Elena's relationship to trauma by the end ("she froze to remember, then moved forward"). Three beats with closure linkage. The action is irreplaceable—removing the freeze would collapse the story's central turn and the somatic-marker method. Strong causal pressure and cost (time arrested, body as guide), just shy of indispensable due to the visitor's smooth receptiveness reducing the final friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Somatic markers" is named at the freeze beat (~35%: "method her therapist had named") and shapes Elena's interpretation of her body's response ("no longer tyrants but guides"). Two beats. The method appears and constrains her understanding, but its mechanics (gut-to-spine signal, bodily flags) are told rather than shown altering her tactics—she does not, for instance, deploy somatic awareness to manage the freeze or choose the next move. Functional middle development without closure payoff beyond thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The arboretum frames the opening, supplies the mulch where Elena finds the photograph, and the cliff edge delivers the wind-whine that triggers the freeze. The lighthouse vents and fireflies charge the closure image. Three functional beats with spatial and atmospheric pressure. The setting enables key turns (wind as trigger, hybrid rose enclosure as teaching stage) and its seaside-cliff specificity (salt spray, waves, rusted vents) is irreplaceable. Strong integration; one notch below indispensable because the core freeze-and-share arc could occur in another reflective outdoor space with minor adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the last lighthouse keeper" anchors the era (automation, silenced vigil) in the opening and the "automated lighthouse beam" returns at dusk closure. Setup and closure participation present, but no middle development. The timeframe colors atmosphere but does not tighten a decision or alter tactics—Elena's freeze and mentorship would proceed identically in any post-automation era. Functional but replaceable; the temporal anchor is more thematic texture than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elena's desire "to anchor optimism in realism" is stated explicitly (~60%: "She had come to this cliffside haven not to forget, but to anchor optimism in realism"). The motivation informs her final advice to the visitor ("That's the realism: winters come, yet springs follow if you graft the scars right"), providing closure participation. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no on-page moment where blind hope tempts her and she pays a cost to resist it. Lyric resonance without friction caps the score near mid-band.</comment>
