<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is defined almost entirely through label-only interiority ("burning need to understand the texture of time") and passive observation rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His borrowed heart and chronosurgeon backstory remain decorative labels that never constrain a choice. The final "weaver" role arrives without earned causality—no prior struggle forces him to broadcast the listing or become a dispenser of fragments. Lira's urn triggers visions but no micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost; he simply receives revelation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural attempting lyric density, but orientation remains unclear past the 120-word mark (chronosurgeons, the Shift's mechanics, "numbers changed meaning" are asserted without anchoring when or where Elias stands in relation to these events). The closure unit—Elias broadcasting a new listing and becoming a "weaver"—lands as summary declaration rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost; the "timeless shard" and its dispersal are told, not dramatized, and no prior constraint is forfeited. The capsule's "breach allowed the Shift's chaos to infuse it" arrives as retroactive explanation, not causal linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The emerald silo's fungal sheen and corrugated walls receive vivid sensory treatment, and the "undercroft" descent supplies spatial progression. However, the silo functions as backdrop rather than constraint—Elias moves through it freely without any environmental choice-point or tactical tradeoff. The capsule's "chronal vapors" and "verdant glows" remain decorative; no tool, object, or spatial feature alters his approach or charges the final image with physical consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is declared early but never tested by a live choice that narrows options. The garage-sale message method appears mid-story yet does not create a reversal or tightening; responses "trickle in" off-page and guide him to rediscover the fragment without cost. Opening the capsule and pressing the fragment to his chest are passive actions; no want conflicts with fear, no trade-off is visible. The ending announces a new role ("weaver") without showing the price of broadcasting or the tactical shift that dispensing fragments will demand.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of time's texture and loss made eternal emerges from the urn fragment and borrowed-heart motif, avoiding overt moralizing. However, the climactic insight—"time's texture was loss made eternal, mysteries we'd always sensed but never grasped"—arrives as abstract declaration rather than through a concrete particular that reweights prior material. The final listing and "weaver" role recapitulate the theme without dramatizing a non-literal answer to the central question. The ending moves toward resonance but does not land a charged image grounded in specific action or forfeiture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains a lyric-experimental register with purposeful compression ("borrowed-time timekeeper," "anticipated mysteries," "time's fibrous grain") and teaches its pattern early. Psychic distance is stable, and the perceptual signature—time-sensitive, grief-soaked—remains character-specific. However, peak moments lean on elevated diction ("silken drags of dawns, gritty rasps of midnights") that edges toward thesaurus-itis without deepening embodied perception. No second character appears, so dialogue and voice-distinction tests do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: stacked metaphors ("emerald-veined walls," "verdant glows," "fibrous grain," "plush weight of unspoken regrets") and synonym churn ("notched," "etched," "groaning," "shiver," "rippled," "pulsed") dull propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "borrowed time felt thinner" / "No longer just surviving on borrowed time" and "timeless" repeated across three sentences without added pressure. Template cadence runs: "his pulse quickened—borrowed time felt thinner—as he descended" / "suddenly timeless, the porcelain ceased its subtle decay" / "visions unspooled—not memories, but time's raw weave." Figurative density in the closure paragraphs obscures cause/effect; the final notch lacks concrete consequence. Apply −1.4 for patterned artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-Shift numerology, chronosurgery, and garage-sale cryptography offers a specific premise, and the urn-as-timeless-relic provides a non-obvious focal object. However, the emotional arc—grief for Lira channeled into understanding time—could transfer to a generic loss-and-discovery frame with minor edits. The Shift's mechanics (numbers yielding echoes, clocks spiraling) remain decorative rather than shaping a choice or constraint. The ending pivot to "weaver" echoes mentor-sage templates without a fresh synthesis tied to lived cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elias is present across all beats and his role as timekeeper frames the premise, satisfying setup. He etches notches, descends, opens the capsule, and presses the fragment—logically consistent actions. However, these are observations and passive receipts rather than decisions that narrow options or alter tactics. The final broadcast is announced in summary without showing the choice's cost or friction. The character shapes the frame but does not drive two distinct causally linked beats with visible tradeoffs, capping the score in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cremation urn fragment appears at setup (buried in the capsule), is rediscovered mid-story (pried open, "jagged porcelain etched with faded names"), and returns at closure ("pressed to his chest," "pulsed against his palm"). It reweights meaning: grief's slow abrasion → timeless relic. However, the fragment does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost; Elias receives visions without forfeiting an option. Two-beat involvement and closure reprise earn mid-band placement, but lack of causal pressure or cost connection prevents higher reach.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The damaged time capsule is introduced early (buried a decade ago), its cracked seals and chronal vapors are described, and it is pried open mid-story. The breach's effect—allowing Shift chaos to infuse it—is explained at closure as the source of the timeless fragment. This explanation reweights the capsule's role but arrives as retroactive summary rather than shaping a tactical choice under pressure. The capsule enables one key beat (opening) and provides thematic payoff, earning lower mid-band, but does not constrain options or impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" is applied to the porcelain fragment when Elias touches it: "ceased its subtle decay, locking into an eternal sheen." The attribute enables the closure revelation (Lira's message becomes visible) and charges the final image (fragment pulsing with promise). However, it does not constrain an earlier choice or create a visible tradeoff—Elias gains access without cost. The attribute shapes one key turn (fragment's transformation) and participates in closure, satisfying two gates and earning mid-band placement without causal pressure or cost linkage to lift higher.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Rediscover" structures the middle beat: Elias descends, pries open the capsule, and uncovers the urn fragment. This action is causally prepared (garage-sale messages urge him) and it triggers the climactic transformation (fragment becomes timeless, message reveals). The action is essential to the plot's hinge and closure participation, satisfying all three gates. However, the rediscovery is passive receipt without a choice-point or visible cost during the act itself. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage place it in the higher mid-band, but lack of on-page tradeoff prevents entry to ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The garage-sale method is introduced early (notched at setup: "embedding messages in garage sale item descriptions") and described in detail ("vintage lamp, bends light like forgotten tomorrows"). Responses guide Elias to rediscover the capsule's core, enabling the middle beat. At closure, he broadcasts a new listing. The method appears in three beats and frames both complication and resolution, satisfying all gates. However, its mechanics do not constrain a choice or impose cost—messages arrive off-page, and the final broadcast is summary. Functional across structure but swappable for any covert communication method without altering stakes.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The emerald silo is established at setup (looming, fungal bloom, corrugated walls) and provides spatial grounding for the descent and undercroft discovery. At closure, it becomes a "beacon" and "thrummed with fresh anticipations." The setting supplies verticality and atmosphere, and its "verdant hush" charges the final image. However, the silo does not constrain a tactical choice—Elias moves through it freely—and the "overflowing junk" and "grain-dusted depths" remain decorative rather than altering his approach. Setup, middle presence, and closure reprise satisfy gates, but lack of causal pressure or resource-based tradeoff limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after numbers change meaning" is established at setup (the Shift, clocks spiral, calendars dissolve) and provides the story's conceptual backdrop. Elias's notched beam and "days that no longer aligned with the sun" gesture toward temporal dislocation. However, the Shift's mechanics do not tighten a decision or create a live countdown; time remains atmospheric rather than a tactical constraint. The climactic insight—"irrational sums now mapped time's fibrous grain"—reweights the premise thematically but does not impose cost or alter options on the page. Present across beats but ornamental in function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the texture of time passing" is declared early ("driven by a burning need") and recurs at closure ("feeling time's texture etch into his bones"). The urn fragment is placed to "feel time's texture through grief's slow abrasion," linking desire to action. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible tradeoffs. No friction appears between understanding and another cost (safety, resource, relationship). The motivation frames the quest and charges the ending image but does not drive a choice-point with stakes, placing it in the functional band without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The tone of "anticipated mysteries" is signaled early ("hummed with anticipated mysteries," "secrets fermented") and sustained through the middle ("anticipated mysteries coalesced") to closure ("silo thrummed with fresh anticipations"). The tone modulates minimally—remaining lyric-expectant—but coheres across beats without contradiction. The final image ("promising revelations yet to unfold") reinforces the tone and charges the ending. However, the tone does not shift under pressure or constrain a choice; it remains a static atmospheric layer. Coherent presence and closure linkage earn mid-band, but lack of modulation or tactical effect prevents higher reach.</comment>
