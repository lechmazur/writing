<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is declared but his inner contradiction—questioning his own crusade—arrives only in the final third without earlier embodied tension. The reversal from debunker to secret-keeper lacks dramatized cost; he simply walks away with a letter fragment, and the choice feels asserted rather than earned through competing impulses shown in scene. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("sharp observance," "keen gaze") and the epiphany moment reads as convenient rather than causally forced. No secondary character pressures him on the page, removing relational friction that could have tested his stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive clearly (wasteland, orchard, homestead) and the causal chain holds: dust → orchard anomaly → letters → diamond → decision. However, the closure unit—Elias reburying the diamond and walking away silent—lacks visible cost; he pockets a fragment but no on-page consequence alters his options or forecloses a path. The piece teaches a causal lens but the final reversal (debunker protects the lie) is told rather than dramatized through a choice that narrows future action. Cost remains implied rather than legible in the ending image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orchard's circular boundary and the homestead debris constrain Elias's search, and the flawed diamond's pulsing blue glow charges the final act. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (fogged mask, rad-suit readings, apple skin under light). Spatial choreography remains clear across dune, threshold, homestead, and floorboard. Minor slip: "dust bunnies" amid post-liquidation rubble reads as anachronistic filler rather than world-specific debris.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exposing the orchard's secret—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes the truth could weaponize the stillpoint. However, the peak choice (rebury the diamond) lacks on-page cost; no warlord threat materializes, no scavenger confronts him, and he exits without visible sacrifice or tactical constraint. The tightening is conceptual rather than dramatized, and the "comfortable lie" theme substitutes for a scene-level test of his reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—truth versus survival's need for comforting lies—emerges through Elias's arc and the orchard's dual reading (curse vs. tech). The apple and diamond recur with shifted meaning, and the final question ("was the real conspiracy his own unyielding quest?") reweights his crusade. However, the ending borders on thesis statement ("Some truths were too fragile for the wasteland's winds") rather than letting the image carry the question unanswered. Subtext in the shredded letters and hidden diamond is strong, but the closure reflection edges into moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with Elias's perceptual filter ("sharply observant eyes," "intuited the full peril"). Diction is controlled, though "keen gaze" and "sharp observance" repeat within tight proximity, flattening texture. No dialogue appears; the piece is all narration and reflection. Free indirect style is clean, but the final third drifts toward summary rather than scene ("He pressed on, mask fogging once more") when dramatization would sharpen the turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "sharply observant eyes" → "His sharp eyes" → "observant mind"; "Elias scoffed inwardly" → "Elias knelt" → "Elias's pulse quickened" → "Elias leaned back" → "Elias hesitated" chains identical sentence stems across the middle third. Stock metaphors ("opium of the irradiated," "comfortable lies") and filter-verb stacks ("His keen gaze noting," "sharp eyes caught") dull immediacy in peak beats. The closure paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the walk away, losing propulsion. Apply −1.0 for patterned artifacts under the accumulation cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—post-apocalyptic conspiracy debunker finds tech masquerading as curse—echoes familiar genre templates (rational investigator, hidden science, moral reversal) without a non-obvious synthesis. The stillpoint generator and flawed diamond lattice add specificity, but the arc (debunker protects the secret) follows a predictable path. The transformation test fails: swap names and setting, and the emotional beats (exposé → doubt → silence) remain unchanged. No bold structural risk or fresh inflection beyond competent genre execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias frames the investigation and his final choice to rebury the diamond shapes the ending. However, his decision arrives late (final third) and is told rather than dramatized through competing pressures. His conspiracy-debunker role is mentioned repeatedly but observation without decision dominates the middle; the peak reversal lacks a visible tradeoff that would elevate integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The flawed diamond is set up early (locals' rumors), discovered mid-story (loose floorboard), and returns at closure (reburied). It appears in three beats and its "milky fractures, pulsing faintly blue" specificity makes it irreplaceable. However, it does not constrain a middle choice—Elias simply finds it—and the closure participation is passive (he reburies it off-camera). No visible cost ties directly to the diamond's properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The stillpoint concept is signaled early (unnatural calm, circular boundary) and names the tech (stillpoint generator in letters). It shapes the orchard's existence and Elias's realization that exposing it could weaponize it. Missing middle development: the stillpoint does not constrain a tactical choice during the investigation. Closure linkage is thematic rather than causal—Elias walks away to preserve it, but the concept does not reweight the final image with charged specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Sharply observant" is labeled repeatedly ("sharply observant eyes," "His sharp eyes," "observant mind") but never constrains a choice with visible cost. Elias's reassembly of letters could succeed with ordinary diligence; no scene shows him catching a detail others would miss or paying a price (time, risk, error) for hyper-focus. Label-only trait without dramatized tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Intuit" appears twice (diamond setup, full peril) and drives his realization that the diamond is tech, not curse, and that exposure risks weaponization. This realization enables the final choice. However, the intuition itself is not dramatized—no false lead, no competing hypothesis tested on the page. The action is signaled and matters, but it could be swapped for "deduce" or "infer" with minimal structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Reassembling shredded letters is signaled early (confetti-like shreds), occupies multiple beats (sifting, cataloging, piecing blueprints and plea), and delivers the key knowledge (stillpoint generator, flawed diamond lattice, creditor sabotage). The method's mechanics matter: hours under lamp, edges/inks/watermarks cataloged. It drives the investigation and enables the peak realization. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is present throughout (circular boundary, thriving trees, radioactive calm) and the homestead interior supplies the loose floorboard that reveals the diamond. The orchard's anomaly drives the investigation. However, the setting does not constrain a tactical choice—Elias walks in, searches, leaves—and the dust storms are decorative rather than obstacles he must work around. Postcard atmosphere rather than micro-setting that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the liquidation" frames the post-2047 wasteland but no live clock tightens Elias's choices. The investigation unfolds in untracked time ("Hours blurred under his portable lamp") without urgency or deadline. Timeframe is context, not constraint. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—"to unearth truth from these comforting fables"—is declared early and drives the investigation. The peak reversal (protecting the lie) creates friction between his want (expose) and the cost (weaponization). However, the conflict is told in reflection ("For the first time, he questioned his crusade") rather than dramatized through a scene-level test where another character or immediate threat forces the choice. Desire is present and conflicted but lacks visible cost on the page.</comment>
