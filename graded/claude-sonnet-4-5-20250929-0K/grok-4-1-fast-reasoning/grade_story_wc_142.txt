<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's trait ("orderly intuitive") appears as a label repeated throughout but rarely manifests as contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "dual allegiance" creates potential internal conflict, yet her choices proceed smoothly without visible struggle or trade-offs—she executes her graffiti campaign without meaningful friction between carnival chaos and mainland order. Interiority relies heavily on abstract assertions ("her attribute shone," "intuition foresaw") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The closure choice (continuing to paint, absorbing newcomers) lacks visible cost; no path is foreclosed, and the story tells us she succeeded without dramatizing what she surrendered.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors appear quickly (raft city, carnival, Elara's role), satisfying the test. The drive lens reads as Causal-Situational hybrid: Elara's graffiti plan unfolds in sequence, and the privatization threat provides situational pressure. However, the closure unit is weak—"Elara painted on" and "She absorbed it all" are assertions without a decisive on-page change or visible cost. The story claims victory ("reorganization had saved the spirit") via summary rather than dramatizing a final turn that reweights options. The cost-proof test fails: no sentence in the ending beat shows what Elara lost or foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The raft city setting is vivid and specific (bioluminescent lanterns, pedal-crew Ferris wheels, stilt-walkers), filtered through the carnival's sensory chaos. The foundation stone chip functions as a recurring tactile anchor that Elara clutches and embeds into paint, constraining one choice (pressing it into the mural). However, spatial choreography during the midnight parade and raft-realignment sequence remains vague—movements are told rather than shown with legible positions. The setting pressures Elara's tactics (using carnival noise as cover) but does not charge the final image, which defaults to abstract celebration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (stopping privatization via community reorganization) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kai reveals the contracts and the timeline narrows to weeks. However, the escalation unfolds via summary montage ("graffiti secrets evolving," "rafts realigned") rather than on-page reversals that test Elara's commitment. The resolution is told as fait accompli ("reorganization had saved the spirit") without dramatizing the cost or showing what Elara or the community forfeited. Agency is present but the final outcome lacks a visible price that alters later options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of resistance to gentrification through encoded art emerges from particulars (graffiti coordinates, binary-pulse eyes, cipher maps). Dual allegiance offers a promising internal question but dissolves into "no longer a tear, but a bridge" without complication or ambiguity. The ending defaults to thematic summary ("Hopeful desperation birthed a new order") and prompt-echo language ("She absorbed it all. Intuitive, orderly, alive.") rather than letting the final image speak. The carnival-as-resistance motif is present but not reweighted by the closure; it remains static celebration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic—Elara's way of noticing (carnival lights, crowds, rafts) could belong to any observer. Diction remains consistent but leans on template cadence and repeated sentence stems ("Elara's attribute thrived," "Elara smiled," "Elara painted on"). Dialogue with Kai is functional but minimal and lacks subtext. The prose compresses key action (raft realignment, developer yacht encounter) into summary rather than scene, flattening momentum at pivotal beats. Free indirect style is clean but the voice lacks specificity under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops proliferate: "Hopeful desperation birthed a new order" echoes "hopeful desperation" five times across the text without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the second half ("Elara's attribute thrived," "Elara painted on," "Elara smiled"). Figurative language stacks at closure ("The sea whispered approval. Rafts danced eternal. And so the carnival endured.") without clear function. Key action beats (raft shuffle, yacht encounter) are summarized rather than dramatized, reducing information density. Stock metaphors ("beacon," "bridge," "tide") replace specific images. The prose reads as scaffold with minimal revision, and artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The raft-city carnival setting offers visual specificity, and encoded graffiti as resistance method is a fresh tactical angle. However, the gentrification-via-art-resistance premise follows a familiar activist-narrative template without transformation through non-obvious moral calculus or lived friction. Elara's dual allegiance is declared but never complicates her choices in scene; she executes her plan without setback or doubt. The ending defaults to triumph-via-summary rather than a specific, inevitable consequence that grows from prior particulars. Emotional truth is replaced by sloganeering ("Allegiance to the Float," "Carnival forever").</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's role as "culture shock absorber" is present in setup (guiding newcomers) and closure (absorbing new arrivals), satisfying two gates. She makes one key decision (to organize via graffiti) that drives the middle sequence. However, the trait itself (absorbing shock) does not constrain her choices or create visible friction—she moves smoothly through her campaign. The closure beat mentions absorption but does not show how it alters her options or forecloses a path. Causal pressure is moderate; irreplaceability is low (another organizer role would serve similarly).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip appears early (first paragraph), is clutched for grounding in two beats, and embedded into the grand-wheel mural to legitimize the cipher. Three-gate participation and two distinct beat involvements earn mid-band eligibility. However, its properties remain static—"grounded her," "hummed with ancestral warning," "edges warm"—without evolving function or reweighted meaning at closure. The chip is mentioned in the ending sequence ("now shared talisman, chipped away at doubt") but does not charge the final image or constrain a choice there. Swappability is moderate; another relic could function similarly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dual allegiance is signaled early (born to carnival, schooled ashore) and declared as internal tension ("tore at her"). However, it does not shape on-page choices with visible friction; Elara's actions blend both sides without cost or trade-off shown in scene. The closure claims "dual allegiances could coexist" and "no longer a tear, but a bridge," resolving the tension via assertion rather than dramatized consequence. The concept functions as theme rather than tactical pressure, and the ending does not reweigh it through image or action. Two gates present (setup, closure echo) but middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" is labeled repeatedly ("her attribute shone," "intuition foresaw patrols' blind spots," "orderliness ensured perfect alignment") but rarely demonstrated through contradictory impulses or visible tradeoffs on the page. One beat shows her mapping Kai's shock and planning murals, but the trait does not constrain a choice or impose cost—she succeeds without friction between order and intuition. Closure mentions "Intuitive, orderly, alive" as summary rather than charged action. Setup and closure echo are present; middle development is label-only. Swappability is high; "strategic" or "adaptive" would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Reorganize" drives the central action: Elara resolves to reorganize the community herself, executes the graffiti-coordinate plan, and directs the flotilla shuffle. Three beats involve the action (resolution, mural campaign, raft realignment), and the closure claims reorganization saved the spirit. However, key reorganization moments (vendor alliances, raft re-lashing) are summarized rather than dramatized, reducing causal specificity. The action is irreplaceable to the plot but its mechanics remain abstract. Setup, development, and closure participation all present; causal pressure moderate; cost connection weak (success is told, not shown with price).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Encoded graffiti art is signaled early (resolved "through messages encoded in graffiti art") and its mechanics matter: coordinates hidden in vines, binary pulses in mask eyes, cipher in gears. The method drives three beats (central mast mural, food-raft mask, grand wheel gears) and shapes Elara's tactics (using blind spots, carnival noise as cover). Closure mentions "murals fading into legend" but does not show the method's final consequence or reweighted meaning. All three gates present; beat involvement strong; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage is echo rather than charged participation. Specificity is high (fractal lashings, binary pulses), earning mid-to-upper band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The perpetual carnival raft city is vividly rendered (neon lights, stilt-walkers, pedal-crew Ferris wheels, bioluminescent lanterns) and frames the entire story. The setting supplies resources that affect tactics: carnival noise masks the raft shuffle, drum circles cover deed swaps, midnight parade provides cover. However, the setting does not constrain a key choice at closure—the final image defaults to abstract celebration rather than showing how the environment pressures or charges the ending beat. Setup immediate, development strong (shapes two tactical beats), closure participation is thematic echo. Micro-setting (body, tool) not leveraged. Environmental specificity and tactical involvement earn solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Before privatization" is signaled early and Kai's revelation ("hits in weeks") narrows the timeline, creating urgency. The clock affects one tactical beat (forcing Elara to act via graffiti rather than protests) but is not tracked thereafter—"weeks passed" in the ending montage deflates the ticking pressure. The timeframe does not visibly constrain the closure or shape the final choice; success is declared without showing how time ran out or was beaten. Setup and development present; closure participation absent. Causal pressure moderate; cost connection weak. The element trends functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation to navigate gentrification is declared early ("desperate to navigate the shift") and drives Elara's central choice (to reorganize via graffiti). However, the desire is told more than dramatized—Elara's internal conflict between honoring chaos and imposing structure does not produce visible friction or trade-off in scene. The closure claims navigation succeeded ("had navigated it") via summary rather than showing what navigation cost her. Setup and development present; closure participation is assertion. Friction between want (preserve carnival) and method (impose structure) is potential but not realized with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Hopeful desperation" is declared explicitly and repeatedly ("fueled by hopeful desperation," "Hope surged; desperate families," "In the hopeful desperation") but does not modulate with scene pressure—the tone remains static assertion rather than embodied oscillation. The ending doubles down ("Hopeful desperation birthed a new order") as summary rather than letting image and rhythm carry the dual affect. Coherence is present but the tone does not charge the final image; it flattens into slogan. Setup immediate, development is label-only, closure participation is thematic echo without embodied shift. Template language and lack of modulation lower the score.</comment>
