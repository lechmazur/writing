<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara reads as a role rather than a person with contradictory impulses. Her motivation ("to find where shadows went at noon") is declared but never tested by competing desires or costs that force visible trade-offs. Interiority consists largely of exposition and task description ("She had pored over tomes for months") rather than embodied emotion under pressure. The final "smile faintly" and decision to descend arrive without prior contradiction or renunciation that would earn the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates world detail and task beats (brushing grime, turning key, mending rune-loops) but lacks a meaningful pressure turn or deepening that narrows options. Closure reads as simple task completion—Elara solves the puzzle and gains knowledge—without visible cost or a path foreclosed. The Orientation Test is passed (who/where/when anchor by opening lines), but the ending delivers information rather than a reconfiguration of stakes or meaning with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The observatory, floating isle, and pedestal are anchored early and supply concrete resources (star-ink, rune-lock, brass telescopes). The nocturnal setting and crystal spires create coherent atmosphere. Spatial choreography is clear across beats. The pedestal and key constrain one choice (aligning the key), lifting the score into the mid-6s, but the environment does not pressure the climax or charge the final image beyond serving as backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding where shadows go) is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Elara encounters no meaningful obstacle—the pedestal opens, the automatons awaken, the map appears—so pressure remains flat. The sequence is a series of successful moves without reversal, tightening, or a trade-off that forecloses an option. Agency is present but uncontested, yielding a functional but un-escalated arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of "relearning harmony in a bent reality" and the shadow-noon mystery are asserted rather than explored through conflicting values or ambiguity. The final holographic map and Elara's "smile faintly" declare resolution without a resonant image that reweights prior material. Subtext is minimal; the automatons and runes function as plot devices rather than charged motifs. The piece gestures at mystery but resolves into tidy explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with no head-hopping. Voice remains consistent but generic, lacking perceptual signature or rhythmic modulation under pressure. Diction occasionally elevates ("fleeting voids," "ethereal filaments") in ways not clearly rooted in Elara's scholarly register. No dialogue. The phrase "quietly deliberate" recurs mechanically as a template stem rather than as a character-specific rhythm, signaling template cadence without voice-motivated purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Template cadence is pervasive: "quietly deliberate" appears three times identically, and many sentences open with "Elara [verb]" or "[Her X], [verb]" creating rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loops occur (paragraph 3 restates the Bending twice; "seal/sealed/sealing/awakenings" cluster without advancing meaning). Stock metaphors ("breath caught," "smile faintly") and filter-verb stacks ("She understood instantly," "Elara smiled faintly") dull immediacy. Information density is low; many lines restate world rules rather than advancing pressure. Apply −1.2 cumulative for template cadence, loops, and stock phrasing touching multiple beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—scholar decodes rune puzzles to awaken automatons guarding forbidden lore—follows a familiar quest-and-unlock template without transformation. The "shadows at noon" concept is intriguing but resolved via exposition dump rather than dramatized discovery. The Bending (spoons bending reality) reads as quirky ornament disconnected from the shadow mystery. No turn or synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; plot and emotional arc are interchangeable with generic scholar-puzzles-ancient-tech stories.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout, initiates each beat (lifting key, turning lock, mending loops), and her choices advance the plot. Setup: named in opening line. Development: her actions unlock pedestal and awaken automatons. Closure: she pockets the key and prepares to descend. However, her decisions are uncontested and do not create meaningful turns or force trade-offs; she succeeds at every step without friction. Band: functional across beats but replaceable with any competent puzzle-solver. Swappability and lack of causal pressure cap at ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The key is discovered mid-story, handled in two beats (lifting reverently, turning in lock), and referenced at closure ("pocketed the key"). Setup: appears ~40% in. Development: its use unlocks the pedestal. Closure: carried forward, signaling next quest step. It constrains one choice (must align spirals) and its properties (brass, micro-etched runes, shadow-shaped teeth) matter to the unlock. Late appearance and minimal causal pressure limit the score; the key is more plot token than driver. Band ~6.2 for two-beat presence and closure linkage, capped by late intro and swappability with any magical artifact key.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sealed awakenings frame the quest (paragraph 6: "whispers of sealed awakenings"), constrain tactics (Elara must close rune-loops to awaken automatons), and appear at closure (final line: "awakenings purposeful"). Setup: signaled by ~25%. Development: the mechanic of incomplete loops drives middle beats. Closure: the concept is named and validated. It shapes on-page choices (closing loops methodically) and is irreplaceable—removing it would break the puzzle logic. Band ~6.7 for cross-beat causal pressure and closure validation, with some swappability (could be "sealed guardians" or similar).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Quietly deliberate" is used three times as a label-only descriptor without constraining or enabling action with visible cost. It does not shape a decision or trade-off; Elara's deliberation never conflicts with urgency or risk. The phrase functions as template cadence rather than embodied trait. Ornamental use across multiple mentions trends low. Band ~2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Relearn" is thematized early (inscription: "relearn what noon conceals") and enacted in middle beats (Elara relearns rune arts, traces gaps, realigns prongs). It shapes tactics—she must reconstruct fractured circuits rather than simply read them. Closure: "relearning harmony" restates the concept. Setup and development are strong; however, the action is somewhat swappable with "decode" or "restore." Causal pressure and cross-beat presence elevate the score; limited irreplaceability and summary-only closure use cap it. Band ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Closing loops" is signaled early (inscription: "Awaken by closing loops"), enacted across three beats (mending nadir loop, realigning tangled loops, completing labyrinth loops), and validated at closure ("each closure unlocking fragments"). The method is irreplaceable—the puzzle logic depends on it. Setup, development, and closure presence are solid. However, the mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized with felt difficulty, and cost is generic ("hours blurred"). Band ~6.1 for strong integration with minor swappability friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle is anchored in the opening and supplies resources (pedestal, star-ink, brass telescopes, levitation crystals). Setup is strong. Development: the setting houses the puzzle but does not constrain choices or introduce obstacles. Closure: "The observatory hummed approval" is a cameo rather than active participation. The isle's floating and nocturnal features are atmospheric but do not alter tactics. Band ~5.9 for setup and one resource beat, capped by lack of pressure or closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After spoons bend reality" establishes the post-Bending era in paragraph 2 and is referenced once more ("post-Bending now"). The timeframe provides world context but does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or alter tactics on the page. It is ornamental background. Setup: present early. Development and closure: absent. Band ~3.2 for functional context without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To find where shadows go at noon" is declared in paragraph 4 ("Her obsession burned steady"), drives her choice to investigate the pedestal, and is answered at closure (shadow-vault revealed, "shadows' noon haven no longer mystery"). Setup and closure are strong. Development: the desire motivates investigation but is never conflicted or tested by competing wants or costs. Told as obsession rather than dramatized through friction. Band ~6.3 for setup-to-closure arc with limited on-page friction and swappability (any mystery would serve).</comment>
