<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's blindness is asserted rather than embodied through groping, spatial memory, or error; he "oversaw" and commanded flawlessly without contradiction or struggle. The drone repair motivation ("honor the machine's whispered story") reads abstract and label-driven; no on-page micro-choice reveals hierarchy of values under pressure. Apprentices remain functional hands; no relationship friction tests Elias's choices. The final smile is serene satisfaction without visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Closure reads as successful repair → serene vigil; no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing is legible. The anchor-chain timeframe brackets the repair sequence but does not narrow options or force a visible trade-off at the ending. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early; causality (drone damaged → refraction exam → patch → test) holds within the repair. The inferred lens is Causal (because/therefore), but the ending resets Elias to pre-story stasis without felt cost or altered stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot, rail yard, and harbor ship are vividly anchored with layered sensory detail (fog, clanking chain, glowing lanterns, water basins). Spatial choreography is clear throughout the repair. The water-feature setup constrains the examination method, and the basins return at the patch beat. However, the environment does not force a climactic choice or charge the final image; Elias lingers in the same shop without environmental pressure altering his stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair the drone before anchor clears) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the captain's plea and the rising chain clanks create urgency. Yet the escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; no failed attempt, resource scarcity, or apprentice mistake forces adaptation. The patch succeeds on first application without visible cost (time, material, or error). Closure lacks a trade-off or foreclosed path; success and serenity land without sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme (mastery amid blindness, renewal through repair) emerges from the setup but is stated rather than tested: "to honor the machine's whispered story," "dreams tethered to far horizons," "his own decoded truth." The refraction method and hummingbird imagery are vivid particulars, yet the ending declares rather than dramatizes resonance. No ambiguity or counter-reading; the repair succeeds, Elias's wisdom is confirmed, and the moral is asserted in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct lyric register (e.g., "mist coated…like a lover's breath," "magnetic calm," "heartfelt artisan"). Diction elevates consistently but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("decoded truth," "oversees…with unerring intuition"). Dialogue is minimal, functional, and task-driven. Elias's perceptual signature (touch, vibration, sound) is asserted more than demonstrated through groping or spatial friction. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines frame the vigil motif. Minor loops: "heartfelt" appears three times (artisan, passion, mastery); "magnetic calm" recurs without reweighting; "oversees" contradicts blindness without cost. Template-cadence slip: "Elias's motivation burned deep—to decode…not just for repair, but to honor…" reads expository. Figurative density is high ("lover's breath," "gravity," "whispered story") but mostly coherent. Paragraph structure supports the repair sequence. Final bracketed note "[Wait, but in real: adjust.]" is scaffolding; ignoring per Text Artifact Screen, but it signals generation seams.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Blind artisan repairing drone via refraction is a specific synthesis; the water-basin method adds ingenuity. Yet the emotional arc (serene mastery → serene mastery) and plot (problem → flawless solution) follow safe, predictable paths. No risk or subversion: Elias's blindness is overcome without struggle, the repair succeeds without error, and the ending affirms his role without cost. The premise is fresh; execution retreats to median comfort.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias (heartfelt artisan) is present throughout and directs the repair. His choices (water-basin exam, polymer selection, patch application) drive beats but follow a linear checklist without friction or pivot. No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path; he succeeds as established. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal involvement +0.8, but no closure transformation or visible cost: net ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The artificial hummingbird drone anchors the central problem (damaged wing, microfractures), is examined via refraction, patched, tested, and departs into mist. Setup ≤33%, middle development (refraction reveals crack), and closure (drone whirrs, darts away). Three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, early signal +0.5. Swappability: any precision device would serve; −0.5. Net ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Repair shop is the setting and frames Elias's role. Setup early, shapes middle tactics (benches, tools, water basins), and closure occurs within it. Three beats +1.4, causal +0.6, closure linkage +0.9, early +0.6. However, "repair shop" is generic; any workshop suffices. Swappability −0.6, mid-irreplaceability −0.3. Net ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Oversees while blind" is asserted ("blind yet overseeing…with unerring intuition") but not dramatized with cost. He commands by touch and sound without groping, error, or spatial friction. Setup early +0.5, mentioned in three beats +0.8, but label-only −0.6, no visible trade-off or constraint −0.8. Net ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Patch" is the pivotal action: polymer application seals the crack and restores flight. Setup (prepare patch material), middle (Elias applies layers), closure (drone whirrs, ready). Three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.3, early signal +0.5. Specificity moderate (translucent polymer, heated gently) +0.4. Swappability mild (weld, bond) −0.4. Net ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Examining light refraction through water features is signaled midpoint, shapes the diagnosis (prismatic rainbows reveal microfractures, warped halo), and guides the patch. Setup late (second third) −0.4, two beats +0.9, causal +1.2, specificity +0.6, early absent −0.5. Closure linkage indirect (method enables patch but does not appear in final image) +0.4. Net ~5.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Mist-coated rail depot is established early, anchors spatial choreography, and supplies the fog motif ("fog-wreathed depot" returns at closure). Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure lyric reprise +0.8. However, setting does not constrain choice or supply decisive resources; the repair occurs indoors unaffected by mist or rails. Postcard use −0.7, swappability (any workshop) −0.5. Net ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Anchor lifting timeframe is signaled early and recurs ("anchor chain rattled," "anchor's near-release," "anchor broke free with a final groan"). Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (tightens urgency) +0.9, closure linkage (anchor breaks as repair completes) +1.1. However, no on-page clock forces a visible trade-off; Elias finishes without rushing or error. Generic time pressure −0.5, cost absent −0.6. Net ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"To decode feedback into direction" is stated ("Elias's motivation burned deep…to decode the drone's faint feedback vibrations") and pursued (he decodes tremors, directs patch). Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal +0.7. Yet desire is told, not conflicted; no on-page friction between decoding and repair speed, no want/fear tension. Summary-only −0.6, no visible cost −0.8, label-only passion −0.4. Net ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Magnetic calm" is declared four times ("magnetic calm settled," "Elias's calm held the shop in thrall," "magnetic calm, ready to pierce") and frames the tone. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (serene vigil) +0.9. Tone is static; no modulation under pressure or charged shift at the ending. Single mood −0.6, label-reliance (told not shown through rhythm or syntax) −0.5. Net ~5.8.</comment>
