<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirien's core motivation—to recover stolen time—is clear and drives her to the glade, but her choices there feel largely performative rather than pressured. The birth context adds embodied stakes (blood loss, nursing infant), yet the cartomancy ritual unfolds without genuine internal conflict or cost-laden hesitation. The "willingly perplexed" attribute is asserted repeatedly but never constrains a choice with visible tradeoff. The final winding of the clockwork into swaddling is a symbolic gesture rather than a decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a causal arc: Lirien climbs to the glade seeking lost time, performs a ritual with family objects, discovers the hidden clockwork, and descends with it as "promise rather than curse." However, the central reversal—the saucer crack revealing the heirloom mechanism—arrives without prior setup or earned discovery; the hinge and wax seal are introduced exactly when needed, weakening causality. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (repentance shifts from abstract to embodied in the clockwork) with felt cost (years stolen, blood loss, the "velvet noose" of beauty), satisfying the closure gate under an Accumulative lens. The orientation anchor (who, where, when) lands within the first ~100 words, so no Orientation Test penalty applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The midnight glade is vividly rendered ("obsidian branches," "dew-slick moss," "starry moss that pulsed with ethereal light") and the cloudbound setting frames the stakes thematically. The saucer crack and tablecloth function as micro-setting elements that organize the ritual and charge the closure image. However, the glade itself remains largely atmospheric backdrop; it does not constrain Lirien's choices or supply resources that alter her tactics—she could perform the same ritual elsewhere with minor adjustments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming lost time—is signaled early and remains coherent. The ritual sequence (tracing hands, inking cards, opening the saucer) provides a single meaningful deepening when the clockwork tumbles free, reweighting her relationship to family custom and future. Yet the pressure is more thematic accumulation than escalation through tightening choices; Lirien never faces a trade-off or renunciation that forecloses a live option. The cost (years stolen, post-birth exhaustion) is felt but largely pre-existing rather than arising from the scene's agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—the recovery of time through inheritance and ritual—emerges organically from the tablecloth custom, the saucer heirloom, and the infant's integration into the cycle. The final image of the clockwork syncing with the baby's breath offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "where lost time accumulates" without overt moralizing. However, the "willingly perplexed" motif is asserted more than dramatized, and the thematic turn from theft to promise is declared ("now a promise rather than a curse") rather than fully earned through prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with strong sensory texture ("choking beauty," "velvet noose," "milk-warm dawns"), and focalization remains stable in close third. However, the diction frequently drifts into elevated abstraction ("ethereal light," "opulent haze," "fragmented life whole") that feels imposed rather than filtered through Lirien's exhausted, post-birth state. Key moments—"Willingly perplexed, she refused to parse the riddles cleanly"—tell the stance rather than enacting it through perceptual choices. The narrative voice reads more like poetic commentary than embodied consciousness under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prose is dense with figurative language, but sustained metaphor density ("choking beauty," "velvet noose tightening with forgiveness," "beauty must strangle before they set you free") in nearly every paragraph becomes effortful without always advancing clarity. Paraphrase loops appear: "willingly perplexed" is asserted three times in similar phrasing, and "choking beauty" recurs without progression. Register drift is evident—"Cloudbound repentance called her," "Accumulating Veil," "fragmented life whole"—elevated diction that clashes with the immediate physical state (blood loss, nursing). Template cadence in the closing lines: "perplexed no longer by choice, but by grace" and "not loss, but return" follow a mechanical toggle pattern. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops, metaphor density without payoff, and register drift; −0.3 for template cadence in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—a cartomancer seeking lost time in a cloudbound glade after childbirth—synthesizes fantasy ritual with maternal reckoning in a specific way. The hidden clockwork in a cracked saucer and the birthday-tablecloth custom offer fresh particulars. However, the arc follows a familiar template: magical seeker performs ritual, discovers hidden heirloom, gains symbolic closure. The "lost time" conceit and the glade-as-penance setting read as constructed for the prompt elements rather than as an inevitable synthesis. The emotional core (motherhood reweighting past choices) is authentic but not pushed into surprising territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirien's identity as an onyx-ink cartomancer frames the ritual (she inks cards, spreads them, traces hands with onyx vial), appearing in setup, middle ritual, and closure. Her past cartomancy is the source of "lost time" and thus the motivating wound. However, her on-page choices are procedural enactments of the ritual rather than pressured decisions; the cartomancy itself does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under stress. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal linkage moderate +0.8, closure linkage moderate +0.8, swappability moderate −0.5 (another diviner type could perform similar actions), ornamental use in card-spread beat −0.5, summary-only backstory −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The saucer appears in setup (paragraph ~10, "cracked saucer from her dolls' tea set"), returns in the ritual mid-section ("saucer crack glowed faintly"), and unlocks the climax ("Lirien pried at the saucer's rim, unfastening a hidden hinge"). Its crack is causally active: it holds the clockwork shards and the hidden hinge, making it indispensable to the discovery. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure strong +1.2, closure linkage strong +1.4, specificity high +0.7. However, the hinge and wax seal are introduced exactly when needed without prior setup, reducing irreplaceability slightly −0.5; the object's role in the ending is causal but the mechanism feels convenient −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Cloudbound repentance" is named early and frames the glade setting and Lirien's motivation throughout. The concept shapes her journey (climbing to the glade after birth to seek penance) and the tonal charge of the ending (repentance "solidified, cloudbound no more"). Yet it functions more as thematic atmosphere than on-page constraint—Lirien does not face a choice between repentance and something else, nor does the concept impose a visible cost or narrow her options. Early signal +0.7, closure linkage moderate +0.9, causal pressure weak +0.3, swappability moderate −0.6 (another penitential setting could serve similarly), ornamental/thematic use −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Willingly perplexed" is asserted three times as a stance ("willingly perplexed, embracing the fog of confusion as her truest sight," "Willingly perplexed, she refused to parse the riddles cleanly," "perplexed no longer by choice, but by grace"). It appears in setup, middle, and closure, but remains label-only; it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic with visible cost. The attribute is told rather than enacted—Lirien never chooses confusion over clarity in a way that forecloses an option or incurs a price. Three mentions +0.4 (same beat repeated, counts as minimal), ornamental/label-only −0.8, swappability high −0.7 (another contemplative stance could replace it), late payoff weak +0.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unfasten" appears twice with causal weight: Lirien unfastens her bodice to nurse (~paragraph 3), grounding her post-birth vulnerability, and later unfastens the saucer's hidden hinge (~paragraph 21), releasing the clockwork. The second instance is the pivotal turn, redefining the nature of lost time and enabling the closure. Early signal (bodice) +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure strong in the hinge beat +1.3, closure linkage strong +1.5, specificity moderate +0.5 (the hinge action is specific but the bodice use is minor). The bodice unfastening does not alter tactics; only the saucer hinge is indispensable, so dual use inflates the score slightly without doubling necessity −0.4, summary-only backstory of the wax seal −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The custom of tracing hands on birthday tablecloths is introduced early (paragraph ~8), structures the ritual (Liiren traces her hand, then her daughter's), and is invoked at closure ("Tracing hands had mapped not loss, but return"). The method is causally active: the traced hands guide the ink spread and prime the discovery of the clockwork in the adjacent saucer. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure moderate +0.9 (it organizes the ritual but does not constrain a choice under stress), closure linkage strong +1.3, specificity high +0.7 (the intergenerational handprint detail is particular). However, the method is more procedural framework than pressured means; Lirien could perform a similar ritual without it with minor adjustments, reducing irreplaceability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The midnight glade above the clouds is established in the opening line and remains the sole location throughout. It frames the stakes (cloudbound repentance, vapors that hold lost time) and provides atmospheric pressure ("choking beauty," "perfumed mist that tasted of forgotten laughter"). The glade's "root-woven altar" and "starry moss" organize the ritual space. Early signal +0.8, present throughout +1.0, closure linkage moderate +0.9 (the glade's vapors part to reveal dawn, signaling release). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—Lirien could perform the ritual elsewhere with the same objects and achieve the same outcome. Postcard description dominates over micro-setting pressure −0.9, swappability moderate −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the birth—after that tear-streaked expulsion" is signaled early and provides embodied urgency: Lirien is "still echoing the violent rupture of birth just hours before," bleeding, nursing. This temporal anchor pressures her physically and emotionally throughout the ritual. The birth context appears in setup, recurs in sensory detail (nursing, blood loss, trembling fingers), and charges the closure (daughter's breath syncing with the clockwork). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure moderate +0.9 (the post-birth state constrains her stamina and sharpens the stakes of legacy), closure linkage moderate +1.0. However, the timeframe is background condition rather than live clock—hours pass without on-page time pressure altering a tactic −0.5, swappability moderate −0.6 (another recent crisis could serve similarly).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Lirien's desire "to find where lost time accumulates" is stated early and drives her journey to the glade. The motivation is dramatized through her physical struggle (dragging herself skyward post-birth) and the ritual enactment. It recurs in the middle ("What penance for the hours I devoured?") and resolves at closure when she discovers the answer (the clockwork heirloom). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure moderate +1.0 (the desire propels the ritual but does not face a competing want that creates friction), closure linkage strong +1.4. However, the motivation is more quest than conflict—Lirien seeks an answer rather than choosing between incompatible desires, reducing tension −0.7. The cost (years stolen, exhaustion) is pre-existing rather than arising from the pursuit −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Choking beauty" is named in the opening line and recurs six times as the dominant tonal signature: "choking beauty," "opulent haze," "velvet noose tightening with forgiveness," "choking splendor," "The choking beauty lingered in her lungs," "some beauties must strangle before they set you free." The tone is coherent and modulates slightly—intensifying during the ritual, releasing at dawn. It charges the final image ("lingered in her lungs, a reminder") and integrates with the core concept (beauty as both affliction and grace). Early signal +0.8, present throughout +1.4, closure linkage strong +1.5, specificity high +0.7. However, the repetition becomes effortful without progression; the phrase is reused rather than developed, reducing its evolving charge −0.8. The tonal metaphor (strangulation/beauty) is mixed in the final beat ("strangle before they set you free"), muddling clarity −0.5.</comment>
