<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to chronicle dreams is established, but her interior work leans heavily on abstract labels ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The jealousy method is told more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final return to the cabin and folding of the scroll suggests endurance, but the cost of that renunciation—what path is foreclosed—remains gestural rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (grave, past selves, soaring) that reweights the dominant stake of distilling chaos. Orientation anchors (Elara, cabin, Blackthorn Peak, post-grave-dream) arrive by ~10% but the chronological confusion blurs causality without teaching a clear pattern early. The closure—scroll complete, chaos distilled, quiet return—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she accepts the cyclical chronicling role), yet the cost (what future or past self is she forgoing?) is implied rather than made undeniable in the final image. Penalty for lens ambiguity through the middle third: −0.3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cabin, Blackthorn Peak, birch bark, and raven-feather quill anchor the setting with vivid, purposeful detail. The scroll's "papery skin unfurling like a reluctant confession" and the cabin's "skeletal embrace" filter environment through Elara's weary perspective. However, the soaring sequence (cabin roof splintering, crags as "broken teeth") shifts into metaphor-heavy skyscape without clear spatial choreography; the return to "cabin ruins, or were they whole?" introduces ambiguity that does not constrain a choice or charge the closure image with micro-setting consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: distilling chaos into narrative, signaled early and sustained. The jealousy-triggered flight is a meaningful deepening that reweights Elara's relationship to her past selves, and the mid-air inscription on the scroll tightens pressure. Yet the resolution—landing, scroll complete, ready for the next dreamer—feels more like a return to baseline than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift is legible, but the price paid (what does she lose by accepting this cycle?) lacks the sharp edge required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the grave as rebirth marker, jealousy as lucidity spark, feral nostalgia fueling flight. The final scroll entry ("Grave seen, yet ungrown; selves feral, me chained") and the closing question ("whose grave would I chronicle next? Mine again?") offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how she reconciles past and present selves. However, phrases like "jaded wonder" and "feral nostalgia" risk labeling rather than embodying the theme through concrete action, and the ending leans toward articulating the theme rather than letting it emerge fully from image and choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person with a distinct, lyric-inflected narrative texture ("weeds choking the headstone," "moon's indifferent grin"). Elara's perceptual signature—chronologically confused, weary, self-envious—shapes what she notices. Yet the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("chronologically confused," "feral nostalgia") that reads more like writerly shorthand than Elara's lived idiom under pressure. The compression and patterned imagery (cabin → flight → return) are purposeful, but the voice does not sharpen or degrade noticeably under peak stress, flattening the sense of escalation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and often vivid ("cabin's skeletal embrace," "arrow of light"), but several metaphors cluster without clear pattern-teaching: "cabin walls blurred," "splintering timber in a cascade of starlit shards," "winds howled with the voices of past selves." Template cadence runs appear ("I remembered… I hated… I chased… I twisted… I landed") without variation in sentence openings across multiple beats. Paraphrase loops touch the middle third: "Jealousy gnawed… The envy deepened… Jealous no more, but envious still." Combined artifacts in peak beats trigger −0.8 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The lucid-dream-chronicler premise and jealousy-as-method offer fresh angles, and the birch-bark scroll as medium for chaos distillation is specific. However, the core arc—protagonist envies past self, undergoes transformative flight, returns with earned insight—follows a recognizable template without a non-obvious synthesis that redefines the stakes. The chronological confusion and feral nostalgia remain more thematic labels than engines that uniquely constrain choices. Risk-taking in the soaring sequence is present but does not heighten stakes enough to overcome the derivative structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role as chronicler frames the story, but her decisions are limited: she grips the scroll, writes mid-flight, and folds it at the end. The jealousy-triggered flight is more a vision-state than a tactical choice that alters later options. She observes and records rather than making on-page decisions that create key turns. Missing middle development cap: 3.4 does not apply because the flight itself is a beat; swappability and summary-only use lower the score within the 4.0–5.0 functional band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The birch bark scroll appears in four beats: harvested (setup), glowing in her lap (early middle), inscribed mid-flight (climax), folded at closure. It frames the act of chronicling and its papery texture charges the opening. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost; Elara writes on it without difficulty, and the scroll's completion feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle with the medium. Lyric reprise (first third → ending) with closure presence qualifies it for mid-6s, but lack of causal pressure or cost connection caps further rise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Feral nostalgia" is named five times and described as "savage, clawing yearning for untamed selves" and fuel for the ascent, but it operates more as thematic label than a stake that shapes tactics on the page. It does not present a choice, tradeoff, or cost that alters Elara's moves; instead, it explains her emotional state. Present across beats but functionally ornamental; late first explicit naming (~15%) and swappability (could be "wild longing" or similar) apply small deductions within the 4.0–5.0 band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Chronologically confused" is stated twice and shown through overlapping visions (grave, childhood meadows, future/past blend), but it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. It colors perception without forcing a tactical choice or creating a tradeoff. Swappability cap (3.8): the story would function similarly if she were "temporally disoriented" or simply "confused about time." Label-only trait without dramatized cost trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Soar" drives the central sequence: jealousy crests → she erupts upward through the roof → chases past selves → writes mid-flight → lands with scroll complete. The flight redefines her relationship to past selves and enables the act of distillation. Removing it would collapse the middle and closure. Causal pressure across three beats (eruption, mid-air inscription, landing) and closure linkage (the scroll is completed during/after the flight) place it solidly in the 7.0–8.4 essential band. Cost is implied (acceptance of the cycle) but not sharp enough for higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The jealousy method is signaled early ("getting jealous of past selves to shatter the veil") and enacted on-page ("Jealousy crested—I hated them all… The air thickened, and suddenly, I was soaring"). It triggers the flight and thus shapes the central beat. However, the mechanics are told more than shown through micro-choices; we do not see her deliberately cultivate the jealousy under pressure. Present in setup and one key beat (the trigger), but missing middle development as a repeated tactic. Two-gate fulfillment with causal pressure lifts it into the 5.5–6.3 range; told-only friction and late payoff prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cabin anchors the opening and closing and provides the birch bark scroll (harvested from a tree during last week's storm). Its "skeletal embrace" and "creaky bunk" establish mood, and the return at closure ("cabin ruins, or were they whole?") recharges the space. However, the cabin does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it functions as frame and atmosphere. Lyric reprise (first paragraph → penultimate paragraph) qualifies it for mid-5s, but lack of micro-setting pressure or cost caps further rise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The grave vision frames the opening ("stood before my own grave… date that might have been tomorrow's") and is revisited in the flight ("my grave's mound swelling"), and the scroll notes "Grave seen, yet ungrown." The timeframe is more conceptual than tactical; it does not create a live clock that tightens decisions. Present in setup and ending, but does not constrain middle choices or impose a deadline. Swappability (could be "after a prophetic vision" or "after a disturbing omen") and lack of time pressure trend low-mid.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"To distill chaos into narrative" is stated as Elara's paid role and restated at the climax ("this chaos demanded distillation") and closure ("a chronicle of jaded wonder… chaos distilled"). The scroll-writing mid-flight dramatizes the act. However, the desire is more professional duty than conflicted want; there is no friction between distilling chaos and another competing goal. Present across setup, middle, and ending; causal role in the writing beat and closure linkage place it in the 6.5–7.5 range. Lack of visible cost or internal conflict prevents higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Jaded wonder" is named once and embodied through contrasts: "weary awe of one who's flown too many dreamscapes," "wonder jading into resolve," and the closing "jaded wonder, where graves precede flights, and jealousy births wings." The tone coheres through the piece and modulates with pressure (weary opening → soaring exhilaration → quiet resolve). The final image charges the tone by yoking weariness and possibility. Present in setup and ending with clear modulation under pressure; closure linkage and thematic reprise place it in the 6.0–7.0 band. Lack of sharp cost or irreplaceability (could be "weary awe" throughout) prevents higher scores.</comment>
