<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias and Mira are motivated by a shared compassion cycle, but their interiority relies heavily on labels ("shrewd," "whimsically attentive," "cautious exuberance") rather than embodied contradiction. The locket revelation triggers recognition but not a difficult choice with visible cost—Elias simply marvels and proposes friendship. Backstory dominates the middle third (the wreck, Mira's anonymous donations) and is told rather than dramatized through present micro-choices, flattening pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (friendship formalized, cycle acknowledged) with a felt emotional cost (Mira's reclusiveness broken, Elias's solitude ended), satisfying the closure requirement. However, the causal chain is weak: the mistaken address is pure coincidence, and the locket's backstory is delivered through exposition rather than discovered beats. The orientation anchor is delayed—"breezy library under stars" appears in line two, but we don't learn Elias's precise location or the concert context until well past the 120-word mark, warranting a −0.3 penalty and triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The library setting ("open-air shelves swaying like cargo nets") and pier are vivid and mood-consistent, but they don't constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elias could track Mira anywhere. The locket photo (pier, decades past) charges the final image when Elias presents a new locket photo, creating a purposeful reprise. However, the Orientation Test penalty in Q2 caps this category at 7.0, and sensory detail skews visual without using proximity or access to pressure decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reconnecting the locket to its origin, then recognizing Mira as benefactor) is clear, but escalation is minimal—Elias tracks an address, knocks, and the revelation unfolds through dialogue summary. No live option is foreclosed; Mira agrees to friendship without visible friction or cost. The coincidental envelope solves rather than complicates, and the "cycles" concept is declared rather than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "cycles of compassion" theme emerges through the locket's engraving and the mirrored donor-recipient roles, avoiding overt moralizing until the final paragraph's "Cycles complete, then begin anew." The piece resists tidy binaries (Mira's reclusiveness vs. Elias's recognition), but the thematic answer is more stated than embodied. The locket reprise (sister's photo → shared photo) offers a resonant non-literal closure, lifting the score despite earlier exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Single-POV Elias maintains a consistent narrative distance, but voice leans generic with recycled stems ("cautious exuberance," "whimsically attentive") and filter stacks ("he'd come," "he pocketed," "he arrived"). Dialogue is functional but flat—"Oh dear, I meant it for…" reads expository rather than goal-driven. No head-hopping, and psychic distance is stable, but the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "cautious exuberance" appears five times, "whimsically attentive" three times, "shrewd" four times, often without advancing meaning. Template cadence runs ("He frowned shrewdly… Curiosity piqued, Elias slipped… Knocking gently, he met…") and synonym churn ("uplifting," "uplift," "uplifted") across adjacent paragraphs trigger −0.6. The backstory block (lines ~25–35) stalls momentum. Figurative language ("cargo nets," "tides," "vault") is coherent but ornamental, not integral to peak beats. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack and loop check: −1.2 total in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The mistaken-address meet-cute and anonymous-donor reveal are familiar templates executed competently but without transformation. The locket's dual photos (sister lost → friendship found) offers a specific emotional anchor, but the core arc (reclusive benefactor recognized, friendship proposed) could swap names and settings with minimal impact. No bold structural risk or non-obvious synthesis; the piece stays safely in the middle ground.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's shrewdness is asserted ("shrewd mind pieced it together") but not demonstrated through a difficult on-page choice. He observes, tracks an address, and proposes friendship—functional but replaceable with any observant character. Present in setup and closure, but middle development lacks a constrained decision with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locket appears in three beats: discovered in the envelope, revealed as the sister's keepsake, and reprised as the new shared photo at closure. Its return reweights the opening ("Cycles begin with one kindness" engraving) and charges the final image. However, its mechanics are told (Mira found it post-wreck) rather than discovered through action, and it doesn't narrow options mid-story. Strong closure linkage and specificity lift it into the 6.5–7.0 range; irreplaceability (the photo's pier, sister's identity) nudges it to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Cycles of compassion" is stated explicitly ("vowed to perpetuate," engraving text, final paragraph "Cycles complete") and shapes Elias's motivation, but it doesn't constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page—he would track the locket sender regardless. Present in setup (vow), middle (recognition), and closure (new photo), satisfying all three gates. However, the concept is thematic rather than operational; it reweights meaning but doesn't narrow options. Functional across beats with closure linkage, but lacks causal pressure: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Whimsically attentive" is used as a label five times without enabling or constraining action. Elias notices the address error and envisions "fate's playful nudge," but the trait doesn't shape a tactical choice or impose a cost. Ornamental repetition without mechanical work: mid-3s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Initiate" appears twice as a verb (seeking the sender, proposing friendship) and frames Elias's goal. The envelope-opening initiates the search, and the friendship proposal initiates the resolution. Present in setup and closure, but middle development is weak—the address-tracking is passive. One clear causal turn (opening the envelope) and closure participation, but easily swappable with "pursue" or "begin": 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The mistaken address ("Wharf Library" vs. "Wharf Lane") is the inciting incident and is referenced at closure ("kindled by that envelope's error"). However, its mechanics are purely coincidental—it doesn't shape Elias's attempts or impose a constraint. Setup and payoff are clear, but middle development is absent and the method resolves a problem it didn't help create. Two gates met, lyric reprise present, but no causal pressure: 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "breezy library under stars" is described lyrically and frames both the concert and the final scene, but it doesn't constrain a choice or supply a resource. Elias could meet Mira anywhere; the setting is postcard backdrop. Present in setup and closure (they reconvene after another symphony), but no middle pressure. Functional reprise without mechanical work: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the symphony ends" anchors the opening and is referenced once more ("after another symphony crescendo"), but elapsed time is vague and doesn't tighten decisions. The "weeks later" transition is summary-only. Setup and closure participation are weak; no live clock pressure. Ornamental timeframe: 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elias's desire "to uplift silent contributors" is stated early and drives his observation of patrons, his tracking of Mira, and his proposal to credit her openly. Present across all three beats, but the motivation is told rather than tested—no friction between this want and a competing cost. Functional involvement with closure linkage, but no dramatized conflict: 5.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is repeated five times as a label describing crowd, Mira, and their shared state, but it doesn't modulate under pressure or charge the final image. The tone is static and asserted rather than embodied through rhythm or syntax shifts. Present setup-to-closure, but ornamental: 4.4.</comment>
