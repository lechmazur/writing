<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara remains a cipher throughout; her "wisely adventurous" trait is asserted but never tested by contradictory impulses or visible cost. The ending moment—touching the throne and choosing "stewardship, not conquest"—arrives without prior struggle between competing desires or a dramatized hierarchy of values. Internal experience is flattened by label-heavy diction ("futuristic nostalgia enveloped her") and diagnostic clarity ("understanding that claiming it meant stewardship") that no one possesses mid-crisis. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are absent; she moves through set-pieces without genuine struggle or consequence that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive late (who/where clear by ~180 words, when/why remain vague until ~250); the Orientation Test penalty applies (−0.4), also capping Q3 at 7.0. The closure unit—throne acceptance via "communing with its lore"—lacks visible cost; "restoration" is asserted without showing what Elara sacrifices or forecloses. Causality is Tourist Plot: she navigates obstacles (tunnels, waterfall, drones, trapdoor) in sequence without her decisions narrowing options or creating new complications. The drive lens reads Causal by default but the and-then sequencing never tightens into because/therefore linkage. No Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost lands on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Vivid catalog (holographic spires, smog-veiled sky, bioluminescent fungal groves, kaleidoscopic waterfall, luminous fruits) but most detail is ornamental postcard work disconnected from choice. The ruby flake's glow peels paint and projects the hologram, satisfying the gate minimally; the orchard provides the pavilion floor trapdoor. Spatial choreography holds across moves. No other object or environmental constraint shapes a tactic or charges the final image; the throne itself is described but does not pressure Elara's approach beyond her internal monologue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the stairway, claim the throne) is signaled early but never escalates into a trade-off or tightening. Obstacles (undergrid tunnels, drones, trapdoor) are bypassed in sequence without forcing Elara to sacrifice a resource, abandon a plan, or endure a visible cost. The drone encounter—"she deciphered a mural's riddle, using the flake to etch a counter-frequency… cloaking her presence"—is solved off-page without dramatized attempt or failure. The throne's "warning" and "testing her soul with visions" are told, not shown; no on-page choice narrows options or reweights tactics. Pressure remains flat; coincidence does not complicate but corridor-clears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme (wisdom/stewardship versus hubris/conquest) is stated overtly in the mural inscription, Elara's closing monologue, and the narrator's summary ("her quest ended not in rule, but restoration"). No subtext; the piece tells its thesis rather than earning it through concrete action and image. The final paragraph—"not grasping power rashly, but communing with its lore—understanding that claiming it meant stewardship"—is diagnostic label-speak that replaces dramatization with declaration. The orchard and throne could symbolize lost paradise but remain decorative; no particular reweights the abstraction into felt cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction frequently drifts into elevated register mismatched to live perception under pressure: "futuristic nostalgia enveloped her," "miracle pocket of the past," "molting skin," "shattering rainbows," "weave a canopy that whispered windsongs." Psychic distance oscillates between tight interior and distant catalog without purposeful modulation. Filter verbs ("she murmured," "she deciphered") cluster in peak beats, dulling immediacy. No distinct perceptual signature; the narrator's way of noticing reads generic cyberpunk-fantasy rather than character-particular. Single line of dialogue does not reveal subtext or pursue a goal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Loops and scaffold pervade: "slathered in layers of iridescent paint—camouflage from scavengers, peeling faintly" then "the paint to bubble and slough away like molting skin" then "Through the peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals" restates the same event across three beats (−0.6). Stock metaphor strings ("heartbeat from yesteryear," "whispered windsongs from centuries past," "molting skin," "shattering rainbows") cluster without earned specificity (−0.5). Template cadence runs: "Clutching… activated… slipped," "Parting… stepped… into" (−0.4). Figurative density in most sentences of the orchard and pavilion beats without payoff at closure (−0.5). Cumulative artifact penalty −2.0; since artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("communing," "weave," "beckoning"), the 9+ global disallow applies and high-band entries cap at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core premise (cyber-future + ancient throne + lone seeker) is template cyberpunk-fantasy without transformation. The journey structure (undergrid tunnels → waterfall → orchard → pavilion → stairway → throne) follows video-game level design. Elara's arc (wisdom triumphs over hubris) is stated rather than earned through specific non-obvious synthesis. "Futuristic nostalgia" as tone is the freshest element but remains thematic assertion; no particular detail synthesizes past and future in a way that feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth is absent; Elara's interior is stock. Proximity to genre templates is high; the derivative premise guardrail applies (−1.0 within Q8).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lore keeper trait anchors the setup (archives, lore-tapes, forbidden scrolls) and she uses lore to decode the mural and counter-frequency. However, both decisions happen off-page in summary ("she deciphered a mural's riddle," "understanding that claiming it meant stewardship") without on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Present in setup and closure image, but middle beat is summary-only (−0.4). Swappable with "archaeologist" or "scholar" with minor edits (−0.5). No visible cost tied to this identity on the page (−0.4). Total ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ruby flake appears early (setup gate), used in two distinct beats: peeling paint at the pavilion and cloaking from drones (development gate). Present in the closure paragraph ("the flake… the throne") but not causally active there; cameo does not count as payoff (missing payoff gate cap 2.8 would apply, but lyric reprise allowance lifts to ~3.0). However, the flake enables two key turns (paint removal, drone evasion) with specific mechanics (vibration, counter-frequency etching), raising involvement +0.9 and causal pressure +0.8. Irreplaceable properties (Elder energy signature) +0.5. Subtract late first physical use ~−0.2 and ornamental description at intro ~−0.3. Total ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Unclaimed throne frames the quest (setup gate) and is the destination image (payoff gate), but does not constrain a middle choice (missing development gate; two-gate cap ~6.0). Elara's approach to the throne is narrated without on-page friction: "she approached wisely, not grasping power rashly" is assertion, not dramatized cost. The throne's "testing her soul with visions" is told in transit, not shown. Swappable with "lost artifact" or "secret power" with minor edits (−0.6). No visible price tied specifically to *un*claimed status versus simply "throne" (−0.4). Total ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Wisely adventurous" is asserted in paragraph 2 and again in the drone beat ("Wisely adventurous, Elara didn't flee blindly; she deciphered…"), but both moments are label-only without on-page tradeoff. No scene shows wisdom in tension with daring; she simply succeeds at every obstacle. Missing setup in action (introduced as label), missing development as dramatized cost, missing payoff. Ornamental (−0.8), label-only (−0.3 per pattern pack), swappable (−0.5). Total ~2.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Sally" appears twice: "she would sally forth on her most perilous quest" (setup) and "She sallied upward" on the stairway (payoff). Both are diction choices, not plot actions; the verb does not define the movement's stakes or mechanics. Easily swappable with "ventured," "ascended," "pressed" (−0.7). Present in two beats but purely ornamental (−0.6). No causal pressure or cost tied to this verb choice (−0.5). Total ~3.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Method signaled early (paint camouflage hinted, flake glow causes peel, murals revealed) and executed on-page in the pavilion beat (development gate). The revealed murals provide the map and stairway activation logic, shaping the closure approach (payoff gate). Mechanics matter: flake vibration → paint slough → holographic overlay. Irreplaceable specifics (iridescent paint, motif alignment, twin moons map) +0.6. Three beats (paint description, peel action, mural decode) +1.4. Causal pressure (without murals, no stairway access) +1.0. Subtract ornamental first mention ~−0.3 and slight swappability (could use "scanning a hidden screen") ~−0.4. Total ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Hidden orchard behind waterfall is introduced mid-story (~40% mark; −0.3 late penalty). Provides the pavilion and trapdoor (development gate) and frames the stairway's location (payoff gate). The orchard itself does not pressure a choice; Elara simply "stepped behind it into the hidden orchard" without navigating obstacles inside. The waterfall veil is parted with a "tuned sonic pulse"—brief tool use, no cost. Present in two beats (entry, pavilion floor) +0.4. Causal role (houses the stairway access) +0.6. Subtract ornamental catalog (gnarled trees, luminous fruits, drones mimicking fireflies) ~−0.7 and swappability (any hidden ruin would serve) ~−0.5. Total ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is declared at the outset and the chrono-implant pulses warnings twice, but elapsed time is never tracked and no choice is tightened by the clock. The stairway ascent occurs "as the chrono chimed sunrise"—coincidence, not cost. Missing development gate (time does not alter a middle tactic). Present in setup and payoff (two-gate cap ~6.0 eligible, but coincidental resolution lowers it). No visible price for delay or hurry (−0.8). Swappable with "by dawn" or any deadline (−0.5). Total ~3.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Motivation (find the stairway of ascension) is stated early and drives the journey structure (setup and payoff gates). However, desire is never dramatized in conflict with cost or alternate want; Elara encounters no moment where finding the stairway competes with safety, rest, or another goal. The quest is narrated as checklist completion. Missing development gate (no middle choice where stairway-seeking forecloses another path). Friction between wants and costs is absent (−1.0). Swappable with "find the lost temple" or similar (−0.6). Total ~4.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Futuristic nostalgia is signaled ("synth-waves… from the Great Bloom," "drones mimicking fireflies," "Eden her ancestors mourned") and recurs across beats, but tone remains static: every description layers chrome-and-vine imagery without modulation under pressure. During the drone threat, tone does not shift to urgency; the orchard remains "miracle pocket" catalog. The closure paragraph repeats the motif ("Neo-Eden's lost paradise," "orchards virtually blooming," "nostalgic bridge to tomorrow") without charging it with new cost or irony. Coherent but unvaried (mid-band). Does not charge the final image with reweighted pressure (−0.8). Total ~4.3.</comment>
