<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Thorne's motivation to decode glyphs via lucid dreams is clear, but his interior life remains largely functional—witness role without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The climactic choice (sharing dream-data with Lyra) feels inevitable rather than earned through visible struggle. Lyra's exhaustion is embodied ("shadows under her eyes"), yet both characters deploy therapy-speak labels ("burden," "solace," "healed") without embodied micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final embrace resolves neatly without lingering cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Causal with accumulative texture (variable stars → glyph alignment). Orientation anchors who/where/when early. The closure—Thorne decodes glyphs, shares insight, temple glyphs glow—lands on the page but cost remains diffuse: "burden lifting" is declared, not dramatized through a forfeited option. The convergence (seventh pulse matching central glyph) arrives via dream-witness without prior on-page friction that the method could fail, lowering felt stakes. One meaningful tightening occurs (dream sketches → temple confirmation), meeting length expectations, yet the price paid is abstract rather than a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Observatory setting (stone walls, brass instruments, cliff-side temple) is vivid and filtered through Thorne's professional lens. The daylily-pressed telegram charges the final image ("fragile beauty mirroring the dawn"), meeting micro-setting allowance. However, environment does not constrain a choice—characters move freely from observatory to temple without spatial friction. Sensory detail is selective (star charts, ink-stained fingers, roseate dawn) but remains descriptive rather than tactically decisive, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode inscriptions before "light fails") is signaled early via telegram. One tightening occurs when dream-data syncs with glyphs, narrowing interpretation. Yet escalation is muted: the lucid dream succeeds without resistance, and temple confirmation arrives without setback. The final alignment ("spirals pulsing in sync") reconfigures understanding but no live option is foreclosed—both characters achieve their goal without visible sacrifice. Pressure remains coherent under Causal lens but lacks a trade-off that would elevate felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges through Thorne absorbing Lyra's interpretive weight, but final image ("midnight solace had birthed eternal dawn") overtly articulates the concept rather than letting it resonate through particulars. The daylily motif (fleeting dawn → preserved legend) attempts symbolic reprise but the closure paragraph ("Through variables and vows, understanding endured") summarizes rather than charges. Epiphany is declared ("understanding dawned—sharp as a nova") instead of earned through embodied realization, lowering thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Thorne; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (star charts, dream-veil soaring) but diction drifts into elevated register ("solace deepened," "burden gnawed," "ethereal sweat") that reads ornamental rather than character-particular. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("Share it with me," "You witnessed what I could not") without subtext or goal pursuit. Psychic distance is consistent, yet the prose at peak beats ("tears tracing solace's path") toggles into metaphoric overlay that flattens immediacy. Filter verbs ("he watched," "she stirred") are present but not stacked.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: "midnight wrapped the world in a blanket of solace," "dawn's promise," "celestial symphony for shared souls." Mixed metaphors ("burden that gnawed," "tears tracing solace's path") and template cadence in final third ("Witness to wonders, they shone. Through variables and vows, understanding endured.") dull momentum. Paraphrase loops appear ("burden lifting," "burdens lightened"; "solace," "midnight solace," "solace's path" recur without reweighting). Stock metaphors (nova, symphony, dawn) cluster in closure beats. Figurative density in final paragraph triggers −0.7; template stems and loops add −0.6, total −1.3 within Q7 per artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Premise—lucid dreamer decodes temple glyphs via variable-star patterns—offers a fresh synthesis of astronomy and mysticism. Execution, however, leans on stock mystical-romance beats: exhausted scholar, supportive partner, harmonious revelation without friction. The telegram device and variable-star method are specific, yet the emotional arc (shared burden → mutual triumph) follows template satisfaction without risk or counter-pressure. Transformation test: swap observatory for archive and stars for ancient texts; the arc holds unchanged, signaling insufficient particularity to elevate originality beyond functional mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Thorne's role as lucid dream chronicler is signaled early (first paragraph), drives the central method (dream-witnessing variable stars), and enables the climactic decode. He makes one key decision: entering the lucid dream to absorb Lyra's burden. However, the choice is inevitable given his established skill—no visible cost or alternative path is foreclosed. The character could be replaced by "expert astronomer" with minor edits, lowering irreplaceability. Present in setup, development (dream beat), and closure (shares insight), satisfying all three gates. Causal pressure is moderate; cost is diffuse.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Daylily-pressed telegram appears in two beats: unfolding at the observatory (mid-story) and clutched as talisman at temple (ending). The object carries symbolic weight (fleeting dawn, urgency) and its fragile beauty mirrors the dawn in the final image, meeting lyric-reprise criteria. Yet it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—characters would decode glyphs without it. Swappable with any urgent message token. Present in setup (introduced ~40% mark, late penalty −0.3), absent from middle development, present at closure. Two-gate eligibility caps at ~6.0; late introduction and ornamental use lower to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Shared burdens is the story's thematic spine: Thorne absorbs Lyra's interpretive weight, dream-witness distributes the decode labor, and the telegram plea literalizes the concept. The concept shapes stakes (Lyra's exhaustion, Thorne's motivation) and is dramatized on the page when Thorne enters the dream to carry the burden. However, no visible trade-off or cost is tied to sharing—both succeed without sacrifice. Present in setup (opening paragraphs), development (dream absorption), and closure (burden lifted, "shared souls"). All three gates met; causal pressure moderate; cost implied but not concrete, capping score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heals with words is introduced early ("his voice a balm that mended not flesh but frayed souls") and returns at closure ("his words healing the rift between stone and sky"). The attribute enables one on-page action: Thorne's spoken interpretation mends Lyra's doubt. Yet the healing is declared rather than dramatized through visible micro-choices or cost—Lyra's tears signal relief without a foreclosed path. Swappable with "provides insight" or "offers comfort." Present in setup and closure; absent from middle development. Two-gate eligibility caps at ~6.0; label-only execution and ornamental closure mention lower to low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Witness defines Thorne's role and method: he witnesses variable stars in lucid dreams, enabling the decode. The action shapes two beats (dream-soaring, dawn interpretation) and participates in closure (temple glyphs confirm his witnessed data). Major turns trace to this action—without witnessing, the decode fails. However, the act of witnessing involves no dramatized struggle or cost; it succeeds on first attempt. Present in setup (established profession), development (dream beat), and closure (confirmation). All three gates met; causal pressure strong; irreplaceability high; cost absent, capping score in mid-to-upper 6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Through variable stars is signaled early (title entries, dream mapping) and provides the decode mechanism: star pulse cycles match temple glyph spirals. The method shapes two beats (dream-witnessing, dawn insight) and is confirmed at closure (glyphs pulse in sync). Mechanics matter—seventh pulse matching central glyph is specific—but no on-page friction tests whether the method could fail or require adjustment. Present in setup, development (dream), and closure. All three gates met; causal work moderate; specificity high; lack of dramatized cost or tactical constraint caps score in upper-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Celestial mapping observatory is introduced early (first line) and houses the inciting action (telegram, dream preparation). The cliff-side temple appears at closure for glyph confirmation. Both settings are vivid but do not constrain choices—characters move freely without spatial friction or resource limitation. Observatory supplies props (star charts, brass instruments) but these remain descriptive. Present in setup and closure; development occurs in dream-space (liminal, not the observatory itself). Missing middle development gate caps at 3.4; strong setup and closure participation lift to low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>When understanding dawns structures the arc: midnight vigil → one a.m. clock strike → hours blur in dream → dawn insight. Time tightens decisions (Lyra's exhaustion, "before light fails" urgency) and the dawn moment crystallizes the decode. The timeframe shapes two beats (midnight threshold, dawn epiphany) and charges the final image ("midnight solace had birthed eternal dawn"). However, no live clock forces a tactical trade-off—the decode succeeds at the first dawn without time-pressure consequence. Present in setup, development (dream duration), and closure. All three gates met; moderate causal pressure; cost implied but not concrete.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>To decode temple inscriptions drives both characters: Lyra's "unyielding motivation," Thorne's dream-witness to help. The desire is dramatized in Lyra's exhaustion and the telegram plea, creating friction (inscriptions "eluded her"). The motivation shapes two beats (telegram trigger, dream decode) and resolves at closure (glyphs unveiled). However, no on-page conflict between wants and costs—both achieve the goal without sacrifice. Present in setup (Lyra's labor), development (Thorne's dream decision), and closure (success). All three gates met; friction present but cost absent, capping score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Midnight solace establishes tone in the opening ("midnight wrapped the world in a blanket of solace") and recurs throughout ("midnight's solace yielding to dawn's promise," "Midnight solace had birthed eternal dawn"). The tone modulates slightly—quiet vigil to triumphant embrace—but remains static comfort rather than coherent tension. At closure, "solace" is declared rather than felt through image. Tone does not constrain a choice or charge the final moment beyond thematic echo. Present in setup and closure; absent from middle pressure. Two-gate eligibility caps at ~6.0; ornamental use and label-reliance lower to low-5s.</comment>
