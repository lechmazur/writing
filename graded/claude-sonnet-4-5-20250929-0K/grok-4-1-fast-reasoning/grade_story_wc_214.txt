<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's spiritual curiosity is declared but never genuinely tested by a conflicting impulse—he simply observes and empathizes without internal friction. The trembling vulnerability is asserted as motivation but dissolves without cost when he has his epiphany; no path is foreclosed. Key moments like "vulnerability was no weakness" arrive as delivered wisdom rather than earned through dramatized choice. The character reads as a vessel for theme rather than an agent under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece opens with atmospheric scene-setting but delays clear anchoring of who Elias is and what immediate problem he faces until well past the 120-word mark, creating orientation debt (−0.4). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful deepening or pattern break charges the ending—Elias's final stance ("vulnerability was no weakness") is stated rather than reconfigured through image or cost. The closure reads as Conceptual Repricing, yet the conceptual cost is not legible on the page; he sets the lantern aside and resumes sweeping with no visible trade-off or foreclosed option. Under the Accumulative lens, the story needed a cadence shift or density spike to reweight the dominant stake; instead it delivers an abstract epiphany.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The station and yellow lantern glass constrain Elias's ritual and anchor the final image, satisfying the micro-setting test. Spatial details—domes, observatory apex, relic shelf—are legible and purposeful. However, the "overlooked era" and "primordial frost" remain vague atmospheric gestures without affecting choice or stakes. The lantern glass charges the closure by being set aside, but the setting itself does not evolve or pressure the final decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The on-page action (tracing star paths, empathizing) does not narrow options or impose a visible cost; Elias's memories surface without altering present tactics. The story delivers a moment of realization but no tightening that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; the ending asserts bloomed strength without demonstrating a trade-off or constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of vulnerability as strength emerges from repeated imagery (falling stars, trembling hands, tears) but is over-articulated in the penultimate paragraph: "vulnerability was no weakness, but the cosmos's elegant forge." This thematic echo (−0.5) replaces scene pressure with thesis statement. The final image—broom in hand, "vulnerable, yet eternal"—gestures toward resonance but lacks the non-literal particularity that would reweight prior material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, but diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register ("primal elegance of a shadow given form," "life's elegy," "flourishing stillness") that clashes with Elias's concrete janitorial context. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he felt," "he glimpsed") stack in peak beats without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; the narrator's lens could belong to any cosmic contemplator. No dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dense figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.6 for density). Multiple metaphors clash or overreach: "shadow given form," "vein of liquid sunlight," "blooming brightest in vulnerability's hush." Paraphrase loops recur: paragraphs restating that stars flourish in surrender without adding pressure (−0.3). Template cadence: repeated "he + past-tense verb" stems across six consecutive sentences mid-story (−0.5). Artifacts touch the closure beat ("vulnerable, yet eternal"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8. Total deductions approach −1.4 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The cosmic-janitor-finds-meaning premise is a familiar template (solitary observer in space station learns spiritual lesson) without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−0.8 for derivative premise). The yellow lantern glass and star-tracing method offer surface novelty, but the emotional arc—loneliness to epiphany—follows a predictable trajectory. No bold structural risk or synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight; the piece prioritizes lyric decoration over ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Cosmic janitor is present throughout but makes no choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Elias observes, empathizes, and arrives at a realization without agency-driven turns. Setup and closure participation are met, but middle development (a decision under pressure) is absent. The role is ornamental to the thematic work rather than causal. Cap at 3.4 (missing middle development); adjust down slightly for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Yellow lantern glass appears in three beats: retrieval from shelf, alignment at dome apex, and being set aside at closure. It enables the star-tracing method and is present in the final image, meeting all three gates. However, its function could be replaced by any optical device with minor edits; specificity (harvested from supernova, amber glow) does not constrain choice. Closure linkage (+0.9) and beat involvement (+0.9) lift the score, but swappability (−0.5) and lack of unique causal pressure prevent entry to the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Flourishing stillness is named once in the mid-story reflection and echoed in "flourish in surrender," but it does not shape stakes, alter tactics, or change options on the page. The concept functions as thematic label rather than active constraint. Missing setup, missing middle development, and missing closure participation. Present only as abstract claim.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Spiritually curious is declared in paragraph three ("spiritually curious by nature") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. Elias's ritual is consistent with curiosity, yet the trait could be removed without altering the plot. Label-only use (−0.3); no tradeoff demonstrated. Cap at 3.8 (swappable with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Empathize is present in the star-tracing beats and the memory sequence, driving the middle section. It appears in setup (spiritual curiosity frames it), development (tracing paths, feeling isolation), and closure (tears, forehead to glass). However, the empathy does not force a trade-off or alter Elias's options; he could swap it for "observe" or "contemplate" with minimal edits. Two-beat involvement (+0.9) and closure linkage (+0.7) reach ~5.7, but swappability (−0.5) and lack of causal pressure prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tracing the path of falling stars is signaled early (paragraph nine) and enacted across multiple beats: aligning the lantern, following trajectories, finger on glass. The method shapes the middle action and is present in the closure ritual. Three-beat involvement (+1.4), causal pressure (enables empathy, +0.8), and closure linkage (+0.9) combine for strong integration. Swappability is low; the story's logic depends on this exact method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Shooting star tracking station provides the spatial frame and supplies the yellow lantern glass (relic shelf) and observatory dome, affecting the method. Setup, development (tools used), and closure (dome setting) are met. However, the station is largely postcard description; it does not constrain Elias's choices or impose logistical pressure. Micro-setting (glass, dome) does more work than the macro. Three gates met but causal pressure is mild; score in the 5.0–6.9 band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Through the hush of an overlooked era is atmospheric dressing with no temporal constraint on Elias's actions. Time does not tighten decisions, and the "overlooked era" could be any period. Missing setup clarity (when is this?), missing middle development (no clock), and missing closure participation. Present only as mood.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>To find strength in vulnerability is declared as motivation (paragraph five: "urged him to seek strength") and returns in the penultimate epiphany. Setup and closure participation are met, but middle development is absent—Elias does not face a choice where vulnerability and strength compete with felt cost. The motivation is told and then confirmed, not dramatized with friction. Two-of-three gates allow eligibility to ~6.0, but lack of on-page conflict (−0.8) and summary-only treatment (−0.5) lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Primal elegance appears as diction throughout ("primal elegance of a shadow," "primal rite," "primal elegance" reprised near closure) and modulates with Elias's emotional arc, maintaining coherence. The tone charges the final image ("quiet power—vulnerable, yet eternal"). Setup, development (sustained register), and closure participation are met. However, the tone is more consistent than dynamic; it does not shift decisively under pressure. Three gates met with closure linkage (+0.9) place the score in the upper 5s.</comment>
