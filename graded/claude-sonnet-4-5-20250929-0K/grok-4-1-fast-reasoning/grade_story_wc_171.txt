<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("burned deep: to anchor ideals in practice") but never tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The delegates receive operatively gentle micro-targeting ("Lord Kael, your son's grave…"), yet these appeals feel mechanical rather than embodied in Elara's internal conflict. The spectral vision of the boy arrives as ornamental guilt rather than a lived contradiction that shapes her final choice. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("trembling hand," "quiet ache") without character-particular embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; no penalty applies. The closure unit—delegates signing, Elara's blood-seal, peace blooming—reads as Decisive Change under a Causal lens, but the cost ("what was forever lost," spectral boy) is asserted rather than made legible through a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift on the page. The boy's vision and Elara's palm-press occur, but no prior scene establishes what she sacrifices beyond abstract redemption. One meaningful tightening (ritual invoked, delegates approached) is present, but the final image deflates into summary ("Forever War stuttered to silence") rather than a charged particular.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The terrace, midsummer zenith, and celestial bodies anchor setting early and return at closure ("resuming celestial waltz"). The ritual braziers and altar slab constrain the signing sequence, satisfying micro-setting involvement. Sensory detail is vivid but often ornamental ("velvet sky," "scars on porcelain skin") rather than filtered through Elara's professional or emotional priorities. Spatial choreography remains clear across the ascent and assembly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—ending the Forever War—is signaled early and remains coherent. One tightening occurs when Elara lights the braziers and delegates approach, but escalation relies on summary ("one by one") rather than a dramatized reversal that narrows options. The spectral boy's appearance is ornamental; it does not alter Elara's tactics or force a visible trade-off. Cost at closure is told ("life's blood sealing") without showing what tactical path or relationship she forecloses.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—redemption's price—emerges through repeated images (clipboard, spectral boy, blood-seal) but resolves into direct statement: "redemption purchased not in gold but in the quiet ache of what was forever lost." The final paragraph explains rather than leaving a resonant image. The clipboard's sigils and Elara's palm-press offer concrete anchors, yet the piece telegraphs its thesis ("anchor ideals in practice") in prompt-like language rather than trusting the enacted ritual to carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara. Diction drifts into elevated register ("operatively gentle," "flawed beauty," "celestial waltz") that exceeds the narrator's established lexicon and repeats as template phrases. The dialogue snippet ("To muster peace…") reads as thesis delivery rather than goal-driven speech. Perceptual signature is thin; Elara's interior does not show a distinct way of noticing under pressure. No head-hopping, but the voice feels generic rather than character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "reluctant lover," "velvet sky," "flawed beauty" recur as decorative tags without pattern-teaching or payoff. Mixed metaphors appear ("cracks spiderwebbing… like scars on porcelain skin" conflates spider/scar vehicles). Paraphrase loops: "operatively gentle" appears three times in identical phrasing; "flawed beauty" recurs without added meaning. Template cadence: "She was… her name… Now, in this…" runs across opening paragraphs. Filter-verb stacks dilute immediacy ("said to bind," "casting shadows that danced"). Deductions: density −0.6, coherence −0.4, loops −0.4, template −0.5; artifacts touch closure ("flawed beauty redeemed"), triggering −1.7 total and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Core premise—ancient ritual peace negotiation—follows a familiar template (lone mediator, symbolic site, blood oath) without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Operatively gentle" and "flawed beauty" function as prompt labels rather than specifics that alter choice. The spectral boy and blood-seal echo standard redemption arcs. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece adheres to a median, safe path. Derivative premise guardrail applies: −1.0 for close match to writing templates without sufficient transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role as negotiator frames the ritual. She lights braziers and addresses delegates by name, shaping two beats (setup, middle appeal). However, her final choice (palm-press blood-seal) is not causally driven by a prior on-page decision that altered tactics; it reads as ceremonial conclusion. The spectral vision does not change her approach. Two gates (setup, middle) are met; closure participation is ornamental rather than decisive. Mid-band: functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ebony clipboard appears in three beats: Elara clutches it on ascent, places it on the altar, opens it to reveal sigils. It enables the signing sequence and returns at the end ("now heavy with history's weight"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the clipboard's properties (polished surface, etched ghosts, yellowed pages) do not constrain a choice or shift tactics; it serves as prop rather than active constraint. Solid lyric reprise with reweighted meaning, but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"The price of redemption" is declared in the setup ("Yet redemption came at a price") and returns at closure ("her redemption purchased… in the quiet ache"). It shapes the dominant stake. However, the concept is told rather than dramatized through a visible trade-off; Elara's blood-seal and spectral vision are ornamental gestures without showing what tactical path or relationship she forecloses. The concept echoes as theme but does not change on-page options or tactics. One key turn (ritual invocation), but cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Operatively gentle" is introduced early and repeated three times: "steps operatively gentle," "operatively gentle demeanor," "operatively gentle resolve." Each mention is label-only; the trait does not constrain an action or force a visible trade-off. Elara's soft voice and gentle tide metaphor describe rather than enable/disable a choice. Setup gate met; development and payoff are ornamental. Swappable with "diplomatic" or "measured" without structural impact. Cap at 3.8 for swappability; deduct −0.2 for label-only pattern.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Muster" appears twice: Elara says "To muster peace" in dialogue, then "She mustered them now" when calling delegates forward. The second use drives the middle beat (delegates approach and sign), shaping one key turn. However, the action is swappable with "summon," "gather," or "rally" without altering structure. Setup and development gates met; closure participation is indirect (delegates' approach leads to signing). One beat involvement with modest causal pressure, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Ritual significance" is signaled early ("ritual significance of this night," "stones said to bind oaths"), shapes the middle beat (lighting braziers, invoking sigils), and directly enables the closure (blood oath, signatures). Three gates met. The ritual's mechanics—braziers, altar, sigils, blood-warmed ink—constrain the delegates' approach and Elara's final act. The terrace's binding property is declared ("bind oaths with starfire") but not tested; still, the ritual framework is indispensable to the signing sequence. Two beats plus closure linkage with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ancient terrace at midsummer is established early ("perched atop Mount Elysara," "midsummer's zenith," "midsummer's terrace had hosted parleys") and returns at closure ("that ancient terrace of midsummer's grace"). The setting supplies resources (altar, braziers, ritual history) that enable the signing sequence, satisfying development and payoff gates. However, the terrace does not pressure a choice or create a tactical constraint; it functions as atmospheric stage. The midsummer timing (timeframe H) does more work than the terrace itself. Solid setup and closure reprise, but mid-range causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"The slow dance of celestial bodies" is introduced early ("during the slow dance… planets aligning") and returns twice: "constellations wheeled overhead," "celestial bodies halted their dance for a breath," "resuming celestial waltz." The timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; it serves as lyric backdrop. No character checks a clock or adjusts tactics based on the alignment. Setup and payoff gates met through reprise, but no middle development constraint. Lyric resonance present, but no live pressure on choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To anchor ideals in practice" is declared as Elara's motivation in the setup ("Her motivation burned deep: to anchor ideals in practice") and echoed at closure ("ideals at last earthed in practice"). The desire frames her role but is never dramatized through a friction between wants and costs. Elara does not face a choice where anchoring ideals conflicts with another goal; her path is linear ceremony. Setup and payoff gates met; no middle conflict. Told-only motivation without on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Flawed beauty" appears four times as a repeated label: "flawed beauty of a place," "danced like flawed beauties," "a flawed beauty redeemed," "Elara smiled—a flawed beauty." The tone is asserted rather than modulated through turns. Each use is ornamental description; the phrase does not shift meaning or charge the final image with new pressure. Setup gate met; no development or payoff transformation. Swappable descriptor without tonal work. Deduct −0.3 for label-only pattern and −0.2 for final-third ornamental use.</comment>
