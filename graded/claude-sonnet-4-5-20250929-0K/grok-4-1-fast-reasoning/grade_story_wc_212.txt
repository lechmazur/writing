<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "discover the texture of borrowed time" is stated clearly but her interior landscape remains largely abstract—"wild serenity," "furiously tranquil"—without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The physical embodiment is present (trembling fingers, silver braids tugged by wind) but peaks lean on oxymoronic labels rather than showing her torn between preservation and risk through micro-choices. The final smile and readiness feel declared rather than earned by visible cost that forecloses a prior path. No secondary character pressure on the page to test status dynamics or relationship friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: starlight intensifies, seeds germinate in reverse, entropy yields through a pattern of magical actions culminating in hand-plunged-into-vortex. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (seeds bursting, atrium thawing, vortex stabilized) but the cost is vague—what exactly did Elara sacrifice or foreclose? The phrase "borrowed time would snap back, erasing her lineage's extended years" sets stakes, yet the ending offers triumphant greening without visible price paid on the page. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the egg-hatching opener). One meaningful deepening occurs when she positions the cap and chants, but the final image ("ready to save not just seeds, but eternities") reads as assertion rather than felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The icebound atrium under starlight is vividly anchored: glass dome, frost-laced arches, vines with acorns, prismatic halos, suspended snowflakes. Sensory details are filtered through Elara's seed-saver priorities (packets frozen in pods, heart-tree roots). The oak acorn cap functions as micro-setting constraint: its ridged dome and runes focus starlight into coherence, directly enabling the reopening ritual. The cap's physical properties (opening aligned like a lens, twisted like a valve) shape her method and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for environment/tool constraint on choice and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: reopen the vortex or lose the lineage's borrowed time. One tightening occurs when Elara positions the cap and places seeds to bind the vortex's edges, narrowing the path to a single ritual method. Yet the escalation is largely procedural—she performs steps without visible tradeoff or a moment where she must choose between competing goods. The ending declares victory ("proving preservation's triumph over decay") without showing what she gave up or what path she foreclosed. Accumulative lens allows this, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus entropy emerges through concrete images: heirloom seeds, frozen vines, the vortex fraying at its edges. The oak acorn cap and seeds-in-reverse function as non-literal nodes of order combating disorder. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement: "proving preservation's triumph over decay" and "ready to save not just seeds, but eternities" sound more like prompt echo than earned resonance. The texture-of-borrowed-time motif ("viscous as honeyed fog, threaded with the pulse of unlived springs") is vivid but arrives late and is narrated rather than shown through a choice it complicates. No overt moralizing, but thematic closure leans on assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elara with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (seed-saver lexicon: "botanical relics," "heart-tree," "genetic precision") but diction drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "furiously tranquil guardian of time's heirlooms," "the gritty silk of moments pilfered from infinity." Oxymoronic phrases ("furious tranquility," "serene fury," "wild serenity") repeat without modulation under pressure, flattening rather than intensifying voice. Filter verbs are sparse. Narrative distance is consistent but lacks embodied texture in peak beats—Elara's perception during the vortex plunge is told in lyric abstraction ("viscous as honeyed fog") rather than immediate sensory grounding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: nearly every sentence in the ritual sequence stacks metaphor or oxymoron ("furiously tranquil," "wild serenity," "serene fury," "gritty silk"), triggering density and register penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "furiously tranquil" recurs three times without added meaning; "borrowed time" and "entropy" cycle through synonym variants (decay, dissolution, disorder molecules). Template cadence is present in the chant sequence: "She positioned… she began… she placed… she poured…" across four consecutive sentences. Line-level clarity survives but propulsion is sluggish. Final image ("ready to save not just seeds, but eternities") abstracts rather than concretizes. Aggregate artifacts in peak beats warrant −1.2 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Core premise—heirloom seed saver uses botanical order to stabilize a temporal vortex—synthesizes fresh elements (seed inheritance meeting time magic). Yet execution leans on familiar beats: magical ritual performed, entropy defeated, protagonist triumphant without visible sacrifice. The oak acorn cap as concentrator of order is a specific touch, but the emotional arc (discover texture of borrowed time → plunge hand into vortex → smile, ready to save eternities) follows a template resolution without friction or non-obvious cost. Oxymoronic phrasing ("furiously tranquil," "wild serenity") repeats as ornament rather than transforming tropes. No close echo of famous lines, but the thematic endpoint ("preservation's triumph over decay") reads generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara frames the story, kneels beside the hatched egg, and performs each step of the ritual: positioning the cap, chanting, placing seeds, twisting the valve, plunging her hand into the vortex. Her choices drive all major beats (middle ritual, final plunge). Setup is immediate (first paragraph), development spans the middle third (cap positioning, seed placement), and she is causally active at closure (hand inside vortex, atrium thawing). Cost is stated (inheritance reopened, time saved) but not visibly traded—what did she give up? The decision to reopen is never shown in friction with an alternative path. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but swappability is moderate (another magical practitioner could perform similar steps) and the cost is conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The oak acorn cap appears in paragraph 9 ("She reached into her cloak, withdrawing the oak acorn cap"), is described with specific properties (ridged dome, runes, concentrator of order), is handled in the ritual (aligned like a lens, twisted like a valve), and is clutched at the ending ("the cap clutched tight"). Three distinct beats: withdrawal/description, ritual use (focusing starlight, twisting to bind rifts), final grip. Setup by ~40%, development in the climax, payoff at closure. Causal pressure is strong: without the cap's lens function, the starlight cannot focus and the vortex cannot reopen. Specificity is high (its ridges, runes, and valve-twist are unique). Cost linkage is indirect—cap enables success but no tradeoff is shown. Irreplaceability is moderate (another focusing tool might substitute, though the text claims this one drank starlight and wove structure).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Vortex inheritance frames the inciting event (egg hatches, releasing a hatchling vortex) and the stakes (reopen or borrowed time snaps back). It is named in paragraph 2, shapes the middle beats (vortex shrinking, entropy clawing its edges), and the climax centers on reopening it. Setup is immediate, development is continuous (Elara's ritual targets the vortex's fraying), and closure depends on it (vortex expands, stabilizes, grants access to borrowed time). Causal pressure is present: the concept defines what Elara must do. However, the vortex itself is largely passive—Elara acts on it rather than it resisting or complicating her method. Specificity is high (vortex as inherited temporal rift), but the mechanics are told rather than tested (no failed attempt, no mid-course friction). Cost is declared but not shown in tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" and cognates ("wild serenity," "serene fury," "furious tranquility") appear six times as labels for the vortex's state and Elara's emotional stance. Setup is early (paragraph 2 and 6), but the attribute never constrains or enables a specific on-page action with cost. It describes mood and metaphysics ("calm rage of ordered winds") without altering Elara's choices—she does not choose one tactic over another because of this quality. No development beat where the attribute complicates her method. At closure, "furiously tranquil guardian" is applied to the stabilized vortex but remains ornamental. Swappability is high: the story's logic would hold if the vortex were simply "powerful" or "conflicted." Label-only use across all appearances.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reopen" is the explicit goal stated in paragraph 11 ("the inheritance demanded reopening") and paragraph 18 describes the vortex reopening: "The vortex expanded, reopening with a sigh… its maw now wide enough to glimpse swirling eras beyond the ice." This moment is the story's decisive turn—before it, the vortex is shrinking and inheritance is threatened; after it, Elara gains access to borrowed time and the atrium thaws. Setup by the inciting egg-hatch (inheritance must reopen or snap back), development through the ritual (cap, seeds, starlight focus all aim to reopen), and payoff at the climax. Causal pressure is strong: the entire ritual sequence exists to achieve this action. Specificity is high (reopening a sealed temporal vortex, not a generic door). Cost linkage is indirect—the action succeeds without showing what Elara sacrificed to achieve it. Not easily swappable; removing "reopen" would require rewriting the core conflict.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"By decreasing entropy" is named in paragraph 14 as the method: "Chanting… she began the method: by decreasing entropy, invoking the cap's power to reverse the swirl's fraying threads." The next paragraphs show starlight refracting, seeds germinating in reverse to "draw chaos inward," and "entropy yielded." Mechanics are signaled mid-story and visibly shape the climax: the cap channels order, seeds act as nodes of inherited order, and the vortex's edges are knit tight. Setup arrives at ~60% (late but before the final third), development spans two beats (starlight intensification, seed placement), and payoff is direct (entropy yields, vortex reopens). Causal pressure is moderate: the method enables success, but no failed attempt or alternative tactic is shown. Specificity is high (decreasing entropy via botanical and stellar order is unique to this premise). Swappability is low within the story's logic. Late signal (−0.3) and summary-heavy execution (−0.3) apply.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The icebound atrium under starlight is established in paragraph 3 and recurs throughout: glass dome piercing the night sky, starlight casting prismatic halos, frost-laced arches, frozen vines, suspended snowflakes. Starlight is causally essential—paragraph 13 describes Elara positioning the cap to focus starlight into "a beam of pure coherence," and paragraph 15 notes "The starlight intensified, refracting through the icebound panes." The setting provides both constraint (ice, stasis) and resource (starlight as focusing medium). At closure, the atrium thaws in patches and seeds burst under starlight, proving the environment's transformation. Setup is immediate, development involves the cap-as-lens using the dome's starlight, and payoff is environmental change (thaw, verdant growth). Spatial choreography is clear (vortex in atrium center, cap positioned above it, seeds around rim). Specificity is high (this exact configuration of ice, glass, and starlight enables the ritual). Cost is environmental rather than personal—atrium shifts from frozen to thawed.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the egg hatches" is established in the opening line and frames the inciting event. Paragraph 11 adds urgency: "The egg had hatched precisely now, under this starlit convergence, signaling the inheritance demanded reopening, or all borrowed time would snap back." However, no on-page clock tracks how much time Elara has or how it tightens her decisions. The ritual unfolds in a continuous sequence without time pressure dramatized—no countdown, no fatigue, no race against dawn or vortex collapse rate. Setup is immediate, but development is absent (no middle beat where time constraint alters her tactics), and closure does not hinge on a deadline met or missed. The convergence is declared but not felt. Swappability is high: the story's logic would hold if the egg hatched "at midnight" or "during the solstice" without affecting her choices. Functional setup only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to discover the texture of borrowed time" is stated in paragraph 5 and recurs in paragraph 12 ("feel that texture firsthand, the gritty silk of moments pilfered from infinity"). Paragraph 19 fulfills it: "She plunged her hand inside, fingers brushing the texture of borrowed time—viscous as honeyed fog, threaded with the pulse of unlived springs and unharvested autumns." Setup is early, development is present (her ritual aims toward this tactile discovery), and payoff is explicit at closure. However, the desire is told rather than shown in friction—Elara never hesitates, weighs an alternative, or faces a cost tied to this specific want. The motivation drives her forward but does not conflict with a competing need or fear on the page. Specificity is high (tactile metaphysics is unique), but the lack of dramatized tension or tradeoff limits integration. Summary-only interiority (−0.4) and no visible cost tied to the want (−0.3) apply.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Wild serenity" is named in paragraph 2 and 8 as a quality of the vortex and Elara's emotional state, and recurs as "furiously tranquil," "serene fury," and "furious tranquility." The tone is consistent across beats—oxymoronic calm-in-chaos—but does not modulate with pressure. At the climax, the tone intensifies slightly ("furious tranquility amplified, the air humming with serene fury") but remains a static descriptive layer rather than charging the final image with new meaning. Closure ends on triumph ("Elara smiled… ready to save not just seeds, but eternities") which shifts away from the oxymoronic tension into straightforward confidence. Setup is early, development is label-repetition without deepening, and payoff does not reweight the tone's meaning. Swappability is moderate (the story would function with "calm determination" or "focused intensity"). Ornamental use with no constraint on choice.</comment>
