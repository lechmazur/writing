<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's prosopagnosia shapes her artistic method convincingly—she navigates blindness through "fractally precise strokes of posture, gesture, and light." Her motivation to craft the mirror array is clear, and the final choice to complete the work under demolition pressure shows agency. However, her internal experience remains somewhat declarative ("Her blindness, once a cage, freed her") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in peak moments. The renunciation of recognition ("recognizing none of their blurred faces, smiled inwardly") carries thematic weight but the cost feels more conceptual than viscerally dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Elara discovers the coin's encoded method, deciphers it, and crafts the mirror array under tightening time pressure, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the sky mirrored within, her limits transcended) with felt cost (the tree's demolition, her work's anonymity). Orientation anchors arrive within the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The escalation from discovery to craft to completion coheres, and the closure image—"the sky endured, fractally precise and eternal"—reweights the opening stake. One friction: the middle section leans heavily on reflective exposition about the guild's limits and Elara's artistic philosophy, which dilutes immediate scene pressure and delays the peak crafting beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is vividly particularized: "bark-lined shelves," "warped shelves, etched with centuries," "shallow channels into the inner bark." The knothole through which dawn sky enters directly enables the mirror array's function, constraining her work to available light and the tree's geometry. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the crafting sequence. The recurring sensory anchor of "hush" and the demolition crew's encroaching sounds modulate pressure effectively. Minor slip: the "velvet nest" and "optical experiments, silver leaf from restoration kits" feel slightly convenient rather than earned through prior spatial seeding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—craft a defiant sky-mirror before demolition—is signaled early and tightens as "the hush outside crescendoed to a held breath, the foreman's voice echoing faintly: 'Positions.'" Elara's agency drives the escalation: she deciphers the coin, gathers materials, and executes the fractally precise array under a live clock. The cost is visible: "Demolition's first tremor vibrated the floor," and she exits into "axes biting bark." The guild's abandoned ambition provides historical contrast that sharpens her achievement. One soft edge: the material-gathering beat ("scavenged guild tools—tiny mirrors from optical experiments, silver leaf from restoration kits") compresses convenience into a list, undercutting the sense of obstacle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—discovering and transcending limits—emerges organically from Elara's prosopagnosia, the guild's historical failure, and the mirror array's fractal recursion. The final image, "the sky endured, fractally precise and eternal," answers the thematic question through concrete craft rather than stated moral. The coin's nested indentations become both method and metaphor without over-signaling. Subtext operates in her smile at the appraisers' ignorance: "invisible truths etched beyond sight." One small slip: the phrase "her limits discovered, then transcended in this craft" inches toward thematic echo, though it remains tied to the on-page action of completing the array.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtered through Elara's face-blind perception ("faces interchangeable smears," "blurred faces"). Diction occasionally elevates beyond immediate crisis register—"fractally precise," "prosopagnosia," "bilateral symmetry"—reading more expository than character-urgent in peak moments. The perceptual signature is consistent: she sees "patterns where others saw faces." Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the crafting sequence, tightening as tools click into place. One friction: the middle reflective block ("The guild had faltered here, their scholarly minds too rigid for fractal chaos; faces, with their bilateral symmetry, had blinded them") shifts into essayistic analysis that flattens voice texture under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is generally high, and the opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Sentence rhythm varies, though several beats repeat "fractally precise" as a talisman (five instances) without functional variation. The phrase "heightened stillness" appears three times, and "hush" recurs without reweighting. Mid-story, synonym churn surfaces: "meticulous layers," "unflinching accuracy," "infinite detail" cycle through similar semantic space. The closure sequence tightens momentum, but earlier paragraphs stack filter verbs ("she sought," "she deciphered," "she confronted") and template stems ("Her fingers traced," "Her hands... moved," "Her blindness... freed her") that dull immediacy. One paraphrase loop: "Elara's breath slowed further, syncing with the tree's pulse" followed by "With scavenged guild tools... Elara began to craft" restates the transition without adding pressure. Apply −0.8 for template cadence, paraphrase, and stock-phrase recurrence across multiple beats; the artifacts touch the middle third but not the closure image itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of face blindness, fractal craft, and a living library offers a specific, non-obvious premise. The inversion—her disability as the key to transcending the guild's limits—feels earned by the coin's method and her artistic training. The final image of salvaged planks revealing "glimpses of that inner heaven" provides a fresh, oblique closure rather than explicit triumph. However, the core emotional arc—artist discovers secret, overcomes obstacle, completes masterwork under deadline—follows a familiar template. The metaphor of mirroring the sky risks abstraction without the fractal mechanics grounding it in craft. The piece transforms its materials through Elara's perceptual particularity, but the trajectory itself is not bold enough to escape mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's face blindness is seeded early, directly enables her fractal perception ("no distracting symmetries, only pure form"), and drives the peak crafting choice to complete the array without reliance on facial/bilateral symmetry. She deciphers the coin, gathers tools, and executes the installation—three distinct beats. The trait shapes tactics (her method of layering mirrors by "infinite detail" rather than symmetry) and charges the closure (she recognizes no faces but smiles inwardly at the unseen truth). Cost: her work remains anonymous, appraisers marvel at the "unknown artist's hand." Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage present; swappability low. Cap at 6.8 due to middle exposition that tells rather than dramatizes the contrast between her method and the guild's.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The secret book safe appears early ("a slim volume... betraying a secret book safe"), houses the coin that encodes the mirror method, and is resealed at the end ("The coin slipped back into its safe, the book resealed among tomes"). Two beats: discovery and return. The safe's placement within the condemned library sharpens the time pressure and connects to the guild's lost ambition. Closure linkage: the resealing punctuates Elara's departure and the tree's fall. Specificity: the "velvet nest" and the safe's alignment betray its hidden status. Minor friction: the return beat is efficient but does not reweight meaning beyond tidying; the safe functions primarily as a container rather than an active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Discovering limits" frames Elara's opening motivation ("discovering limits... the artist's boundary between creation and impossibility") and recurs explicitly at closure ("In discovering the guild's limit, and her own"). The concept shapes stakes: the guild failed due to rigid minds; Elara's prosopagnosia frees her from bilateral symmetry, enabling success. However, the concept is largely thematic overlay rather than a lived friction. The on-page action centers on deciphering and crafting; "limits" are declared more than tested through choices that pit one constraint against another. Cost connection is conceptual rather than visceral. Early signal and closure linkage present; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" appears throughout, directly constraining Elara's method: "fractally precise patterns," "fractally precise to refract the sky inward without distortion," "a millimeter's errancy would shatter the illusion into chaos," "fractally precise and eternal." The trait enables her work (her eye "thrived on such infinities") and differentiates her from the guild's failed attempts. Three beats: deciphering the coin's grooves, executing the mirror placement at exact angles (23.7 degrees, sub-mirrors halved in scale), and the closure image of flawless recursion. Cost: the demand for "unflinching accuracy" under time pressure, sweat unheeded. Early signal, causal pressure, closure charge, irreplaceability all strong. Minor friction: the phrase recurs five times without much variation, reading slightly formulaic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Craft" anchors every major turn: Elara's motivation ("to craft... a mirror of the sky"), deciphering the coin's method for "impossible reflections," gathering tools, executing the fractally precise installation, and the closure ("she had crafted not just sky, but a new vision unbound"). The act of crafting under demolition pressure is the story's spine. Cost: physical strain, time tightening, the tree's fall. The verb and its synonyms ("carving shallow channels," "layering mirrors," "affixing") recur across five beats, shaping tactics and escalation. Closure: the completed array endures; appraisers later marvel at the "unknown artist's hand." Early signal, irreplaceable, causal driver, closure participation all present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The centuries-old coin with "faint indentations... microscopic grooves spiraling in fractally precise patterns" is discovered early, deciphered mid-story ("the indentations mapped angles for a nested mirror array"), and directly enables the crafting method: "23.7 degrees," "sub-mirror halved in scale yet precise to the coin's nth indentation." The coin returns at closure ("The coin slipped back into its safe"). Three beats: discovery, decipherment, application. Specificity: the grooves encode guild knowledge; Elara's lens and artist's eye unlock them. Cost: the precision demanded by the coin's dictates risks "shatter[ing] the illusion into chaos." Mechanics matter; the coin is irreplaceable. Minor friction: the decipherment beat is efficient but slightly summarized rather than dramatized step-by-step.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is seeded immediately ("ancient oak, hollowed by the scholar's guild into a labyrinth of bark-lined shelves"), provides the physical canvas for the mirror array (channels carved into bark, knothole for sky access), and houses the coin and tools. The setting's condemnation creates the time pressure driving all choices. Three beats: entry and exploration, discovery of the safe, crafting within the trunk's geometry. The hollow's "curves" and "inner bark" constrain her installation; the knothole at a specific angle enables the first mirror's placement. Closure: the tree falls, planks scatter, yet the mirrored sky endures within salvaged wood. Specificity, causal pressure, closure linkage strong. No swappability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The timeframe—"hush just before... demolition"—is established in the opening line and tightens throughout: "dawn" entry, "murmuring outside like distant thunder held in check," "Timeframe tightened," "the hush outside crescendoed," "the foreman's voice... 'Positions,'" "Demolition's first tremor." The live clock constrains every choice: Elara deciphers quickly, gathers tools, executes with "unflinching accuracy" as tools clink and axes approach. Cost: sweat unheeded, no time for hesitation. Closure: she exits as "axes bit[e] bark." The clock is tracked and shapes tactics in at least four beats. Early signal, causal pressure, irreplaceable. Swappability zero; remove the deadline and the story loses its spine.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To mirror the sky inside walls" is Elara's stated motivation from the opening ("to craft... a mirror of the sky—a defiant eternity against the erasure") and recurs at closure ("the sky mirrored inside walls... endured"). The desire drives decipherment, gathering, and crafting. Friction: the motivation is earnest but faces little internal conflict—Elara never doubts or weighs competing wants. The guild's historical failure provides context, but Elara's path is linear devotion rather than torn choice. Cost is external (time, demolition) rather than a sacrifice of another desire. Early signal, beats involvement strong, closure linkage clear. However, "told-only" weakness: the want is declared more than tested through choices that force her to choose between this and something else she values.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Heightened stillness" appears three times and "hush" five times, establishing a coherent tone that modulates with demolition's approach: opening "profound stillness," middle "heightened stillness, with demolition crews murmuring," crescendo "the hush outside deepened," then rupture "She exited into the hush's rupture, axes biting bark." The tone charges the closure: "in memory's hollow, the stillness held her masterpiece aloft." However, the tone is somewhat static—stillness persists rather than transforming under pressure. The contrast between interior calm and exterior threat is present but could tighten further; mid-story exposition flattens the tonal arc. Early signal, closure linkage, modulation present; intensity shift moderate.</comment>
