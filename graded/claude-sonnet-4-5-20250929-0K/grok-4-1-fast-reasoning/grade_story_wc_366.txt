<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to protect the letter chain is legible and his observant nature is embodied in concrete actions (brushing pebbles, reading notes). However, the final choice—pocketing glass, writing a reply, rebuilding the stack—lacks visible cost or internal contradiction under pressure; it reads as a kind gesture rather than one that forecloses a path or forces a trade-off. Harlan's thinning frame and cough provide bodily markers, but his arc is compressed into exposition ("been leaving 'em for months") rather than dramatized choice. The piece achieves functional characterization but misses the contradictory-impulses-in-scene standard required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when promptly (Elias, lighthouse, storm night, lamp fails) and follows a causal thread: lamp dies → climb → discover stacks → read chain → Elias writes reply. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias's vow to protect the chain, articulated in his note and the rebuilt stack), and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layered letters, stone towers, the sea-glass talisman). However, the cost at closure is only implied—"his protection a silent vow"—without an on-page forfeiture, delay, or concrete price that alters his next move or relationship with Harlan. The final paragraph also contains visible text artifacts ("Wait, recount precisely later," "No, must hit 600-800," "[Over]") that break immersion and muddy the closure image, triggering the artifact-at-closure penalty. Under the Cost Proof Test, no exact sentence makes the price legible at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lantern room is vividly rendered—fog through cracked panes, iron grating, Fresnel lens, spectral moans—and the stone towers on the sill function as micro-setting that anchors the discovery and final action. Spatial choreography (skiff → stairs → lantern room) tracks clearly. However, the haunted atmosphere remains decorative; the "drowned souls" and "grasping fingers" threaten mood but do not constrain Elias's choices or alter his tactics. The sea glass and stacks charge the final image, lifting the score into the mid-6s, but the environment itself does not meet the Q3 9+ gate (constrain choice or charge closure).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the anonymous chain of safety amid isolation—is signaled early and coheres through the piece. Pressure tightens once: the lamp dies, forcing the climb and discovery, which prompts Elias's decision to add his own note. Under the Accumulative lens this qualifies as a meaningful deepening, and Elias's agency (writing, rebuilding) is on the page. However, the tightening does not foreclose a live option or impose a visible trade-off; Elias's choice is generous rather than costly, and Harlan's arc (confession, descent to shelter) is summarized rather than dramatized. The piece enters the 6-band for coherent pressure and one turn but lacks the felt price or second reversal typical of higher scores.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme—bottling the elusive glow of safety against isolation and spectral dread—emerges organically from the stone messages, sea glass, and lantern room without overt statement. The piece resists tidy morals and invites reflection on anonymous care and fragile solace. The final image (rebuilt stack, Elias's note: "Safety is the stone that doesn't fall, the glass that endures") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor weaknesses: "luminescent ache" appears as a label in the final line rather than being fully embodied in prior particulars, and Harlan's whispered confession edges toward thematic echo. Still, the thematic work is stronger than execution in other categories.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV on Elias is maintained without head-hopping, and his perceptual signature (warmly observant, tracing silhouettes, brushing formations) is consistent. Harlan's dialogue ("Pocket that," "Not mine first") carries regional brevity and subtext. However, the narration suffers from register drift: "luminescent ache," "abyssal black," "spectral moans" elevate diction beyond a supply skipper's idiom at peak moments, and the final paragraph's visible text artifacts ("Wait, recount precisely later," "No, must hit 600-800," "[Over]") are non-diegetic scaffolding that breaks voice and distance. The artifacts trigger the Q6 contamination penalty (−0.2) for voice integrity loss, compounding the diction issues.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The prose opens with vivid images ("waves clawed," "jagged cliffs," "dying heartbeat") and maintains clarity through most beats. However, the final paragraph disintegrates into visible generation artifacts: bracketed notes ("Wait, recount precisely later," "No, must hit 600-800," "[Over]"), false starts ("No—that exceeded," "Adjust," "But core intact"), and meta-commentary on word count. These scaffold fragments pervade the closure beat, obscuring the final image and violating the Text-Artifact rule. Applying the Patterned-Artifact Penalty Pack: baseline −1.4 for spread, escalated to −1.7 because artifacts touch closure, plus the disallow-9+ cap and 8.8 high-band cap. Minor additional issues: "luminescent ache" is abstract rather than concrete, and "bottle the feeling of safety" recurs as a phrase without embodied variation. Rounding down yields 4.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The anonymous letter chain in a haunted lighthouse combines familiar isolation/epistolary tropes with the specific detail of stone-stacking signals and sea glass as talisman, which lifts it above pure template. Elias's reticence and Harlan's solitary curation feel particular, and the concept of "bottling safety" is developed through concrete particulars (child's hand in fog, first spark at dusk). However, the premise closely tracks "lonely keeper finds solace in messages" templates, and the resolution—Elias adds his note, vows to protect—follows predictable beats without a non-obvious turn. The piece shows synthesis and care but does not transform its tropes enough to enter higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias (reticent lighthouse supply skipper) is established early, drives the discovery by climbing and reading, and makes the final choice to write and rebuild the stack. He is present across setup, middle, and closure (all three gates). However, his decision is observational and generous rather than one that constrains later action or imposes visible cost; his reticence does not create a meaningful friction or trade-off on the page. Under the band guidance: one beat (discovery) +0.4, closure linkage (writing note) +0.7, but swappability (a less reticent character could perform the same acts with minor edits) −0.6 and no causal pressure that narrows options −0.5. Starting from 3.0 baseline: +1.1 positive, −1.1 friction → ~3.0; lyric reprise and closure participation lift to mid-5s. Rounding down: 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sea glass appears at the discovery beat (nestled at the base of the tallest stack), is lifted and felt by Elias ("cool weight"), is named by Harlan ("Pocket that"), and returns in the final paragraph as "talisman" whose "luminescence" he carries. This covers all three gates (setup at discovery, development when pocketed, payoff in final image). Causal involvement: enables Elias's understanding of the chain's continuity and charges his resolve (+0.9 for two beats, +0.8 closure linkage, +0.5 specificity). However, the glass does not constrain a choice or impose a cost; it is symbolic rather than mechanically decisive, limiting upward reach. Starting from 3.0: +2.2 positive, −0.4 ornamental at closure (not causally active, only reprised) → ~4.8; lyric resonance and charged reprise lift to upper 6s. Rounding down: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The anonymous letter chain is introduced at ~40% (Harlan's gesture to the stacks, Elias unfolds notes), fully explicated in the middle (Elias reads all notes, learns the history), and drives the closure (Elias writes his reply, rebuilds the stack taller). All three gates are met. The concept shapes stakes (preserving the chain) and tactics (Elias's choice to add his note, his vow to protect), and the final action would collapse without it. Causal pressure: the chain is the premise of Elias's protection vow (+1.2), closure linkage strong (+1.4), irreplaceability high (+0.7). Late first appearance (second third) −0.3. Starting from 3.0: +3.3 positive, −0.3 late → ~6.0; strong causal and closure work lift to low 7s. Rounding down: 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Elias is described as "warmly observant" in the opening and his observation is embodied in several beats: tracing the silhouette, noting Harlan's thinning frame without comment, scanning shadows, brushing pebbles. Setup gate met. However, the attribute does not constrain or enable a key choice with visible cost; it flavors his actions but is swappable with "attentive" or "perceptive" without structural change. No middle friction or closure cost tied specifically to warmth or observation. One beat (noting stacks) +0.4, specificity low (label-only in peak beats) −0.6, swappability −0.5. Starting from 3.0: +0.4, −1.1 → ~2.3; early signal +0.3 and consistent embodiment lift to mid-4s, but missing development and closure participation caps at 4.6 per gate model. Rounding down: 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The action "protect" is announced late (Elias: "But this... I'll protect it") and enacted in the final beat (pocketing glass, writing note, rebuilding stack as protection). Setup gate missed (not signaled in first third), development gate missed (no middle attempt to protect), payoff gate met (drives the ending). With only one gate, the element is capped at ~2.8 per the gate model; however, the action is causally central to the closure and irreplaceable (the final choice is explicitly framed as protection). Closure linkage strong (+1.4), causal pressure moderate (+0.8), but late introduction (final third) −0.9 and summary-only in Harlan's arc (Elias protects by leaving, not dramatized struggle) −0.5. Starting from 3.0: +2.2, −1.4 → ~3.8; closure centrality lifts to low 6s despite gates. Rounding down: 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stone-stacking as messages is introduced at the discovery (~40%: "a code he'd glimpsed on rocky shores"), examined closely (Elias pries open the core, reads the folded paper), and drives the closure (he rebuilds the stack taller, embedding his note). All three gates met. The method shapes tactics (how the chain is continued) and is mechanically specific (precarious tilt, wax-sealed notes hidden at the core). Causal pressure: the method is the premise of Elias's final action (+1.2), closure linkage strong (+1.2), specificity high (+0.6). Late first appearance (second third) −0.3. Starting from 3.0: +3.0, −0.3 → ~5.7; strong mechanical and closure work lift to low 7s. Rounding down: 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room is established early (climb after lamp dies, fog through cracked panes, iron grating, spectral moans) and is the sole location for the discovery and closure. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate met (the room houses the stone towers and pressures the characters with cold and legend). However, the haunted quality remains atmospheric; the spectral threat does not constrain Elias's choices or alter his tactics. The room's micro-setting (stone sill, towers) charges the final image moderately. Two beats (discovery, closure) +0.9, closure linkage moderate (+0.6), but no causal constraint −0.7. Starting from 3.0: +1.5, −0.7 → ~3.8; consistent presence and charged final image lift to mid-6s. Rounding down: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the lamp flickers out" is established in the opening beats (lamp snuffs, plunging coast into black; climb occurs immediately after) and anchors the entire sequence. Setup gate met, development met (the darkness frames the discovery), payoff met (dawn's first gleam marks closure). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions; Elias and Harlan have the entire night, and no clock or urgency forces a faster move. Time is tracked loosely ("As dawn bled gray") rather than used as live pressure. One beat (darkness frames climb) +0.4, closure participation (dawn marks end) +0.5, but no constraint on tactics −0.8. Starting from 3.0: +0.9, −0.8 → ~3.1; consistent anchoring lifts to upper 5s. Rounding down: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to bottle the feeling of safety" is articulated explicitly at ~60% (Harlan: "to bottle the feeling of safety... protecting fragile souls from the void") and drives Elias's closure choice (he writes of safety, rebuilds the stack, vows to protect it). Setup gate missed (motivation not signaled early as Elias's own), development gate met (Harlan's confession reframes the stakes), payoff gate met (Elias enacts the motivation). The desire is dramatized in Elias's final actions but told rather than shown to be conflicted; no visible cost or trade-off between wants. Causal pressure moderate (+0.9), closure linkage strong (+1.2), but late explicit framing −0.5 and told-only internal conflict −0.6. Starting from 3.0: +2.1, −1.1 → ~4.0; strong closure work lifts to upper 6s. Rounding down: 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The tone "luminescent ache" is named explicitly in the second half ("the luminescent ache of the darkened room," final line "luminescent ache of safety preserved") and is evoked through images of faint glimmers (lamp's dying heartbeat, lantern casting pools, sea glass's frosted glow) against darkness and dread. Setup gate partial (glimmers present early but the phrase appears late), payoff gate met (the phrase charges the final image). However, tone is asserted via the label rather than fully built through rhythm and image alone, and the final paragraph's text artifacts break tonal coherence. One beat (darkened room ache) +0.4, closure linkage moderate (+0.6), label-only at closure −0.6, artifacts in final third −0.4. Starting from 3.0: +1.0, −1.0 → ~3.0; lyric reprise lifts to low 5s. Rounding down: 5.1.</comment>
