<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's "emotionally rational" trait is repeatedly labeled rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The silent weeping while cataloging ledgers gestures at embodied conflict, but most decisions flow linearly without visible internal friction. The grandfather revelation arrives late and adds motivation by assertion rather than complicating prior choices. His final sense of wholeness reads as declared rather than earned through on-page renunciation or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a causal lens: Elias pursues the letter, decodes microscript, finds corroborating ledgers, and resolves to publish. Orientation anchors quickly (historian, station, after petal drop). However, the closure—walking away with the letter, promising future publication—defers the decisive change off-page. The cost (exposing national shame, completing family legacy) is told in future tense rather than enacted now, weakening the on-page closure effect required at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ivy-choked station, rusted locker, and bare rosebush provide vivid, purposeful detail that mirrors thematic decay and supports atmosphere. The illuminated letter's microscript and ledgers are handled concretely. However, spatial choreography remains generic (platform, waiting room, tunnel) without tactical constraint; Elias moves freely without the environment narrowing options or complicating his retrieval, keeping setting from charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing buried truth—is signaled early and pursued through discovery, decoding, and archival corroboration. One meaningful tightening occurs when microscript reveals the gas-canister secret, raising moral and familial cost. Yet escalation remains primarily epistemic (knowledge accumulation) without a tactical dilemma or on-page reversal that forces Elias to trade competing goods; he obtains everything he seeks without visible sacrifice, muting pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The noble-lies theme is overtly stated in multiple beats ("noble deceptions," "pit of lies," Hale's confession, modern parallels) rather than emerging through image and action. The ivy-as-deceit metaphor is spelled out rather than resonant. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "noble lies crumble when truth is recaptured," replacing scene pressure with thesis statement. The rosebush nod and emotional wholeness are asserted, not earned through a non-literal final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent access to Elias's perceptions. Diction is controlled and historically inflected ("vellum," "calligraphed missive," "microscript"). However, register occasionally drifts into abstract academic phrasing ("emotionally rational guardian of forgotten rails") that flattens urgency. Sentence stems repeat across paragraphs ("He lifted," "He drew parallels," "He ventured," "He emerged"), creating template cadence that dulls rhythmic variation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Clarity is generally high, but significant paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs restate the noble-lies concept and parallel-drawing method with synonym churn ("noble deceptions," "pit of lies," "noble lie," "lies' noble shroud"). Template cadence runs across multiple beats ("Elias [verbed]...He [verbed]..."). The phrase "drawing parallels" recurs mechanically in four separate paragraphs without added nuance. These artifacts accumulate beyond the −0.8 non-closure cap, totaling roughly −1.2, and touch the penultimate paragraphs near closure, triggering the 9+ disqualification and high-band cap at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The fictional-historian-discovers-war-secret premise follows a familiar template without fresh transformation. The ivy/lies metaphor, illuminated letter with hidden text, and WWI gas-attack cover-up are stock mystery elements executed competently but predictably. The "emotionally rational" label and modern-parallels method are asserted rather than demonstrated through non-obvious choices. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the arc proceeds along expected beats without surprising synthesis or hindsight inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias (fictional historian) drives all major beats: travels to station, retrieves letter, decodes microscript, finds ledgers, resolves to publish. Present in setup, middle discovery, and ending. However, most choices are epistemic (interpreting evidence) rather than forcing tactical dilemma or visible tradeoff; he succeeds without renouncing a competing path. Closure cost is future-tense promise, not on-page decision. Two gates solid, closure linkage weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The illuminated letter appears in setup (discovery on bench), development (microscript decoding reveals gas secret), and ending (letter in satchel, safe, will expose lies). Handled physically in at least two beats. Reweighted from historical artifact to proof of war crime. However, the letter does not constrain Elias's choices—he obtains it easily and it does not force a moral calculus or tactical sacrifice. Essential but not indispensable; swappable with another document type.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Noble lies" frames the dominant stake (rescue truth from deceptions) and is present throughout: Hale's manifests, gas-canister cover-up, modern parallels, final thesis. Shapes middle discovery when microscript rewrites the letter's meaning. However, the concept is asserted via exposition and moralizing rather than constraining a live on-page choice between competing goods (e.g., publish vs. protect). Theme-heavy, pressure-light; present in closure but as stated argument, not dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Emotionally rational" is labeled in paragraph three and invoked at the ledger beat ("wept silently...even as logic cataloged") and the ending ("emotionally rational guardian"). Does not constrain a choice with visible tradeoff; the trait is described rather than tested through a decision where emotion and logic pull Elias in conflicting directions with felt cost. Present in three mentions but ornamental, functioning as character summary rather than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Recapture" (truth) is the explicit motivation driving all major beats: pursuit, decoding, archival search, and planned publication. Signaled early, developed through evidence accumulation, and closure hinges on "truth rescued from lies' noble shroud." However, "recapture" is interchangeable with "recover," "reveal," or "expose"—no unique mechanics. The action succeeds without dramatized opposition or forfeiture; Elias reclaims everything he seeks. Two gates strong, specificity and cost weak.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Drawing parallels" is named explicitly in five beats: Roman censors, postwar narratives, modern conflicts, ivy/lies metaphor, and the ending's mental etch. However, the method is described rather than enacted with unique mechanics that alter his approach. The parallels are thematic assertions, not tactical tools that enable discovery or force a choice. Present throughout but functionally ornamental—swappable with "analyzing" or "connecting" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The disused railway station (ivy-choked, rusted, forgotten post-WWI spur) is present in setup, all discovery beats, and ending departure. Provides vivid atmospheric detail and thematic mirroring (decay, concealment). However, the setting does not constrain Elias's movements or complicate retrieval; he accesses waiting room, tunnel, and locker without spatial friction or resource trade-off. Postcard backdrop rather than tactical pressure. Two gates solid, causal work minimal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the final petal drops from the old rosebush" anchors the opening and recurs symbolically ("bare rosebush," "season of pretense ended," final nod). However, no live clock tightens decisions; Elias works at his own pace without urgency from vandals (mentioned once, never materialized) or temporal constraint. The petal-drop functions as lyric marker, not pressure device. Setup and lyric reprise present; middle development and escalation absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Rescue truth from a pit of lies" is stated early as singular motivation, drives discovery and decoding, and resolves in the ending's wholeness claim and publication promise. The grandfather revelation adds emotional friction mid-story. However, the motivation is declared rather than dramatized through on-page conflict between competing desires (e.g., protect vs. expose). Elias pursues one goal without visible renunciation or cost; his want does not conflict with fear or need in a charged beat.</comment>

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal. The story proceeds through because/therefore linkage: Elias seeks the letter → finds it → decodes microscript → retrieves corroborating ledgers → resolves to publish.

**Closure Assessment:** The ending defers the decisive change (publication, world's reaction) to future tense. The on-page closure is Elias driving away with the letter, feeling "whole" and promising "Tomorrow, the world would see." This reads as Charged Poise (options crystallized, stakes reconfigured) but the cost is conceptual and future-oriented rather than visibly paid now. Acceptable under the rubric's RR allowance, but the deferral weakens immediacy.

**Cross-Caps Applied:**
- Line-level artifacts (Q7 = 5.6, template cadence and loops touch near-closure beats) disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.
- No orientation debt; lens is clear by midpoint.
