<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivations remain abstract throughout; "to find the place where explanations fail" is declared but never grounded in concrete want versus fear. Her internal state is told via label ("obsession," "resolve") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The climax choice—pulling three hinges—reads mechanically without visible cost or foreclose; she emerges with bottled petrichor and vague transformation, no path closed. The expedition guardians appear as decorative exposition rather than forcing a stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural but collapses into linear summary with weak causality. Orientation is delayed (factory archive appears abruptly, no spatial anchor for cliffs until midpoint). The closure unit fails: Elara ascends with "newfound weight" and "hinged awakenings" but no decisive change, earned stasis, or conceptual repricing with on-page cost. The expedition transformation and guardian approval are told, not dramatized, and she simply continues her hobby enriched—no option foreclosed, no felt price paid in the final image. Causality breaks: psychometry visions gift the path and hinges without her earning knowledge through choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The subterranean lagoon and limestone cliffs arrive late (past midpoint) and function as postcard backdrop; "mirror of obsidian," "gothic hush," and bioluminescent algae are visually vivid but do not constrain choice. The moss-crusted hinges are spatial props that Elara pulls without risk or obstacle. The factory setting is a brief opening frame, abandoned without return. Sensory hierarchy is absent—Elara notices petrichor, mineral tears, and metallic tang in catalog fashion regardless of urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake—finding the realm beyond logic—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tested by opposition or trade-off. The compass visions gift Elara the solution; no reversal or tightening narrows her options. Pulling the three hinges occurs without friction; the expedition guardians approve her arrival rather than challenge it. The lagoon "claimed" the prior explorers but poses no threat to Elara. Resolution is passive: she collects essence, ascends, and continues her quest with "newfound weight" but no cost legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme—mystery beyond reason—is announced repeatedly in prompt-adjacent language ("where explanations fail," "hinged awakenings," "resonant hush") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes: "Explanations failed, as they should, yielding to mystery's embrace." The compass and petrichor recur as motifs but do not constrain choice or accumulate pressure; they are token symbolic objects. No earned wisdom arises from specific struggle; Elara's "hinged enlightenments" are asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable but diction drifts into elevated abstractions inconsistent with a laid-off factory worker ("sensibly eccentric logic," "communion with the place," "hinged enlightenments"). Perceptual signature is generic; Elara notices in catalog fashion without character-specific bias. Key moments are narrated as summary ("Awakening cascaded") rather than immediate experience. No dialogue. The final staccato fragments ("But wait, deeper callings lingered") break the established rhythm without voice-motivated purpose and read as generation artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Severe overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence in the lagoon beat carries figurative language ("mirror of obsidian," "gothic hush," "frozen waves," "metallic tang") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.6. Paraphrase loops pervade: "resonant hush" appears eight times; "hinged" recurs mechanically as stem in adjacent lines; "delve/delving/delved" cycles without added meaning. Template cadence runs from "Elara [verb]" structure across multiple beats (−0.5). The final third staccato ("She was home. But wait, deeper callings lingered.") contradicts prior rhythmic mode and obscures closure (−0.8 total for artifacts touching closure). Register drift into abstract diction ("communion," "translucent," "quiescent") clashes with POV lexicon (−0.4). Total artifact penalty −1.7 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—mystical underground discovery via psychic relic—is a template fantasy quest without fresh angle. Petrichor collector is a quirky occupation label that does not alter tactics or worldview. The compass psychometry, hinged levers, and guardian transformation are stock genre beats executed without specificity. Elara's journey could be recast with different names (crystal cave, ancient scroll, spirit guides) and the emotional arc would remain unchanged—fails transformation test. "Sensibly eccentric" is asserted but never demonstrated through choices that trade off competence against unconventional insight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her role is passive recipient: psychometry visions gift the path, she follows without obstacle, pulls hinges without cost, and is approved by guardians. No choice she makes creates a reversal or alters tactics; her "sensibly eccentric" trait is label-only. Present in setup, middle (delving), and ending (ascent) but ornamental—functionally replaceable with any seeker protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Compass appears in setup (factory archive), middle (psychometry readings plural), and ending ("quiescent in her pocket"). Handled twice on-page: first reading shows expedition fate, second at lagoon edge reveals hinges. Its glyphs and pulse guide her but do not constrain—visions are pure gift with no cost or misreading. Swappable with any mystical navigation device (amulet, map, crystal) with minor edits. Causal involvement in two beats and closure mention elevate above ornamental, but no irreplaceable properties or tied cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Hinged awakenings" recurs as thematic label and physical levers late in the piece but does not shape stakes or tactics. The concept is abstract and decorative: visions "hinged open," "hinged to eternal guardians," "awakenings hinged on faith." The moss-crusted hinges Elara pulls do not pivot meaning—she simply pulls them sequentially and gains access. Present only as metaphor and late literal prop; no demonstration of how awakening changes options or costs.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Sensibly eccentric" is asserted three times but never demonstrated through on-page choice or cost. She "eschewed ropes for intuition" but no consequence follows—she descends safely without friction. Her petrichor obsession motivates the quest but does not constrain tactics or force a trade-off. Label-only trait, no visible tradeoff or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Delve" anchors the action throughout: into archive, into crevice, deeper into passages, into alcove. Present in setup (archive search), middle (descent and exploration), and ending (ascent after delving). Shapes two beats—descent and alcove discovery—but does not redefine options; it is the mode of travel rather than a decision with consequence. Easily swappable with "explore," "descend," or "venture" with minor edits. Causal involvement in two beats and early signal support ~6.2, but no irreplaceability or tied cost lifts it higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Psychometry reading appears twice: factory archive and lagoon edge. Both instances gift Elara information without cost, misreading, or constraint—visions are pure exposition. Mechanics are mentioned (pressing relic to palm) but do not matter; no failed attempt or tradeoff. Present in setup and middle but purely functional exposition device. Swappable with any clairvoyance method (scrying, dream, oracle). Two-beat involvement and early signal prevent sub-3.0, but ornamental function and swappability cap at mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Lagoon and cliffs arrive past midpoint and supply the closure location. Description is vivid but postcard: "mirror of obsidian," "gothic hush," bioluminescent algae do not pressure choice. The alcove hinges are spatial props Elara uses without obstacle. Factory is opening frame, abandoned. Lagoon provides backdrop for final psychometry and hinge-pulling but does not alter tactics or constrain—she moves freely. Present in middle and ending; causal involvement in one beat (hinge discovery). Late arrival and ornamental middle use trigger −0.4; one-beat causal role and closure presence support ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Factory shutdown anchors the opening and motivates Elara's quest but exerts no time pressure. The journey "hours blurred in timeless dark"—time is vague and untracked. No deadline tightens decisions; "dawn broke" and "twilight" are atmospheric markers without consequence. Present in setup, absent in middle pressure, token mention in ending ("After"). Does not constrain tactics or shape closure. Setup present, development and closure absent; cap per gate model at 4.6; ornamental use and vagueness lower to ~3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Motivation is declared in setup ("to find the place where explanations fail") and repeated in visions and ending but never dramatized through conflicted choice. No friction between this want and a competing cost or fear; Elara pursues it linearly. The guardians affirm her purpose rather than testing it. Present throughout as thematic claim but told-only; no on-page moment where this desire forces a trade-off. Setup and ending presence without middle friction or cost; lyric reprise at closure elevates slightly but told-only execution caps near mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" recurs eight times as atmospheric label but does not modulate with pressure—maintains one static mood. Opening factory "echoing with resonant hush," crevice "swallowing footsteps," lagoon "gothic hush," ending "twilight." Coherent but unchanging; no cadence shift or tonal deepening at closure. Charged final reprise ("smiled into the resonant hush") reweights slightly but mechanically. Present across beats and ending; coherence without modulation or pressure-driven shift supports ~4.8.</comment>
