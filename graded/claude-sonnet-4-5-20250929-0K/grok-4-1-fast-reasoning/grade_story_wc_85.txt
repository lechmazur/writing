<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's core motivation (unearth truth vs. manufacture lies) is clear and his regret is embodied through physical moves (sifting driftwood, pocketing the watch hand). However, his decision-making feels more contemplative than contradictory under pressure; the internal conflict is told through backstory loops rather than shown in competing impulses within the present scene. The reflection about his mother and his own buried lineage (~20% of the text) anchors to present stimuli but flattens present-tense choice friction. Micro-choices exist (kneeling, sifting, pocketing) but they observe and process rather than alter immediate options until the final vow, which reads as declaration rather than dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Elias, cobalt terrace, dusk) arrive early. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: driftwood fragments accumulate meaning, the watch hand reprises his mother's death, and the final terrace moment reweights his vow. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (tempered regret becomes resolve) with conceptual cost (abandoning his black market trade). However, the cost is asserted in summary ("felt hollow now," "quiet vow") rather than shown through a forfeited client, destroyed record, or another concrete on-page sacrifice. The sieved-hush motif charges atmosphere but does not visibly narrow options or force a trade-off within the scene, weakening the felt price at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace, forgotten shore, and driftwood carvings are vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography is clean (terrace → steps → shore → driftwood pile → back to terrace). The watch hand and carved family crest function as micro-setting objects that anchor Elias's guilt and charge the final image. Sensory detail (brine, decay, cool stone, tarnished metal) is selective and POV-filtered. The driftwood carvings constrain the method (sifting) and the watch hand charges closure by evoking his mother's death, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3. Minor issue: "jagged rocks strewn with driftwood like the bones of drowned ships" leans ornamental and could be tightened.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias's need to discover the weight of withheld truth and decide whether to continue his deception—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the driftwood revelations (initials, dates, noose scratches, sinking ship) that confirm Mira's grandfather's crime. However, escalation is textural rather than causal; each carved fragment deepens his guilt but does not force a mid-scene choice that narrows options. The final resolve ("return it to Mira… speaking the words long unspoken") arrives as summary intention rather than a dramatized forfeiture (e.g., destroying forged documents, confronting a client). The cost is declared but not paid on the page, landing the piece in mid-6s for escalation clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (the cost of manufactured truth vs. confronting painful reality) emerges through image and action rather than statement. The watch hand, driftwood carvings, and sieved-hush motif layer meaning without overt moralizing. The final image (holding the watch hand to dying light, "its arrow pointing to truths he'd finally weigh") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, lines like "tempered regret lingered, not as torment, but as a quiet vow to quell deception henceforth" and "he'd measured their burden" veer close to thematic summary in the closing paragraphs, slightly weakening the implicit charge. The piece earns credit for complexity (Elias's cycle mirrors his clients') but loses elegance in the final explanatory beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual filtering is consistent (callused fingers, genealogist's eye for symbols). Diction is elevated and lyric ("cobalt terrace," "sieved hush," "tempered regret") but remains coherent within the narrative stance. However, the prose leans toward template cadence and decorative phrasing: repeated sentence stems ("He'd…," "The…," "Elias…"), stacked filter constructions ("he'd learned," "he'd quelled," "he'd withheld"), and motif words ("tempered," "quell," "sieved," "unspoken") recur mechanically rather than with purposeful modulation. Under peak reflection (the mother's death, Mira's tears), the voice does not compress or intensify; it remains at the same lyric register throughout, flattening urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is grammatically clean and vivid in places ("watch hand, bent and tarnished, frozen at half-past three"). However, it suffers from pervasive template cadence, paraphrase loops, and motif overuse. "Tempered," "quell," "sieved hush," "unspoken words," and "weight" recur across most paragraphs without evolving function. Adjacent sentences restate content: "Guilt clung to him" / "regret tempered his resolve"; "he'd quelled her doubts" / "they gnawed at him"; "false memories he'd manufactured flickered" / "Mira's imagined grandfather." Sentence stems repeat ("He'd…," "The…," "Elias…") across runs of three or more lines. Filter-verb stacks ("he'd obliged," "he'd quelled," "he'd learned," "he'd withheld") dull immediacy. These artifacts spread across the final third, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty and global 9+ disqualification. Deduction: −1.2 in Q7 for template cadence, paraphrase loops, and motif churn touching closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—black market genealogist confronting his own deceptions via driftwood evidence—offers a fresh synthesis. The driftwood-as-archive conceit and the watch-hand reprise are specific and purposeful. However, the emotional arc (guilt → reflection → vow to reform) follows a familiar template without bold transformation. The piece hedges risk by summarizing the final choice rather than dramatizing a concrete forfeiture (confronting Mira's estate, destroying his records, losing a client). The driftwood coincidence (carved crest matching Mira's forged one) strains plausibility without narrative payoff that justifies the convenience. Originality is present in detail and setting but not in the arc's execution or the closure's specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias's guilt and black-market trade frame the story and motivate his shore descent. His genealogist skills (reading symbols, forging documents) enable the driftwood sifting. However, his choices on the page are observational (kneeling, sifting, pocketing) rather than decisional until the final vow, which is summarized. The character is present in setup and closure but does not drive a mid-scene turn through on-page action. Two gates met (setup, payoff); development is passive. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The watch hand appears at midpoint (protruding from driftwood), is pocketed, and returns in the final image ("held the watch hand to the dying light, its arrow pointing to truths"). It reprises Elias's mother's death and charges the closure image. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as symbolic object rather than causal agent. Three gates met (setup implied via backstory, middle discovery, closure reprise); causal pressure is low. Upper mid-band for charged reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Sieved hush" is named twice as atmospheric descriptor ("A sieved hush fell over the shore," "In the sieved hush, false memories… flickered," "The sieved hush deepened"). It evokes filtered silence but does not shape stakes, constrain action, or alter Elias's choices. It remains ornamental motif rather than story engine. Setup and middle presence; no closure participation or causal work. Low functional band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Manufactures false memories" is signaled early (forging family trees, implanting illusions) and defines Elias's trade. It enables the central conflict (guilt over Mira's false lineage) and contrasts with the driftwood's true records. However, the trait is told in backstory and does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost during the present scene. Setup and thematic linkage present; no middle beat where the skill creates a live tradeoff. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Quell" appears four times: Elias quelled Mira's doubts with lies, the shore's hush quells the roar in his ears, carvings depict methods to "quell the chaos of truth," and his final vow is "to quell deception henceforth." The action frames the conflict (suppressing truth vs. confronting it) and charges the closure vow. However, its use is thematic and verbal rather than a physical action that drives a turn. Setup, thematic development, and closure participation present; causal pressure is conceptual. Upper mid-band for closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The method (sifting driftwood carvings) is signaled early, occupies the central beats (kneeling, parting wood, discovering symbols, initials, noose, ship), and delivers the evidence that reweights Elias's guilt. The mechanics (driftwood as archive, carvings as truth) shape his discovery and charge the closure. Three gates met; the method is indispensable to the plot. Strong integration across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace frames the story (opening and closing images) and the forgotten shore provides the stage for the driftwood method. Both are vivid and purposeful. However, neither location constrains Elias's choices or supplies a resource that alters outcome; the terrace is observational, the shore is passive backdrop. Setup and closure reprise present; no middle pressure or micro-setting constraint. Mid-band for framing function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Under the weight of unspoken words" appears in the opening and recurs ("words unspoken about the cost," "words long unspoken"). The timeframe is conceptual (the burden of withheld truths) rather than a ticking clock. It frames Elias's motivation but does not tighten decisions or create urgency within the scene. Setup and thematic presence; no tactical pressure. Low-mid functional band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias's desire to "discover the weight of a withheld truth" is signaled early and motivates his shore descent. The driftwood revelations dramatize the discovery (grandfather's crimes, carved evidence). However, the motivation is more investigative than conflicted; cost arises from what he learns rather than friction between competing desires. The final vow reflects the discovered weight but is summarized rather than tested in a choice. Setup, middle development, closure linkage present; friction is moderate. Mid-to-upper band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Tempered regret" is named five times and modulates from "regret tempered his resolve" to "tempered regret swelled" to "regret tempered into clarity" to "tempered regret lingered… as a quiet vow." The tone is coherent and purposeful, charging the reflective mode and the final image. However, the repetition is mechanical rather than evolving, and the tone does not modulate with scene pressure (no sharpening or compression under discovery). Setup, development, and closure presence; charges the final image but lacks dynamic range. Upper mid-band for closure linkage.</comment>
