<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "shape a new dawn" is declared but never tested through competing impulses or meaningful internal friction. His actions follow a linear path from isolation to broadcasting without genuine struggle or trade-offs visible on the page. Mira's "variant allegiance" sabotage arrives and resolves within two lines, offering no sustained pressure or earned cost. The final choice—standing defiant and broadcasting—feels inevitable rather than earned through contradictory desires acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (lyric density, prophetic fragments building to a visionary culmination), but the closure unit lacks legible cost. The final paragraph offers atmospheric assertion ("dawn forged in shadow's playful pyre," followers unified, loneliness banished) without a visible price that forecloses a path or reweights prior material. The penultimate beat ("wondered if the dawn would blind or burn") gestures toward ambiguity but is immediately smoothed over by "promise kept" and "shaped it all," erasing rather than charging the question. Orientation is clear early (stormlit observatory, Elias, radio receiver), so no penalty there, but closure remains decorative rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory and cobalt glass portico anchor setting vividly and recur across beats, charging the final image when "cobalt portico gleam[s] like a promise kept." Storm details (lightning, thunder, clouds) modulate with pressure, narrowing Elias's focus during radio work and expanding during followers' arrival. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the observatory's isolation pressures Elias's choices. However, the portico functions more as symbolic recurrence than a constraint that alters tactics; its presence enriches atmosphere but does not directly foreclose options or enable a turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—broadcasting a prophetic vision to shape a new dawn—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira sabotages the receiver, but the threat is resolved in the same beat by shadows "twisting her betrayal into loyalty anew," erasing cost rather than forcing Elias to adapt tactics. The final broadcast proceeds without on-page obstacle or trade-off; followers kneel unified, and the prophecy is "fulfilled" without visible forfeit. Escalation exists in followers arriving and the sabotage moment, but neither narrows options at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>A coherent theme—prophecy as shaped narrative, allegiance as mutable construct—emerges through the radio fragments and Mira's sabotage, resisting easy morals. The final question "if the dawn would blind or burn" invites reflection, but the immediately following lines ("promise kept," "shaped it all") flatten ambiguity into triumphant closure rather than sustaining tension. Thematic material is woven through particulars (cobalt glass, fragmented frequencies, shadow-tendrils) rather than stated, but the ending tilts toward resolved certainty when earned doubt would sharpen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias with no head-hopping. However, diction frequently lifts into elevated register ("lyrically prophetic," "variant allegiance," "gritty whimsy") that reads more as authorial decoration than Elias's perceptual signature under pressure. Sentence stems repeat: "Elias [verb]" opens multiple beats, and "gritty" / "whimsical" / "variant" recur as decorative modifiers rather than voice-motivated texture. The final paragraph's syntactic uniformity ("He had shaped it all—gritty, whimsical, inexorable") signals template cadence rather than escalating rhythm. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Dense figurative language—"fractured jewels," "fireflies in a gale," "threads from a cosmic loom," "bruised horizon pregnant with change"—appears in nearly every paragraph without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, creating rhetorical weight that slows momentum (−0.6 for density without purpose). Paraphrase loops occur: "lonely visionary" / "alone for years" and "variant allegiance" / "allegiances variant" restate concepts across adjacent lines (−0.3). Repeated sentence stems ("Elias [verb]," "The [noun] [verb]") and the recycled modifiers "gritty," "whimsical," "lyrically prophetic," "variant" flatten rhythm (−0.5 for template cadence). Multiple metaphors clash or lack coherent vehicles: shadows both "cling like soot" and "seep as inky tendrils giggling," mixing registers without earned progression. Cumulative artifact debt prevents high-band eligibility and disallows 9+ globally per the filter-verb and template-cadence caps.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "lonely visionary receives prophetic broadcasts" frame is a widely used template (hermit discovers hidden knowledge, gains followers, transforms society). The story transforms baseline elements through specific details—cobalt glass filtering lightning, radio-summoned shadows, variant allegiances as mutable threads—but these particulars do not fundamentally alter the arc's predictability: isolation → revelation → gathering → triumph. Mira's sabotage is resolved within two lines by convenient shadow intervention rather than Elias's ingenuity. The ending offers declarative closure ("prophecy fulfilled") rather than a non-obvious synthesis that reweights prior material, and the triumph arc feels safe rather than bold. Derivative-premise deduction (−0.8) applies; specific imagery elevates but does not overcome template structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias (lonely visionary) is present throughout and makes choices—scavenging radio parts, twisting dials, broadcasting the final verse, standing defiant—but most actions follow linear progression without competing options or visible trade-offs. His decisions enable plot advancement (setup, middle involvement, closure participation) but do not create key reversals; the arc is additive rather than turning. Causal pressure is present but not tied to costs that narrow later options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico frames the opening, recurs during storm-etched runes, and "gleam[s] like a promise kept" in the final paragraph, reweighting the opening image with closure resonance. It appears in three distinct beats and charges the ending. However, it remains primarily atmospheric; Elias does not handle or use it to alter tactics—it filters lightning but does not constrain his broadcasting choice or force adaptation. Its lyric reprise is purposeful, placing it in mid-band, but it lacks the causal irreplaceability or on-page cost connection for higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Variant allegiance—loyalties that shift and splinter—is introduced through radio prophecies (middle third: "factions once loyal... now swearing fealty to cloud-wraiths, oaths fraying"), enacted when Mira's "variant allegiance" drives sabotage, and resolved when shadows twist her betrayal into loyalty anew. The concept shapes Mira's middle beat and the thematic question, but its mechanics are told rather than dramatized through choices: we do not see allegiance morphing under pressure or Elias navigating competing loyalties on the page. Present in setup, middle, and closure participation (followers "variant no more, unified"), but its causal work is summary-level rather than choice-altering.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Lyrically prophetic describes Elias's voice at closure ("his voice now lyrically prophetic, echoing the radio's ghosts") and the radio fragments ("Lyrically prophetic voices crackled"), but it functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains or enables action with visible cost. The attribute modifies tone but does not create a tradeoff—Elias does not sacrifice clarity for lyricism or face consequences for prophetic speech. Present across beats as descriptive texture, not as a mechanic that alters choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unfold" appears explicitly when "the prophecies began to unfold" (early signal) and when Elias "unfolded the full prophecy" to gathered followers (middle beat driving their commitment), and the final verse broadcast completes the action at closure. The action enables the gathering of followers and the climactic broadcast, shaping two key beats and participating in closure. However, it is somewhat swappable—"reveal," "declare," or "transmit" could serve similar functions with minor edits. Causal involvement is clear but specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fragmented radio frequencies are introduced early (Elias "chasing fragmented radio frequencies that danced like fireflies"), mechanics matter in the middle (frequencies coalesce, teach methods, fracture during sabotage), and the method is integral at closure (the final frequency hisses a warning, then the radio falls silent). The method shapes Elias's attempts, constrains his tactics (he must twist dials, repair after sabotage), and its exhaustion ("fragments spent") is the mechanism of closure. Present in all three gates with clear causal pressure, though the mechanics remain somewhat abstract rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds is established in the opening line, pressures the narrative by isolating Elias and forcing followers to "climb the treacherous spires," and houses the climactic gathering and broadcast. The setting supplies resources (radio receiver, cobalt portico, altitude above the masses) that affect outcome and recurs as "the observatory pulsing with new life" at closure. It enables key beats (isolation → gathering → broadcast) and its verticality matters (followers must climb; broadcasts "pierce the clouds"). Strong setup, middle involvement (followers' arrival), and closure participation, with some causal irreplaceability—the altitude and isolation are load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Across the rise of a prophet" frames the timeframe in the opening, recurs mid-story ("Across his rise, from hermit to herald"), and closes the final paragraph ("Across the prophet's rise, he had shaped it all"). The phrase signals a span from isolation to culmination, but time itself does not tighten decisions—days blur into weeks without a live clock pressuring choices, and no deadline or time-driven cost appears. The timeframe is present as thematic framing but does not alter tactics or escalate pressure on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation "to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated early and drives his scavenging, radio work, and final broadcast. The desire is dramatized through his actions (twisting dials, etching lyrics, broadcasting the final verse) and recurs at closure ("dawn forged in shadow's playful pyre"). However, the motivation is linear—Elias does not face friction between this want and competing costs or fears; the shadows serve him without demanding visible sacrifice. Present across beats and integral to the arc, but the conflict between desire and price is declared ("wondered if the dawn would blind or burn") rather than dramatized as a choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Gritty whimsy is invoked repeatedly as descriptive modifier—"gritty whimsy," "whimsically promising," "whimsical malice," "gritty with frostbite," "gritty tendrils," "whimsy turned gritty," "gritty whimsy of prophecy fulfilled"—but the tone reads as a label applied rather than an emergent quality that modulates with pressure. The opening storm imagery and final triumph maintain consistent lyric elevation without clear tonal shift or charge at the closure image. The terms recur mechanically across beats rather than being embodied through syntax, image choice, or rhythm that reflects the focalizer's shifting state.</comment>
