<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's blank-faced performance and whittling actions are consistently motivated by grief and the drive to "cultivate lightness," but interiority remains largely declarative rather than contradictory-in-action. The mercy killing backstory is told efficiently but the moral ambiguity never generates on-page friction or a visible hierarchy of values under present pressure. Embodied emotion is present (the blood bead, the voice crack) but the porcelain-mask conceit flattens moment-to-moment contradictions. The final choice to continue performing is consistent but lacks a felt cost that forecloses a live alternative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (farmhouse, turbines, kitchen, post-mandate era) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through repetition of whittling, narration, and the turbine hum, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where she gathers the carvings and bouquet into a talisman and commits to tomorrow's performance. Cost is felt but oblique—"lightness lingered, morally ambiguous as mercy"—and the final image reweights prior material without a decisive physical turn. The lens holds, but the closure moment lacks a sharper on-page consequence or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The farmhouse, turbines, scarred table, and bouquet are consistently anchored and filtered through the protagonist's grief-performance frame. The turbine hum functions as micro-setting, modulating from "remade hush" to "dirge" and shaping the performer's soliloquy rhythm. The carved turbine blade and dried flowers constrain the performer's symbolic vocabulary and charge the final talisman. Spatial choreography (kitchen, window, table) remains clear across moves, and sensory selection (shavings, blood, crumbling petals) reflects urgency without catalog sprawl.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cultivating lightness in grief through performance—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the whittling and narration cycle, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows live options; the protagonist begins performing and ends performing with the same commitment. The mercy-killing backstory adds moral weight but remains a static frame rather than a present dilemma. The final talisman-gathering registers as deepening rather than a turn that forecloses a path, meeting the Accumulative lens minimum but lacking visible agency cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—grief, performance as coping mechanism, and moral ambiguity—emerges organically from the whittling, bouquet, and turbine imagery without thesis statements. The final image (talisman, darkness, "lightness lingered, morally ambiguous as mercy") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether the protagonist's method honors or betrays. Subtext operates in the cracked voice, the blood lick, and the blank face that never twitches. The piece resists tidy resolution and invites reflection on the cost of performed detachment, though the "remade hush" concept occasionally tilts toward prompt echo rather than earned particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person-limited with consistent psychic distance and perceptual filtering through the performer's grief-performance frame. Diction ("titans," "sift through voids," "carve of inevitability") sustains a heightened, theatrical register that matches the character's soliloquy habit, though the elevated idiom occasionally drifts into prompt-template phrasing ("emotional void," "morally ambiguous") that feels imposed rather than voice-particular. Rhythmic control is strong in the whittling beats, and the compressed final image ("hush remade once more") modulates effectively. No dialogue is present; no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high in the whittling and turbine beats, and sensory detail (shavings, blood, crumbling petals) advances atmosphere. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "emotional void" recurs four times, "remade hush" five times, and "morally ambiguous" three times, often in adjacent or nearby lines without added pressure. The stock phrase "blank-faced performer" is repeated identically across beats. Template cadence clusters in the narration sequences: "Behold," "See here," "Thus, I remake." These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack. Figurative language ("whispers," "snow of detachment," "feather now, not stone") is frequent but mostly coherent; mixed metaphors are minimal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The post-mandate grief-performance premise offers a fresh angle on mourning and complicity, and the whittling-as-theater conceit is specific. However, the "happiness mandate" dystopia and the blank-faced performer trope echo widely used SFF templates (emotion-suppression regimes, artist-as-survivor) without full transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The turbine-overshadowed farmhouse and the narrator's soliloquy method provide texture, but the mercy-killing backstory and the "morally ambiguous" framing feel median rather than bold. Risk-taking is present in the sustained theatrical register and the quiet, static ending, yet the piece does not fully commit to either a causal turn or a radically particular synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The blank-faced performer is present throughout and drives the whittling and narration. Her choices (selecting branches, carving shapes, gathering the talisman) shape two beats and the ending, but no decision alters tactics or forecloses a live option with visible cost. The porcelain-mask trait is label-consistent but does not constrain a high-stakes choice. Setup early, development present, closure participation yes; causal pressure modest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dried flower bouquet appears in four beats: initial description, mid-whittling acknowledgment ("desiccated sentinel"), dramatic lifting with petal-dusting, and final talisman-bundling. It returns with reweighted meaning (from grave marker to "union: flora and forge") and charges the closure image. Setup early, development yes, closure linkage strong. Swappability is low (it anchors the mercy-killing backstory), but it does not constrain a choice under pressure; its role is primarily symbolic accumulation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Remade hush" is named five times and thematically linked to the turbine drone and the performer's effort to reshape grief. However, it remains a metaphor rather than a concrete constraint that changes options or tactics on the page. The concept frames the atmosphere but does not drive a beat or choice. Setup early, development ornamental, closure participation as echo only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Moral ambiguity is explicitly named three times ("morally ambiguous mercy," "morally ambiguous in its mute witness," "morally ambiguous as mercy") and anchors the mercy-killing backstory. It informs the protagonist's detachment and the story's thematic resonance, but it does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost; the protagonist never faces a present trade-off that tests the ambiguity. Setup early, development label-only, closure participation as thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Whittling is the central action across three extended beats: the turbine blade carving, the petal carving, and the final talisman assembly. It enables the performer's dramatic narration method and produces the objects that charge the closure image. Removing whittling would collapse the story's structure and thematic particulars. Setup immediate, development across multiple beats, closure participation direct, causal pressure high, irreplaceability high. No visible cost is tied uniquely to the act of whittling itself (the nicked thumb is minor), preventing full 8.5+ range.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dramatically narrating mundane tasks is the protagonist's signature method, demonstrated in four beats: the whittle soliloquy, the petal-carving speech, the mimed churning, and the final talisman declaration. The method shapes her coping mechanism and drives the theatrical register throughout. Setup early, development across beats, closure participation yes. The method does not face resistance or alter tactics under pressure, and it could be summarized as "performative coping" without losing causal force, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The farmhouse and turbines are anchored in the opening and recur in five beats: opening description, turbine groan during whittling, window gaze, final turbine spin, and closing "turbine shadow." The turbine hum functions as atmospheric pressure and metaphor ("remade hush," "dirge"), but the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Setup immediate, development atmospheric, closure participation as backdrop. Micro-setting (scarred table, kitchen) is functional but not decisive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The post-mandate timeframe is established early and provides thematic context (suppressed sobs, emotional void, husband's perpetual grin). However, it remains static backstory; no on-page clock tightens decisions, and the temporal setting does not alter present tactics. The phrase "after the happiness mandate" recurs as atmosphere rather than constraint. Setup early, development ornamental, closure participation as thematic frame only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation to cultivate lightness in grief is explicitly named and drives all whittling and narration beats. It is dramatized through the protagonist's actions (carving, performing, gathering the talisman) and tested by the grief "coiled in her chest." The final line ("lightness lingered") confirms partial success with felt ambiguity. Setup early, development across beats, closure participation direct. Friction between the goal and the "emotional void" is present but the protagonist never faces a choice that forces her to abandon or pay a higher cost for the lightness; the motivation is pursued without visible trade-off, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Emotional void is named four times and sustained through the blank face, flat eyes, detachment, and "no tears came." The tone modulates subtly (turbine hum → dirge, voice crack at closure) and charges the final image ("In that emotional void, lightness lingered"). The void is coherent across turns and integral to the protagonist's performance method. Setup immediate, development consistent, closure participation strong. The tone does not shift under external pressure (no tonal break when the knife slips or when she views the other farmhouse), which limits dynamic range, but the static void is thematically purposeful and well-integrated.</comment>
