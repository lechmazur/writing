<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("the color of unspoken apologies") but never internally contradicted or tested by competing impulses. Her actions—pruning, breathing—are symbolic gestures without visible cost or choice architecture; the "severance" with Tomas remains backstory label. Hiroshi is a static guide whose "slow-spoken" trait appears as repeated descriptor rather than constraint. Emotional states are labeled ("cerulean regret," "grief") rather than embodied through contradictory perception or choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The orientation test fails: who Elara is, where the islet sits, and when "after the severance" occurs remain vague past 120 words, triggering −0.4 in Q2 and capping Q3 at 7.0. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural (mist, lace, compass imagery), but no causal turn or tightening forecloses a path with on-page cost—Elara's "diffusing" of apologies and the compass revealing cerulean occur without friction or stakes narrowing. The ending summary ("Cerulean regret had found its true shade—not loss, but luminous forgiveness unspoken") tells closure rather than landing it through image or action. Cost is asserted, not demonstrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "breezy islet after rain" and mist-shrouded garden supply atmosphere but do not constrain a single choice—Elara moves freely, Hiroshi's grove is backdrop. The compass embedded in heartwood and the antique lace are handled, meeting micro-setting criteria minimally, but neither object blocks or enables a tactic under pressure. Spatial choreography is coherent (shore → garden → bonsai center → departure) yet postcard-descriptive. The cerulean sky reprise at closure charges the final image slightly, lifting the score within band despite the Q3 cap at 7.0 from orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("find the color of unspoken apologies") is signaled early but remains abstract—no on-page cost, no narrowing of options. Pruning the bonsai and aligning the compass are rituals performed without friction or failure; Hiroshi's instructions guide Elara without resistance. The compass "pointing inward" and revealing cerulean occur as unveiling rather than earned reversal. No agency choice forecloses a path; coincidence (the compass's glow) delivers the resolution. Pressure is steady-state descriptive rather than escalating under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme of apologies and regret is repeatedly stated ("unspoken apologies," "cerulean regret," "diffuse the anchors of regret") rather than emerging from image or action. The final paragraph ("Cerulean regret had found its true shade—not loss, but luminous forgiveness unspoken") is direct thematic summary, triggering −0.6 for moralizing in the final lines. The compass and lace motifs are ornamental—mentioned but not reweighted by choice. No counter-reading or ambiguity; the resolution is tidy and declarative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices mist, sky, trees without character-specific bias. Hiroshi's dialogue ("Behold the ghost ship's compass," "Diffuse further") reads as exposition rather than goal-driven speech. Register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("filigreed threads," "spectral galleon") that clashes with emotional immediacy. Psychic distance remains consistent, but voice lacks rhythmic control under pressure—syntax is uniform across calm and climactic beats. The orientation debt (Q2 penalty applied) caps Q6 at 7.8, but execution issues lower the score within that range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive template cadence and synonym loops: "rhythmically placid" appears three times, "slow-spoken" twice, "diffuse/diffused/diffusing" seven times across adjacent lines without pattern payoff. Paraphrase loops in final third ("cerulean regret" echoed four times in closure paragraph; "unspoken apologies" three times). Mixed metaphors: "heart severed" then "unmoored," "tides carry hues" then "diffuse the anchors." Stock phrases: "voice fracturing," "tears traced her cheeks," "heart lighter." Template stems: "Elara [verb]" opens six sentences in three paragraphs. Artifacts touch closure, triggering baseline −1.4 and disallowing 9+ globally; final-third concentration escalates to −1.7 total, capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise (mentor teaches symbolic lesson via enchanted object to resolve internal conflict) is a widely used template without fresh synthesis. The "ghost ship's compass" and "antique lace instructions" are ornamental props that do not constrain choice or alter stakes—swappable with tarot cards or a spell without structural change. Cerulean as the "color of unspoken apologies" is asserted rather than discovered through lived detail. No bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus; the journey follows a predictable arc from arrival to symbolic healing. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −1.2 for template adherence without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Hiroshi appears by paragraph 5, guides Elara through instructions, and exits—setup and development gates met. However, he makes no decisions that alter tactics; his role is purely expository (handing shears, directing compass use). The "slow-spoken" trait is label-only, appearing three times without constraining an action. No closure participation beyond watching Elara depart. Functional but replaceable; any wise mentor could serve identically. Late-penalty waived (setup early), but ornamental use (−0.7) and swappability (−0.6) apply.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The compass is introduced at midpoint (paragraph 12), handled in two beats (reveal, alignment), and its needle's inward pointing triggers the cerulean vision—setup, development, and closure gates met. However, Elara does not use it to make a choice; it reveals information passively. The brass relic embedded in heartwood is specific, but its function (pointing to "tides of remembrance") could be filled by a mirror or crystal with minor edits. Causal pressure minimal; closure linkage present but passive. Mid-introduction penalty −0.3, swappability −0.5, ornamental lean −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Tides of remembrance" is named in paragraph 10, structures Hiroshi's instruction ("align heart's shadow to the needle's ghost"), and the visions flood Elara's mind—setup and development met. Yet the concept remains metaphorical backdrop; it does not narrow options or create a trade-off. The "tides" do not ebb or flood with consequence; they are invoked as theme without altering tactics on the page. Closure participation is summary ("navigated her own tides") rather than dramatized. Mid-introduction −0.3, ornamental use −0.8, summary-only −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Rhythmically placid" appears as repeated descriptor (waves, grove, chant, acceptance) without constraining or enabling a single action. The trait is label-only—no visible cost or tradeoff. Setup in paragraph 3, but no development or closure participation beyond echo in final third. Swappable with "gently steady" or "calm" without loss. Ornamental −0.9, label-only −0.3, swappability −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Diffuse" appears throughout (paragraphs 11, 18, 21, 25, final), structuring the ritual (diffuse grief, apologies, regret). Setup, development, and closure gates met. However, the action is passive—breathing and exhaling—without visible cost or choice friction. The "diffusing" does not prevent or enable a competing option; Hiroshi directs, Elara complies. Major turns trace to this verb, but it is easily swappable with "release" or "let go." Causal pressure low; closure linkage present but soft. Ornamental lean −0.5, swappability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The lace pattern is introduced at paragraph 17, deciphered with Hiroshi, and carried as talisman at closure—setup, development, payoff gates met. The instructions ("Diffuse intention at slack tide, align heart's shadow") guide the ritual, shaping one attempt (aligning compass). However, the mechanics are cryptic without consequence; Elara does not fail or adapt. The lace could be replaced by a scroll or engraved stone with identical function. Beat involvement (two touches), but causal pressure minimal. Swappability −0.6, ornamental lean −0.4, summary payoff −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The islet is named in opening and closing, frames the journey spatially—setup and closure participation met. Rain and breeze supply atmosphere but do not alter a choice; Elara moves freely without environmental constraint. The garden's mist thickens description yet does not block or enable tactics. Micro-setting (bonsai, compass in tree) is handled but passively. Postcard-level integration; the setting could be a mountaintop shrine or forest glade without structural change. Swappability −0.7, ornamental −0.6, postcard description −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After the severance" is mentioned in paragraph 2 and echoed ("no longer severed" in final third)—setup and closure met. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions; no clock or urgency. "The severance" remains backstory label without on-page consequence or cost. Development gate missing (no middle choice shaped by time pressure). Vague temporality trends low. Summary-only −0.6, swappability −0.5, missing development gate caps at 3.4 per rubric, but lyric reprise lifts slightly within cap tolerance to 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to find the color of unspoken apologies" is declared in paragraph 8, drives her journey, and is satisfied at closure—setup, development, payoff met. The motivation is told rather than shown through conflicted micro-choices; no friction between want and competing cost on the page. The compass reveals the color without Elara sacrificing or choosing between options. Functional but enacted passively. Told-only lean −0.7, lack of friction −0.6, summary satisfaction −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Cerulean regret" is named in paragraph 1, recurs as descriptor (sky, pooling chest, compass hue, final shade), and charges the ending image—setup and closure met. Tone is static rather than modulating with pressure; the mood remains wistful-melancholic throughout without cadence shift or intensity variation. The phrase is repeated four times in the final paragraph, reading as label rather than emergent effect. Single static mood trends mid-low per rubric. Ornamental repetition −0.6, static mood −0.5, label-only closure −0.4.</comment>
