<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are declared ("premature lines from relentless lab pursuits") but never dramatized through embodied choice under pressure. Voss remains an oracle figure whose boyish-yet-aged body is described but whose internal contradictions never complicate a decision. The trance sequence offers visionary imagery but no micro-choices that foreclose paths or reveal hierarchy of values. The final "ready to vanish and reemerge" reads as summary acceptance rather than earned transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece opens with ornate scene-setting but delays who/where/when anchors past 120 words, creating orientation debt (−0.4 in Q2; Q3 capped at 7.0). The dominant lens remains ambiguous—lyric accumulation or causal decision—and is not taught by midpoint. No decisive change, renunciation, or crystallized stance occurs on the page; "ready to vanish" is preparation, not closure with felt cost. The stone-toss and ripple patterns are described but do not narrow Elara's options or reweight prior material in a legible before/after.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The floating basalt platform, luminous moss, and magnetic grotto supply vivid sensory anchors and the pond's mirroring effect charges the trance sequence. However, none of these elements constrains a choice or alters tactics—they remain atmospheric backdrops. The 9+ gate (environment must constrain choice or charge final image) is not met, capping the score at 8.8; orientation debt further lowers it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reversing aging—is signaled early but never tested by on-page choice or escalation. Elara observes Voss's method passively; no decision narrows her options or imposes visible cost. The trance functions as exposition delivery, not pressure crucible. Without a tightening that forecloses a path or a turn driven by protagonist agency, the piece remains declarative rather than escalating.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The vanish-to-appear motif recurs but is stated rather than earned: "You teach vanishing to appear" explicates theme rather than letting the final image speak. The ripple patterns and grotto pull gesture toward metamorphosis, yet no particular lived cost or non-obvious moral calculus emerges. The ending "ready to vanish" is an intention, not a resonant reconfiguration that reweights prior material through concrete consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The prose carries a consistent lyric register ("sycamore hush," "reversed waterfalls over boyish shoulders") but lacks perceptual signature—Elara's noticing does not reveal character-specific bias or selective attention under stress. The self-interrupting meta-commentary ("Wait, too many words already? No, adjust") breaks the narrative frame and exposes scaffold. No dialogue appears to evaluate. Diction remains elevated throughout without modulation tied to pressure shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The piece suffers from paraphrase loops ("through the trance" appears five times), template cadence (repeated "Wait, …" meta-commentary), and figurative overloading in every sentence of the trance beat without taught pattern or payoff. The self-aware scaffolding ("Restart mental draft," "True output begins now") is generation artifact that obscures story momentum (−1.0). Stock phrases ("heart pounding," "transfixed") and mixed metaphors ("silver hair falling like reversed waterfalls") further reduce clarity and propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The backwards-aging premise and meditation-platform setting combine familiar tropes without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious stakes. The ripple-method feels ornamental rather than integral to character or conflict—Elara could receive the wisdom through direct instruction with minor edits. The meta-commentary and unfinished draft structure read as process artifacts rather than bold formal risk. No fresh inflection or inevitable synthesis emerges.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Voss is present across the scene but makes no choice that alters tactics or narrows options. He tosses the stone and speaks two lines of instruction, but these are exposition delivery rather than decisions under pressure. His backwards aging is described, not used to complicate conflict.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto appears in vision during the trance and is mentioned in the closing lines as calling to Elara. It supplies atmospheric pressure but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. No middle development beat; late closure mention is ornamental rather than causally decisive. Caps: missing middle development (3.4), late introduction beyond 40% (4.6); lowest cap 3.4, but lyric reprise lifts slightly to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Delayed revelation is gestured at—"ripples speak," "delayed revelation held"—but the method is never withheld in a way that changes Elara's on-page choices. The concept is asserted in narration ("weaves truth carefully," "choosing instead to withhold") rather than dramatized through conflicting options. It does not reshape tactics; it remains thematic commentary.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" appears twice as descriptor but never constrains or enables an action with visible cost. Voss's withholding is told, not shown to impose a tradeoff. The trait remains label-only; swappable with "speaks cryptically" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Withholding occurs when Voss "did not elaborate, choosing instead to withhold," but this does not drive a turn or redefine Elara's options—she proceeds into the trance regardless. The stone toss is a separate action. The withholding itself is summary rather than a pivot moment with cost; easily replaceable with direct instruction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The stone-toss and ripple patterns appear in the trance sequence and are described as encoding the secret ("patterns encoding the backwards aging secret"). They occupy two beats (toss, then observation of symbols) and recur in Elara's final realization. However, the method does not shape her attempts or impose a constraint—she passively receives the vision. Present across beats but without altering tactics, scoring mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The floating platform anchors the entire scene, steadies under Elara's weight, and provides the ground for the trance. It appears in setup, hosts the middle action, and is present at closure ("the platform rocking softly"). Yet it never constrains a choice—Elara could receive the same teaching on solid ground. Meets all three gates but remains postcard backdrop rather than pressure source; scores in the 5.0–6.9 band for purposeful reprise without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"Through the trance" is repeated but the timeframe is elastic and untracked: "stars wheeled overhead," "timeframe stretching… like an endless breath." No live clock tightens decisions. The trance functions as exposition vessel, not temporal constraint. Present but ornamental; swappable with "during meditation."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>"To teach vanishing to appear" is stated by Elara at the end as interpretation of Voss's motivation. It is never dramatized through conflicting wants or a choice with cost. Voss's goal does not create friction or alter his tactics on the page. Told-only, no embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Sycamore hush" opens the piece, recurs three times, and frames the final realization. The tone remains consistent—quiet, reverent—but does not modulate with pressure or sharpen at the closure beat. It charges the atmosphere without inflecting the stakes. Lyric reprise without decisive reweighting; scores in the 5.0–6.9 band for purposeful consistency that does not transform meaning.</comment>
