<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's scarred backstory is established through extensive reflection, but his present agency is thin—he primarily listens and shares memory rather than making choices under live pressure. Lena appears late (~40% mark) and remains a static receiver; her vow at the end is declared but not tested. Interior contradiction is absent; Elias moves smoothly from pain to pedagogy without competing impulses, and the porcelain box functions as symbolic prop rather than constraint on choice. The final exchange ("I won't bargain mine away angry") reads as epiphany-by-declaration rather than earned through on-page cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: "Elias, the scarred forest firefighter" arrives at line 3, spatial grounding (ridge path, pines) is present but the forward pressure remains vague until Lena's sob ~40% through. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (celestial imagery, box handling, shared memory), but closure is a stated vow without visible cost—Lena's declaration does not foreclose a path or reweight prior material through image. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) applies for delayed anchoring, and the Cost Proof Test shows no exact sentence where cost is legible at closure; the final image ("binding scars to stars") is metaphor without agency. Cap Q3 at 7.0 per the Orientation Test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ridge path, pines, boulder, and moon are vivid and sustained across beats. The cracked porcelain box is handled twice (opened, placed in Lena's palms) and its fissures charge the shared moment, qualifying as micro-setting that constrains intimacy. Sensory detail (gravel crunch, starlight, dusty face) is selective and POV-filtered. The cap at 7.0 (Orientation Test applied in Q2) limits upward movement despite solid spatial choreography and the box's role in the closure gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias seeking to "translate pain into a universal language"—is abstract and never tested by live opposition or cost. The encounter with Lena offers an opportunity for escalation, but she accepts his wisdom without friction; no reversal, no trade-off emerges. The vow "I'll fight smart, like you" is unearned by prior pressure; coincidence (her sob) delivers the pupil, and the resolution is pedagogical summary rather than a choice that forecloses an option. One deepening (shared memory) occurs but lacks visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—innocence bargained, pain as universal language—is pervasive but stated rather than embodied. "Pain speaks to all, if we listen" and the final line "binding scars to stars" are overt thematic summaries that replace scene pressure. The box's cracks function as symbol without complicating choice, and the celestial dance recurs decoratively. Lena's insight is delivered via epiphany rather than earned friction, and the ending moralizes ("healing rhythm of the world") instead of offering a resonant non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and Elias's perceptual signature (fire vocabulary, tenderness filtered through scarred tissue) is consistent. Dialogue is sparse but serviceable; Lena's "Please, mister" and Elias's gravelly tone carry age and power differential. However, diction elevates during reflection ("bargained my innocence," "slow celestial dance") in ways that feel authorial rather than firefighter-particular. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs. The phrase "gently skilled" repeats mechanically across three beats without variation, a minor template artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: "hard softness" (×3), "slow dance of celestial bodies" (×2), "gently skilled" (×3), and figurative density ("silver vein," "night's hard softness," "pain etching deeper lines") clusters in high-pressure moments without clear pattern-teaching. Paraphrase loops appear: "pain speaks to all" echoes "translate pain into a universal language" without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("stars wheeling," "cracked like fragile memories") and therapy-speak ("bargained away," "enlighten") flatten the voice. Template cadence: "He [verb]" and "Elias [verb]" dominate sentence openings across the middle third. Apply −1.2 in Q7 for density violations, loops, and stock phrasing; artifacts touch the closure beat ("binding scars to stars"), triggering the 9+ disqualification and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—scarred mentor enlightens child survivor on moonlit ridge—follows a familiar template (wise guide imparts hard-won lesson to innocent). The cracked box is a conventional symbol of fractured memory, and the celestial timeframe is decorative rather than transformative. "Bargained innocence" and "universal language of pain" read as abstract placeholders without specific lived detail. No synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; Lena could be swapped for any lost child, the ridge for any quiet space, with minimal rewriting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his scarred identity frames the encounter, satisfying setup. He kneels, brushes dirt, opens the box, and tells his story—functional actions in two beats (meeting Lena, sharing memory). However, his choices do not create key turns; Lena's sob is coincidence, and his response is pedagogical rather than conflicted. The final descent is joint action without on-page cost tied to his agency. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, but swappable (any mentor) −0.6, no closure-driving decision −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The box appears in paragraph 4 (setup), is opened and held aloft mid-story (beat 1), and placed in Lena's palms near closure (beat 2). Its cracks are traced and verbally linked to shared brokenness, reweighting from personal relic to teaching tool. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (placed in her hands, discussed in final exchange) +1.0, specificity (blue glaze, fissures as story) +0.5. However, it does not constrain choice—removing it would require rewriting only the tactile gesture, not the logic. Swappability (any heirloom) −0.5, ornamental in final paragraph (cameo rather than causal) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Bargained innocence is established in Elias's backstory (paragraph 8: "I bargained my innocence") and recurs in his confession and Lena's vow. Setup is clear, but the concept operates as theme rather than live stake—no on-page choice tests the bargain's terms or cost. Lena's vow "I won't bargain mine away angry" is thematic echo without friction. Early signal +0.6, closure mention (Lena's vow) +0.3, but told-only −0.7, no causal pressure −0.8, summary use −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Gently skilled" is applied to Elias three times: handling embers and wildlife (told), brushing dirt from Lena's cheek (shown), and "gently skilled at this enlightenment" (label). Setup is present, one on-page action (cheek brush) shows the trait in beat 1, and the final label links it to pedagogy. Early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, but label-only in closure paragraph −0.6, no visible tradeoff (skill costs nothing) −0.7, template repetition artifact −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Enlightenment is Elias's declared goal (paragraph 6: "To enlighten you, child") and the frame for his storytelling. He describes his bargain, places the box in her hands, and she vows to "fight smart"—one major turn (her acceptance). Setup is clear, one beat (teaching moment) +0.4, closure mention (she becomes "new guardian") +0.5, but the action is mostly spoken exposition rather than dramatized pressure. Told-only (his story is recounted) −0.6, swappable (any mentorship verb) −0.5, no cost (she simply agrees) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Reflecting deeply" appears twice as method: "I must reflect deeply on my own scars" (stated) and the final summary "Elias had translated his pain... for the healing rhythm" (told). The method is label rather than dramatized mechanics—no struggle or failed attempt shows reflection shaping his approach. Setup via dialogue label +0.3, closure mention +0.3, but summary-only (no on-page process) −0.7, told mechanics −0.6, swappable (any introspection) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge path is named in the opening line, sustained across beats (gravel crunch, boulder, descent), and paired with the final image ("path faded behind them"). Setup +0.7, three beats (arrival, encounter, descent) +1.4, closure linkage (bridge metaphor, descent) +0.8. However, the path does not constrain choice—it is backdrop rather than obstacle. No causal pressure (they could meet anywhere) −0.9, postcard description (silver vein, starlight) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Slow dance of celestial bodies" is invoked in paragraph 2, rephrased twice ("constellations shifted," "moon climbing higher"), and echoed at closure ("slow celestial dance"). Setup +0.4, closure mention +0.3. Time does not tighten decisions—no live clock, no urgency tied to dawn's arrival. The celestial frame is metaphor without mechanical constraint. Ornamental (poetic but inactive) −0.8, no tactical pressure −1.0, swappable (any night) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—"translate pain into a universal language"—is stated in paragraph 6, drives his choice to share his story, and is summarized at closure ("Elias had translated his pain"). Setup +0.6, two beats (internal resolve, storytelling) +0.9, closure reference +0.5. Friction is minimal: Elias wants to teach, Lena wants to learn, no competing desire complicates the exchange. Told desire (no embodied contradiction) −0.7, no cost (teaching succeeds without sacrifice) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Hard softness" is named in paragraph 2 ("night's hard softness"), applied to Elias's tone ("gravelly yet warm"), and echoed in paragraph 45 ("hard softness of his features yielding"). Setup +0.5, two mentions +0.6. The tone is asserted via oxymoron rather than modulated through syntax or image—diction remains elevated and even across emotional beats. Label-only (no rhythmic proof) −0.7, static mood (no shift under pressure) −0.6, ornamental closure mention −0.3.</comment>
