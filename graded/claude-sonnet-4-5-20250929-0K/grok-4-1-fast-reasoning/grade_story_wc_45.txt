<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation shifts repeatedly without visible cost or contradiction: she dismisses magic, then discovers belief, then becomes a healer of fae-swapped souls, all in summary. The final "setting" of the tooth reads as metaphor without embodied struggle. Interior voice relies on therapeutic abstractions ("forgiveness," "innovation," "yearning") rather than concrete choice under pressure. No moment dramatizes her wrestling with genuine doubt; the arc is told.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchors arrive gradually but remain vague past 120 words (family estate, "tonight," village unspecified) without payoff at closure; apply −0.4. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is asserted ("mistakes...into constellations") rather than shown through a foreclosed path. The substitute body inciting incident vanishes after setup; causality fragments into a tour of symbolic objects. Drive lens is ambiguous—lyric accumulation or causal?—and not taught; apply lens-ambiguity penalty −0.4. Cap Q2 at 7.2 per cross-caps; score lands lower due to causality gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The hedge maze and secret garden are vividly described with sensory detail (honeysuckle, dew, marble benches). However, they function as backdrop rather than constraint: Elara navigates without friction, the maze never blocks her, and the garden does not alter her choices. The tooth is unearthed without spatial challenge. Spatial choreography is clear, but the micro-setting does not pressure closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—healing the rift between skepticism and belief—is declared but not tested by on-page opposition. Elara's journey through the maze encounters no reversals; the tooth appears, she performs a ritual Grandma taught, it seals. No tightening narrows options; no visible price is paid. The substitute body and village child are mentioned but never return to complicate. Escalation is absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of doubt reborn as belief emerges clearly from the tooth's cleft and Elara's arc. The constellation metaphor recurs purposefully. However, the ending states the theme rather than embodying it: "mistakes indeed patterned into eternal, forgiving light" and "skeptic forged anew" are direct thematic summary. The final image (Elara exiting with a rose sprig, planning to teach villagers) does not reweight prior material non-literally; it extends the moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Voice attempts lyricism but falls into template cadence: "shrewdly innocent" repeated five times, "yearning" used as verb/noun eight times, and identical adverbial stems ("As a girl," "As dawn's first blush," "After any shift"). Register drifts between folksy ("bone setter," "shepherd bones") and abstract ("nostalgic innovation," "reborn from doubt"). POV is stable third-limited, but perceptual signature is thin—Elara's observations could belong to any character. Psychic distance wavers between close and distant without purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Severe text-artifact debt across the piece. Template cadence: "She'd tell... She'd demonstrate" and synonym loops ("yearn/yearning" eight times, "shrewd/shrewdly innocent" five times, "cleft" six times as motif and noun). Paraphrase loops: "Her skepticism a cleft widening" / "The cleft in the tooth" / "her certainty cleft mended." Filter-verb stack in middle third ("seemed to bow," "sworn changelings," "dismissed Grandma's claim"). Mixed metaphor: "mistakes as errant stars" then "set it into a hollow" conflates celestial and surgical imagery. Apply patterned-artifact penalty pack: −1.4 in Q7; artifacts touch closure beat (final third), disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The changeling-tooth/bone-setting synthesis offers a modest fresh angle, but the fairy-swap premise and skeptic-to-believer arc are stock templates. The maze-to-secret-garden structure is familiar; no turn subverts expectation. The final gesture—bringing fae lore back to the village—retreats to safe evangelism rather than risk. Transformation test fails: swap names and the emotional arc remains generic. No bold risk elevates stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elara is labeled "forgiving skeptic" but makes no key turn; she moves from disbelief to belief in summary without visible cost. Present in setup and ending but no dramatized decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Tooth appears mid-story, is examined, then "set" into the sundial and seals. Two beats (discovery, ritual) and participates in closure. However, its mechanics are told ("anointed," "bound with linen") not shown. Swappable with any fae token.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The cleft metaphor recurs (tooth cleft, certainty cleft) but remains ornamental. It does not constrain choice or alter tactics; Elara's path is unchanged whether certainty "clefts" or not. Label-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is repeated five times but never enables or constrains action. Elara's choices do not hinge on this trait. Label without function.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Yearn" appears eight times as verb and noun throughout. It colors tone and links beats but does not drive turns—Elara yearns, then acts; the yearning itself is passive. Replaceable with "seek" or "hope."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Bone-setting is signaled early (Elara's profession) and returns at closure when she "sets" the tooth. The parallel is thematic, but the mechanics are summarized ("align the spirit as one aligns fractured femur") not demonstrated. Two beats, modest causal role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The secret garden is introduced in the first third, drives the middle discovery beat, and frames the ending. It provides the sundial and earth for the tooth. All three gates met; causal role in two beats. However, it does not constrain—Elara's access is frictionless.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The substitute body is mentioned in setup ("just yesterday") but never pressures Elara's choices. Time does not tighten; the ritual occurs "as dawn's first blush" without urgency. Clock is vague and inert.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Turning mistakes into constellations is stated throughout and returns at closure ("mistakes indeed patterned into eternal...light"). The metaphor threads the arc but is told, not dramatized through friction. One lyric reprise; functional but summary-driven.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Nostalgic innovation" is coherent: Grandma's tales (nostalgia) meet Elara's new method (innovation). Tone modulates subtly from wistful opening to charged ending. It does not dramatically shift under pressure but supports the final image. Stable mood that charges closure.</comment>
