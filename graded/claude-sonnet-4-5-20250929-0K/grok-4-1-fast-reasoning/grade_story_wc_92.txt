<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (silent revolution against Overwardens) is declared but never tested by competing impulses or visible cost on the page. Her "calmly inventive" trait appears as label rather than constraint—no moment shows invention failing or calm masking panic under pressure. The final paragraph's "Elara smiled, sentinel eternal" reads as static competence rather than character arc with foreclosed paths. Interior voice relies on generic phrases ("heart steady," "lips quirked") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening lines, satisfying the test. However, causality remains weak: the blackout enables Elara's plan but she faces no on-page reversal or tightening—allies appear on cue, the quill holder unlocks every mechanism without friction, and dawn nears with revolution "simmering" rather than landing a decisive change. The ending offers conceptual repricing ("the cradle of sparks had kindled true") but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture, injury, or relationship severed that makes a before/after legible with felt price. Under a situational or accumulative lens, pressure should crystallize stance or a pattern should break with cost; neither occurs on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The luminous fort's phosphor veins and twilight blackout frame the action, but spatial choreography grows vague—Elara moves from battlements to eastern garden to grand vault to parapet without clear distances or barriers that constrain tactics. The half-painted sundial's angles and the quill holder's prongs offer micro-setting specificity, yet their mechanics (how grooves decode via "refracted shadow-play") remain abstract. The blackout functions as enabler rather than obstacle, and the environment's glow "teases back to life in patches" without altering Elara's choices in the final third.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (spark revolution) is signaled early but never tightens—Elara encounters no failed attempt, no guard who doubts, no Overwarden countermove. The "unexplained blackout" is revealed as rebel-anticipated, erasing potential friction. By midnight "clusters formed in alcoves" off-page; the escalation is told rather than dramatized. The ending's "poised for ignition" offers Charged Poise in name only—no on-page moment crystallizes a trade-off or forecloses a live option with visible cost. Agency reads as seamless execution rather than decision under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "cradle of sparks" motif recurs throughout, but the final image ("the cradle rocked gently onward") asserts resonance rather than reweighting prior material through a non-literal turn. Thematic statements appear directly: "silent revolution's first breath," "intrigue's web sprawling unseen," and the closing "The end sparked anew" summarizes rather than dramatizes the central question. The piece gestures at complexity (hoarding power, vigilant lock sentinel turned saboteur) yet resolves into a tidy success without moral friction or ambiguity that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated ("winking hush," "velvet gloves," "sly grin") throughout, creating a consistent stylized texture but little modulation under pressure—peak beats (vault unlocking, ally handoff) maintain the same ornate register as exposition. Elara's perceptual signature is generic competence without character-specific bias in what she notices. Brief dialogue with Mira ("Forty-seven northeast, at the hush of one") is functional but carries no subtext or goal pursuit beyond information transfer. Filter verbs ("she traced," "she withdrew") cluster in high-density passages without clear voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Severe text-artifact penalties apply. Paraphrase loops pervade: "winking hush" appears in paragraphs 4, 13, 24, and 37; "cradle of sparks" in 9, 15, 24, 38; "calmly inventive" in 1, 10, 16, 37. Template cadence dominates with repetitive "[Subject] [past-tense verb], [gerund phrase]" stems across 20+ sentences. Stock metaphors accumulate without tension: "thief in velvet gloves," "twilight's sly grin," "shadows conspiring." The final paragraph stacks scaffold sentences—"The winking hush deepened," "Her motivation fulfilled in flickers," "Twilight faded, but the hush endured"—that restate closure rather than dramatize it. Figurative density (metaphor in nearly every line) obscures rather than sharpens action in peak beats, triggering overwriting penalties per Q7 guidance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise (lock sentinel uses coded mechanisms to spark rebellion during blackout) offers genre competence but no fresh synthesis—sundial codes and hidden crystals are familiar steampunk/fantasy devices. Emotional and tactical turns feel templated: competent protagonist executes plan without friction, allies appear on cue, revolution spreads off-page. The "winking hush" tone and "calmly inventive" trait are declared rather than embodied through specific, non-obvious choices. Transformation test: plot and arc function identically with different names and objects, indicating insufficient particularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara as "vigilant lock sentinel" appears throughout and her access to locks drives multiple beats (sundial, vault), satisfying setup and development gates. However, her decisions feel pre-determined—no moment where she hesitates, recalibrates tactics after failure, or chooses between competing goods. She observes, decodes, and distributes without on-page friction, lowering causal pressure. The role is essential to the mechanics but swappable with "rebel engineer" or similar without altering emotional or thematic stakes. Late penalty does not apply (present from opening); causal pressure and cost connection are weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder appears in four beats: introduction (paragraph 7), sundial decoding (10-13), vault unlocking (19-20), handoff to Mira (25). It enables key actions (unlocking concealed compartment, threading conduits, passing to next node), satisfying setup, development, and closure participation. However, the holder's mechanics remain abstract ("prongs locked into painted grooves," "refracted shadow-play") and its use feels interchangeable with any "coded key" device. Specificity is gestural—engraved wards and heirloom status are mentioned but never constrain a choice or impose cost. Causal pressure is moderate; irreplaceability is low.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"The cradle of sparks" recurs as metaphor in paragraphs 9, 15, 24, and 38 but never alters tactics or imposes constraint—it names the rebellion's heart rather than shaping on-page choices. The igniter crystal extracted from the sundial's base (paragraph 15) operationalizes the concept briefly, yet the crystal's use ("spark leaped, silent and blue") is told rather than dramatized with cost. Setup gate met (introduced early); development weak (no middle choice constrained by it); closure participation ornamental (final paragraph echoes the phrase without reweighting stakes). Swappable with "nexus of resistance" or similar without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Calmly inventive" appears as label in paragraphs 2, 10, 16, and 37 but never constrains action—no moment where invention fails, calm cracks under pressure, or the trait forces a visible trade-off. The attribute describes Elara's execution (aligning quill holder, twisting counterclockwise) rather than enabling a choice another character couldn't make. Setup met (early signal); development and closure participation are label-only. Cost connection absent; specificity and irreplaceability negligible.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Intrigue" frames the narrative and recurs explicitly in paragraphs 8, 13, 23, and 34. It enables key beats (coded sundial, whispered handoff, "intrigue's web sprawling") and Elara's motivation hinges on it. However, the action itself lacks specificity—"intrigue" could swap with "conspiracy," "subterfuge," or "covert signaling" with minor edits. The trait shapes setup and development but does not redefine options at closure; the ending's success feels inevitable rather than contingent on this exact action. Causal pressure moderate; irreplaceability low.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "coded angles in a half-painted sundial" appear in paragraphs 5-6 (discovery), 11-12 (decoding via quill holder), 20 (angles match vault keyhole), and 26 (rubbings shared). The method is signaled early, drives two distinct beats (sundial → vault), and mechanics matter (forty-seven degrees northeast, twenty-three west). However, the process remains abstract—"refracted shadow-play" and "grooves" are gestured at rather than made legible. The method could swap with any "hidden schematic" without fundamentally altering stakes. Setup, development, and closure gates met; causal pressure moderate; cost connection weak (no moment where angles mislead or fail).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "luminous fort at twilight" anchors all action and the blackout enables the plot. The phosphor veins and battlements appear throughout, satisfying setup. However, the setting functions as backdrop—no moment where fort layout constrains tactics, where Elara navigates a locked passage, or where proximity to guards alters her choices. Spatial choreography (eastern garden, grand vault, parapet) is vague; distances and access remain untracked. The blackout is told as "unexplained" yet "anticipated," erasing friction. Closure participation weak (final image generic: "fort waited, poised for ignition").</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "unexplained blackout" is present throughout, signaled in the opening and sustaining until "dawn neared" (paragraph 28). It enables Elara's covert moves and frames urgency ("buying time as plans solidified"). However, the timeframe imposes no visible constraint—no clock counts down, no moment where dawn's approach forces a rushed choice or error. The blackout is revealed as rebel-engineered (paragraph 13), lowering its pressure. Setup and development gates met; closure participation ornamental (dawn is mentioned but does not trigger the ending beat). Causal pressure and cost connection weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"To spark a silent revolution" is declared in paragraph 8 and echoed in 24, 27, 31, and 38. The motivation drives Elara's actions (sundial decoding, vault access, ally coordination) but is never tested by competing desire, doubt, or on-page cost. No moment where revolution risks exposure and she must choose between safety and mission. Setup met; development present (multiple beats serve the goal); closure participation weak (success asserted rather than earned with visible forfeiture). Friction between want and cost absent; the motivation reads as premise rather than dramatized stake.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Winking hush" appears explicitly in paragraphs 4, 13, 24, and 37, and the tone of covert, playful competence ("sly," "winking," "hush") pervades. However, the tone remains static—no modulation under pressure, no moment where hush threatens to break or winking confidence falters. The final image ("winking eternally," "Elara smiled, sentinel eternal") repeats rather than reweights the tone. Setup met; development weak (tone does not shift to charge a turn); closure participation ornamental. The tone is coherent but does not escalate or charge the ending with cost.</comment>
