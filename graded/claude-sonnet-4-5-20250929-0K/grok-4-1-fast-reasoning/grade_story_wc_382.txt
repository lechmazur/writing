<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to learn the building language is clear and sustained, but her interior life relies heavily on abstraction ("motivation burned fiercely," "heart raced") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to demand full teaching feels unmotivated by prior on-page struggle; she interrogates Harlan but we see no cost or hesitation that would make her demand feel earned. Harlan remains a cipher—his "mysteriously familiar" smile and patient manner are labels, not dramatized contradictions. The "agreed upon lies" frame is told rather than shown through competing impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when adequately by the Victorian on Elm Street, and the rooftop meteor scene provides a clear closure unit where Harlan confesses and hands over the seal. However, the escalation relies on Elara's sudden interrogation rather than prior causal pressure; her week-by-week suspicion is summarized, not dramatized in choices that narrow options. The closure—Elara speaking to the building—lands as a Decisive Change, but the cost (what she forfeits or risks by speaking) is asserted rather than shown. The lens reads Causal with summarized ellipses rather than motivated linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Victorian's groans, Harlan's cluttered parlor, and the rooftop garden are vivid and purposeful. The meteor shower backdrop and night-blooming jasmine create atmospheric pressure for the confession. However, the antique seal and the buildings' "murmurs" remain largely decorative; the seal's inscriptions are described but never constrain a choice on the page. Spatial choreography is clean (door, parlor, rooftop) and sensory detail is selective, but the setting does not materially shape Elara's interrogation or Harlan's capitulation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning the building language—is signaled early and sustained. The rooftop interrogation provides one turn when Harlan confesses, but Elara's agency in forcing that turn is told ("she interrogated," "grasping his wrist") rather than shown through tactical choices under pressure. No on-page cost accompanies her demand; Harlan's capitulation feels convenient rather than hard-won. The weeks of tea sessions are summarized, missing the escalation that would make the final confrontation inevitable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of hidden languages and "agreed upon lies" emerges through image and event rather than statement, and the seal's warmth ("pulsed like a heartbeat") charges the handover. However, the final phrase "and it replied in kind" asserts thematic payoff without showing what Elara says or how the building's reply alters her. The "lies dissolve" moment is dramatized but lacks friction—no counter-reading or ambiguity complicates the revelation. The story avoids overt moralizing but the ending tilts toward summary rather than resonant image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with consistent narrative distance. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("dust motes in sunlight," "living breath of edifices"), and the free indirect style is clean. Dialogue when present ("Tell me the truth, Professor") serves goal pursuit and carries subtext. However, perceptual signature is thin—Elara's noticing does not vary with stress, and interior phrasing occasionally slips into abstraction ("motivation crystallized"). The prose rhythm modulates appropriately from summary (tea sessions) to scene (rooftop), but lacks the sentence-level variance that would elevate pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is largely clear, but several paraphrase loops dull momentum: "agreed upon lies" appears three times with similar phrasing, and "patiently nimble" recurs as a label without evolving. The rooftop interrogation suffers from summarized beats ("she interrogated further," "his facade wavered") that tell rather than show tactical moves. Figurative language is frequent ("streaks of fire," "cosmic glow") but not overwritten. The final image ("and it replied in kind") is abstract when a concrete sensory detail would sharpen closure. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she suspected," "she'd recount") reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise of sentient buildings and a dead-language tutor who hears them offers a fresh angle, and the "agreed upon lies" frame has potential. However, the emotional arc—weeks of veiled suspicion resolved by a single rooftop confession—follows a familiar trust-and-reveal template without transformation through specific lived detail. The antique seal and meteor shower are vivid but feel assembled rather than inevitable. The final image of fluent speech to the building is asserted rather than rendered with enough specificity to feel earned in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Harlan (dead language tutor) is present from the sugar-borrowing through the rooftop confession and his decision to hand over the seal drives the final turn. However, his choices are reactive—he answers the door, dismisses theories, then capitulates—rather than creating pressure. His confession is summarized ("I was a linguist once") rather than dramatized through competing wants. Present across beats but swappable with any "keeper of secrets" mentor figure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The antique desk seal appears in three beats: sealing session notes, tracing it in his pocket during the rooftop scene, and pressing it into Elara's palm at closure. Its brass lion's head and inscriptions are vivid, and the handover charges the ending. However, the seal does not constrain a choice—it is transferred without cost or resistance. Its "warmth pulsed like a heartbeat" is asserted rather than tied to a visible price. Functional reprise but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Agreed upon lies" is named explicitly and frames the weeks of tea sessions where both pretend Harlan's knowledge stops at parchment. The rooftop turn ("our lies dissolve") dramatizes their collapse. However, the concept is told more than shown—we never see Elara or Harlan make a tactical choice constrained by maintaining the lie. It functions as thematic label rather than stake-shaping pressure. Present in setup and closure but not in middle choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" appears three times as a descriptor for Harlan's hands working the seal and weighing Elara's words. It is vivid but label-only; no on-page moment shows patience or nimbleness constraining or enabling an action with cost. The trait could be replaced with "careful" or "deliberate" without structural impact. Ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Interrogate" is named four times and structures the rooftop climax where Elara presses Harlan for truth. The action drives the confession and seal handover. However, the interrogation itself is summarized ("she interrogated further," "under her relentless questioning") rather than shown through specific questions and resistances. Present in closure and causally important, but the mechanics are told, limiting irreplaceability. Strong functional role but execution is summary-dependent.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Borrowing sugar (opening door) blossoms into weekly tea sessions that deepen the bond and set up the "agreed upon lies" frame. The ritual is signaled early and recurs, shaping middle beats and priming the rooftop turn. However, the tea sessions are summarized ("week after week") without showing a single session's tactical choices. The method enables the relationship but does not constrain the final interrogation. Solid setup and development, weaker closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during the Perseid meteor shower provides the closure scene's setting and atmosphere. Meteors mirror urgency and the building groans "in harmony," intensifying pressure. The garden's blankets and jasmine are vivid. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's interrogation or Harlan's response—the conversation could occur elsewhere with minor edits. The meteor shower charges the mood but does not alter tactics. Atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to learn the language of old buildings" is signaled in the opening paragraph and sustained across beats: moving into the Victorian, seeking Harlan's help, and demanding full teaching at closure. The motivation drives her interrogation and the final act of speaking to the building. However, the friction between desire and cost is told rather than shown—no on-page moment where learning the language forces her to forfeit something else. Strong thematic spine but lacks dramatized sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is named explicitly in Harlan's smile and their bond ("as if they'd shared secrets in another life," "mysteriously familiar as kin"). The tone recurs and modulates from the opening borrowing to the rooftop revelation. However, it functions as atmospheric label rather than pressure—the mystery does not constrain choices or charge the final image with undeniable cost. Coherent and purposeful but not indispensable to closure.</comment>
