<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is driven by clear motivation (proving kindness endures) and his insomnia is embodied through trembling fingers and methodical hope. The final shift to sleep is earned by the night's revelations and the ripple of small acts below. However, interiority leans heavily on label-speak ("methodically hopeful," "primal warmth") and the visions function more as exposition than contradiction-driven choices under pressure. The stranger who fed him and the night-shift worker are mentioned but never tested on the page, weakening relationship-as-crucible potential.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (rooftop greenhouse, waxing moon, insomniac painter). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: saffron ink, lost glyphs, and moonlight build density until the final image of strangers lighting windows and Elias sleeping reconfigures the stakes. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): his insomnia retreats, strangers respond, and the night's warmth carries forward with felt cost (months of sleeplessness, doubt now quieted). One slight weakness: the visions cascade without on-page resistance, reducing friction before the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse supplies ferns, orchids, and smog-fogged panes that frame Elias's world and constrain his art to plant-derived inks. The moon-tipped brush drinks light and ignites daydreams, a tactile object that charges the climax. Saffron ink, rice paper, and the greenhouse as womb anchor the final image. The smog-choked city below provides contrast and the tenement windows become responsive setting elements. Spatial choreography is clear (panes facing the city, sprawling glyphs, Elias curled among pots).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: prove strangers remember kindness. The visions (trader, healer, old woman, night-shift worker) deepen the question and the multiplying window-lights provide a tightening that validates Elias's quest. The final image of strangers carrying warmth outward and Elias sleeping reconfigures his doubt with visible cost (months of insomnia, now ending). One limitation: the escalation is mostly internal and visionary; no on-page reversal tests Elias's commitment or forces a trade-off. The tension accumulates without a peak choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (kindness as self-perpetuating through language and memory) emerges through the lost glyphs, the cascade of visions, and the strangers' window-lights responding without proclamation. The final image—Elias dreaming of "chains unbroken" and strangers carrying warmth—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No moralizing; the piece commits to saffron quiet. One minor slip: "proving kindness remembered itself through souls adrift" in the penultimate paragraph borders on theme-echo, though it remains poetic rather than diagnostic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable and close to Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is artist-specific: "saffron quiet," "tentative leaves," "conspirators." Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, matching the contemplative tone. Weak points: recurring template cadence ("Elias, methodically hopeful," "the brush's tip," "moon-tipped brush") and filter-verb stack in the vision sequence ("came a vision," "recalled," "watched," "seemed to hum") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. No dialogue to assess. Overall voice is distinct but sacrifices propulsion for texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often successful ("fogged by distant factory haze," "curling like tentative leaves," "saffron diffusing in broth"). Clear loops and template artifacts appear: "methodically hopeful" repeated verbatim, "moon-tipped brush" x3, and parallel "Stroke by deliberate stroke, methodically hopeful" construction. The vision cascade uses similar stems ("First came," "Generations later," "Daydreams cascaded"). Filter-verb stack ("came," "seemed," "felt," "watched") in the climax reduces immediacy. Line-level clarity is generally strong, but density and repetition drag momentum in the final third. −0.6 for loops and template cadence; −0.3 for filter-verb cluster.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise (lost languages preserve kindness across epochs, accessed via moon-brush visions) is fresh and the saffron-quiet tone is memorable. Transformation is solid: the insomniac artist angle and rooftop greenhouse setting particularize the material. Risk is present in the lyric, visionary structure. Weaknesses: the visions feel ornamental rather than dramatically tested, and the strangers' responses (old woman, night-shift worker) are coincidental recognitions rather than choices under constraint. The piece leans on atmospheric texture rather than earned causality, limiting ingenuity in escalation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias arranges inks, traces glyphs, paints larger on panes, and watches strangers respond—functional beats across setup, middle, and ending. His choices (to paint, to sprawl glyphs across panes) enable the night's transformation. However, no on-page reversal or trade-off tests his commitment; the visions cascade without resistance. Present in closure (he sleeps, dreaming). Cost is visible (months of insomnia now ending). Swappable with "artist" or "dreamer" with minor edits. −0.5 for swappability; −0.2 for lack of a tightening choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The moon-tipped brush is handled in setup (carved ebony, crescent tip), dipped into ink, hovers during visions, pulses with gold, cools as moon wanes, and lies ready at the end. It enables the moonlight-vision mechanism and charges the climax when moonlight amplifies through it. Present in or shaping closure (the glyphs it inscribed provoke the strangers' responses; it lies ready for tomorrow). Cost tied to it: the gift from the stranger sustains him, and its use tonight resolves his doubt. Irreplaceable due to its moon-stone tip. −0.4 for late signal of its unique properties (the light-drinking crescent isn't leveraged until the visions); −0.3 for being a convenience gift rather than a tool he earned through prior struggle.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lost languages are the core mechanism: Elias traces glyphs from crumbling tomes, the visions show traders and healers inscribing mercy in that tongue, and the glyphs on the panes "hum" to bridge strangers' kindness. The concept shapes his quest and the final proof. Present in setup (he pieces the language from archives), middle (he paints the glyphs), and ending (the symbols pulse, strangers respond, "lost languages lived again"). Cost: his doubt is resolved, insomnia ends. Causal pressure: the act of writing the lost language triggers the visions and the strangers' recognition. −0.8 for being told rather than tested; the visions are exposition, not a choice under constraint. −0.3 for swappability (any "forgotten art" could serve with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" appears as a label four times but never constrains a choice with visible cost on the page. It describes his approach (arranging jars, tracing glyphs) but does not create friction or force a trade-off. No beat where hopefulness costs him speed, resources, or precision. Late mention in the final third ("methodically hopeful rhythm of revelation") reads as scaffold. −0.8 for label-only use; −0.6 for not shaping an on-page action with cost; −0.4 for appearing in summary rather than dramatized beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Rouse" appears in the visions (strangers "roused" by glyphs), in the city (strangers "stirred from fitful slumbers"), and in the ending (insomnia "roused to retreat"). It is thematically present and ties the strangers' awakening to Elias's own. However, it is not a discrete action that Elias performs; it is an effect of his painting. The action could be "awaken" or "stir" with no structural change. Present in closure (insomnia retreats, strangers rouse). −0.9 for being an outcome rather than a protagonist choice; −0.5 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Daydreams sparked by moonlight are signaled early (moon's glow, moon-tipped brush), triggered mid-scene ("A shiver ran through the stone crescent, igniting daydreams"), and cascade through visions of caravans, healers, and strangers. The mechanism matters: the visions provide proof of enduring kindness and resolve Elias's doubt. Present in closure (the visions validate his quest; he sleeps dreaming of "chains unbroken"). Cost: the visions banish insomnia. Causal pressure: without the moonlight-daydream link, no revelation occurs. −0.6 for the mechanics being told in summary ("daydreams sparked by moonlight") rather than shown through contradictory perception or sensory breakdown.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse supplies ferns, orchids, potting bench, rice paper floor, and glass panes. The smog-choked city below provides contrast and the tenement windows supply the strangers who respond. The greenhouse frames the night's work and the panes become the surface for his sprawling glyphs. Present in setup (he slips into the greenhouse), middle (he paints on the floor and panes), and ending (he sleeps among the pots, the greenhouse a "womb of glowing symbols"). The setting constrains his materials (plant-derived inks, moon-tipped brush) and charges the final image (greenhouse as sanctuary, city below responding). Cost: isolation above the smog, vulnerability to the moon's visibility.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The waxing moon is present in the title beat, crests higher mid-scene, triggers the daydreams, and wanes slightly at the end. It provides a narrative clock: the night progresses as the moon moves. The moon's light is the enabling condition for the visions and the strangers' responses. Present in setup, middle (cresting), and ending (waning, dawn approaching). The timeframe tightens Elias's window for revelation. −0.7 for not creating a hard deadline or forcing a tactic shift; the moon simply moves without consequence if he paints faster or slower. −0.4 for being atmospheric rather than pressuring.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is dramatized in setup ("to prove strangers remember kindness, that fleeting mercies echo beyond the self"), tested through his painting and the visions, and resolved when the strangers' window-lights answer and his insomnia retreats. The motivation is conflicted: doubt gnaws ("did such gestures linger...or fade"). Cost is visible: months of insomnia, the night's labor, and the vulnerability of hoping. Present in setup (his quest burns), middle (he paints to invoke proof), and ending (proof crystallizes, he sleeps). −0.5 for the visions providing validation without forcing a choice between competing desires; the friction is internal doubt rather than a trade-off under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Saffron quiet" anchors the opening line, recurs in "saffron ink," "saffron diffusing in broth," and "saffron quiet affirmations," and charges the ending ("smoggy blush," "tranquil certainty"). The tone modulates with pressure: trembling hope, cascading visions, gentle drowsiness. Coherent through turns and present in the final image (the greenhouse as womb, Elias sleeping). The tone is not static; it tightens during the visions and softens at closure. Cost tied to tone: the quiet is earned through months of sleepless nights and the night's revelation. −0.4 for one instance of stock phrasing ("saffron diffusing in broth") that risks cliché.</comment>
