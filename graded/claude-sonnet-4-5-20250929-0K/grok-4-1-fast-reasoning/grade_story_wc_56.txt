<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias remains an abstraction throughout—"errant legend seeker" label never translates into contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. His "trained instincts" and "thoughtfully clear mind" read as competence assertions rather than embodied struggle; no genuine risk of failure shapes his salvage operation. The final smile and "understanding complete" flatten into epiphany without visible cost or path foreclosure. Interiority consists of stock folklore-seeker claims ("architecture of lies," "hindsight clarity") recycled across beats without differentiation under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation debt accrues: "by the silence of morning radio" never anchors time-of-day or causal trigger past ornamental metaphor; the canal setting drifts without spatial grounding until the wreck appears. The salvage itself—lowering into mud, extracting crates, finding the twin sundial—unfolds as a checklist without reversal or cost; no option narrows, no tactic shifts. The closure image ("understanding complete," dual sundials as weight) asserts thematic arrival but offers no on-page decisive change, earned stasis with visible price, or conceptual repricing; the before/after is declared, not dramatized. Drive lens remains ambiguous between accumulative pattern (motif recurrence) and causal pursuit, never cohering at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The twilight barge canal supplies atmospheric description ("mist clung," "velvet indigo," "overhung willows") but does not constrain a single choice or tactic on the page. The mudflats, wreckage, and eddying currents are narrated passively; Elias gauges and probes without friction from the environment. The sundial's shadow and the wreck's inscription function as plot tokens rather than environment-driven pressures. Spatial choreography remains vague—barge position, pole mechanics, water depth are asserted generically, never grounding the reader in lived-in particulars that alter action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to understand the architecture of lies"—is declared early but never tested by a live choice with visible cost. The salvage proceeds without reversal: Elias finds exactly what the legend promised, no complication narrows his options. The wreck yields parchments and the twin sundial in sequence; no discovery forces a trade-off or reweights prior assumptions. Agency at closure is absent—he simply "decoded" and his "understanding complete" is a summary claim, not an earned stance crystallization or renunciation with on-page price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Architecture of lies," "hindsight clarity," and "serene upheaval" recur as prompt-label motifs without transforming through specific action; the final inscription ("Time reveals the frame; lies collapse at dusk") explicates theme rather than letting the image resonate. The dual sundials function as symbolic tokens, present in the final beat but not reweighted by prior particulars—they appear, are pocketed, and their "weight" is asserted without embodied consequence. No earned insight emerges from specific struggle; the ending summarizes thematic arrival ("his understanding complete") in place of a non-literal answer grounded in scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("serene upheaval," "architecture of lies," "scaffolds where stories propped up illusions") that clashes with the practical task of poling a barge and salvaging wreckage. Perceptual signature is generic: "thoughtfully clear," "trained instincts," "hindsight clarity" repeat without character-specific filtering. Purposeful compression is attempted in fragments like "By training instincts" and "By the silence of morning radio," but the pattern is neither taught early nor paid off at closure—these openers read as stylistic tics rather than voice-motivated structure. POV remains stable but lacks distinct texture; Elias's way of noticing is interchangeable with any treasure-seeker archetype.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "thoughtfully clear" / "hindsight clarity" / "serene upheaval" recur across beats without added pressure; "by training instincts" appears three times as a template opener. Stock metaphors ("mist clung to the water like unspoken regrets," "shadows into velvet indigo") stack without specificity. Synonym churn around "architecture of lies" / "intricate scaffolds" / "submerged scaffolds" restates the concept without advancing it. The closure paragraph loops: "serene upheaval lingered" after already declaring "his understanding complete" and "motive fulfilled." Filter-verb stacks ("remained thoughtfully clear," "sensing the pull," "caught the dying light") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Information density is low—most sentences restate mood or theme rather than advancing situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The errant legend-seeker archetype and treasure-salvage frame are familiar; the twin-sundial twist and "architecture of lies" motif add ornamental specificity but do not transform the underlying template. The ending's epiphany ("understanding dawned not in pursuit, but in patient recovery") and the inscription's moral ("Time reveals the frame; lies collapse at dusk") read as thesis statements rather than earned, non-obvious synthesis. The barge-canal setting and folklore angle are mildly fresh, but the emotional arc—skeptic finds proof, gains clarity—proceeds without risk or surprise. No bold structural or perspectival choice elevates the premise; the piece hedges toward atmospheric mood over causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Setup present (first paragraph identifies Elias as "errant legend seeker"). Middle development weak: his label is repeated but no on-page choice or constraint arises from this identity—he observes, poles, salvages without friction. Closure participation ornamental: "No longer errant" is a summary claim, not a dramatized shift. Swappable with "treasure hunter" or "relic seeker" without structural impact. No specific cost tied to "errant" status.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup early (sixth paragraph, "antique pocket sundial" in pocket). Development: catches light, casts shadow pointing to wreck—one causal beat. Closure linkage: twin sundial found, both pocketed, "their weight a serene upheaval." Lyric reprise (early mention → final weight) reweights the stake moderately. However, the sundial's mechanics (shadow as anomaly pointer, inscription reveal) feel convenient rather than irreplaceable; a map fragment or compass could substitute with minor edits. Caps at mid-band for two beats plus closure mention but swappability remains.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Setup implied (early reflection on "sifting folklore from fraud"). Middle: mentioned abstractly in multiple reflective beats ("hindsight clarity now pierced his thoughts," "architecture of lies was temporal") but does not constrain a live choice. Closure: "he'd reclaimed the core concept of hindsight clarity from legend's deceptive depths" is a thematic claim, not a dramatized shift in options. Treated as label motif rather than stake-shaping force. No visible cost tied to the concept itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully clear" appears as a label in multiple beats ("his thoughtfully clear mind," "thoughtfully clear vision") but never enables or constrains an action with visible cost. No tradeoff dramatized—Elias's clarity is asserted, not tested. Missing middle development: the attribute does not shape a choice under pressure. Closure participation ornamental: "thoughtfully clear vision pierced ahead" restates the label without reweighting it. Swappable with "focused," "disciplined," or "alert."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup present (wreckage spotted mid-story, salvage decision made). Development strong: two distinct beats—lowering into mud, probing wreck's ribs, extracting crates and sundial. Closure linkage: "he'd salvaged more than relics" ties the action to thematic arrival. Causal pressure moderate: salvage is the vehicle for discovery, though no complication or cost emerges from the act itself (mud and snags mentioned, not dramatized as obstacles). Irreplaceability partial: "retrieve" or "recover" could substitute with minor tonal shift.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setup weak: "trained his instincts meticulously" appears early as background claim. Development: "By training instincts" recurs as a stylistic opener in three beats (gauging water depth, easing barge closer, final decoding) but the mechanics of this method never constrain or enable a choice—Elias simply succeeds each time without friction. Closure participation: "By training instincts, he'd salvaged" summarizes but does not dramatize the method's cost or payoff. Template-cadence artifact; swappable with "by experience" or "by skill."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setup early (second paragraph, "twilight barge canal" anchors location). Development: canal supplies the wreck (mudflats, submerged hull) and atmospheric description, but does not constrain a tactical choice—Elias poles, lowers, salvages without environmental friction. Closure linkage: "twilight barge canal fading behind" is a spatial closing image, not a reweighted pressure. Moderate causal role (one beat: wreck location in mudflats) but replaceable with "river," "marsh," or "lagoon" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"By the silence of morning radio" appears once in the second paragraph as an atmospheric cue, never anchoring time-of-day causally or reappearing. Does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time; "twilight" dominates the temporal frame instead, creating inconsistency (morning silence → twilight action). Missing middle development and closure participation. Ornamental mention; swappable with "at dawn" or deletion without impact. No cost or tactical constraint tied to this timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Setup strong: "to understand the architecture of lies" declared in fourth paragraph as "burning motivation." Development weak: desire is restated in reflective beats but never conflicts with a cost or alternate want on the page—Elias pursues the wreck without friction, trade-off, or visible price. Closure: "motive fulfilled" is a summary claim, not a dramatized choice between competing goods. Told-only motivation; no on-page friction between this desire and another stake.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" recurs across beats as a tonal label ("gentle upheaval in the air," "Serene upheaval stirred within him," "Serene upheaval lingered") but the tone itself remains static—no modulation with pressure. The oxymoron is asserted rather than embodied: scenes proceed calmly without felt upheaval (no emotional spike, no tactical scramble). Closure linkage present ("a calm storm propelling his barge") but the tone does not charge the final image with undeniable pressure. Swappable with "quiet intensity" or "calm resolve."</comment>
