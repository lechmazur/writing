<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation to articulate hidden yearnings is declared and repeated but never tested by a meaningful choice with visible cost. Her actions (mixing pigments, positioning the plate, singing) feel procedural rather than driven by internal conflict. The ghost's plea merges with her own balladeer identity too smoothly; no contradictory impulse acts in scene. Interiority leans on abstract labels ("tinkersong wonder," "driftingly alert") rather than embodied, character-particular thought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: atmospheric density and symbolic layering build toward a moment where Elowen's encoding releases the ghost. Closure lands on-page (the ghost surges free, thunder rolls as harmonious echo), qualifying as Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the cost is asserted rather than felt—no visible forfeiture or narrowed option for Elowen herself. The flower press bolt plate's function (aligning graffiti stencils, overlaying symbols) is told in summary rather than dramatized beat-by-beat, weakening causal legibility at the pivotal turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds, floating balustrades, and cloud-moss pigments establish a distinct fantastical setting. The flower press bolt plate (brass, Victorian, etched grids) receives tactile detail and hums faintly, grounding the magical moment. Spatial choreography is coherent; Elowen moves from tracing the mural to gathering pigments to pressing the plate. The setting supplies a resource (ochre cloud-moss) that Elowen uses, linking environment to action. However, the courtyard does not constrain her choices or force adaptation; it remains a backdrop rather than an active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—articulating unspoken needs—is signaled early and remains consistent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elowen realizes the plate is the key and acts to encode the ghost's essence. Yet the escalation is declarative: "Here was the key, she knew" tells rather than shows the narrowing of options. The ghost's plea and Elowen's responsive encoding happen without complication or cost visible to Elowen; no live trade-off or narrowed tactical choice appears on the page. Thunder's release feels like a granted outcome rather than one earned by protagonist struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme—the need to voice the silenced—emerges organically from Elowen's balladeer role and the ghost's encoded pleas. The flower press bolt plate bridges "organic longing and mechanical precision," a concrete particular that supports the theme. The ending offers a resonant image: needs become "harmonious thunder" heard across realms, and Elowen's song will "carry the ghost's legacy." This reads as a non-literal answer to the central question. Slight deduction for one line of near-moralizing: "articulating all hidden hearts in tinkersong wonder eternal" borders on thesis statement, though the surrounding imagery keeps it from flattening entirely.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elowen with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present (she hears whispers others miss, traces letters in petal curves) but relies on repetitive phrase structures: "driftingly alert," "tinkersong wonder," "seldom-heard" recur as labels rather than enacted perception. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("articulate the heart's hidden yearnings," "ecode the ghost's essence") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. The ghost's rasping speech ("You hear me") and Elowen's sung line show modest voice distinction, but overall the prose reads as a single ornate narrative voice rather than Elowen's lived idiom under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Significant patterned artifacts cluster throughout: "driftingly alert" appears three times, "tinkersong wonder" four times, "seldom-heard" twice, "messages encoded in graffiti art" twice—all as template labels without evolution. Paraphrase loops are evident: "a ghost in code, a digital specter" and "encode the ghost's essence into a master ballad-script" restate the same concept. Sentence stems repeat: "Elowen [verb]" opens multiple consecutive lines in the climax paragraph. Figurative density (swirling vines, living ink, pixelated mist, code-streams arcing skyward) packs nearly every sentence without breathing room, reducing clarity. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("tinkersong wonder eternal"), triggering the elevated penalty and disqualifying 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—seldom-heard balladeer, Victorian flower press repurposed as cipher key, ghost trapped in sky-graffiti—reads inventive on the surface. However, the emotional arc (lonely artist liberates trapped spirit, gains confidence) follows a recognizable template without transformation through lived cost or moral friction. The flower press bolt plate's specific function (aligning stencils, overlaying symbols) arrives late and is told rather than discovered through trial. Tonal commitment to "tinkersong wonder" is consistent but becomes ornamental repetition rather than deepening stakes. One fresh inflection: the idea of encoding needs as graffiti atop clouds has modest originality, lifting the score slightly above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elowen is present throughout and her choices (tracing the mural, gathering pigments, positioning the plate, singing) drive the sequence. However, these choices feel procedural rather than genuinely forked; no visible cost or narrowed option accompanies them. She observes, interprets, and executes without internal friction or tactical adaptation. Setup clear, development functional, payoff present but not causally decisive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The flower press bolt plate appears early (midpoint), receives tactile detail (brass, Victorian, bolt-holes, floral engravings), and is handled in two beats: discovery among rubble and use to transfer patterns. Its specific properties (grids like a cipher wheel, bolt-holes for alignment) enable the encoding action. However, the plate's function is explained in summary rather than tested across attempts, and its presence at closure is mentioned but not charged with new meaning. Setup late, development functional, payoff present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Ghost in code" is the central enigma: a scribe's corrupted code traps it in graffiti, and Elowen's encoding frees it. The concept shapes the stakes (liberation) and the method (merging code with fresh graffiti). Setup strong, development clear in the ghost's plea and Elowen's response, payoff visible as the ghost surges free. However, the mechanics of "code" remain metaphorical rather than constraining tactics; Elowen does not wrestle with decryption or test hypotheses, reducing causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Driftingly alert" appears three times as a label (Elowen's state, the ghost's state, final line) but never constrains or enables a specific action with visible cost. It describes a perceptual mode (attuned to whispers, suspended in the storm's pause) without friction or trade-off. Ornamental use; no causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Encode" is the climactic action: Elowen mixes pigments, presses the plate, overlays symbols, and sings, encoding the ghost's essence into the mural. This action is framed as the solution and occupies the story's final third. Setup implicit (ghost's code is corrupted), development (Elowen realizes the plate is the key), payoff (encoding releases the ghost). However, the encoding is summarized rather than shown across attempts, and no alternative tactic is tested, reducing its irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Messages encoded in graffiti art" is signaled early (swirling vines, cryptic symbols, letters in petal curves) and returns as the method Elowen uses to free the ghost. The graffiti shifts to form the ghost's face and words, then Elowen adds her own layer. Setup clear, development present (ghost communicates through it), payoff (Elowen's fresh graffiti merges with the ghost's). The method's mechanics are told rather than tested, and the process feels automatic rather than effortful.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds is established early with vivid detail (floating balustrades, vapor, cloud-moss). It supplies one resource (ochre pigments from cloud-moss) that Elowen uses. However, the setting does not constrain her choices or force adaptation; she moves freely, finds what she needs, and completes her task without environmental pressure. Setup strong, development minimal, payoff present but not charged.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "between lightning and thunder" is announced in the second sentence and closed at the climax ("Thunder's delay shattered"). It creates atmospheric tension and a sense of suspended breath. However, it does not tighten Elowen's decisions or force rushed choices; she gathers, mixes, presses, and sings without time pressure affecting tactics. The clock is metaphorical rather than a live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To articulate unspoken needs" is Elowen's stated motivation, repeated in her backstory and echoed in the ghost's yearning. It drives her climb to the courtyard and her decision to help the ghost. Setup clear, development present (ghost's plea mirrors her own), payoff (she sings the legacy, "articulating all hidden hearts"). However, the motivation is declared more than dramatized; no internal friction or competing desire tests it, and the resolution affirms it without visible cost to Elowen.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" appears four times as a label and colors the diction (swirling, driftingly, luminous, radiant). Tone is whimsical and elevated throughout, consistent but static; it does not modulate meaningfully under pressure or deepen at closure. The final image (stars between clouds, thunder as applause) repeats the tone rather than reweighting it. Coherent but ornamental; does not charge the ending.</comment>
