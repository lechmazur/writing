<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to excavate abandoned dreams is declared but never tested by a competing want or visible cost. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("helix-minded," "synaptic plasticity") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The transformation is summarized through metaphysical mechanics rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The final "vow" arrives without forfeiting a live option on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Elara is and what concrete problem she faces remain vague past the opening third, and "profound transformation" functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a ticking constraint. The drive lens wavers between accumulative (cascading dream-fragments) and causal (mirror modification), never stabilizing. Closure reads as a declaration ("no dream abandoned") without visible cost or a before/after choice that forecloses a path. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies, and the closure unit lacks felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon supplies vivid sensory anchors and the periscope mirror recurs with shifting meaning, but neither constrains a choice that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent (ledge, crevice, canyon floor), yet the environment remains a stage for internal monologue rather than a pressure that narrows options. Micro-setting (the mirror) charges the ending image but does not force a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cataloging abandoned dreams—is signaled early but never tested by a competing need or visible obstacle. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows Elara's options; the mirror's "modification" unfolds as wish-fulfillment without friction. The canyon's "quaking reverie" intensifies atmospherically but does not escalate pressure or force a trade-off. Agency is absent: no decision forecloses a path with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme of reclaiming abandoned dreams is stated repeatedly ("archeologist of abandoned dreams," "no dream abandoned") rather than emerging from concrete action. The helix motif recurs but functions as ornamental pattern rather than constraining choice or reweighting prior material. The final monument-building is asserted without demonstrating what was risked or lost. Thematic echo in the vow ("no dream abandoned, all helices restored") replaces scene pressure with prompt-like summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited, but diction drifts into elevated register ("synaptic plasticity," "helical excavation," "entangled archives") that exceeds plausible on-page thought for a character under stress. Perceptual signature is present (helix motifs, fractured light) but syntactic stems repeat mechanically ("Elara's attribute," "The core concept," "Profound transformation"). No dialogue. Psychic distance shifts are unintentional, oscillating between close interiority and distant narration without purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Heavy template cadence: "Elara's [noun]," "The [noun] [verb]," "Chaotically precise" recur across a dozen lines, creating drumbeat monotony. Paraphrase loops proliferate ("synaptic plasticity" restated five times; "profound transformation" four times; "entangled memories" three times). Figurative density ("helix," "entangled," "quaking," "cascaded") appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, obscuring cause/effect at the closure beat. Artifacts touch the ending ("transformation complete"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The premise—neural interface with collective memory—follows a familiar template (psychic archaeology, synaptic modification) without transforming it through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "helix-minded engineer" and "periscope mirror" feel assembled to check prompt boxes rather than organically necessary. The ending ("helixed toward infinity") retreats into abstraction. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −1.0 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that narrows options or creates a turn. The "helix-minded" trait is labeled repeatedly but does not constrain action. Setup present, development is summary-only (willing synaptic change), closure is declarative vow without decision cost. Cap 2.8 (missing middle development as dramatized choice). Ornamental use −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The broken periscope mirror appears in three beats: salvage, angling toward crevice, final "mended" state. Setup early, development via positioning (no cost), closure cameo (mirror "whole in her entangled perception"). Specificity is generic (any reflective surface could substitute). Swappability −0.6, summary-only transformation −0.5. All three gates barely present but pressure minimal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Entangled memories" are described extensively but never constrain a choice or tactic; they cascade as visions without altering Elara's options. Setup early, development is atmospheric, closure reprise ("disentangled yet forever linked") is thematic label. Ornamental use −0.8, late closure participation as summary −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Chaotically precise" is labeled five times but never enables or constrains an on-page action with visible cost. Setup present, development is assertion ("her fingers trembling yet exact"), closure absent. Label-only trait −0.6, no cost connection −0.4. Cap 2.8 (missing closure participation).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Modify" appears in setup (intent), development (angling mirror, exhaling intention), and closure (mirror "mended"). Yet the modification is willed rather than enacted with tools or trade-offs; any verb (attune, channel, interface) could replace it. Swappability −0.7, summary-only enactment −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Synaptic plasticity" is mentioned six times but remains a label for the transformation mechanism; no on-page cost or failed attempt demonstrates its mechanics. Setup present, development is summary ("plasticity surging"), closure is asserted completion. Summary-only −0.8, ornamental −0.5. Cap 2.8 (missing dramatized middle development).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon anchors location early and recurs (ledge, crevice, floor, silt). Development: the crevice's pooled moonlight and canyon floor's rover remnants appear, but neither constrains a choice. Closure: the canyon "sighed" and "embraced." Setup +0.5, two beats +0.7, but no causal pressure. Descriptive use without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Profound transformation" is stated three times as backdrop but never functions as a ticking clock or decision window. Setup present, development is repeated assertion, closure ignores it. Ornamental use −0.8, no tactical constraint −0.6. Cap 2.8 (missing closure participation).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>"To become the archeologist of abandoned dreams" is declared early and restated at closure ("archeologist of abandoned dreams, spiraled into legend"), but no on-page friction tests it against a competing want or cost. Setup +0.5, closure reprise +0.5, but told-only without conflicted choice. Summary-only −0.7, no visible cost −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" recurs as descriptor (canyon air, shadows, final monument), establishing a dreamlike tone. Setup early, development via atmospheric intensification, closure charges the monument. However, tone remains static rather than modulating with pressure. Single static mood trends mid-low; closure linkage lifts slightly but lacks dynamic range.</comment>
