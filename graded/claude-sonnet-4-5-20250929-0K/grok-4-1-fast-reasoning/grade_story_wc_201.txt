<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior is dominated by abstract concepts ("mathematics of mercy," "fractal convergence") rather than embodied contradiction. Her enhanced proprioception is label-only; we're told it maps bark ridges "like a lover's scars" but this never constrains a choice or creates visible cost. The trauma responses are mechanical recitations of torture rather than simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final "rising" feels unmotivated—no prior choice earned her release, so the ending reads as convenient closure rather than a path foreclosed with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: Who, where, and when anchor by the second paragraph (passing). The drive lens is ambiguous—textural density suggests Accumulative, but the plot tries for causal turns via "remembering through trauma." Closure form is unclear: does she solve the equation, accept her state, or simply stand up? The final line "no longer a ghost but a map etched in her enhanced flesh" reads as conceptual assertion without on-page cost or a legible before/after in options or stance. The strap's etched equations appear only in the penultimate paragraph, resolving a puzzle the reader never saw her wrestle with.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is vividly described with "twisted trees pulsed with violet veins" and "phosphorescent soil," but it remains atmospheric backdrop. The forest "responds" by "flickering patterns" and "hushed, violet light softening," yet these changes do not alter Elara's options or tactics—she braces against a tree, then stands. The strap and her body function as micro-setting elements, but neither constrains a choice that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal narrows her options; she intends to remember, she remembers via convulsions, she reads etchings, she rises. The trauma flashbacks are sequential exposition, not escalating pressure that forces a trade-off. Agency at closure is absent: the forest "computed her release" and she simply "rose," with no visible cost or path foreclosed by her decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme of mercy as mathematical integration is stated repeatedly ("Integral of pain over time, bounded by rooted displacement") rather than arising from concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes: "mercy no longer a ghost but a map"—thematic echo in prompt-like language. The ultraviolet penance motif recurs but does not shift meaning; it remains a decorative concept. No earned insight emerges from a specific on-page struggle; the codex she "glimpsed" is told, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara. The prose carries a distinct elevated register ("proprioceptively enhanced," "ultraviolet penance," "fractal convergence") that reads consistent but not character-particular—more concept than lived voice. Psychic distance is consistent but lacks perceptual signature; her noticing is filtered through abstract terminology rather than selective bias. No dialogue on the page. Filter verbs ("felt," "remembering") appear frequently but voice-motivated, so no major penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dense figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff: "anesthesia ebbed like a receding tide," "world ablaze in invisible fire," "sins etched in flesh," "compass for memory," etc. (−0.6 for figurative density). Paraphrase loops: "braced against a throbbing trunk" / "Elara braced harder" / "brace anew" / "Bracing fully" / "bracing one last time" recycles the same physical act without advancing pressure (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("invisible fire," "lover's scars") and register drift into academic jargon ("proprioceptively," "fractal convergence") clash with urgent scene needs (−0.3). Cumulative artifact penalty touches the closure beat ("bracing one last time"), so −1.3 total and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—enhanced interrogation survivor with proprioceptive enhancement in an ultraviolet forest—combines speculative elements but does not transform them through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "mathematics of mercy" remains abstract decoration. Emotional specificity is minimal; trauma responses are told in summary flashback rather than enacted choices. The ultraviolet penance doctrine and fractal convergence read as prompt-fulfillment tokens rather than organic synthesis. No bold structural risk; the piece follows a linear waking-remembering-rising arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Enhanced interrogation survivor: Present in setup (paragraph one), drives flashback exposition in the middle, and she "rose" at the end. But her choices do not create turns—she passively receives memories and reads etchings. No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. Functional but replaceable; the arc could work with any trauma survivor. Setup + Payoff gates met, but no Development choice. Cap at ~6.0 per gate model, then apply swappability (−0.8) and ornamental use (−0.5): baseline ~4.7, adjust down to 3.2 for lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Pewter mask strap: Introduced in paragraph five ("clutched in her fist"), "weight a trigger pressed to her thigh" mid-story, and "etched them into memory" at the end. Three touches across beats. Setup + Development + Payoff gates met, eligible for ≥6.1. However, the strap's etchings appear only in the penultimate paragraph, resolving a problem it did not help create (−1.3 cap at 3.0). Contradiction: it does recur and carry meaning. Split the difference: gates met but late-breaking solve; score 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Ultraviolet penance: Framed in paragraph six ("their doctrine"), recurs in flashback ("UV lamps flaring"), and the forest's "ultraviolet canopy" mirrors it at the end. Present across all three gates. It shapes the interrogators' tactics in backstory but does not constrain Elara's present choices—she braces, remembers, reads. No on-page cost tied to UV exposure now. Lyric reprise reweights the premise (UV penance → UV harmony), so eligible for ~6.3, but lack of present causal pressure and summary-only middle use (−0.8) lower it to 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Proprioceptively enhanced: Introduced paragraph three, appears in seven paragraphs, including the ending ("skeleton as a living equation"). Setup + Development + Payoff gates met. However, it remains label-only—told that her proprioception "maps bark ridges" and "charts the interrogator's flinch," but no on-page action where the trait enables or constrains a choice with visible cost. Swappable with generic "heightened awareness" (−0.8). Strong closure linkage (+1.0) and beat involvement (+0.9) raise baseline, but label-only use (−0.6) caps practical score at 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Brace: Signaled early (paragraph seven), recurs in six distinct beats ("braced against," "brace anew," "braced fully," "bracing one last time"), and shapes the ending image. Setup + Development + Payoff gates met, eligible for ≥6.1. Beat involvement (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.0), early signal (+0.5) suggest ~8+ range. However, the action is static—she braces to endure, not to make a decision that narrows options. No causal pressure (bracing does not alter tactics) and repetitive loop (−0.4 per Q7) reduce irreplaceability. Score 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Remembering through trauma responses: Signaled paragraph twelve ("she would remember through trauma responses"), demonstrated in middle beats ("first response hit," "another spasm," "trauma surged"), and "final trauma echo" at the end. Setup + Development + Payoff gates met, eligible for ≥6.1. Beat involvement (+0.9) and closure linkage (+0.7). However, the mechanics are summary-only—"her shoulders locked," "legs buckled," "spine wracked"—without showing how the convulsions yield the equation. The method resolves the puzzle it did not help create (−1.3 cap at 3.0 conflicts with gates met). Apply the higher of gate-eligible ~6.0 or solve-cap 3.0: final 4.7 for middle-ground functional use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest: Setup (paragraph two), "forest responded" mid-story, and "forest hushed" at closure. Gates met. The canopy "flickering patterns—branch angles mirroring neural fractals" is vivid but does not constrain her choices—she could brace anywhere. The forest "hushed" at the end implies external validation, not a resource or obstacle she navigates. Lyric reprise present (+0.8), but no causal pressure (−1.0) and ornamental in middle (−0.5). Score 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>After the anesthesia wears off: Timeframe anchors the opening ("anesthesia ebbed") and implies a recovery window. Present in setup, but no middle or ending beat references elapsed time or a tightening clock. Missing Development and Payoff gates; cap at 4.6 for missing setup alone is incorrect (setup is present), but missing middle Development caps at 3.4. No on-page pressure from time. Score 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>To discover the mathematics of mercy: Motivation stated paragraph nine, recurs in flashback ("demanding the math"), and the ending claims she "solved" it. Setup + Payoff gates met (middle is backstory exposition, not a present choice Development). Eligible up to ~6.0 per two-gate allowance. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicting choices—no friction between wanting the answer and a cost she must pay now. Summary-only use (−0.8) and no present-scene trade-off lower to 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Displaced rooted: Tone keyword "displaced" in paragraph four and "rooted" in paragraphs four, thirteen, and final line ("Rooted yet free"). Setup + Payoff gates present. The tone oscillates between disorientation and grounding, modulating with her memories, and charges the final image's paradox. Coherent modulation (+0.8), closure linkage (+1.0), but static mid-story—no tonal shift that reweights a beat. Missing strong Development gate; apply small penalty (−0.3). Lyric reprise eligible for ~6.3, so score 5.7.</comment>
