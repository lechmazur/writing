<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is legible—grief drives him to build a homing signal—and his patchwork past justifies the compulsion. However, his choices lack meaningful internal contradiction; he proceeds methodically without a competing want or fear testing his commitment. The censer vibrating and midnight voices direct him externally, reducing agency to obedience. Embodied emotion surfaces in "tears carving clean tracks through grime," but much of his interiority relies on abstract geography-of-loss metaphors rather than moment-to-moment sensory struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (Elias, signal station, post-hydraulic failure). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: nightly calls and incremental tower construction layer toward the final beacon ignition. Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (villages rekindling, reverse migration flowing) with visible cost—Elias's tears, his lingering solitude, the station's transformation—legible in the final image. One deduction: the voices and censer mechanics function as convenient external guides, softening the protagonist's on-page agency and the felt cost of his labor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The starlit station, rusted antenna, sea, and salvaged driftwood ground the setting vividly. The censer foot in its brazier cradle constrains the final beat and charges the closure image when it pulses and glows. Spatial choreography is clear (tower rising, Elias on the perch, silhouettes on distant shores). Minor gap: occupational detail (hydraulics, coils, solder) is gestured at but not leveraged to complicate a choice or reveal expertise under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—calling the lost home—is signaled early and tightens through the nightly build sequence. Escalation reads as density increase: moon phases align, calls grow denser, the structure rises, culminating in the beacon's ignition. The closure image (villages flickering, returnees drawn) forecloses the path of isolation with cost (his tears, his ongoing solitude). One weakness: external voices script each step, reducing the protagonist's on-page trade-offs; the cost of his labor (exhaustion, scars aching) is told more than dramatized in a pivotal moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—reverse migration, loss as navigable geography, ghosts as guides—emerges from action and the censer/beacon mechanics without overt moralizing. The final image (fires kindled, "steady reclaiming") offers a resonant answer with cost (Elias's ongoing solitude, his smile "into the stars"). The patina censer foot returns with reweighted meaning (relic → compass → signal amplifier). One slip: "he'd woven ghosts into guides" edges toward summary statement rather than letting the image speak alone, and "raw solace" appears as a label in early and late paragraphs without fresh embodiment at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance contracts appropriately under pressure. The voice carries a poetic, elevated register ("mosaic of old burns," "foxfire," "patina gleam") that suits Elias's role as navigator but occasionally drifts into writerly diction ("fluctuations syncing with the lunar swell"). Dialogue is minimal (phone voices) and voice-distinct ("frame the base," "twist left under gibbous"). One deduction: filter verbs ("watched," "lingered") and passive constructions ("was meant to amplify") dilute immediacy in high-pressure beats. Perceptual signature is consistent but abstract, favoring metaphor over sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance setting, action, or theme. Rhythm varies purposefully (short beats during calls, longer paragraphs during reflection). Paraphrase loops appear: "raw solace" recurs without evolution; "patchwork" (navigator, life, body) is synonym-churned across early paragraphs; "geography of loss" and "loss's geography" toggle without added meaning. Template cadence in construction beats: "He scavenged... lashing... under starlight" and "wound the coils... align to the censer's hum" read formulaic. Figurative density ("stars wheeled," "foxfire," "threads") is high but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor: "piecing worlds from loss's threads" conflates weaving and cartography awkwardly. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—signal station + ancestral relic + ghost voices guiding construction + lunar-driven tech—is specific and non-generic. Reverse migration as enacted, embodied longing rather than demographic trend is fresh. The cryptic-phone-call mechanic and censer-as-lodestone add ingenuity. One friction: the ghost-voice device (late father, sister) leans on familiar tropes (guiding spirits, midnight calls from the dead) without a sharp twist. The ending's optimism (villages rekindling) feels slightly convenient given the scope of urban exodus. Transformation test passes: plot requires these exact details.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout; his decision to build the beacon is signaled early and drives all beats. He scavenges, lashes, winds coils, lights the brazier—each action advances the structure. His choices, however, are largely directed by external voices; internal conflict is minimal. The closure image ("smiled into the stars") reflects his stance but does not hinge on a final on-page decision that forecloses an alternate path with visible cost beyond what the prior beats already paid.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The censer foot appears in beat one (pocket, faint incense, lodestone hum), beat two (vibrating, "urging him onward"), middle beats (thrums stronger, syncs with moon), and the climax (mounted, pulses wildly, glows, amplifies signal). Its properties (fluctuates with moon phases) directly enable the beacon. Removing it would break the signal mechanism and the ancestral-thread motif. Strong integration; one gap: the foot's final state (cooling in dawn) is told rather than shown affecting a subsequent choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Reverse migration is framed early ("guiding the weary back from concrete hives") and the beacon's purpose is to call returnees. The closure image (silhouettes turning, fires kindled) enacts the concept on the page. However, the concept shapes theme more than it constrains tactics; Elias's construction steps do not face opposition from urban pull or logistics of return. The concept is essential to stakes but does not generate mid-story friction or tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The censer's lunar fluctuation is introduced early ("humming faintly on waxing nights, spinning wild under the full orb, silent in wane") and governs the build sequence: vibrating under crescent, thrumming half-full, pulsing wildly at full moon. This trait directly enables the timing and power of the signal. Removing it would collapse the lunar-mechanical linkage. One weakness: the attribute is told and reinforced rather than tested—Elias never misjudges the phase or pays a cost for misalignment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The action "build" structures the entire middle: scavenging driftwood, winding coils, mounting the censer, lighting the brazier. Each sub-action is dramatized and each advances the signal's construction. The climax hinges on completing the build and igniting it. Removing "build" would leave only the calls and the ending image without causal linkage. One gap: the build itself faces no material obstacle (no structural failure, no missing part) that would force a tradeoff or test ingenuity under constraint.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cryptic midnight calls are introduced early ("old rotary phone... crackled to life as the clock struck twelve") and recur across three beats, each providing construction instructions. The method is specific (rotary phone, midnight timing, gravelly/cadence voices) and necessary—without them, Elias's design would lack guidance. The final call ("Light it, navigator") triggers ignition. One friction: the calls arrive conveniently on schedule without cost (no missed call, no contradictory instruction) and Elias obeys without doubt, reducing friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The starlit signal station is present from the opening and shapes every beat: the rusted railing, frozen antenna, shack with rotary phone, perch above the sea. The setting supplies salvage materials (driftwood ribs, antenna guts, hydraulic wreckage) that enable the build. The isolation and elevation charge the beacon's visibility. Removing the station would break the story's logic. One gap: the setting does not actively resist or test Elias (no storm, no structural instability) beyond the initial hydraulic failure, which is backstory.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hydraulic failure is the inciting condition ("after the hydraulics failed") and frames the timeframe—Elias works in the post-failure window. The story tracks lunar phases (crescent sharpening, moon half-full, eve of full moon, moon waned) which pace the build and closure. The timeframe enables the lunar-censer mechanics. One weakness: the hydraulic failure itself does not recur or complicate later action; it is a setup rather than an ongoing constraint. Elapsed days are implied but not counted, softening urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to navigate the geography of loss" is introduced early and embodied: Elias fled urban grind, seeks to call scattered families home, carries grandmother's relic. The beacon project directly enacts this desire. The closure (villages rekindling, returnees) fulfills the motivation on the page. One gap: the motivation is dramatized through construction and the final image but lacks internal friction—no competing want (e.g., to rest, to abandon hope) tests his commitment or forces a trade-off mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Raw solace is signaled early ("Raw solace lay in this pull, a gritty comfort amid grief's vast terrain") and modulates: aching labor, voices of the departed, tears at ignition, smile at dawn. The tone integrates grief and hope without tidy resolution. The final image ("solace raw and real," "mended heart") charges the ending. One deduction: "raw solace" is labeled twice (early and late) without fresh embodiment in the closure beat itself; the tone is told as much as shown in the climactic moment.</comment>
