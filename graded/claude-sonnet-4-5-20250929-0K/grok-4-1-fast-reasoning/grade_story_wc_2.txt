<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "befriend uncertainty" is stated early but remains largely abstract; his decisive shift comes through finding journals rather than a hard choice between competing goods. The compass rose triggers action more than internal contradiction does. Interiority leans toward poetic declaration ("uncertainly certain") rather than embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. The final laugh and crumbling certainties offer closure, but the arc feels more like confirmation of a thesis than a painful trade-off with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elias finds journals rather than treasure, validating the embrace of uncertainty. The piece follows an accumulative lens—pattern (clocks stopping at 3:17) triggers investigation, discoveries layer toward the final reweighting—and the lens holds. Cost is more philosophical than visceral; no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page. Orientation is clean by ~120 words. One meaningful deepening (journals over gold) reweights the premise, meeting baseline scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall, mist, and fissure choked with vines all constrain movement and charge atmosphere throughout. Spatial choreography remains clear across workshop, ledge, greenhouse, and chamber. The compass rose glowing and aligning with runes on the chest ties setting detail directly to the closure discovery. Sensory details (roar, spray, soot) filter through Elias's focus and shape his route choices, satisfying the micro-setting and constraint tests.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Elias can embrace unpredictability—is signaled early and tightens when coincidence becomes pattern. Pressure accumulates through layered clues (watches, compass, greenhouse, chest) rather than a confrontation with clear alternative paths. The final journals reweight the goal from treasure to philosophy, but no on-page decision forces Elias to sacrifice a competing want or resource. Under the accumulative lens one deepening suffices, yet the cost remains conceptual rather than felt in tactics or relationship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars: clocks, compass rose, Admiral Thorne's philosophy, and the final journals all explore certainty versus chance. The ending offers a resonant answer—"direction lies beneath the ashes of failed plans"—without overt moralizing, though the admiral's journal quote borders on thematic statement. The compass rose with non-cardinal directions and the shift from treasure to wisdom create earned subtext. No prompt-label intrusion in the final paragraph; the waterfall as "timeless witness" closes with image rather than thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, and a consistent contemplative register anchor the narration. Diction choices like "uncertainly certain" and "befriend uncertainty in planning" recur as motifs but risk label-speak rather than dramatized perception. The perceptual signature—Elias filtering through gears, springs, and tools—remains distinct. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (zooming in on the compass rose, widening for the waterfall's roar). Minor filter-verb reliance ("his heart raced") is acceptable within voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with purposeful figurative language ("mist… like forgotten thoughts," "ash"). Two noticeable issues: the phrase "uncertainly certain" and its variants appear four times, creating a template cadence loop around the core concept; the sentence "He embodied uncertainty certainly, convinced that with precise planning…" tangles its own syntax. No major paraphrase loops or scaffold, but the recurrence of the coined phrase in peak beats (opening, mid-point, climax) triggers the template-cadence penalty (−0.4 to −0.6 in Q7). Information density is high; momentum is steady.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The broken-clock tinkerer in a subterranean workshop offers fresh texture, and the compass rose pointing to "Doubt's Drift" and "Fate's Fork" rather than cardinal directions is a memorable detail. The core premise—embracing uncertainty through a treasure hunt that yields philosophy—leans on a familiar epiphany arc (treasure → wisdom). The Admiral Thorne backstory and the greenhouse fissure add specificity, but the emotional progression and final insight feel anticipated rather than surprising. No close echo of famous work; the synthesis is competent but not startling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout; his decision to pry open the timepiece (setup), follow the compass through the waterfall (development), and close the journals with laughter (payoff) all hinge on his role as tinkerer. He makes key turns. His choices alter tactics across three beats. The tinkerer identity enables tool improvisation (quartz screwdriver, hairpin lock pick) with visible consequence. Cost is tied to his old certainties crumbling, though the price is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The compass rose is found at ~25%, spins to guide Elias through the waterfall, and glows to align with the chest runes at closure—three distinct beats. It directly shapes route and discovery. Its swirling, non-cardinal directions ("Doubt's Drift") embody the story's theme and make it irreplaceable. Removing it would collapse the middle and final acts. High causal pressure and closure linkage; the specificity of its etched directions adds unique constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The phrase "beneath the ashes" appears in the villagers' rumor, the geothermal blaze remnants, and the admiral's journal quote at the end—early seed, middle encounter, final reprise. It directly shapes Elias's tactics (brushing away ash to find the chest) and is reweighted in the closing philosophical turn. The concept constrains the search and charges the closure image, though it could be swapped for another metaphor (e.g., "under the ruins") with moderate edits. Two gates plus lyric resonance lift it into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Uncertainly certain" is introduced in paragraph three as Elias's trait and recurs in four beats (opening reflection, improvisation with vines, decision to trust the twist, final crumbling certainties). It labels his internal conflict but remains abstract; the trait does not force a visible on-page trade-off where certainty costs him something tangible. The phrase enables his improvisation decisions, but those choices feel more like confirmations than struggles. Present across beats but not irreplaceable—"cautiously brave" or "hesitantly bold" could substitute. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Improvise" is named in the motivation and enacted three times: lashing vines with clock springs, using a hairpin to pick the lock, and knotting roots for a quicker return route. Each improvisation advances the plot and reflects Elias's shift toward uncertainty. The action is essential to middle progression and closure participation, though "adapt" or "invent" could replace it with minor tonal shift. Two beats plus closure presence; causal pressure is moderate. Solid mid-to-upper band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "swirling leaves" in the "neglected greenhouse" appear at ~40% (late setup) and recur as Elias pushes through them to reach the chamber, then again on his quicker return route. The leaves block the path and force improvisation (vine lashing), directly shaping tactics. The greenhouse setting is specific and irreplaceable for the explorers' backstory. Two beats with causal work; closure participation is indirect (quicker route mention). Just over the two-gate threshold with moderate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall is anchored in the opening line, supplies mist that "drowned out the ticking," conceals the ledge entrance, and remains present as "timeless witness" in the final line. It constrains movement (Elias must step through spray), provides sensory pressure throughout (roar, gusts), and charges the closure image. The waterfall shapes at least three choices and reappears with reweighted meaning at the end. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity make it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"When coincidence becomes pattern" is introduced at ~15% (five watches stopping at 3:17), triggers Elias's investigation, and is named again when he pauses over the naval timepiece. The shift from fluke to pattern drives the inciting decision and middle escalation. It does not tighten a live countdown or alter tactics under time pressure; instead it functions as a conceptual trigger. Three beats with moderate causal work; closure participation is thematic (the admiral's quote echoes it). Solid upper-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To befriend uncertainty in planning" is stated in paragraph four, drives Elias's decision to pry open the timepiece, and recurs in his self-talk ("trusting the twist") and final fulfillment ("alliance with uncertainty"). The motivation is present across four beats and shapes key choices, but it is told more than dramatized in conflicted action. No on-page moment where befriending uncertainty costs him a clear alternative path. The desire enables plot but remains abstract. Mid-band with closure participation.</comment>
