<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "salvage something pure" is stated but rarely tested through contradictory impulses in scene. Her actions follow a smooth procedural arc—kneel, trace, murmur, peer, analyze, command—without embodied hesitation or cost that would reveal character under pressure. The final retrieval of the locket feels awarded rather than earned by internal conflict. Interiority leans on abstract claims ("motivation burning fierce," "guilt woven into the dream's fabric") instead of concrete, contradictory sensory experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: cameo visions layer until the mate's betrayal coalesces. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The closure unit—Elara extracting the locket and the ghosts sighing into peace—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (purity salvaged, windows sealed), but the cost is asserted ("ghosts sighed") rather than shown through a specific forfeiture or tactical shift on Elara's part. One meaningful deepening occurs when cross-threading reveals the mate's treachery, satisfying the length requirement, yet the final beat lacks a visible price that alters Elara's options or stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glacier-ice shrine with candle flames and silver refraction is vivid and purposeful. The melted snow globe's viscous pool serves as the ritual's focal object, constraining Elara's method (she peers into it, places it at the altar). Spatial choreography is clear: shrine, altar, globe at heart, ice walls. The shrine's cold and candle-light charge the tone and frame the ritual, meeting the micro-setting test by shaping the final image ("candle drips," "borrowed starlight's gentle fade").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—salvaging purity from wreckage—is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs as cameos accumulate and cross-thread to expose betrayal, a meaningful deepening that narrows focus to the mate's treachery. However, the mate's confession and the locket's emergence feel mechanically triggered by Elara's command rather than a choice that forecloses a live option. The cost of binding the mate or weaving truth is told ("ghost writhed") but not dramatized as a trade-off with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of salvaging innocence amid betrayal emerges from the cameos and the twin lockets, avoiding overt statement. The child's locket as "symbol of the purity Elara sought" leans toward label-speak, yet the contrast between the mate's malice and the child's untouched lineage offers thematic weight. The final image—"purity endured"—risks a tidy moral but is anchored by the specific locket and the ghosts' release. Subtext operates in the dream-threads and the "weave" metaphor, though the closure could offer a sharper non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent elevated register with mythic cadence ("borrowed starlight," "captured constellations," "veins of quartz in the glacier's glow"). POV distance is stable third-limited, focusing on Elara's perception and ritual actions. Psychic distance tightens during the cameo visions, appropriately. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract explanatory mode ("guilt woven into the dream's fabric," "truth coalesced") that flattens immediacy. No dialogue present; perceptual signature is coherent but somewhat uniform across beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dense figurative language pervades most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties ("breath fogging the air like borrowed starlight," "shattered vow," "twisted into windows of connection," "thread by thread," "veins of quartz"). Mixed metaphors appear: the globe's "sticky rim" and "viscous pool" clash with "windows of connection" and "veins of quartz." Register drifts into explanatory abstraction at peak beats ("truth coalesced, not as a shout but a careful weave"). Template cadence in the cameo sequence: "First came...," "Next...," "Deeper she delved...," "A child's spirit cameo..." Paraphrase loops: "expose" and "exposing" recur; "salvage" appears four times. Cumulative artifact penalty in Q7: −1.2; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ghost-whisperer premise and dream-cameo method offer a fresh angle, yet the execution leans on stock Gothic imagery (glacier shrine, ghost ship, melted snow globe, locket) without strong transformation. The betrayal plot—jealous first mate sabotages for the captain's lover—is familiar and resolved mechanically. Emotional specificity is limited; the "pure bonds" versus "treachery" binary lacks moral ambiguity. The transformation test suggests the arc would survive generic substitutions. Within-band risk distinction is not earned; unconventional choices do not heighten stakes or coherence beyond surface novelty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (kneeling, placing the globe, murmuring invocations, peering into visions, commanding the mate) drive the ritual's progression. She appears early (setup gate met), her actions enable middle beats (analyzing cameos, cross-threading), and she commands the final exposure (closure gate met). However, her decisions are procedural rather than high-stakes; the mate's confession is triggered by her command, not a dilemma that alters her tactics. Cost tied to Elara's choices is asserted ("binding him") but not dramatized with visible consequence. Two beats clearly involve her agency (cross-threading, commanding), meeting functional integration, but swappability remains moderate—another ritual specialist could execute similar steps.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The melted snow globe is handled early (salvaged from wreck, traced, placed at altar), used in multiple beats (peering into its pool, visions shimmer within, globe reforms around locket), and reappears at closure with reweighted meaning (sealing windows of connection). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. The globe's warped state and viscous pool enable the cameo visions, constraining Elara's method and shaping the ritual's mechanics. Its reformation around the locket charges the final image. Irreplaceability is moderate—another scrying object could substitute with edits—but the melted condition and "sticky rim" are specific. Cost connection present: the globe's closure seals the ghosts.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Windows of connection" is introduced early ("twisted into windows of connection") and returns at closure ("sealing the windows of connection"). The concept frames the ritual's stakes—linking living and lost—but functions more as thematic labeling than on-page constraint. Middle beats focus on cameo mechanics without the "windows" language altering tactics. At closure, sealing the windows accompanies the locket's retrieval, a purposeful reprise that reweights meaning. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is weak (the concept is not invoked to enable or constrain a choice). Lyric-resonance allowance applies: early seed → final reprise scores in 5.5–6.3 range when return reweights stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is stated early ("She wove truth carefully, never yanking spirits...") and echoed at closure ("her words threading through his denials"). The trait is presented as a method—coaxing rather than forcing—but its constraint is told, not shown. No on-page moment dramatizes a cost where haste would shatter souls or where careful weaving forecloses a faster, harsher option. The mate's confession arrives after Elara's command, not as a result of visible weaving technique under pressure. Setup gate met; development and payoff gates weak. Label-only friction: −0.6; late thematic echo without middle causal work: −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Expose" is the climactic action: Elara exposes the mate's treachery ("'You poisoned the beams for spite,' she exposed"), which triggers his confession and allows purity to emerge. The action is present at closure (payoff gate met) and follows the cross-threading analysis (development gate met). Setup is implicit in the ritual's goal but not labeled early. The exposure redefines options—ghosts can now be freed—but the mate's capitulation feels mechanically convenient rather than hard-won. Two beats involve the action (cross-threading → exposure), meeting functional integration. Swappability moderate: "reveal" or "confront" could replace with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method—analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams—is signaled early ("drawing forth visions from strangers' dreams") and structures the entire middle sequence. Elara peers into the globe, catalogs cameos (captain's, passenger's, child's), notes cues (averted eyes, shadowed grins), and cross-threads them to map betrayal. The method shapes her attempts (analyzing, not forcing) and enables the final exposure (drawn from dream cues). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. Specificity high: the dream mechanics and "cameo" framing are unique. Three distinct beats involve the method. Irreplaceability strong—removing dream analysis would collapse the ritual's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice is introduced in the opening line and frames the ritual throughout. Spatial elements—altar, ice walls, candle flames, silver refraction—charge the tone and are mentioned at closure ("shrine hushed save for candle drips"). The setting provides the ritual space and sensory texture (cold, light, echoes) but does not pressure Elara's choices; she could perform the ritual in another mystical locale with minor edits. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development weak (the shrine does not supply a resource or constraint that alters tactics). Micro-setting charge present in the final image. Swappability moderate: another sacred space could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to salvage something pure from the wreckage" is stated early ("her motivation burning fierce") and governs the ritual's goal. Elara seeks the child's locket as the pure artifact, and its retrieval at closure satisfies the desire. The motivation is present in setup, implied in middle choices (analyzing cameos for purity vs. malice), and fulfilled at payoff. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no on-page moment shows Elara tempted to abandon the search or forced to trade one value for another. Cost is asserted ("ghosts sighed") but not tied to a visible sacrifice by Elara. Functional integration across beats, but friction between wants and costs is weak.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Borrowed starlight" appears early ("breath fogging...like borrowed starlight") and recurs at closure ("borrowed starlight's gentle fade"), providing a lyric frame. The phrase charges the shrine's ethereal tone and modulates subtly—bright at the ritual's ignition, fading at resolution—but does not tighten with pressure during peak beats. The tone is coherent and supports the mythic register, yet it remains static rather than escalating or contrasting under stress. Setup and payoff gates met; middle modulation weak. Lyric-resonance allowance applies: purposeful reprise reweights the ending image, scoring in upper 5s to low 6s.</comment>
