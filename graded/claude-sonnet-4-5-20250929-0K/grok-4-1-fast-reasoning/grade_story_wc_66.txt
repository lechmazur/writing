<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to teach dust storytelling is established but remains abstract throughout; her micro-choices (tuning the radio, singing lyrics, copying scores) repeat without internal contradiction or escalating cost. The interiority relies heavily on thematic declaration ("she believed, dust held the oldest tales") rather than embodied tension. Her triumph when receiving a response lacks prior struggle or visible trade-off that would make the moment earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Orientation is severely delayed—who Elara is, where the alcove sits, and what the story famine means remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The closure (dust now tells stories, ending the famine) is asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost; we see no on-page consequence or foreclosed path. The piece reads accumulative/textural but lacks a decisive pressure turn or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ember alcove, mist, and radio dial glow create atmosphere, but remain largely postcard descriptions without constraining Elara's choices. The dust swirling in response to the broadcast is vivid yet ornamental—it illustrates theme rather than forcing tactical shifts. Spatial choreography (alcove, desk, radio) is coherent but generic; no tool or micro-setting element charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (teaching dust to tell stories) is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or escalating cost. The "patrol drones hummed distantly" and "pursuit loomed" mention danger without on-page confrontation or tactical pressure. The broadcast succeeds without reversal or visible price; Elara's "cloak held" convenience flattens what could have been a turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (stories as survival, dust as memory) is stated repeatedly ("teach dust to tell stories," "famine receded") rather than emerging from dramatic particulars. The final image—dust veils dancing free—gestures at resonance but offers no non-literal answer or reweighted cost. The piece delivers a tidy moral (stories endure) instead of ambiguity or earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistently elevated ("thistled calm," "secretly luminous") but occasionally drifts into ornamental register that flatlines under pressure rather than sharpening it. The broadcast lyrics ("dust child, lift your grains to the sky") feel artificial, lacking the idiom of someone who copies orchestral scores. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dense figurative language ("tendrils of fog curled like forgotten melodies," "thistled calm," "secretly luminous") appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the overwriting penalty (−0.5 baseline). Paraphrase loops abound: "copyist preserved symphonies" restated as "her diligent work"; "dust swirling" then "motes rose…swirling." Template cadence runs in paragraph structure ("She [verb]…Her [noun]…") flatten propulsion. Mixed metaphor: "thistled calm" pairs prickly threat with serenity without reconciling the contradiction, reducing clarity in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise (teaching dust to tell stories via pirate broadcast after a story famine) is conceptually novel but executed through stock moves: rogue artist versus patrol drones, mystical dust obeying song, tidy restoration. The broadcast's mechanism and the dust's response lack grounded logic or trade-offs, reading as allegorical convenience rather than lived risk. No bold synthesis or non-obvious moral calculus elevates the material beyond its prompt-like frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her copying/broadcasting actions drive the sequence, but her choices do not create reversals or meaningful cost. Setup early, middle involvement (tuning, singing), but closure is passive observation ("dust now told stories in her stead") rather than a choice that alters her tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The radio dial glow appears in setup (salvaged years ago), middle (tuning, intensifying glow bathing her face), and ending (dimming to secrecy). It enables the broadcast but does not constrain a choice or evolve with reweighted meaning; its presence is functional yet replaceable with any broadcast device.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Pirate broadcast shapes the central action (illegal transmission, cloak, patrol drones scanning) and is present across beats. However, it never forces a tactical shift or visible trade-off; the broadcast succeeds unchallenged, reducing causal pressure. Closure mentions "pirate broadcast had taught…stories could cloak themselves," but this is thematic summary rather than dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Secretly luminous" describes the radio dial glow in multiple passages but functions as atmospheric detail without constraining action or enabling a choice with cost. The glow is label-only; no scene hinges on its secrecy or luminosity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Cloak" appears in two contexts: cloaking her message (via elusive lyrics) and "her cloak held" against scanners. Neither instance dramatizes a cost or trade-off; the cloak succeeds by assertion. The element is present but ornamental, easily swappable with "encrypt" or "disguise."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elusive song lyrics are signaled early ("transforming orchestral notations into verses"), demonstrated in the middle ("dust child, lift your grains," "Thistle whispers"), and mentioned at closure ("lyrics too slippery for algorithms"). The method shapes the broadcast's form and enables evasion, but the mechanics (why dust obeys, why algorithms fail) remain unexplained, and no cost or constraint tests the choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Ember alcove in mist is established in the opening and returns at closure ("In the ember alcove, thistled calm reigned supreme"). The setting provides atmosphere and shelter but does not constrain Elara's choices or supply a resource that alters outcome. Spatial presence across beats without tactical pressure trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the story famine" frames backstory and sets stakes (humanity adrift in silence) but does not create urgency or a live clock. The timeframe is static context rather than a force that tightens decisions; Elara broadcasts at her own pace without temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Her motivation (to teach dust to tell stories) is declared early, repeated across beats, and cited at closure. However, it is never dramatized as conflicted; no scene tests her desire against a competing want or cost. The motivation drives her actions but lacks friction or visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Thistled calm" is a recurring phrase (opening, middle, and ending paragraphs) that labels tone but does not modulate with pressure. The oxymoron (prickly + serene) is asserted rather than embodied through syntax or rhythm. The tone remains static across turns, missing the opportunity to charge the final image.</comment>
