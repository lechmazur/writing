<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "cradle empathy in arms of steel" is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The pivotal "rename" action—whispering "Kaelon the Embracer" into the tessera—relies on mystical mechanics rather than earned internal conflict; no micro-choice costs are visible. Kael's transformation arrives via retrocognitive flood rather than his own agency, flattening the arc. The piece leans on labels ("gentle radical," "aberrant mercy") instead of embodied emotion under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure, but the closure—Kael staggering, weeping, then standing with arms wide—attempts Resonant Reconfiguration without visible cost; survivors approach tentatively but no path is foreclosed on the page. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~150 words, satisfying the test. The "rename" mechanism is introduced late (~60% mark) and resolves the conflict it did not help create, undercutting causality. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara aligns the chips, but the final image ("mending sky," survivors' hands outstretched) declares transformation rather than showing its price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The plaza's "cracked flagstones," "crimson fissures," and the mosaic stepping stone provide vivid anchors. The tessera constrains Elara's method (chipped patterns as retrocognitive keys) and appears in the closure image ("solid underfoot, anchoring the new era"), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Sensory selection is strong ("cold light like frozen blood," "wind sighed") but some details ("weathered mosaic stepping stone" vs. "minaret mosaic tessera") create minor confusion about object identity. Spatial choreography is clear; survivors' movements track coherently.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing the plaza from Kael's rule via aberrant mercy—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Elara whispers the new name, forcing retrocognitive floods to hit Kael. However, the resolution depends on the tessera's mystical pulse rather than Elara's agency under pressure; she kneels, touches, whispers, and the magic does the rest. No visible trade-off or foreclosed path appears; Kael's tears and the survivors' tentative approach declare change without on-page cost. The piece tells us "aberrant mercy reigned" rather than showing what was sacrificed to cradle empathy in steel.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring images: "gentle radical," "aberrant mercy," "arms of steel," "warm coldness." The final image—Elara on the tessera, Kaelon with arms wide, mending sky—attempts to reweight the premise, but the answer is stated ("revolutions cradled in steel outlasted flames") rather than implied. The chipped patterns and minaret motifs recur with purpose, and "aberrant mercy" as non-erasure of sins carries complexity. However, the closing lines ("after the great fire… aberrant mercy reigned—gentle, radical, eternal") summarize the theme instead of letting the scene resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara; psychic distance is consistent. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("voice soft as falling snow yet edged with the promise of upheaval") and maintains elevated diction throughout. Kael's single line of dialogue ("I... embraced fire's orphans") reads naturally under stress. However, perceptual signature is generic at peak moments—"her fingers danced," "her gentle radical heart stirred"—relying on label-heavy interiority rather than character-specific noticing. Compression in the retrocognitive sequences is purposeful and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, with mixed metaphors ("warm coldness—affectionate hatred, tender savagery") that blur rather than sharpen. Template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "She knelt… She saw… She felt… Her fingers…" Paraphrase loops are present: "the tessera's pulse, its fractures mapping the minaret's fall" restates "chipped patterns formed subtle glyphs" without added pressure. The closing sequence stacks scaffold: "The shattered sky flickered… Survivors approached… She had renamed… Her gentle radicalism proved…" Strong verb choices ("wept cold light," "clamping around") appear, but scaffold and overwriting in peak beats (the closure) trigger penalties. Filter-verb density remains moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—retrocognitive trap + mosaic tessera as renaming tool + warlord redeemed via forced empathy recall—is specific and non-obvious. "Aberrant mercy" as embracing sins in steel rather than erasing them offers a fresh angle on redemption arcs. The chipped patterns as retrocognitive keys and the minaret's fall encoded in fractures show ingenuity. However, the emotional template (traumatized seer redeems tyrant via mystical artifact) is widely used in speculative fiction, and the piece does not transform it through lived occupational detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The final image's declarative tone ("eternal," "mending sky") retreats from bold ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (kneeling, tracing, whispering the rename) frame key beats. However, her decisions lack visible cost or internal friction; the tessera's mechanics do the causal work. She observes retrocognitive visions and acts on their prompts rather than making a contested choice that alters tactics. The "gentle radical" label recurs but is told, not shown through contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tessera appears early (~25% mark: "minaret mosaic tessera, chipped at the edges"), is handled in multiple beats (Elara traces patterns, aligns chips, whispers into fractures), and anchors the closure ("solid underfoot, anchoring the new era"). Its chipped patterns enable the rename mechanism and reweight meaning at the end. The object is essential across beats and participates in closure, meeting three gates with causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" is named early and shapes the dominant stake: granting Kael a new identity via his buried empathy. The concept appears in the middle ("aberrant mercy: granting a monster a new identity") and the closure ("aberrant mercy reigned"). However, the mechanics are mystical rather than tactical; the concept is theme-echoed more than it constrains on-page choices with visible cost. It drives one key turn (the rename) but does not alter Elara's options under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is introduced early and constrains Elara's perception throughout: looping memories fuel her motivation, the tessera plunges her deeper, and she sees Kael's boyhood. The trait enables the rename action (retrocognitive keys unlock names) and participates in closure (her trap loosens as the rename echoes). The cost—chipping at her soul, being plunged deeper—is stated but not shown as a tactical trade-off in scene. Present in all three gates with some causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "rename" action is seeded early ("method to wield her vision as weapon"), executed at the climax ("whispered the new name into the fractures: 'Kaelon the Embracer'"), and drives the resolution (Kael staggers, visions hit, survivors gather). Major turns trace to this action; removing it would collapse the plot. The act is specific (via chipped patterns, into tessera) and irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; one visible cost (Kael's tears, survivors' tentative approach) though the price to Elara is less clear.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The method—"via the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone"—is signaled midway (~50%: "chipped patterns formed subtle glyphs"), used in the rename beat ("aligning the chips into a lattice"), and anchors closure ("stepped onto the mosaic stepping stone, its tessera solid underfoot"). The mechanics (patterns as retrocognitive keys) enable the action and matter to the outcome. However, the method is introduced relatively late and does not shape earlier attempts or complicate tactics before deployment. Two gates (development, payoff) with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky" is anchored early and pressure-laden: survivors trade blows for scraps, Kael rules from rubble, the shattered sky's fissures weep cold light. The plaza's center (mosaic stepping stone) supplies the rename tool, and the setting participates in closure ("wind sighed through the plaza," "beneath the mending sky"). The environment constrains choice (survivors huddled, Kael perched) and the sky's state reweights the ending. All three gates with causal involvement and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the great fire" anchors the timeframe and recurs in the final line, framing the transformation. However, time does not tighten decisions; no clock or urgency alters tactics. The fire is backstory that motivates Elara but does not pressure the present scene. The timeframe is consistent but passive, serving as setting rather than a live constraint on moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to cradle empathy in arms of steel" is stated early ("fueled her motivation") and drives the rename action (encasing Kael's sins in empathetic steel). It appears in closure ("empathy's fortress," "revolutions cradled in steel"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; Elara does not face a visible trade-off between empathy and steel, mercy and harm. The motivation is causally active but lacks friction or visible cost to Elara herself.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Warm coldness" is introduced early ("dance of warm coldness—affectionate hatred, tender savagery") and recurs at closure ("carrying warm coldness now laced with promise"). The oxymoron charges the tonal texture and modulates: initially oppressive, finally hopeful. However, the tone is more asserted than felt through sentence rhythm or image; the label does most of the work. It reweights meaning at the end but does not constrain action or pressure choices in the middle beats.</comment>
