<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lir's motivation is declared ("to decode the message in falling leaves") but never tested by competing desires or genuine stakes. His interior experience consists largely of label-only emotions ("mossy delight," "heart quickening") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The sylph conversation at the climax reads as exposition delivery rather than character pressure, and the protagonist's agency amounts to assembling monuments without visible cost or foreclosed paths. No on-page change or renunciation alters Lir's stance by the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words, avoiding that penalty. However, closure never lands as a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost—Lir simply succeeds at his stated task without friction, and the final paragraphs summarize outcomes ("arbor thriving eternal," "legacy: monuments eternal") rather than dramatizing a before/after shift. The piece declares a causal lens ("because/therefore" phrasing appears) but does not deliver motivated escalation or a meaningful tightening that narrows options. The sylph's emergence feels coincidental rather than earned by prior choices, and the ending recounts triumph without legible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly described with selective sensory detail (moss-draped walkways, ash flakes, bioluminescent fungi), and the moonstone cabochon dust speck functions as a micro-setting element that appears in multiple beats. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Lir operates without spatial friction, and the "arbor's fading heart" remains abstract rather than a present obstacle. The final image does not charge setting details with new meaning, so the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges closure) is not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>A single dominant stake is signaled early (decode leaves to mend the arbor), but no on-page tightening or reversal narrows options or raises cost. The sylph's emergence grants Lir immediate allies and clarity rather than complicating his path, and the resolution ("gather forgotten seeds") is delivered via exposition rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure. Coincidence (the leaf falling "today") triggers the climax, not Lir's decisions. No visible price is paid, and the ending summarizes success without dramatizing a trade-off or foreclosed alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme (forgotten things, folklore reborn) is asserted through labels ("forgotten things stirred," "regional lore reborn") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The moonstone speck and monuments recur but do not shift meaning at closure; instead, the final paragraphs state the theme directly ("his legacy: monuments eternal, messages decoded"). The piece avoids moralizing in a single sentence but the entire ending is thematic summary rather than a resonant, non-literal image that reweights prior material. "Mossy delight" and "transformed always" function as prompt echoes rather than earned insights from dramatized experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and perceptual signature is consistent (Lir's orderly cataloging, his "mossy delight"). However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register that clashes with the focalizer's grounded task ("verdant haven suspended amid swirling ash clouds," "prophecy's own script") without voice motivation. Dialogue with the sylph is functional but lacks subtext or resistance—lines advance plot mechanically ("Tell me the message") rather than pursuing conflicting goals. Recycled sentence stems and template cadence appear in the middle third ("Each structure... served as a key," "Out fluttered... no longer dust but..."), flattening rhythm under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "hush where past meets prophecy" is restated three times with slight variation; "mossy delight" appears six times without functional reweighting; adjacent sentences repeat content ("The speck quivered, then cracked open" followed by "From within emerged transformed always" summarizes the same moment). Template cadence runs dominate ("To decode, one must..."; "Each structure... served as..."; "Past meets prophecy in the hush..."). Figurative language is dense but mixed ("fingers dancing," "heart burned like bioluminescent fungi," "veins glowing like prophecy's own script"), and elevated diction ("ashen skyborne arbor," "bioluminescent fungi," "iridescent") clashes with the task-focused POV. These artifacts appear throughout, including in the closure beat, triggering −1.7 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise (sky-realm folklore decoder builds seed monuments to summon ancestor sprites) synthesizes familiar fantasy elements but does not transform them through non-obvious moral calculus or specific lived detail. Emotional beats follow a template arc (discovery → wonder → success) without contradiction or cost. The moonstone cabochon dust speck and "transformed always" motif echo the prompt's required elements without irreplaceability—near-synonyms (gemstone shard, "change is constant") would function identically with minor edits. The ending recounts triumph in abstract terms ("arbor forever skyborne and alive") rather than offering a particular, memorable image.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lir is present throughout and his method (sorting seeds, building monuments) frames beats, satisfying setup and development gates. However, his choices do not create key turns—the sylph's emergence is triggered by the leaf falling and Lir's "prod," but that action feels obligatory rather than a decision under pressure. At closure, Lir "stepped to the arbor's edge... probe in hand," but the descent and renewal are summarized rather than shown as a choice with visible cost. Functional but does not drive reversals.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The moonstone cabochon dust speck appears in setup (caught on the leaf), development (Lir prods it, releasing the sylph), and payoff (becomes the sylph's heart-gem at closure). It returns with reweighted meaning (from inert relic to living guardian's core) and shapes two distinct beats. However, the speck's properties are narrated rather than constraining choice—Lir's action (prodding) feels scripted by folklore rather than a decision with alternatives. Strong reprise but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Regional folklore is signaled early ("devotee of regional folklore," tales whispered by elders) and shapes Lir's method (building monuments, prodding the speck "as the tales insisted"). It constrains one on-page action (the prod) and provides the logic for the sylph's emergence. At closure, folklore is explicitly cited ("regional folklore unfolded true"), charging the final image with conceptual validation. Functional across all three gates, but the folklore operates as background logic rather than a live obstacle or dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Emerges transformed always" is labeled as a principle early ("folklore spoke of such specks... guard transformations") and demonstrated when the sylph emerges (dust → living mosaic). It recurs at closure ("we emerge transformed always, and so shall the arbor") to frame the ending's promise. However, the transformation is ornamental—it does not constrain Lir's choices or impose visible cost. The attribute is present in all three gates but functions as thematic decoration rather than a tactical force.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Prod" is signaled early (Lir's thorn-probe is introduced, folklore demands "prod the veil"), executed at the climax (Lir prods the moonstone speck, releasing the sylph), and recurs at closure ("Prod by prod... the messages cascaded"). The action redefines options by summoning allies and unlocking prophecies. However, prodding feels obligatory rather than a chosen risk with alternatives—Lir never hesitates or weighs costs. Essential to the plot's logic but not to protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Building tiny monuments is signaled in the first third ("his method: building tiny monuments"), demonstrated in development (Lir erects a flax-seed archway for the mist-forgottens), and validated at closure (monuments "awaken" relics, "multiplying like verdant stars"). The method shapes the sylph's recognition ("You've built well") and the ending's renewal. However, the mechanics are asserted rather than shown with friction—we never see Lir struggle with materials or trade monument-building against another tactic. Present across all gates but the causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly described in setup and recurs at closure ("ash skies parted," "arbor thriving eternal"). However, the setting never constrains choice—Lir moves freely without spatial obstacles, and the "fading heart" remains abstract. The arbor's renewal is told rather than shown altering present action. Postcard description with thematic reprise but no tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"The hush where past meets prophecy" is named in the opening and recurs at closure ("By hush's end, prophecies clarified"). However, the timeframe is never dramatized as a live constraint—no clock tightens decisions, and "today" feels arbitrary. The hush lifts at the end without visible cost or urgency tied to its duration. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lir's desire to decode the message is stated early ("His deepest motivation burned... to decode the message in falling leaves") and shapes his on-page actions (catching the leaf, prodding the speck, working with the sylph). At closure, the decoded message ("gather forgotten seeds") fulfills the motivation. However, the desire is never conflicted—no competing want or fear tests Lir's commitment, and success arrives without visible trade-off. Functional but not friction-laden.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Mossy delight" is named six times throughout the text ("mossy delight bubbling," "mossy joy profound," "in mossy delight's embrace") but remains a static label rather than modulating with pressure. The tone does not shift when stakes should rise (the sylph's emergence, the descent to ash roots), and the final paragraphs maintain the same buoyant register despite the declared renewal. Coherent but unresponsive to narrative turns, and the repeated phrasing reads as template rather than voice-driven charge.</comment>
