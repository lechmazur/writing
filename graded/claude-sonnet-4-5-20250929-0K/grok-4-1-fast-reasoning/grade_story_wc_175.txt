<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is told rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure. Her grief and reverence for overlooked histories arrive fully formed in reflective exposition; no contradictory impulses complicate her stance. The grandmother's tales function as backstory label without on-page friction—Elara never hesitates, doubts, or pays visible cost for honoring them. The final descent ("transiently rooted no more") asserts completion without showing what she has foreclosed or risked.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (layered signal-building toward a final density), but closure lacks visible cost. The structures dissolve as designed, monarchs pass, and Elara packs—no option is foreclosed, no knowledge reweighted, no stance crystallized with felt price. "Histories honored, cadence echoing unresolved" is thematic assertion, not a Resonant Reconfiguration that the reader experiences. Orientation penalty applied: who/where/when anchors arrive cleanly by line 2, waiving the test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Verdant grotto, pink mist, and mossy stone create vivid atmosphere. The moth wing's iridescence and vine texture are specific. However, the environment never constrains a choice—Elara gathers what she needs without scarcity or obstacle, and the grotto's height or wind arrive on cue to serve the plot rather than complicate it. Spatial choreography is clear but the setting remains postcard backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is declared but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or deepening alters Elara's options; she completes each structure without impediment and departs satisfied. Wind loosens the first knot as scripted transience, not as pressure that forces trade-off. The monarchs' dwindling is told backdrop, not an on-page constraint that narrows her tactics or charges her final gesture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme of ephemera and overlooked lineages emerges from moth wing, knots, and migration, avoiding direct statement until the final summary. The "interrupted cadence" motif recurs but never constrains a choice—it is observed, not internalized as friction. The ending offers thematic echo ("cadence echoing unresolved") rather than a non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Wisdom arrives as platitude: "histories lived in such gestures."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, but diction drifts into elevated register ("esoteric realist," "lepidopteran lore," "fractal math," "Vector sums of wind and instinct") that exceeds the established perceptual signature. Elara's internal voice reads like thematic narration rather than embodied thought under pressure. Sentence stems repeat: "She [verb]" opens seven consecutive beats in the middle third, flattening rhythm. Filter verbs ("watched," "knew") dull immediacy in high moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: "verdant," "blushing stillness," "transiently rooted" recur as decorative tags rather than earned motifs. Paraphrase loops appear: "histories honored" / "overlooked histories" / "histories lived" cycle without adding pressure. Template cadence runs across the signal-building sequence: "She [verb]. The [noun] [verb]. As [event], [result]." Mixed metaphor: "ink in rosewater" clashes with "orange sails against the void." Register drift into academic diction ("geomagnetic dances," "taxonomy's indifference") in peak beats triggers −0.5; loop/scaffold debt adds −0.6; total artifact penalty −1.1 in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Premise—artist honoring extinction through ephemeral sculpture—is familiar eco-art territory without transformation. "Esoteric realist" and "transiently rooted" read as prompt-label ornament rather than lived contradiction. Moth wing as parallel to monarchs is apt but predictable. No turn or inflection arises from Elara's specific lived detail; the arc could transplant to any extinction, any artist, any signal medium. Authentic vision is present in texture but not in synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara's "esoteric realist" identity is told in exposition and never tested by choice. She observes, gathers, builds, watches, and departs without internal conflict or trade-off. Label-only trait with no causal pressure or closure participation; swappable with "contemplative ecologist" or similar. Cap 4.6 for late middle development, further reduced for ornamental use and summary-only involvement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Moth wing appears in beat three (scavenged from floor), is knotted to tower apex (beat involvement), recurs across structures, and is freed in the final paragraph—touching setup, middle, and closure. However, its properties (iridescence, scales) are described, not used to constrain choice or alter tactics. The wing's "nocturnal parallel" thematic claim does not change Elara's options. Lyric reprise qualifies for ~6.0 range, slight lift for multi-beat presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Interrupted cadence" is named early, echoed in monarch wingbeat description, embedded as tower design principle, and restated at closure ("cadence echoing unresolved"). Yet it never constrains Elara's tactics or forces a trade-off—she builds the interruption deliberately as aesthetic motif, not as problem. Thematic resonance without causal pressure. Present across beats but ornamental; cap 4.6 for missing middle constraint, reduced for swappability with "fragmented rhythm."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Transiently rooted" appears as tag in paragraph one, two, four, nine, thirteen, sixteen, and twenty-three—seven mentions, but five are identical label in narration and two describe knots. No on-page action is enabled or constrained by transience; Elara's impermanence is chosen aesthetic, not friction. Summary-only trait without visible cost; swappable with "nomadic" or "itinerant." Cap 3.8 for label-only use despite multi-beat presence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Knot" drives structure-building across four towers (beats ten through eighteen), each knot type named (reef hitch, bowline, clove hitch, Celtic braids). The action is irreplaceable—towers depend on knotting to grip, hold wing, and dissolve. Knotting shapes middle tactics and appears in closure when "undone knots" free the wing. Causal pressure present, closure linkage strong. Cost is conceptual (ephemerality) rather than felt trade-off, limiting top-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Building temporary structures is signaled in paragraph eight ("her method"), executed across beats ten–eighteen, and mentioned at closure ("structures stood eternal" in memory). Mechanics (vine-gathering, lattice, knot types) are detailed. However, the method never faces obstacle or alternative—Elara completes all four towers without impediment. Shapes middle beats and closure thematically but lacks friction or cost that would test the method itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Verdant grotto is anchored early (paragraph one), supplies resources (vines, moss, stone pedestal), and frames closure (mist descent). Wind at dusk loosens knots as environmental trigger. However, the grotto never constrains choice—Elara finds what she needs without scarcity, and the height/wind serve plot convenience. Micro-setting (body, tool) does not substitute. Present in setup, middle resource use, and closure frame; functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"During the migration of the last monarch butterfly" is named in paragraph one and recurs as backdrop ("last monarch migration peaked unseen," paragraph twenty-four). Migration timing creates symbolic urgency but does not tighten Elara's on-page decisions—she works at her own pace, and the monarchs pass without her needing to synchronize or adapt. Timeframe is thematic rather than tactical; swappable with "final day of migration" without altering choices. Cap 4.6 for missing middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to honor overlooked histories" is told in paragraph seven (grandmother's tales), drives structure-building (middle beats), and is restated at closure ("histories honored"). However, friction is absent—no competing desire, no cost of honoring. Elara never doubts, hesitates, or sacrifices to fulfill the motivation. Functional across beats but told-only without dramatized trade-off. Present in setup, middle action, closure restatement; caps at mid-5s for lack of friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Blushing stillness" appears in paragraphs five, nine, twelve, sixteen, and twenty-three. Tone is coherent (reverent, hushed) but static—no modulation under pressure. Elara's emotional state remains serene throughout; the grotto "held its breath" is metaphor without felt tension. Tone does not charge the final image with new affect. Present across beats as atmospheric tag but ornamental; functional coherence without intensity shift or closure charge.</comment>
