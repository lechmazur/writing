<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is label-heavy ("his motivation burned steady") rather than embodied, and Mira's arc from mistrust to transparency is told through external symbols (tickets, lens) without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The text asserts her "dawning realization" and thaw via reported crystals whispers rather than dramatizing micro-choices under pressure. The final embrace is declared complete ("mistrust melted") without visible cost or a path foreclosed on the page, reading as symbolic closure rather than earned character change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who Elias is, where exactly the forecourt sits, and the nature of the crystals remain vague past the opening third. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (mistrust thawed by honesty), but the cost is asserted ("ledger closing forever on solitude") rather than shown; no visible forfeiture or trade-off appears in the final beats. Causality is weak: the tickets and lens appear suddenly from Elias's drawer, and Mira's transformation unfolds through passive observation of projections rather than a decision that narrows her options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt is lush in mood but remains abstract—no spatial choreography (where Elias's booth sits relative to Mira's path, how large the expanse is) or concrete constraints. The lens and tickets appear as props without altering tactics; Mira pauses, lifts, gasps, but the environment does not pressure her choices. The rain-polished crystals amplify whispers, yet this acoustic detail never limits or enables an action at a key turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—thawing Mira's mistrust—is signaled early but never tested by a live trade-off. Elias prepares tickets and places them; Mira picks them up and the doodles "ignite," unlocking her realizations without agency or cost. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the resolution arrives via symbolic projection rather than protagonist decision. The final "embrace" is gestured, not earned by pressure that forced a sacrifice or foreclosed a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme of honesty thawing mistrust is stated explicitly ("freed by honesty, they stood") rather than emerging from particulars. The doodles and lens function as thematic tokens—fractured hearts, blooming vines—that announce meaning instead of letting it accumulate through tension. The final image ("Mira smiled, thawed, transparent as the lens") is on-the-nose metaphor without a non-literal layer. No plausible counter-reading or ambiguity lingers; the piece resolves into a tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but relies on elevated, poetic diction ("resonant hush," "liminal place," "ambiguously clear") that drifts into stock lyricism rather than character-specific perception. Psychic distance is stable, but filter phrases ("he knew," "he sensed") pad rather than sharpen. No dialogue appears to test subtext or goal pursuit. The prose reads as a singular voice without perceptual signature tied to Elias's registrar role or Mira's guarded state.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "quiet night registrar, Elias" then "The quiet night registrar had succeeded"; "ambiguously clear" recurs as a phrase four times without evolving meaning. Template cadence is frequent ("She came to listen... fleeing before..."; "He sketched swiftly: a fractured heart... a shadowed figure... mirrors reflecting..."). Figurative density in the opening ("crystal whispering," "resonant hush," "mirror sheen amplifying whispers into symphony") stacks metaphors without causal work, and mixed vehicles ("timeframe after words become unnecessary" is conceptually strained). Register drifts into abstract exposition ("the core that bound them both") at the climax, flattening momentum. The final third maintains this density, triggering artifact penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The core premise—cryptic symbols enabling emotional breakthrough—is a familiar template (magical realism as therapy metaphor). The doodles, lens, and crystal forecourt read as genre furniture rather than a specific synthesis. Emotional turns rely on symbolic projection (thorns wilting, chains breaking) without grounded character choice or world logic that transforms the trope. The safe, poetic register and tidy resolution ("No more mistrust; only the forecourt's eternal whisper") avoid risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias (quiet night registrar) prepares the tickets and lens, places them, and emerges at the end to lock gazes—actions present but observation-heavy. His choices do not create turns; Mira's realization unfolds via the projections, not Elias's agency. Present in setup and payoff, but no middle development that constrains or enables a choice under pressure. Swappable with a similar guide figure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The lens from the projector appears mid-story in Elias's drawer, is placed atop the tickets, and Mira uses it to view doodles that "ignite in warped light." Two beats (placement, use), but the lens's convex properties are described generically ("bending light into truths") without specific mechanics that alter her tactics. No early signal; introduced at the preparation moment. Functional but not indispensable—any magnifier or reveal device could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Freed by honesty" is the explicit closure claim ("Freed by honesty, they stood"). It shapes the thematic framing and Mira's arc, appearing in setup (Elias's motivation to thaw mistrust with transparency), mid-story (her confessions to the glass), and payoff (the explicit statement). However, it is theme-asserted rather than a tactical constraint; it does not narrow on-page options or impose a cost. Development is summary-only ("each confession... freed a whisper").</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Ambiguously clear" recurs as a label four times (lens description, doodles, Mira's realization, final world state) but never constrains a choice or imposes cost. It is told-only atmosphere rather than a trait that enables or disables action. No middle development; ornamental rather than causal. Could be removed without altering event sequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Eavesdropping appears in setup (Elias "had eavesdropped on the forecourt's whispers and heard her buried grief"), middle ("he continued to eavesdrop, the crystals betraying her soft mutterings"), and payoff ("Elias eavesdropped from afar, crystals whispering her dawning realization"). It motivates his preparation and tracks her transformation across three beats. However, it is passive observation; major turns (Mira lifting the lens, realizing her projection) do not trace causally to the eavesdropping—they result from the doodles' projection. Present in all three gates but not indispensable; he could observe openly with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The method (cryptic doodles on concert tickets) is signaled in setup ("Through cryptic doodles on concert tickets, he would communicate"), developed in the middle sketch sequence (heart/thorns/vines, chains, mirrors), and drives payoff (Mira decodes "ticket by ticket"). Three-gate presence and causal involvement in the transformation. However, the mechanics are vague ("doodles ignited in warped light, projecting faint holograms"); any symbolic image set could substitute. The specificity of concert tickets versus blank cards does not matter to the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt after rain is established early and recurs throughout (whispers amplified, Mira's path, final song). It provides atmospheric continuity and the whisper-medium for Elias's eavesdropping. However, it does not constrain choices or supply resources that alter tactics—Mira could decode the symbols anywhere. The crystals function as mood rather than micro-setting pressure. Present in setup and payoff, minimal middle development, swappable with any liminal space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after words become unnecessary" is mentioned once mid-story ("he sensed they teetered on the timeframe after words become unnecessary") and echoed in the silent final exchange ("no words needed; the timeframe had arrived"). It is thematic framing rather than a clock that tightens decisions. Time is untracked—months of prior visits are summarized, and the present night unfolds without duration cues or urgency. No middle development where time pressure alters tactics; ornamental rather than structural.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation (to thaw mistrust with transparency) is stated in setup ("his motivation burned steady: to thaw that mistrust with transparency") and drives his preparation of the lens and tickets. It appears in payoff when "Her mistrust melted, freed by honesty." However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. No on-page moment shows Elias risking exposure or trading one value for another; the desire is linear and uncontested. Present in all three gates but summary-only in execution, mid-band at best.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Resonant hush is established early ("the night air hung in a resonant hush"), sustained through "gazes locking in resonant hush," and returns in the final line ("the ambiguously clear world resonant in hush"). Coherent and present across beats. However, it remains static mood rather than modulating with pressure—no tonal shift at peak tension or charged reprise that reweights the stake. It supports atmosphere but does not charge the final image with new meaning; consistent but mid-low impact.</comment>
