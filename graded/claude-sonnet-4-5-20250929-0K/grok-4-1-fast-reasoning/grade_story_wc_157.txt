<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is labeled charming rogue scholar but remains a flat archetype making gestures without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. His "spark of defiance" and "rogue charisma" are asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Voss and secondary characters blur into ornamental ciphers; no relationship pressure forces any choice. Interior voice converges with all other description into the same elevated register, erasing individual consciousness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when remain vague through the first third; "shadowed year of 2147," "the sprawl," and "back-alley markets" float without spatial anchors (apply −0.4, cap Q3 at 7.0). Drive lens ambiguous—rushes through what feel like causal beats without dramatization, then shifts to accumulative pattern-planting, then a situational convergence, never teaching one pattern or holding it to closure (apply −0.5, cap Q2 at 7.2 and all others at 8.0). Closure unit unclear: the greenhouse "pulses," patterns "spread," but no decisive change, earned stasis, or conceptual repricing with legible cost lands on the page; the ending asserts "defiance stood guard" without demonstrating what was foreclosed or won.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The entomologist's greenhouse supplies vivid sensory detail—"vines throttled trellises, beetles scuttled in fractal herds"—and the gourd seed's seismic Morse constrains one middle beat. Spatial choreography blurs: gardens "across the sprawl," "the sprawl's edge," and indoor/outdoor convergence remain unclear. The body and tool level (scarabs, drones) charge the final third but arrive too late to anchor earlier choices. Orientation debt and vague geography prevent high-band entry despite vivid texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (untaxed thoughts) declared early but never tested by an on-page choice that narrows options. Elias's patterns "grow bolder" in summary; no dramatized tightening forces a trade-off. The greenhouse standoff assembles chaos (drones, beetles, rebels) but Elias does not decide between competing goods or pay a visible price; "the warp held" and seeds scatter without foreclosing any path. Escalation is asserted via intensifiers ("chaos peaked," "trembled") rather than earned through protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme (collective thought evasion, defiance as viral seed) emerges in the premise but remains abstract; no particular image reweights it at closure. The final paragraph cycles through assertions—"defiance stood guard," "rebellion rattled on"—that summarize rather than dramatize resonance. "Candidly cryptic" recurs as a label without grounding in specific speech or subtext. No earned insight arises from concrete experience; the ending moralizes ("no tax could claim") instead of offering a non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>POV distance stable but register is uniformly elevated across narration, Elias's interior, and Voss's dialogue: "warp at edges," "defiance guards itself," "verdant cipher" erase individual voice. Dialogue ("Gardens call, but skies reply") performs cryptic archetype without naturalism or subtext. Perceptual signature absent—every detail reads as authorial catalog rather than character-filtered attention. Filter verbs ("stood guard," "clasped") cluster in peak beats without immediacy. Diction drift into abstract philosophy ("collective thought evasion," "conceptual missive") violates the focalizer's plausible lexicon under crisis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Template cadence dominates: "Elias [verb]," "Patterns [verb]," "Chaos [verb]" stems repeat across dozens of lines without purposeful pattern-teaching (apply −0.6). Paraphrase loops: "spark of defiance" → "defiance spark" → "defiance guards"; "chaos converged" → "converging chaos" → "chaos peaked" (apply −0.4). Stock metaphors pervade without transformation: "lantern light," "moth," "living warp-field." Final paragraph collapses into list-like assertions with zero propulsion. Figurative density in every line of the greenhouse sequence muddies physical choreography (apply −0.5 cumulative). Artifacts touch closure beat (apply −1.7 total in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band entries at 8.8).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Core premise (thoughts taxable via cranial implants, secret language club) leans on familiar dystopian templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (apply −0.8). Gourd-rattle-seed magic, beetle-assisted warping, and fractal kale glyphs stack quirky ornament without necessity. Ending asserts victory via deus-ex-insect swarm with no earned consequence. No specific, irreplaceable synthesis; the plot could swap scarabs for any other fantastical enabler. Surface novelty substitutes for emotional or thematic truth.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Charming rogue scholar label appears early and recurs but Elias makes no on-page choice that hinges on charm or scholarship; he "infiltrates," "orchestrates," "harvests" in summary. Present in setup and mentioned at closure ("charming rogue unbound") but middle beats show no scholar-specific constraint or charm-enabled tactic. Ornamental archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Gourd rattle seed handled in three beats: passed in speakeasy (setup), planted in greenhouse (middle), harvested with spilling seeds (closure). Seismic Morse pulse enables beetle swarm, a causal tactic. Reprise at ending charges final image. Swappable with any magical seed; specificity of "gourd rattle" does not matter beyond label. Mid-band for presence across arc but replaceable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Secret language club (Verdant Whisperers) mentioned as goal and thematic backdrop but does not constrain on-page choices. Elias seeks entry but never negotiates membership; Voss flags him as known without dramatized test. "Candidly cryptic" language recurs as description, not as stake-altering tactic. Present in setup and thematic closure but ornamental to conflict.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Candidly cryptic appears as label for speech ("Gardens call, but skies reply," Voss's greeting) but does not constrain or enable action with cost. No choice hinges on cryptic versus direct communication. Ornamental flavor without mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Warp used in multiple senses: gourd's hyperbolic growth, beetle warp-field bending light, patterns "warping the sprawl." Present in middle and closure but mechanics remain vague; removing "warp" and substituting "distort" or "shield" would change no outcome. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Joining community gardens to plant message patterns signaled early ("orchestrated message patterns—rows of kale spelling defiance") and shapes middle tactics (glyphs broadcast lore, rival gardeners notice). Does not appear in or directly shape the greenhouse closure. Present in setup and middle, absent from payoff; cap at ~6.0 per gate model, lower for summary-only portrayal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Entomologist's greenhouse anchors final third: humid sanctum supplies beetles, orchids, central bed for seed planting. Greenhouse's warp-field and perceptual static enable drone evasion (causal tactic). Vivid sensory detail charges closure image. Present in middle and closure with specific environmental constraint. Edges into higher band for setting-as-resource despite late arrival.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>After thoughts become taxable timeframe establishes premise and context for defiance but does not tighten on-page decisions or tactics. No live clock alters moves. Background condition, not active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>To stand guard over your own spark of defiance declared early and repeated as label throughout. Never dramatized as conflicting want versus cost; Elias's spark "blazed unguardable" without visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. Told-only motivation without friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Converging chaos signaled as tone: "chaos converged," "chaos intensified," "chaos peaked" mark structural beats. Modulates from shadowed intrigue to greenhouse bedlam. Does not charge final image with felt cost; ending asserts chaos-as-covenant without consequences landing on the page. Functional mood marker but static application at closure.</comment>
