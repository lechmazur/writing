<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to "become the voice of the unknown" is declared repeatedly but never tests contradictory impulses in scene. The fossil triggers floating and memory flashes, yet her internal experience remains abstract label-speak ("heart raced," "tingled") without embodied contradiction. The ending gestures toward transformation but skips the micro-choices that would earn it; she floats, narrates, then trains apprentices in summary. Agency collapses into passive reception of visions rather than decisions under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is ambiguous—oscillates between causal (fossil enables floating) and accumulative/textural (lyric repetition of "transitional," "factually mystical") without committing. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("she had become what she sought") but the cost is asserted in summary ("years blurred," "final float") rather than dramatized on the page. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (cave, Lira, post-hibernation), but causality weakens after midpoint: the fossil "destabilizes" emotions into floating orbs without clear because/therefore linkage, and the ending's apprentice-training and fossil-release occur in tell-only summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Cave anchors are vivid early (salt spray, mineral drips, bioluminescent algae), and the fossil's limestone texture provides one micro-setting beat. However, spatial choreography blurs during the float sequence—"hidden fissure," "churning ocean," "submerged ruins" appear without clear position or access logic. The coastal network supplies atmosphere but does not constrain a key choice; Lira floats freely without environmental resistance. Micro-setting (fossil in palm) charges one mid-scene moment but does not return with altered meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("voice the unknown") is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete test forces a trade-off. The fossil warms and triggers floating, yet this feels coincidental rather than earned by prior choice—Lira presses it to her chest and ascends without cost or resistance. The descent ("focused, heat-mapping her resolve into stabilizing greens") summarizes the tightening instead of showing a decision that forecloses an option. Escalation is declarative: "overheated, threatening overload" tells urgency but does not narrow tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of transitional objects and epochs bridging is explicitly stated ("transitional power," "bridge object," "conduit for emotional handoffs") rather than emerging from particulars. The elm leaf returns with symbolic weight but not reweighted meaning—it glows, she releases it, and the theme is narrated: "maps where emotions float free, bridging worlds factually mystical." The final paragraph moralizes ("she had become what she sought") instead of offering a resonant image. One positive: the fossil's double role (human anchor, Lira's anchor) gestures toward earned complexity, but overt labeling flattens it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited is stable, and the emitter/heat-map vocabulary creates a perceptual signature. However, register drifts into expository abstraction during peak beats: "factually mystical artifact, where quantum-entangled minerals captured ancient emotional echoes" reads like a Wikipedia insert mid-scene. Diction stays consistent in calmer passages but slips into declarative summary at closure ("she embodied the transitional bridge"). Dialogue is absent. Psychic distance widens when it should narrow: the floating climax describes external visuals ("glowing orbs," "thermal specters") instead of Lira's embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "transition/transitional" appears nine times, often within adjacent lines ("transitional power, a bridge object"; "transitional objects for her kin"). Template cadence dominates the ending: "Her maps now…" / "Doubters once…" / "Each heat-mapped…" / "Years blurred…" The phrase "factually mystical" is repeated as a conceptual anchor but becomes a tic. Mid-scene clarity is stronger (fossil discovery, cave choreography), but the final third collapses into summary with synonym churn ("voice," "whisper," "narrated," "carried forth"). Figurative language mixes registers: "veins etched like lightning" is vivid; "core concept incarnate" is abstract filler.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sensory cartography and post-hibernation world offer fresh premises, and the heat-mapped emotion mechanic is specific. However, execution leans on prompt-like phrasing ("factually mystical," "transitional objects") that reads template-driven rather than discovered. The floating climax and apprentice-training epilogue follow predictable beats without a non-obvious turn. Transformation test: swap "emotions" for "memories" or "energy" and the arc holds unchanged, signaling insufficient particularity. One inventive detail: thermal orbs detaching and floating lifts mid-scene, but the ending's tidy satisfaction (fossil released, legacy secured) retreats from risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Lira discovers the fossil, activates the emitter, and releases the fossil at the end—three beats, but all are observational or reception-based rather than decision-driven. Her "vow to voice the unknown" is declared, not tested by conflicting options. Closure participation is summary-only ("trained apprentices"). Swappable: another explorer would trace the same arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fossil appears in discovery beat, heat-mapping beat, floating climax, and final release—four touches across the arc. It enables the float and memory interface, constraining mid-scene action. Closure linkage is present but weakened by summary: "she released it into the tide" lacks on-page consequence. Cost is implied (letting go) but not felt. Strong middle development, modest payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Transitional objects" is mentioned eight times but functions as thematic label rather than stake-shaping mechanic. The concept is told ("bridge object poised between known pasts and uncharted futures") instead of dramatized through incompatible choices. No on-page moment where treating something as transitional versus permanent alters Lira's tactics. Present as ornament, not causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" appears four times as descriptor ("verifiable by spectral analysis yet feeling like sorcery") but never constrains action. The fossil's mystical properties enable floating, yet the mechanics remain vague—no trade-off between rational analysis and intuitive acceptance shown on the page. Label-only; the story would function identically without this exact phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Floating occurs in one extended beat (mid-to-late scene) and drives the visual climax: Lira ascends, maps expand, she addresses cave dwellers, then descends. The action redefines her status ("no longer just a mapper") and sets up the apprentice epilogue. However, the float is enabled by fossil contact without prior buildup—swapping "float" for "project visions" would require only minor edits. Two-gate presence (development, payoff) but modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Heat-mapping is introduced early (emitter, thermal overlays) and used in the fossil analysis beat ("vivid auras bloomed: amber grief, crimson hope"). It shapes one tactical moment (stabilizing greens during descent) but is absent from the ending. Mechanics are told ("translating lingering psychic residues") rather than shown through trial or error. Two beats, but the method does not constrain closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cave network anchors throughout (bioluminescent algae, salt spray, hidden fissure, churning ocean view) and supplies the discovery site. The environment provides atmosphere and one resource (fossil in limestone), but does not resist or complicate Lira's floating ascent—she moves freely without navigating cave constraints. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, ending vista) but participation is backdrop rather than pressure. Solid setup and payoff, weak middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Post-hibernation timeframe is established early ("eons had passed," "humans hibernated in vast underground vaults") and contextualizes the fossil's emotional residue. However, the "after" does not create urgency or tighten tactics—Lira's exploration unfolds without time pressure or consequences tied to humanity's hibernation state. The ending hints humans "stirred faintly" but does not close the temporal loop. Setup strong, no development or payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To become the voice of the unknown" is declared in paragraph six ("Lira burned with a deeper motivation") and repeated at closure ("she had become what she sought"). The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no on-page moment where voicing the unknown costs her safety, clarity, or a competing goal. The motivation frames the arc but does not create friction. Swappable with "to explore" or "to guide."</comment>
