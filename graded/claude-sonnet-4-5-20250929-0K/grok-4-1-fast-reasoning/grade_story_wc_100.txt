<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation (granting the dead permanent rest) is clear and his weariness embodied through decades of burial work. His "inadvertently stubborn" trait drives the lens-repair sequence, though the final transformation feels more thematic necessity than earned character choice—the cost of merging with the lens reads as cosmically inevitable rather than a deliberate trade-off with visible internal conflict. Interiority relies heavily on descriptive summary ("his eyes heavy with the weight of countless burials") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. No second on-page character to test relationship dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accumulates through intensifying distress signals and Elias's iterative placement of prisms in impossible spaces until the final convergence creates silence. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (specifically Charged Poise/transformation): Elias becomes the eternal beacon, his weariness lifted and merged with light, granting the library silence and the dead their permanent address. The cost is legible in the final image (he occupies "rest, addressed forever in the deep," his body pulled into the glow). Orientation is swift (underwater city library, undertaker, package arrival). One substantive tightening occurs as prism placement silences echoes and the lattice converges, reweighting the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underwater library is vividly rendered with bioluminescent anemones, algae-veiled alcoves, coral-encrusted shelves, and enchanted-glass dome holding breathable air. Spatial choreography across the rotunda, shelves, statue, and leviathan fossil remains clear. The "impossible spaces" (vacuum pockets, dry crevices) constrain Elias's method and charge the final lattice convergence, pushing this into the 7+ band. Sensory detail (swelling tomes, pulsing light, muffled wails) modulates with urgency as distress signals intensify.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silencing distress signals to grant permanent rest) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure escalates through the iterative prism placement—each shard ignites, silences an echo, emboldens Elias, and intensifies swirling specters clawing at his robes. The library's trembling and final lattice convergence narrow options toward the climactic choice. The cost is visible: Elias's body is pulled into the glow, his weariness lifted as he merges with the lens to become the eternal beacon. One meaningful deepening reweights the dominant stake under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between rest and disturbance: Elias seeks to give "rest its enduring home" but must become the disturbance (the beacon) to achieve silence. The broken lighthouse lens shifting from surface-world ruin to submerged capstone charges the closure without overt statement. The final image—Elias occupying "the ultimate impossible space: rest, addressed forever in the deep"—reweights the premise with resonant irony. No thematic echo or moralizing in the ending paragraph. The piece resists tidy resolution, accepting the paradox that eternal quiet requires an eternal sentinel.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature filters detail through an undertaker's lens (silt graves, petrified scrolls, burial echoes). Diction stays consistent—elevated but coherent ("algae-veiled alcove," "fractured prisms," "perpetual bubble of breathable air"). Some sentences lean ornate ("its cracks mirroring the fractures in his spirit"), edging toward purple without fully crossing. Psychic distance tightens as pressure mounts (specters clawing, mounting lung pressure). No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is ambitious with strong imagery (bioluminescent anemones, petrified scrolls, mocking echo of the surface) and varied syntax. Overwriting clusters in metaphorical density: "drowned tomes swelled with eternal silence," "fractured prisms scattering faint rainbows," "impossible spaces—folds in the water where vacuum pockets defied physics." These pile figurative language in most sentences of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching, triggering −0.5. Minor loops: "weariness lifted, merging with the light" and "weary from decades of this futile toil" echo conceptually. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. No generation artifacts or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The underwater-library-as-afterlife premise and lens-repair-as-metaphysical-solution feel fresh enough to avoid template plots, though the "reluctant psychopomp becomes part of the mechanism" arc has precedent. Specific details (impossible spaces sustained by ancient wards, vacuum pockets accessible only to the stubborn, lighthouse cataclysm twisting light into limbo-traps) elevate beyond generic fantasy. The ending transformation feels earned in hindsight through the lens's symbolic weight and Elias's iterated placements. Emotional complexity (rest requiring eternal vigilance) and conceptual integrity avoid safety-middle hedging.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias (weary undertaker) is established in the opening beat, drives the decision to revitalize the lens, makes the iterative choices to place prisms in impossible spaces (middle beats), and his final choice to press the apex prism pulls him into the glow (closure). Three gates met. His weariness and inadvertent stubbornness constrain tactics (ignoring mounting lung pressure, pressing against impossibility). The transformation reads as his agency crystallizing the solution, though the cost feels partly cosmic rather than wholly chosen. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage push this above 6.0; slightly abstract agency at the end caps below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken lighthouse lens appears in the package (setup), Elias traces its jagged edges and recalls its legends (early beat), he repurposes its shards into prisms wedged across impossible spaces (multiple middle beats), and the final prism clicks into the dome's apex to complete the lattice and pull him into the glow (closure). Three gates met. The lens's fractured state mirrors Elias's spirit, its reweighted use (from surface beacon to submerged capstone) charges the ending. High irreplaceability and closure linkage; beat count (package, tracing, placement sequence, apex) exceeds two. Causal pressure and cost connection elevate this solidly into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Distress signals (core concept) haunt the library from the opening paragraph, manifesting as ghostly flares and muffled wails that prevent the dead from claiming permanent rest (setup and dominant stake). They intensify as Elias works, swirling specters clawing at his robes (middle pressure), and falter when the lens lattice converges, spirits dissolving into wisps that seek their graves (closure effect). Three gates met. The concept shapes stakes and tactics: Elias's entire mission is to silence these signals. Strong causal pressure and closure participation. Edges into 7+ for driving at least two beats and shaping the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Inadvertently stubborn" is mentioned explicitly ("inadvertently stubborn, his resolve hardening") and shown when Elias ignores mounting lung pressure and dives into the first impossible space, then presses on through subsequent placements despite escalating spectral resistance (middle beats). The trait enables access to the impossible spaces ("accessible only to those stubborn enough to press against impossibility") and drives the final apex placement (closure linkage). Three gates met. Causal pressure visible in his refusal to yield. Minor swappability (determination could substitute) and moderate specificity cap this in mid-5s; the label "inadvertently" adds nuance but doesn't alter tactics distinctly from plain stubbornness.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Revitalize" (action) is Elias's decision after receiving the lens, driving the iterative prism-placement sequence across impossible spaces (middle beats) and culminating in the final apex installation that completes the lattice and pulls him into the eternal beacon (closure). Three gates met. The action redefines options: from passively burying souls to actively constructing a capstone for silence. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (no near-synonym action would preserve the metaphysical mechanics). Beat count and cost connection push this into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Occupying impossible spaces" (method) is signaled in Elias's realization ("His method emerged from desperation: occupying impossible spaces—folds in the water where vacuum pockets defied physics"), deployed across multiple middle beats (rift between shelves, behind statue's eyes, leviathan fossil spine, dome apex), and shapes the closure as Elias himself occupies "the ultimate impossible space: rest, addressed forever" (closure). Three gates met. The method's mechanics (ancient wards, airless voids, accessible only to the stubborn) matter and constrain tactics. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Slight abstraction in "impossible" as a catch-all caps just below 7.0; more concrete physical rules would elevate further.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater city library (setting) is anchored in the opening line, its algae-veiled alcoves and coral shelves house the lens and Elias's work (setup), the central rotunda with enchanted-glass dome and breathable air bubble becomes the convergence point for the lattice (middle and closure), and the library's ancient wards sustain the impossible spaces that enable the method (middle beats). Three gates met. Setting constrains choices (vacuum pockets, rotunda geometry) and charges the final image (library hushed at last). High causal pressure, closure participation, and irreplaceability. Multiple beats and closure linkage place this firmly in the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the mysterious package arrives" anchors the story's start and provides the inciting trigger (setup). The narrative unfolds in a continuous sequence from package opening through lens examination, decision, placement sequence, and final convergence (middle and closure). Three gates met. Time pressure is moderate: Elias's mounting lung pressure and intensifying distress signals create urgency, though no explicit clock or deadline is tracked. The timeframe enables the arc but doesn't tighten decisions with a visible countdown. Lyric coherence across the sequence and closure linkage push this into mid-6s; lack of sharp temporal escalation caps below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation "to give rest a permanent address" is stated early ("Elias sought to give rest its enduring home, a sanctuary where silence could root without disturbance") and dramatized through his decision to revitalize the lens, iterative prism placements to silence echoes (middle beats), and willingness to merge with the lattice to achieve eternal quiet (closure). Three gates met. The desire is conflicted: his weariness and inadvertent stubbornness create friction, and the cost (becoming the beacon himself) is visible. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Slight reliance on summary phrasing ("sought to give rest its enduring home") rather than purely enacted friction caps just above 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Chased stillness" (tone) is evoked in the opening (bioluminescent anemones pulsing "like hesitant heartbeats," drowned tomes with "eternal silence") and sustained through the middle as Elias seeks silence pursued by muffled wails and spectral flares. The tone modulates with pressure: urgency mounts as specters swirl and claw, then resolves into hushed closure as the library achieves "true silence" and Elias occupies rest "addressed forever in the deep." Three gates met. Coherence across turns and closure charge are strong. Minor ornamental phrasing ("hesitant heartbeats," "chased stillness he craved") edges toward mood-label rather than enacted sensation, capping in mid-6s. The final image charges the tone effectively.</comment>
