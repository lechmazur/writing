<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elar's motivation (grief over his lover) is clear and his ultrasonic perception is embodied through skin-reading, but the quest unfolds without meaningful internal contradiction or cost until the pool resolves everything in a vision-dump. The renunciation (removing the ring) lacks prior resistance or trade-off; no path is foreclosed with visible struggle. Interiority leans on stock phrasing: "quiet blaze," "loss had hollowed him," "emotions long buried stirred"—therapy-speak that abstracts rather than dramatizes. The lover's resolution arrives as convenient epiphany rather than earned through on-page friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who (blind mapmaker), where (ultrasonic forest), and the quest goal emerge piecemeal across the opening, touching the ~120-word threshold without anchoring all three cleanly (−0.3). The dominant stake (navigate emotional depths via the stillpoint) is signaled but the escalation is geographic (forest traverse) rather than causal tightening of choice or knowledge. Closure delivers a vision that resolves grief and completes the map, but the cost is asserted ("tears," ring removal) rather than dramatized as a foreclosed path or altered tactic. The piece reads Accumulative/Textural in method but the ending supplies a Decisive Change (grief resolved, map completed) without prior pressure that would make refusal or persistence costly; the stillpoint solves rather than tests.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is vividly rendered through Elar's skin-reading (bark pulses, notes as braille, soil mutterings) and the environment supplies the trail he follows. The platinum ring and the crystalline pool constrain navigation and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling, pressing palm, stepping through thicket, arriving at clearing). The timeframe "pause of shifting constellations" remains atmospheric rather than a tactical constraint, and the forest's ultrasonic properties do not narrow a choice—Elar never loses the trail or must choose between paths.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reach the stillpoint to chart inner depths) is signaled early but pressure remains environmental (following the trail) rather than a tightening that forecloses options. The rival's warning ("devours the unworthy") introduces doubt but Elar presses on without a visible trade-off or tactical shift. The climax is a vision-gift rather than a choice under duress; the ring's purpose is "fulfilled" passively. No credible loss (time, stamina, tool failure, or social cost) alters tactics mid-journey. The ending renunciation (removing the ring) carries no prior resistance or cost-preview, reading as ceremonial rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme (navigating emotional depths, mapping the unmappable) emerges through the quest structure and the contrast between external and internal cartography. The stillpoint as metaphor for emotional resolution is purposeful, and the final image (new map of the heart's terrain) reprises the opening concern. However, the lover's face "resolving into harmony" and "tears evaporating into the blaze of understanding" veer into tidy epiphany, stating the theme rather than letting the image carry it. The piece avoids overt moralizing but the resolution feels declarative: "inner depths now navigable" tells rather than shows the cost of that navigation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature (ultrasonic absorption through skin) is consistent. However, diction inflates under pressure: "threads of forgotten dreams," "unresolved chords," "quiet blaze," "restrained fire"—poetic but generic, not character-particular. The introspective register remains uniform across urgency shifts (kneeling to press soil vs. standing at the pool). Psychic distance never tightens or widens purposefully; emotional peaks receive the same elevated literary treatment as transit beats. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("felt," "absorbed") are acceptable as sensory anchors but stack without tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "invisible symphonies," "vibrations that wove through the air like threads of forgotten dreams," "languages of root and rain seeping into his veins like ink," "sorrow's bass," "rage's red rivers, peace's silver streams." Metaphor density approaches one per sentence in the climax without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.6). Paraphrase loops: "a trail emerged—not of footprints, but of musical notes" / "Each note, a high-pitched pulse… etched faintly into the air" restates the same content (−0.2). Template cadence in the opening: "Blind since birth, Elar crafted… His skin, attuned… Tonight, across…" (−0.4). Stock phrases: "quiet blaze," "forgotten dreams," "unresolved chords." Artifacts touch the closure beat ("evaporating into the blaze of understanding"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The synthesis (blind sensory mapmaker in an ultrasonic forest seeking emotional cartography) is specific and the quest structure is apt. The skin-absorption mechanic and dowsing-ring are fresh details. However, the emotional-journey-as-literal-quest and the pool-of-visions climax follow familiar template beats (hero's journey to a mystical locus that grants insight). The lover's unresolved grief as motivation and the final epiphany ("new map would birth from this night—one of the heart's true terrain") trend toward therapeutic-arc conventions. The piece synthesizes its elements cleanly but does not transform the template through non-obvious moral calculus or lived specificity that would make removal of any part collapse the logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elar's choice to follow the ring's pull and press onward despite the rival's warning shapes the journey. However, the key turn (reaching the pool, receiving visions, removing the ring) is passive reception rather than a decision that alters tactics. Present across setup, middle (kneeling to press soil, following notes), and closure (touching pool, rising, removing ring). The blindness trait enables the ultrasonic perception but does not constrain a choice with visible cost—he never loses the trail or must navigate by non-ultrasonic means.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The platinum compass ring appears in setup (slipping it on), middle (pulsing to guide him, dowsing fiercer, scorching), and closure (stilled at the pool, removed as "purpose fulfilled"). It enables the dowsing action and its warming/scorching progression tracks urgency. However, its removal at the end is ceremonial rather than a charged reprise with reweighted meaning—it simply stops being needed. Two beats (donning, following) plus closure presence, but no visible cost tied to its use or relinquishment.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hidden stillpoint is the quest goal, signaled in setup ("Elar sought the hidden stillpoint"), drives the middle traverse, and is reached at closure (the crystalline pool). It shapes the dominant stake (navigate emotional depths) and the pool delivers the emotional cartography. However, the stillpoint does not constrain tactics—Elar follows the trail without branching choices or trade-offs. Present across all three gates and causally central, but does not narrow options mid-journey with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Skin-absorption is labeled in setup ("skin… absorbed languages through touch"), demonstrated in the middle (pressing palm to soil, notes resonating through body, absorbing dialects), and used at closure (touching pool's edge, languages pouring through skin). It enables perception but does not constrain a choice with cost—Elar never struggles with overload, mistranslation, or conflicting tongues. Two beats (soil-press, note-reading) plus closure use, but no trade-off where the trait limits or endangers.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dowsing (via the ring) is the primary method signaled in setup and executed in the middle (ring warmed, vibrated, pulled, pulsed urgently). It guides every step to the stillpoint and stills at closure. However, the dowsing never fails or offers ambiguous readings that force a choice; it is a reliable GPS. Present across all three gates and essential to reaching the goal, but does not redefine options or impose cost—it solves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The trail of musical notes is introduced in the middle ("A trail emerged—not of footprints, but of musical notes"), demonstrated as Elar follows it (notes twisted upward, clustered, wove into hidden melody), and culminates in the "hidden melody" threading through ultrasonics. It shapes the path and is present at closure conceptually (the melody's resolution). However, the notes never diverge or require interpretation—Elar follows without choosing between trails. Two beats (trail emergence, note-following) plus thematic closure presence, but no cost where the method constrains or misleads.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is established in setup (opening line), supplies the sensory environment throughout (bark pulses, bioluminescent fronds, mossy hummocks), and frames the closure clearing. The ultrasonics enable Elar's skin-reading and the ring's dowsing. However, the forest does not constrain a choice—no obstacle forces him to navigate by non-ultrasonic means, no fork requires selection. Present across all three gates and integral to tone and method, but does not alter tactics with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the pause of shifting constellations" is poetic setup and reprised in the final line ("constellations resumed their shift as dawn's first ultrasonic hum…"). It marks a single night but does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure, no choice shaped by time running out. Lyric reprise reweights the closure image (pause ending = journey complete), but the timeframe does not participate in middle escalation or impose cost. Setup and closure presence only; missing middle development caps at 3.4, but the reprise lifts slightly within band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation (navigate emotional depths, resolve lover's death) is clear in setup ("Loss had hollowed him… Only the stillpoint could chart those turbulent inner seas") and drives the quest. At closure, the visions dramatize the grief resolution and the new map represents achieved navigation. However, the motivation is not conflicted on the page—Elar never hesitates, doubts the worthiness, or weighs a competing want. Present across all three gates and causally central, but no friction between want and cost mid-journey where a choice must be made.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The tone phrase "quiet blaze" appears in setup ("a motivation… burned with a quiet blaze in his chest"), recurs mid-journey ("the quiet blaze flaring"), and reprises at closure ("a quiet blaze illuminating paths unseen"). It is consistent and modulates with pressure (flaring during doubt, illuminating at resolution). However, "quiet blaze" is a stock oxymoron rather than a specific tonal texture—other passages inflate to "scorching like restrained fire," "languages flooded," "tears evaporating into the blaze of understanding." Tone drifts between contemplative and overwrought without coherent modulation. Setup and closure reprise present, but middle inconsistency and label-reliance lower integration.</comment>
