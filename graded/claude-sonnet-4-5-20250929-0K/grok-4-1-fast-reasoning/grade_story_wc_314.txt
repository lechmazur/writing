<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("to harmonize logic and intuition") but never acts as a lived contradiction in scene—she arranges vials, lights a flame, watches birds, and the problem resolves without visible cost or a choice that forecloses a path. Internal conflict is told ("intuition tugged," "sentimental ache") rather than shown through simultaneous impulses competing in a single beat. The satchel letters and "secretly sentimental" label appear as backstory decoration, never constraining an on-page decision. Embodied emotion is absent; labels like "breath held" and "tears pricked" replace physical sensation, and the final "harmony ignite within" reads as wishful assertion rather than dramatized change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (ritual accumulation toward epiphany), but no meaningful tightening occurs—Elara executes a prepared rite without complication, and the starling patterns arrive as deus ex machina confirmation rather than earned discovery. Closure is asserted ("harmony ignite within," "balanced alchemy promising") but no before/after is legible: no option was foreclosed, no visible cost paid, and the "final transformation" remains off-page abstraction. Orientation is anchored early (who/where/when clear by line 4), so no penalty there, but causality is decorative: the crystal, flame, and birds perform their roles without resistance or surprise. The Orientation Test is satisfied, so cross-caps tied to orientation debt do not apply.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The orchard is vividly rendered ("luminous orbs," "mossy roots that pulsed like veins") but functions as scenic backdrop—no environmental constraint shapes Elara's choices. The crystal and flame are handled across multiple beats (setup, warming, thawing), and the waterfall frames entry and exit, meeting the micro-setting standard for a functional score. However, the setting does not pressure tactics or charge the final image beyond atmosphere; removing the orchard and substituting any sacred grove would leave the plot intact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("harmonize logic and intuition before final transformation") is signaled early but never tested—Elara arranges, lights, observes, and succeeds without reversal, complication, or trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; the ritual unfolds as rehearsed, and the starlings' convergence is gift rather than achievement. Agency is limited to procedural execution (kneeling, lighting, holding aloft) without a choice that narrows possibilities or imposes cost. The "final transformation loomed at dusk" is mentioned but exerts no on-page pressure; no clock tightens decisions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The logic/intuition binary is stated repeatedly ("logic's rigid equations met the wild pulse of intuition," "bridge arching between rigid geometries and fluid waves") but remains abstract—no scene moment dramatizes the tension or its resolution. The ending asserts thematic closure ("harmonized at last") without a resonant image that reweights prior material; the final paragraph is summary rather than lived particularity. The starlings' dance could have charged the concept through specific contradiction (intuition disrupting a logical plan, forcing improvisation), but instead they perform a symbolic charade that confirms rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, and diction maintains an elevated, archaic-fantasy register throughout ("ancient freshness," "arcane labors," "sated stars"). However, distance control is slack: phrases like "secretly sentimental" and "proof that intuition stirred beneath her alchemist's veneer" read as narrator intrusion rather than Elara's self-perception. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not evaluated. Psychic distance remains consistently mid-range, but the prose never modulates under pressure—the same ornate, declarative cadence persists from ritual preparation through purported climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the ritual sequence stacks metaphor or elevated descriptor ("prismatic spray scattering rainbows across the hidden orchard like forgotten jewels from an ancient dawn," "veins of wonder," "vortex of feathers and foresight"). Template cadence is evident in the middle third: "First, a spiral... Then, a blooming flower... The patterns shifted: a bridge..." reads as outline scaffold. Paraphrase loops appear: "touch of wonder" is invoked four times without functional shift, and "ancient freshness" bookends the piece as thematic flag rather than earned image. The density cap (figurative language in most sentences without payoff) triggers −0.6, and the template-cadence run adds −0.5; artifacts touch the closure beat ("touch of wonder descended," "harmonized at last"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The premise—alchemist performs ritual to balance internal polarities before transformation—follows a widely used template (magical preparation → symbolic confirmation → inner change asserted). No specific lived detail, occupational texture, or non-obvious moral calculus transforms it; the "logic vs. intuition" binary and the starling-as-omen device are familiar without fresh synthesis. The orchard and waterfall could be swapped for any liminal threshold, and the crystal/flame/birds sequence reads as interchangeable symbolic furniture. The Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −0.8 within Q8 for template reliance without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara arranges vials, lights a flame, holds the crystal aloft, and rises—all procedural moves without a choice that alters tactics. The character is present throughout but does not create a key turn; the starlings drive the climactic moment. Setup satisfied, development and closure participation are passive observation rather than decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The crystal is introduced early, handled in three beats (holding, warming over flame, thawing), and its meltwater appears in the climax. However, its role is inert: Elara planned to use it, does so, and it performs as expected without complication. Functional across beats but swappable with any ritual catalyst; no unique property constrains a choice or charges the final image with cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Touch of wonder" is named four times but remains abstract—no on-page action demonstrates what it is or how it changes options. The label appears in the opening, the climax description ("touch of wonder descended"), and the closing reflection ("touch of wonder lingered"), but it never shapes a choice or tactic. Present as thematic claim, not causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Secretly sentimental" is declared twice (opening and mid-ritual "tears pricked her eyes—secretly sentimental proof") but never enables or constrains an on-page action. The trait is told, not shown through a choice or trade-off. The satchel letters are mentioned once as backstory decoration, no visible cost attached.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The flame is lit, warms the crystal, and merges with the crystal's essence in the climax. It participates in the ritual's middle and ending beats but does not drive a turn—Elara lights it as planned, it performs its function, and the outcome is confirmation rather than complication. Functional in two beats, but easily swappable with any ritual heat source.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The starlings are introduced at the sun's crest, form three symbolic patterns (spiral, flower, bridge), and converge to frame the climax. They appear in ~four consecutive beats and dominate the ritual's second half, but their arrival is coincidence (Elara did not summon or shape them), and their mechanics are passive confirmation rather than a method she employs. Present in and shaping the ending, but not as a means controlled by the protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The orchard is described across the opening third and frames the ritual space, but it does not constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that alter the outcome. The waterfall reappears in the final line as scenic bookend. Setup satisfied, but no middle or closure participation beyond atmosphere; postcard description dominates over tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Before the final transformation" is stated in the opening and mentioned again at the ritual's completion ("before the final transformation loomed at dusk"), but the timeframe exerts no on-page pressure—no clock tightens decisions, and the ritual proceeds at a leisurely pace with room for elaborate description. Mentioned twice but vague and untracked; no live urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The motivation is declared in the opening ("to harmonize logic and intuition before her final transformation") and reasserted at closure ("harmonized at last"), but it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or a choice with cost. Elara's actions are procedural execution of a prepared plan; no friction between desire and obstacle appears on the page. Told-only across three mentions, no visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Ancient freshness" appears in the opening paragraph ("air hummed with ancient freshness") and returns in the penultimate line ("In this hidden cradle of ancient freshness"), framing the piece. The tone is consistent—elevated, ornate, contemplative—across all beats, but it does not modulate with pressure (the climax maintains the same declarative cadence as the setup) and the final reprise is decorative rather than charged. Early seed and final mention satisfy two gates, but the return does not reweight the stake.</comment>
