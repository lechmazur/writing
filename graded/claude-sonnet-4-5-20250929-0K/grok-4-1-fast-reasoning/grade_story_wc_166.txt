<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to inscribe cosmic verse on mortal skin—is declared but never dramatized as an internal conflict with competing impulses. The spontaneous anchoring triggers panic described in labels ("obsidian grace fracturing like flawed glass") rather than embodied contradiction. Her shift from exile-bound purity to returning to Kai reads as plot convenience; no on-page micro-choice reveals why gaps in stars suddenly override her stated need for isolation. Kai appears only in the final third as a passive canvas, offering no relationship pressure or status friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story opens with vague temporal-conceptual anchors ("after the nostalgia ban had crumbled") and withholds who Elara is, where the garden sits, or what "tide dancer" means past ~200 words; orientation debt applies (−0.4). A Decisive Change occurs—Elara completes the verse and bonds with Kai—but the causal chain is stitched by coincidence: the moonstone speck spontaneously anchors her, then spontaneously releases when she observes star-gaps, with no earned link between observation and physical effect. The closure moment itself (inscribing Kai's arm) lands on the page, but the cost is asserted rather than felt; exile is "complete" by fiat, not foreclosed choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The twilight garden supplies the moonstone speck and star-canopy for gap observation, anchoring two key beats. Sensory detail is vivid but often ornamental ("dew-kissed moss," "roses paling to silver") and does not constrain Elara's choices. The shift to Kai's balcony in the final third is abrupt, with no spatial transition or lived-in texture. The garden's role is functional but the piece could substitute another locale with minor edits; the stars matter more than the ground.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—complete the cosmic verse—is signaled early but never tested by a competing cost or trade-off. The anchoring is imposed by coincidence (stepping on the speck) and resolved by coincidence (observing gaps releases it); Elara's agency is limited to waiting and looking. No on-page reversal narrows her options; the "panic" beat deflates immediately when the anchor spontaneously reverses. The final act (inking Kai) proceeds without friction or visible price; exile is declared "complete" but no path is foreclosed with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of exile, purity versus connection, and cosmic-mortal fusion is declared throughout but never emerges from concrete particulars. The moonstone speck and star-gaps function as symbolic tokens rather than images that reweight prior material. The ending ("some verses endure on mortal skin forever") reads as an explicit moral rather than a resonant image. The nostalgia ban is mentioned twice but never dramatized as a social or personal constraint that shapes Elara's choices or the verse's cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but psychic distance fluctuates without purpose: "exile now felt eternal" tells emotion after showing panic, and "purpose fulfilled" asserts satisfaction without embodied cues. Diction drifts into elevated register ("diaphanous wings of tidal mist," "liquid starfire") that does not reflect Elara's practical dancer background. Kai's single line of dialogue ("Elara?") and his whispered reprise feel generic; no perceptual signature distinguishes his lens from hers in the brief balcony scene. Filter verbs ("she knew," "he gasped") cluster in the final third without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>High figurative density obscures rather than sharpens: "obsidian grace," "milk-fire," "unbreakable thrall," "comet's sigh" stack without payoff. Paraphrase loops appear ("exile now felt eternal" / "elective exile complete"), and template cadence runs ("she knelt," "she straightened," "she descended"). The climactic beat—inking the verse—summarizes in abstraction ("lines bloomed… cosmos etched") rather than showing hand, quill, and skin. Several beats recycle the stem "Elara + verb" without variation. The prose reads overwritten at peak moments, dulling propulsion when clarity is most needed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core premise—artist seeks purity in exile, is physically trapped, escapes by observing cosmic gaps—follows a familiar template (creative block overcome by mystical insight). The moonstone speck, spontaneous anchoring, and star-gaps function as convenient plot devices rather than fresh synthesis. "Tide dancer" and "nostalgia ban" are labels without grounded world logic or choice pressure. The final image (glowing tattoo, entwined lovers) and moral ("some verses endure forever") offer no non-obvious angle; the transformation test fails, as the same arc could be told with "painter," "sculptor," or "poet" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout, but her tide-dancer skill does not drive key turns; dancing appears only in early description. The gap-observation is passive waiting rather than skilled action. She inks Kai at the end, but this beat is summarized and does not leverage tide-dancer technique. Swappable with "poet" or "mage."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The moonstone speck appears in three beats: discovery, anchoring, and as ink powder. It enables the anchoring and provides ink, but its properties (milk-fire, lunar heart) are decorative; any magic dust could serve the same function with minor edits. No specific cost is tied to the speck itself; it "dissolves into nothingness" without consequence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Elective exile frames Elara's setup and is declared at closure ("elective exile complete"), but it does not constrain on-page choices or create dramatized friction between isolation and connection. Her return to Kai proceeds without visible trade-off or renunciation of exile's purpose; the concept is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Spontaneous anchoring traps Elara for one extended beat, forcing her to observe gaps rather than flee. The trait enables the middle turn but is resolved by spontaneous reversal without cost. The mechanics (silver roots) are vivid but the constraint is imposed and lifted by coincidence, limiting integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Fledging (wings unfurl, flight to city) appears only in the final third after the anchor releases. It enables Elara's travel to Kai but does not drive the core turn (gap observation) or face resistance. The action could be replaced with "she ran" or "she rode" without altering the story's logic or emotional arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Observing gaps is signaled early ("gaps between stars") and executes the middle beat, but the method's mechanics are vague: how does noticing absences in constellations dissolve physical roots? The verse coalesces spontaneously after observation, not through a visible process. The method appears in setup and payoff but lacks development or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The twilight garden under stars supplies the moonstone speck and star-canopy for gap observation, anchoring two key beats. The garden constrains Elara's location during the anchoring but does not pressure her choices or alter tactics; she could observe gaps from any vantage. The shift to Kai's balcony is abrupt, and the garden's thematic echo in the final line is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The nostalgia ban's end is mentioned in the opening and once mid-story ("post-ban splendor") but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The timeframe is conceptual backdrop rather than a constraint that alters Elara's tactics or stakes. No urgency or cost is tied to the ban's status at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The motivation—to pen cosmic verse on mortal skin—is declared early and drives the setup, but it is never dramatized as a conflicted desire. No on-page beat shows Elara weighing the verse's cost against isolation or connection; she completes it in the final third without friction. Kai's desire is mentioned in backstory but not tested. The motivation is present but not pressured.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Obsidian grace is a recurring phrase ("embodied her elective exile with obsidian grace," "obsidian grace fracturing," "obsidian grace restored," "obsidian grace enveloped them") but functions as a label rather than a modulating tone. The prose remains elevated and ornamental throughout, with no coherent shift under pressure; panic is described in metaphor rather than registered in syntax or rhythm. The tone is static and does not charge the final image.</comment>
