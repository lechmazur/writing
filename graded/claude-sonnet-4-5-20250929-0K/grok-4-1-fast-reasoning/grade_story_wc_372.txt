<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is stated ("to conjure meaning from that brink") but never tested by a credible counter-desire or trade-off. His "gently meticulous" trait appears as label and gesture ("adjusted his spectacles, fingers tracing") without constraining a choice or exacting visible cost. The final smile and securing of the slide read as summary triumph rather than earned change through contradictory impulses. No internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene; actions follow a single orderly path without ambiguity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by ~60 words, satisfying the test. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: frequency sampling builds density toward a resonant chord. However, closure lacks legible cost—the library "ascends once more" and Elias smiles, restoring order without on-page forfeiture or foreclosed path. The vows stabilize, but no visible price is paid; the ending declares success rather than dramatizing a trade-off or renunciation. Without felt cost at closure, the RR (Resonant Reconfiguration) claim is not demonstrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The frozen library setting is vivid ("frost veiled forgotten tomes," "clouds swirling far below") and the quartz/ice motifs recur. The lantern device and crystalline gauge are present but function as props for narrated procedure rather than constraining a tactical choice. The library's groaning and drift toward oblivion create atmospheric pressure but do not force Elias to alter his method or accept a spatial limitation. Sensory detail is selective and evocative, yet the setting remains backdrop rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—salvaging the vows—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through decay descriptions ("edges frayed," "frequencies waned") but escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency or a live trade-off. The gauge trembles and vows resist fade, but Elias's actions follow an uninterrupted checklist (sample, note, calibrate, fuse) without a reversal or forced choice. The ending triumph ("frequencies stabilized at unity's baseline") resolves the problem without visible cost or tactic shift. No on-page price alters later moves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme—order salvaging meaning from oblivion—emerges from repeated motifs (frequencies, luminous vows, quartz hush). The final ledger and ascent offer a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the ending's assertion "order triumphed gently" borders on a stated moral, and "meaning conjured from near-void" abstracts the victory rather than anchoring it in a particular image with undeniable cost. The vows' harmonization is told ("frequencies stabilized") rather than shown through a specific embodied consequence. Subtext operates in imagery but the closure line summarizes rather than resonates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited focused on Elias. Voice carries elevated, lyric diction ("quartz hush," "ethereal wisps") that reads purposeful and consistent. However, register uniformity flattens across pressure peaks—intensity does not modulate syntax or rhythm. Repetitive stems appear: "gently meticulous" recurs three times, "luminous vows" six times, creating template cadence. No dialogue is present. Perceptual signature is generic archival ("orderly," "meticulous") without character-specific bias in what Elias notices or ignores. Under peak stress, diction remains ornate rather than compressing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "illusions faded to memory" appears four times; "gently meticulous" three times; "luminous vows" six times; "quartz hush" recurs as both anchor and filler. Template cadence runs: "Elias [verb], [object]" structures dominate without variation. Figurative language ("dying stars," "divining rod," "cloud-forged silver") appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density without clarity. The ending beat—"order triumphed gently"—is abstracted rather than image-driven. Mixed metaphors (vows as stars, waves, melody) blur sensory coherence. Artifact penalty: −1.2 total in Q7; loops and stems touch closure. Disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The premise—measuring decaying vows in a sky library—offers a conceptual frame but executes through generic procedural beats (attune, note, calibrate, fuse). The core emotional arc (salvaging meaning from oblivion) could transfer to any archivist setting with minor edits. No turn or intensification grows from unique world logic or character trade-off; the gauge always works, the vows always respond, and order always wins. Figurative language (frequencies as light, vows as melody) is stock rather than synthesis. The ending restores equilibrium without risk or irreversible cost, trending toward safety middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias as "orderly records chief" is present throughout but his choices do not create turns. He follows a procedural sequence (sample, note, fuse) without deviation or trade-off. His final act (securing the slide) restores order rather than altering it. The role is functional but replaceable; any meticulous archivist could perform these beats. No decision forecloses a path or introduces visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide is handled in multiple beats: placed in the lantern, ignited, projected, used for sampling, and secured at the end. It enables the vow projection and sampling action. However, its specific properties (filigreed frame, humming surface) do not constrain a choice or impose a cost. The slide could be replaced by any projection device without altering stakes. It appears in setup, middle, and closure but does not reweight meaning or charge the final image beyond being the tool that completes the task.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Luminous vows" anchor the stake and drive the sampling action. They shape tactics (measuring frequencies, fusing samples) and appear in the ending (vows renewed, continuity promised). However, the concept functions primarily as the object of salvage rather than a force that constrains Elias's choices. The vows' decay creates atmospheric pressure but does not impose a trade-off or limit his options. Setup, development, and closure participation are present, earning functional credit, but causal pressure and specificity are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Gently meticulous" appears three times as label ("gently meticulous care," "Gently meticulous, he adjusted," "Gently meticulous, he initiated"). It describes Elias's manner but never constrains an action or exacts a visible cost. No beat shows his meticulousness forcing him to slow down at a critical moment or to choose precision over speed. The trait is ornamental; removing it would not alter any turn or the closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Measure" (and "measuring," "measured") drives multiple beats: Elias measures frequencies, samples, amplitude, decay, and final overtones. The action is central to the procedural arc and appears in setup, middle, and ending. However, the act of measuring itself does not create a reversal or force a difficult choice—it is the method that always succeeds. Swapping "measure" for "record" or "analyze" would require only minor edits. The action is essential to the task but not irreplaceable in story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"By sampling frequencies" is signaled early and executed across multiple beats (432 Hz unity, 528 Hz renewal, 741 Hz truth, 852 Hz spirit, 963 Hz transcendence). The method shapes attempts and is integral to the resolution (fusing samples into a resonant chord). Its mechanics appear on the page and drive the procedural arc. However, the method does not impose a constraint or cost; each sample succeeds without complication. It is present in all three gates but swappable with other measurement techniques without altering stakes.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "frozen library above clouds" is vividly described and present throughout. The library's chill deepens, shelves groan and contract, and it drifts lower—creating atmospheric pressure. At the end, it ascends, linking setting to outcome. However, the setting does not constrain Elias's choices or supply a resource that alters tactics. The frost and cold are backdrop rather than obstacle. Spatial choreography is clear but the environment does not pressure a turn. Setup, middle presence, and closure participation are met, but causal pressure is limited.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"While illusions fade to memory" recurs four times, bracketing the narrative and appearing in the final third. The timeframe creates atmospheric decay (illusions receding, vows dimming) and is woven into the thematic texture. However, it does not function as a live clock that tightens decisions or alters tactics. Elias proceeds methodically without time pressure forcing a choice or omission. The element is present in setup and closure, offering lyric resonance, but lacks mid-scene development that narrows options. Cap at 4.6 per missing-middle-development rule; adjust down for ornamental recurrence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is stated early ("His motivation burned clear") and restated ("Driven to conjure from oblivion's edge"). It frames the quest and aligns with the ending (meaning conjured, continuity promised). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or a visible trade-off. Elias's determination never wavers or costs him something on the page. The desire is present in setup and closure but lacks friction between wants and costs in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Quartz hush" anchors tone in the opening line and recurs ("The quartz hush deepened," "The quartz hush thickened," "quartz hush now vibrant"). The tone is coherent—elevated, crystalline, contemplative—and modulates subtly (deepening chill, then vibrant glow). The final image ("In that suspended realm above clouds, order triumphed gently") maintains the tone and the hush imagery charges the resolution. However, the tone remains largely static; no sharp tonal shift marks escalation or cost. All three gates are met and the tone supports closure, but it does not decisively reweight the stakes.</comment>
