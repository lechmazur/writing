<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Jax's motivation to help Elara kindle empathy is clear, but his interior life reads generic—"jaded wonder," "clean slate," and "motivation crystallized" are labels rather than embodied contradiction. The neural wipe setup never constrains a present choice; backstory dominates without micro-choices that tilt present stakes. Elara's tear at the end arrives without prior dramatized resistance, making the change feel declared rather than earned through her agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchors emerge only after extended abstraction ("sterile haze," "dim apartment," "underground lake" all lack spatial grounding until well past 120 words); apply −0.4 and cap Q3 at 7.0. The closure unit—Elara's tear and empathy flicker—is asserted rather than shown through a decisive act or stance that forecloses a path. The drive lens wavers between causal (heist → wipe → journey) and accumulative/textural (newspapers, lake glow) without a taught pattern or coherent escalation method. No visible cost: the baseball "mends," but we never see what Jax or Elara forfeit on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The underground bioluminescent lake is vividly described ("azure," "phosphorescent algae," "delicate robust currents"), and the newspapers/subway grates provide concrete anchors. However, the lake functions as a backdrop for epiphany rather than constraining choice—Jax and Elara arrive, the illusions appear, and empathy kindles without the environment altering their tactics. Spatial choreography in the tunnels is vague ("twisted," "hours blurred"), and the cavern's properties (algae, currents) are ornamental rather than load-bearing at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—kindling Elara's empathy—is signaled early but never tested by a live choice or trade-off. The journey unfolds as a sequence of descriptions (subway, fungi, lake) without on-page reversal or tightening; Elara simply "waited there" per the newspapers' prophecy, and the baseball's touch triggers her tear with no visible cost or decision. Coincidence (newspapers foretold her presence) resolves the problem, and neither protagonist loses or sacrifices anything concrete to earn the closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of choices and empathy emerges from the labyrinth concept and Jax's neural wipe, but it is stated rather than dramatized: "choices breathe," "empathy kindling," "futures rewritten." The baseball and lake illusions are symbolic conveniences introduced to harvest theme rather than arising from prior particulars. The final image—"etched with chosen light"—is a generic platitude that tells the theme instead of embodying it in a non-literal, resonant action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited (Jax), and the voice carries a consistent lyric register ("delicately robust," "jaded wonder"). However, diction frequently drifts into abstraction ("calcified heart," "hollow shell," "walking void") that labels rather than filters through Jax's specific perception. Elara's dialogue—none—and Jax's single line ("This place... it's the labyrinth of choices") feel expository rather than goal-driven. The prose is controlled but generic; no perceptual signature distinguishes Jax's way of noticing from a neutral narrator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: "delicately robust" appears three times, "jaded wonder" four times, creating a loop that dulls momentum (apply −0.8 for density and repetition in peak beats). Mixed metaphors: "cracked like ancient parchment yet unyielding under pressure" contradicts itself; "calcified heart" and "hollow shell" are stacked clichés. Template cadence: "He unfolded... began reading... Patterns emerged... Chronos had marked... Jax's motivation crystallized" runs identical stems without variation. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("delicately robust" in the lake description, "jaded wonder" in the final line), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Scaffold phrases ("amid crumpled newspapers," "fueled by jaded wonder") add no information.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The core premise—neural wipe + time-traveler baseball + underground lake of choices—is a checklist of speculative tropes without fresh synthesis. The newspapers-as-map device is generic treasure-hunt logic, and the bioluminescent lake illusions that "birth paths" are a familiar metaphor. Jax's arc (redemption via helping his partner) and Elara's tear (empathy restored) follow a well-worn template without transformation through specific, lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. No bold structural risk or perspectival choice elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Jax ("clean slate seeker with dirty past") is named early and his wipe/heist backstory frames the journey, but he makes no on-page decision that alters tactics—he follows the newspapers' prophecy to the lake, holds out the baseball, and recounts his past. Elara's tear arrives without his agency forcing a turn. Present by setup and ending (two gates), but his choices do not constrain or enable the closure. Functional but replaceable; a generic guide figure could occupy the role with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The baseball signed "To Jax, choose wisely—Chronos, 2047" is introduced early (~10% mark), returns at the lake when Jax holds it out, and Elara touches it to trigger her tear. Three beats (discovery, journey mention, lake payoff) and closure linkage earn mid-band. However, its function is ornamental: it serves as a token that "sparked something human" without constraining Jax's choices or altering his tactics; any memento could substitute. The signature's time-travel claim is told, never demonstrated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Labyrinth of choices" is named early ("a labyrinth of choices hidden beneath the city") and surfaces again at the lake ("it's the labyrinth of choices"). The lake illusions show "glowing paths forking into infinities," but this is backdrop for theme rather than a mechanic that shapes Jax's or Elara's tactics. The concept is present in setup and ending (two gates) but does not constrain or enable an on-page choice. Functional but largely thematic decoration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Delicately robust" is applied to the baseball ("delicately robust—its leather cracked... yet unyielding"), the lake currents ("delicate robust currents... fragile in shimmer yet eternally resilient"), and Elara's palm ("delicately robust in her palm"). Three mentions, but all are descriptive labels without constraining or enabling an action. No on-page tradeoff arises from this attribute; it functions as thematic ornament. Present by setup and ending, but ornamental use and swappability (any paradoxical descriptor could replace it) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The journey from apartment to underground lake structures the entire middle (newspapers → subways → tunnels → lake) and delivers Jax to the closure location. It is signaled early, occupies multiple beats, and enables the ending. However, the journey itself is a sequence of descriptions without a causal turn—no wrong path, obstacle, or sacrifice alters Jax's tactics. The newspapers foretold the route and Elara's presence, so the journey is guaranteed rather than tested. Essential to plot structure but does not redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Reading between newspaper lines" is introduced early ("began reading between the lines... the buried obits, the odd ads... Patterns emerged") and mentioned again during the journey ("navigated by the papers' cryptic hints"). Two beats and setup gate satisfied. However, the method is told rather than shown—we never see Jax decode a specific obit or ad on the page, and the mechanics (how "obit dates align with station names") are asserted without demonstration. Functional but abstract; any treasure-map device could replace it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The underground bioluminescent lake is signaled midway (~50% mark, late penalty −0.3) and serves as the closure location where Elara touches the baseball and "empathy kindles." The lake's properties (algae, azure glow, illusions) are described but do not constrain Jax's or Elara's choices—they arrive, observe illusions, and the baseball sparks empathy without the environment altering tactics. Present in ending (one gate) and vivid, but largely a backdrop. Closure linkage and sensory detail partially offset the late introduction and lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the procedure" anchors the opening ("Jax blinked into the sterile haze after the procedure") and frames his clean-slate state, but time as a constraint never tightens decisions. The journey takes "hours" (vague), and there is no live clock pressuring Jax or Elara at the lake. The procedure's aftermath is setup only; it does not recur or shape the ending. Present by setup (one gate) but ornamental; the story could begin "years after" with no structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To kindle empathy where none remains" is named explicitly ("his motivation crystallized—to kindle empathy... in Elara") and drives Jax's journey to the lake. The motive is present in setup, middle (journey purpose), and ending (Elara's tear, "empathy kindling faint"). However, the desire is told and static—Jax never faces a choice that conflicts with this want or reveals a cost. The ending declares success ("empathy flickered") without dramatizing friction between wants and obstacles. Essential to plot but not conflicted in action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Jaded wonder" is named four times ("jaded by the wonder," "Jaded wonder stirred," "fueled by jaded wonder," "In that jaded wonder") and colors the voice throughout. The tone is present in setup, middle, and ending (three gates) and modulates slightly from skepticism ("who signs a baseball from the future?") to cautious hope ("smiled... no longer blank"). However, the label is stated rather than embodied in Jax's perceptual texture—his observations remain neutral exposition. Coherent across beats but static and tell-heavy; the final image relies on the label rather than charging it through action.</comment>
