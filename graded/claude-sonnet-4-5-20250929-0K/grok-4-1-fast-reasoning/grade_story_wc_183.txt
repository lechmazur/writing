<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find the garden is stated but her choices feel predetermined rather than tested under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstract phrases ("unkindled solace," "blissfully aberrant") that function as labels rather than embodied contradiction. The chimera twin remains a memory-construct without on-page presence until the final third, so no relationship pressure exists. The discovery-to-reunion arc is summarized across years rather than dramatized in micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: Elara collects narrative threads across the ship to open the garden archway. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive early enough. The closure—stepping through the archway with her twin—lands on the page, but the cost is abstract ("trapped freedom," "unkindled solace") rather than a visible forfeiture or decision that narrows options. The method (weaving threads) connects beats, but each thread-binding feels iterative without meaningful tightening or a reversal that changes tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The carnival ship setting supplies vivid, purposeful details (Ferris wheel, funhouse mirrors, ghost train) that anchor the accumulative lens and provide spatial waypoints for each thread. The emerald swatch card appears physically and recurs with evolving function (gift → tool → roots). Fog as a constraint shapes the tone and closure image. No choreography confusion, and the environment charges the final archway moment, lifting this above mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reach the garden—is clear and sustained. The thread-weaving method provides structure, but each binding (clown, lovers, sailor, acrobats) feels additive without escalating cost or forcing trade-offs. No reversal narrows Elara's options; she collects threads in sequence until the archway appears. The reunion with her twin is achieved without visible sacrifice or a choice that forecloses another path, so pressure accumulates without tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The concept of "trapped freedom" and "forgotten names" recurs consistently and shapes the thematic frame. The ending image (garden as eternal maze, "free to remember, trapped in endless rediscovery") offers a non-literal answer with conceptual resonance. However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit statement ("Elara's motivation fulfilled, but the tone persisted") rather than trusting the image alone, and "unkindled solace" is repeated as a label rather than dramatized through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. Perceptual signature is present (carnival imagery filtered through Elara's quest) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated or abstract register ("blissfully aberrant fusion," "unkindled solace") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. The chimera twin's single line of dialogue ("We are recaptured") carries weight, but there is no sustained exchange to test voice distinction. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on repeated abstract phrases: "unkindled solace" (five times), "blissfully aberrant" (four times), "trapped freedom" (four times) creates a template cadence that dulls momentum. Paraphrase loops are visible ("Memories began to alter" / "Memories altered further" / "Memories altered wildly now"). Mixed metaphors: "fog sealed every horizon" vs. "fog reclaimed the ship." Apply −1.2 cumulative for loops, stock metaphor strings, and phrase recycling across beats. Information density is moderate; many sentences restate tone rather than advance situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The carnival-ship-as-liminal-space and the method of weaving narrative threads offer a fresh synthesis. However, the chimera twin and "garden of forgotten names" lean on familiar fantasy/surrealism templates without transformation through specific lived detail. The ending's circular entrapment ("eternal in its quiet hold") is conceptually coherent but predictable given the repeated "trapped freedom" motif. No bold structural risk or non-obvious moral calculus elevates the premise beyond its genre baseline.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her quest drives the structure. She handles the emerald swatch card, recites stories, and binds threads across multiple beats (carousel, ghost train, Ferris wheel, prow). However, her choices do not face friction or force trade-offs; she executes a plan without deviation. The final reunion is achieved by completing the weave, but no on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses another path. Setup and development gates met; payoff is participation without causal turn. Causal pressure mild; closure linkage present but passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The emerald swatch card is introduced in the first third (funhouse) and recurs functionally: draped over threads (carousel, big top, ghost train, Ferris wheel), pulsing light, dissolving into soil at the end. It is handled across four distinct beats and its transformation (card → roots) reweights the closure image. However, it does not constrain a choice or force a cost; Elara uses it as a tool without trade-off. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Beat involvement strong; causal pressure and cost connection weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Unkindled solace" is repeated five times as thematic descriptor ("comfort without spark," "chill peace," "peace without fire") but does not shape an on-page choice or tactic. It labels Elara's emotional state without constraining action. Present in the ending but as mood rather than stake-altering force. Setup and payoff gates met via repetition; development gate missing (no middle choice tied to this concept). Ornamental use; swappable with similar mood phrases.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Blissfully aberrant" is applied four times: to the twin's form, to the threads' imperfection, to the twin's joy in flight, and to the final reunion. It functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains or enables action with cost. The twin's aberrance is described but does not force Elara to adapt tactics or pay a visible price. Setup and payoff gates met via repetition; development gate weak (twin's flight is backstory, not on-page choice). Label-only use; no visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Recapture" frames the action: Elara recaptures narrative threads to reclaim her twin and lost names. The method is signaled early (threads strung across the ship) and each binding advances the quest. The twin's line "We are recaptured" articulates the thematic endpoint. However, the action is iterative collection without a turn; swapping "recapture" for "gather" or "restore" would require only minor edits. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Beat involvement across middle and end; causal pressure moderate; specificity low.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The method "through narrative threads" is signaled in the first third and used across four beats (carousel, big top, ghost train, Ferris wheel, prow tapestry). Elara recites each thread's story and binds the card, and the method's completion opens the archway. The mechanics are clear and shape her attempts. However, the method does not impose friction or require adaptation; each thread-binding succeeds without complication. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Beat involvement strong; causal pressure mild (no failed attempt or forced revision).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The carnival ship provides spatial structure (Ferris wheel, carousel, funhouse, ghost train, big top, prow) and each location anchors a thread-binding beat. The fog constrains visibility and seals horizons, reinforcing "trapped freedom." The setting supplies the narrative threads themselves (carnival tales from performers) and the archway emerges from the ship's prow. The setting is indispensable to the closure image. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Causal pressure and closure linkage strong; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"As memories alter" appears in the title and recurs as a timeframe marker ("Memories began to alter," "altered further," "altered wildly now," "would alter here too"). However, the alteration does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline; it describes a fluid state rather than a live clock. The timeframe is thematic mood rather than pressure mechanism. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak (no middle choice forced by time). Ornamental use; does not narrow tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to find the garden is stated early and drives every beat; Elara collects threads to open the garden archway. The twin's murmur ("Weave us back, sister") reinforces the goal. However, the motivation is not dramatized through conflicting wants or costs; Elara pursues it without friction or temptation to abandon the quest. The garden is reached, fulfilling the want without visible sacrifice. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Causal role clear; friction and cost weak.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Trapped freedom" is signaled early and recurs across beats (roaming the ship, soaring in reverie, stepping into the eternal garden maze). The tone coheres through the ending and charges the final image ("free to remember, trapped in endless rediscovery"). However, the tone is stated more often than modulated; it remains a steady mood rather than shifting with pressure. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Closure linkage strong; modulation under pressure weak. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-6 band.</comment>
