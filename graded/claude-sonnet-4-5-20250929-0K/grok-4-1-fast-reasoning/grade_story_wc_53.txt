<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivations are established (reclaim lost youth, negotiate with his ghost), but his interior life remains abstract and label-heavy ("ambitions eroded," "regret coiled"). The ghost confrontation at the climax delivers labels rather than embodied contradiction—"You eroded us" reads as thesis, not lived interiority. Micro-choices are present (cranking the wheel, offering it to the ghost) but feel mechanical rather than driven by contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final renunciation lacks visible cost that forecloses a path; he simply steps back and descends with "ambitions reborn," which undercuts the earned-stasis logic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: fragments accrue until Elias confronts his ghost and steps away from the carousel. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (stepping back, vowing "grounded hunts"), but the cost is asserted ("regret lingered") rather than dramatized in the final image. Orientation is delayed—carousel, lagoon, and Elias's scavenger role are not anchored concretely until multiple paragraphs in, causing mild disorientation. The ghost negotiation is the dominant stake, but the turn (ghost refuses, Elias offers the wheel, pact forms, Elias descends) feels summarized rather than pressure-tested on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon and carousel are vividly sketched ("viscous waters," "brass-rimmed platforms"), but they function primarily as backdrop rather than constraining choice. The disposable camera wheel is handled multiple times and its plastic texture is noted, yet it never limits Elias's options or alters his tactics—it simply collects stories. The final image ("wheel discarded at last, spun lazily on a lily pad") charges the ending modestly, lifting the score into mid-band, but the environment itself does not pressure the negotiation or descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—negotiate with the ghost to reclaim lost ambitions—is signaled early and persists. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ghost refuses Elias's request, forcing him to offer the wheel instead. However, the escalation is summary-heavy: "stories hummed from the device, weaving into a pact" tells rather than shows the reversal. The cost of stepping back from the carousel is asserted ("ambitions reformed, not sharp but resilient") but lacks a visible forfeiture or tradeoff on the page. Agency is present but does not narrow options in a way that charges the final image under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme—eroded ambitions, the cost of endless pursuit—emerges from the carousel's halt and Elias's collected fragments. The wheel's final discard and Elias's descent offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the piece edges toward abstraction: "chronologically confused," "fractured stillness," and "regret lingered" are stated more than embodied. The ghost dialogue ("You eroded us") veers close to thematic echo. The ending reweights prior material (wheel empty, capturing "nothing but sky") with modest charge, earning mid-6 range.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but leans abstract: "chronologically confused," "viscous waters," "spectral echo" read as elevated diction rather than Elias's scavenger idiom. Purposeful compression and lyric phrasing are evident ("Time had always been chronologically confused here"), but the voice does not modulate distinctly under pressure—peak beats carry the same elevated register as exposition. The ghost's voice ("Ghosts don't bargain; they haunt") feels externally authored rather than filtered through Elias's perception, and dialogue mechanics are clean but do not advance subtext or goal pursuit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense throughout ("kinetic lagoon," "vapor reefs," "carousel dust glittering on spectral shoulders") without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, triggering overwriting deductions. Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "ambitions—once sharp as scavenger blades—lay worn to nubs" restates "ambitions he'd chased" within two lines; "carousel ceased its hypnotic whirl" echoes "carousel halted." Sentence stems repeat ("Elias X," "The Y," "From the Z") across beats without variation. Register drifts into abstract diction ("chronologically misplaced," "fractured polyphony") that clashes with scavenger-POV lexicon. Accumulative artifacts (density without clarity, loops, template cadence) justify −0.6 to −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon and disposable camera wheel offer fresh specificity, and the ghost-as-younger-self premise is a non-obvious angle on regret. However, the emotional arc—scavenger confronts past, renounces endless pursuit, descends to solid ground—fits a familiar template (journey to acceptance) without transformation through lived detail or a non-obvious moral calculus. The wheel's mechanics (cranking to collect story fragments) are introduced but not developed into a system that constrains choice. Risk-taking is modest; the piece avoids bold structural moves that might heighten stakes, and the closure lands safely in lyric abstraction rather than earned particularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout, signals early, and his choices (cranking the wheel, offering it to the ghost, stepping back) drive two key beats and shape the ending. However, his scavenger trait is label-only—he collects stories but the scavenging method does not constrain tactics or create visible cost. The final descent is a decision that alters outcome, but "resolute scavenger" as a character attribute is swappable with "haunted seeker" without structural loss. Two gates met (setup, payoff); score trends mid-5s for causal presence without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The camera wheel appears early ("In his pocket spun the disposable camera wheel"), is used in multiple beats (cranking to collect fragments, jamming, offered to the ghost, discarded on the lily pad), and its plastic texture and ratchet sound are noted. It enables Elias's method and participates in the closure (discarded, "capturing nothing but sky"). However, the wheel could be replaced with any collection device (recorder, journal) without breaking logic—its disposable-camera specificity does not constrain choice. All three gates met; causal involvement and closure linkage lift score to mid-6s, but swappability caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Eroded ambitions" is stated repeatedly ("ambitions—once sharp as scavenger blades—lay worn to nubs," "Ambitions ground to powder," "ambitions reborn") and frames the dominant stake (reclaim lost youth). It shapes Elias's goal and the ghost's accusation, but most articulation is thematic echo rather than on-page constraint—Elias's tactics are not visibly altered by the erosion itself. The concept participates in closure ("ambitions reformed, not sharp but resilient"), meeting all three gates, but its function is largely atmospheric. Score trends low-5s for presence across beats without causal pressure that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Chronologically confused" is stated ("Time had always been chronologically confused here," "chronologically misplaced," "chronologically adrift," "chronologically clarified") but remains label-only. The trait does not constrain or enable a single on-page action with visible cost—Elias's choices proceed linearly despite the temporal confusion. The attribute is ornamental texture rather than a plot driver. Setup present, but no middle development or closure participation; cap at 4.6 for missing middle gate, further lowered by label-only use and swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Regret" is seeded early ("regretted squandering them," "Regret coiled in his gut"), drives the middle turn (Elias confronts the ghost, fueled by assembled regrets), and shapes the ending ("Regret lingered, a faint click in his pocket"). However, the action is mostly internal and summarized—regret is stated rather than enacted through a visible choice with cost. All three gates met, and the action is present in closure, but swappability (replace "regret" with "longing" or "grief") and summary-only execution cap score at high-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Collecting fragments of overheard stories" is signaled early ("Whispers drifted from the lagoon's depths—fragments of overheard stories," "Elias scavenged them relentlessly"), demonstrated in beats (cranking the wheel to reel in voices), and enables the ghost negotiation. The method's mechanics (wheel clicks, voices overlap) are specific and return at closure ("stories collected, ghost appeased"). All three gates met, beat involvement in two sequences, and closure linkage justify mid-6 range. However, the method could be simplified (he remembers stories, he dreams them) without breaking the ghost-confrontation logic, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is named in the opening line and returns at closure ("The lagoon waited, eternally fractured"), meeting setup and payoff gates. It provides vivid description ("viscous waters," "lily pad," "waters stilled further") but does not constrain Elias's choices or supply resources that affect outcome—he kneels on a lily pad, but any platform would suffice. Missing middle development gate caps at 4.6; modest specificity (lily pad as perch) nudges score slightly higher, but swappability and postcard function limit integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"After the carousel halts" frames the opening and the narrative present. The halt is the inciting condition (stillness replaces spin, enabling Elias's ghost negotiation) and recurs at closure ("carousel dreamed of motion" but Elias descends). Setup and payoff gates met. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics—no live clock pressures Elias's choices, and the "stillness" is static atmosphere rather than a countdown. Score trends low-5s for presence and thematic coherence without escalation pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias's desire to negotiate with his ghost is stated early ("To reclaim even a sliver, he needed to negotiate with his own ghost"), drives the middle sequence (collecting stories, confronting the ghost), and resolves at closure (pact formed, Elias descends). The motivation is dramatized through choices (cranking the wheel, offering it) with visible friction (ghost refuses, then accepts). All three gates met, causal pressure in two beats, and closure linkage justify mid-6 range. However, the negotiation itself is summarized ("stories hummed from the device, weaving into a pact") rather than enacted with visible cost, and the motivation could be swapped for "reconcile with the past" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Fractured stillness" is established in the opening ("world fractured into stillness," "eroded hush") and modulates through beats ("lagoon's waters stilled further," "deepening stillness"). The tone charges the final image ("stillness held promise," "chronological peace") and coheres with the accumulative lens. All three gates met, and the tone reweights the carousel's prior motion. However, the tone is largely static—no purposeful modulation under pressure to heighten escalation—and "fractured" is stated more than embodied in syntax or rhythm. Score trends low-6s for coherence and closure linkage without dynamic pressure-charge.</comment>
