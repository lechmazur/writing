<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirion's motivation is clear and rooted in his role as guardian, but his interior life remains largely abstract—"eyes held the weight of fallen epochs" is label-only. The piece tells us he is diminutive and titan-essence but never dramatizes internal contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. His actions align with stated motive, yet the final "smiled faintly" lacks the contradictory impulse or visible cost that would earn a meaningful change at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through repeated cryptic messages, constellations pause and resume, and the final cascade reweights the pretender's claim. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. However, the closure—"thrones toppled in slow, elegant arcs"—is summarized rather than dramatized on the page, and the cost to Lirion himself (temporal binding vs. verity's triumph) is asserted but not felt. The Conceptual Repricing is present but weakened by summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The temple library is vivid and purposeful: dust motes, vaulted arches, constellations wheeling outside. The eternal font provides water for the ink, and the temporal snare binds Lirion—both constrain his method and charge the stakes. Spatial choreography (hidden pouch, shadowed alcove, towering stacks) remains clear. The "pause of shifting constellations" recurs to frame the timeframe and returns at closure, reweighting the library's role, which lifts this into the 6.5–7.0 neighborhood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unmask the pretender—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the drift of loyalty and spies drawing nearer, with one meaningful tightening when the final book reaches the pretender during coronation. However, the climactic sundering is told ("truths cascaded—forged scrolls exposed") rather than shown, and Lirion's own agency at closure is observation rather than decisive action. The cost is conceptual (empire's graceful collapse) but summarized, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—truth versus artifice, the weight of lineage—emerges from concrete actions (inscribing runes, sowing revelations) rather than assertion. The iron gall ink's "acrid permanence mocking ephemeral lies" and the final rune igniting in spectral light offer non-literal answers. However, "verity's quiet triumph" in the final line edges toward thematic summary. The recurring image of drift reweights meaning at closure, and the graceful collapse carries conceptual cost, keeping this in the upper 6s despite the slight moralizing close.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Lirion. Perceptual signature ("dust motes hung eternal," "constellations' pause") is distinctive, but diction often drifts into elevated register ("titanic essence forged in the world's dawn," "temporal snare") that edges toward narrator assistance rather than Lirion's lived voice. Free indirect style is clean, yet the prose favors abstraction ("tectonic intent," "verity's quiet triumph") over embodied immediacy. Rhythm supports atmosphere but flattens under peak pressure—"truths cascaded" and "banners fell" read summary rather than dramatized perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "dust motes hung eternal," "honeyed decrees," "fragile weave," "rusty-black," "mist among stacks," "chaff before the gale," "silken ruin," "autumn leaves," "elegant arcs." In the climax paragraph alone, metaphors stack without breathing room—"spectral light," "cascade of silken ruin," "autumn leaves," "elegant arcs"—blurring the concrete action. Template cadence appears in paired descriptors ("regally unpretentious," "rusty-black," "graceful collapse"). Paraphrase loop: "the pause broken by verity's quiet triumph" and "constellations resuming their dance" restate closure twice. Apply −0.6 for density in peak beats, −0.3 for template cadence, −0.2 for paraphrase loop, totaling −1.1; artifacts touch closure, so cap at 5.4 per artifact penalty pack and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Premise—diminutive titan using cryptic ink-runes to unmask a usurper from a time-lost library—offers a fresh synthesis of familiar elements (guardian, false king, magical messages). The iron gall ink and drift-rune specificity add particularity. However, the emotional arc (quiet guardian → quiet triumph) could transfer to other settings with minor edits, and the "graceful collapse" resolution feels aesthetically predetermined rather than earned through character friction. The risk-taking in tone and setting elevates within band, but the transformation test reveals insufficient grounding in lived human complexity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Lirion is present throughout and his choices (inscribing runes, selecting tomes, crushing the final pellet) create key turns. He appears early, drives at least three distinct beats (first message, sowing seeds, final inscription), and his action enables the climax. However, his diminutive-titan nature is label-only—it does not constrain his method or cost him anything on the page. His physicality (small form, steady hand) is described but never tested. Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is indirect (he inscribes, pretender falls off-page). Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal enablement +0.6, closure indirect +0.3, irreplaceability low (any guardian could inscribe) −0.5, label-only trait −0.3, total ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Iron gall ink pellet is handled in three beats: drawn from pouch, dissolved in spring water (rusty-black bloom), crushed for the final amplified sigil. Early signal (first third) +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (ink enables runes that drift to seekers) +0.8, closure linkage (final pellet amplifies the coronation rune) +1.0, specificity (tannic heart, acrid permanence, deepens with age) +0.5. However, the pellet is swappable with any magical ink without breaking logic −0.4, and the final crushing is told rather than shown −0.3. Total ~6.8; rounded 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Rune of drift is inscribed and described ("swirling sigil evoking wanderlust of thought and fate") and propels words through the ether. Present in first third +0.5, involved in one beat (first inscription; later uses summarized) +0.4, causal pressure (enables books to drift to seekers) +0.6, closure linkage (final rune ignites in spectral light) +0.7. However, the mechanics are vague—how drift works is asserted, not shown—and it could be replaced with "teleportation rune" or "sending spell" with minor edits −0.6. Summary-only in middle uses −0.4. Total ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Regally unpretentious" is stated twice ("regally unpretentious in his simplespun robes," "ever regally unpretentious, moved like mist") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. It is label-only characterization that does not alter his speech, choices, or tactics. Early signal +0.3, ornamental use (description without action pressure) −0.8, swappable (remove the phrase and nothing changes) −0.6, label-only −0.3. Total ~3.6; cap 3.8 for swappability applies, final 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Sunder" appears in the final missive ("By drift's rune, sunder the veil") and the pretender's claim is sundered at closure ("truths cascaded," "sundering the pretender's claim"). Setup (final third, late but climactic) −0.3, one beat (coronation) +0.4, causal pressure (the rune's command triggers the cascade) +1.2, closure linkage (the sundering is the decisive change) +1.6, irreplaceability (the verb matches the effect—veil torn, claim destroyed) +0.6. However, the action is summarized rather than dramatized −0.5. Total ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Method is signaled early ("cryptic messages left in library books") and shapes all middle beats: first message in genealogies, more seeds in annals, final chronicle. Early signal +0.6, three distinct beats +1.4, causal pressure (method narrows his options—he cannot stride forth bodily, so he uses books) +1.2, closure linkage (final book reaches pretender's hand during coronation) +1.4, specificity (books drift to seekers, found in bazaars or ruins) +0.6, cost (temporal binding forces this indirect method) +0.4. Total ~7.8; no major frictions.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ancient temple library is present throughout: dust motes, vaulted arches, towering stacks, eternal font, temporal snare. Early signal +0.6, three beats (first inscription, sowing seeds, final move) +1.4, causal pressure (temporal snare binds Lirion, forcing the cryptic method; eternal font provides water for ink) +1.0, closure linkage (constellations resume, library's pause broken) +0.9, specificity (time-lost, constellation-framed) +0.5. However, most description is atmospheric rather than tactically decisive −0.4, and the library's binding is asserted more than tested −0.3. Total ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Across the pause of shifting constellations" frames the story and returns at closure ("constellations resuming their dance, the pause broken"). Early signal +0.5, lyric reprise (first paragraph → final line) +0.8, causal pressure (the pause allows Lirion his vigil; its breaking marks closure) +0.6, closure linkage (the pause's end reweights the victory) +0.9. However, the timeframe is vague—"months blurred" summarizes duration without tightening decisions or tactics on the page −0.7, and the clock never visibly alters a move −0.5. Total ~4.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation—"to unmask this usurper, for the true bloodline's echo lingered only in these tomes, and falsehood would unravel the cosmos' fragile weave"—is stated early and drives all action. Early signal +0.7, three beats (inscriptions, sowing, final book) +1.4, causal pressure (this desire shapes every tactic) +1.3, closure linkage (unmasking succeeds at climax) +1.2. However, friction between wants and costs is minimal—Lirion never doubts, hesitates, or pays a visible personal price −0.8, and the motivation is told rather than embodied in contradictory impulses −0.6. Total ~6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Graceful collapse" is signaled in the title-like phrase and delivered at closure: "banners fell like autumn leaves, thrones toppled in slow, elegant arcs, without blood or bellow." Early signal (implicit in "regally unpretentious," "whispered," "quiet") +0.4, closure linkage (tone charges the final image) +1.2, coherence (measured, elegant diction throughout) +0.6. However, tone is static—no modulation with pressure; the crisis is narrated in the same stately cadence as the opening −0.6, and the final paragraph's metaphor stack ("silken ruin," "autumn leaves," "elegant arcs") reads decorative rather than pressure-driven −0.4. Total ~5.7.</comment>
