<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias's monthly personality molt is labeled but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost; the "architect self" functions identically to any determined character. Mira appears suddenly without embodied introduction or contradictory impulses under pressure. The friendship forming while sorting books is told in a single line rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal character hierarchy. Internal voice relies heavily on poetic abstractions ("luminous fracture," "forge beauty from anarchy") that read as thematic echo rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (blooming resistance through repeated images of rust, stars, sorting), but the closure—"luminous fracture shone eternal"—restates the opening's mood without reweighting prior material or legible cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph, avoiding penalty. The coffee tin's seeds and final poem gesture toward Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains abstract ("From anarchy's bloom, we rebuild the sky") rather than felt on the page. Multiple micro-reversals (guards pass indifferently, warden rages, gatherings form) accumulate without a single decisive tightening that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The rusted library, stars through holes, and scavenged materials supply vivid sensory anchors and recurring images. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint shapes a key choice (e.g., guards' patrol patterns, tool scarcity forcing a trade-off). The body and micro-objects (coffee tin, seeds, rebar) are handled across beats but do not charge the final image with a new constraint. Spatial choreography remains stable and the tone-setting detail is purposeful, lifting the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—forge beauty/rebuild the library as resistance—is signaled early and coherent under the Accumulative lens. Pressure accumulates through sorting, planting, and secret gatherings, but no single tightening forecloses a live option or forces a visible trade-off (e.g., risking punishment to plant seeds, choosing between concealment and expansion). The warden's rage and gatherings are summarized rather than dramatized, obscuring cost. Agency remains diffuse across Elias and Mira without one protagonist decision that narrows tactics or reweights the stake at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—resistance blooming from confinement, beauty from anarchy—emerges through recurring images (seeds, rust, stars, library) and the coffee tin as symbol. However, the final poem on the tin's lid ("From anarchy's bloom, we rebuild the sky") states the theme rather than letting the final image answer the question non-literally. The piece resists moralizing elsewhere and embraces ambiguity (guards mistaking industry for submission), but the closure edges into thematic summary. Subtext operates in the false-bottom cache and "quiet uprising," lifting score despite the stated epiphany.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person on Elias with no head-hopping, but perceptual signature is generic poetic register ("luminous fracture," "anarchy twisted into art") rather than character-specific idiom. Dialogue between Elias and Mira ("do you always reinvent yourself with the calendar?" / "Monthly molt") reads as expository rather than goal-driven or subtext-laden. Repeated phrases ("luminous fracture," "forge beauty") across narrative and interior voice flatten distinctness. The prose texture is elevated but uniform, lacking modulation under peak stress or character-particular diction that would ground the voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Severe overwriting pervades: "luminous shards," "star-pricked vault," "molted his latest personality," "luminous fracture of gravel and melody" cluster without pattern-teaching or payoff, obscuring causality in high-pressure beats. Paraphrase loops: "forge beauty from anarchy" recurs in lines 20, 28, 46, and the final poem without reweighting. Template cadence: "Elias [verb]...Mira [verb]..." runs across multiple paragraphs. Mixed metaphors: "blooming resistance" versus "forge beauty" versus "luminous fracture" never cohere. The −0.3 to −0.7 density penalty, −0.4 paraphrase-loop penalty, and −0.4 template-cadence penalty compound to approximately −1.5 in Q7, with artifacts touching the closure beat (final poem), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prison-library-as-garden premise is familiar (resistance through forbidden texts and blooming metaphor) but receives specific texture through the coffee tin's false bottom and sorting as bond-formation. The monthly personality molt is introduced but never transformed into a fresh turn; it remains a label. Emotional truth in the friendship and defiant resilience avoids sentimentality, and the piece commits to its lyric register. However, proximity to common "prison poet" and "forbidden garden" tropes without a non-obvious synthesis or bold structural risk limits freshness. No single turn or detail feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his actions (sorting, prying open the tin, devising scaffolds, reciting verses) appear in multiple beats. However, no single choice by Elias creates a key turn; the rebuild and planting proceed without visible conflict or cost tied to his agency. He is the vehicle for the plot rather than the engine of escalation. Present early, involved mid-scene, and mentioned at closure (penning the final poem), satisfying two gates but lacking causal pressure or a decision that narrows options. Mid-band cap due to swappability (any determined character could perform these actions) and lack of cost-linked choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The coffee tin appears in two distinct beats: Elias pries it open mid-story (discovery of seeds) and refills it "weeks later" with maps, then pens the final poem on its lid. The false bottom enables the smuggling resistance and the object is handled on the page with purposeful specificity. It shapes the middle choice (plant seeds as symbolic resistance) and is present at closure (poem on lid, becoming a relic). However, the seeds' planting and the maps' refilling are summarized rather than dramatized with visible cost, limiting irreplaceability. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.5, minus ornamental final mention −0.3 and summary-only maps −0.4, yielding ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Blooming resistance" is named explicitly and seeds are planted as embodiment, appearing in setup (discovery), middle (planting), and closure (flowers erupt, gatherings form). It shapes the stake (rebuild as defiance) and the tactic (disguise rebellion as restoration). However, the concept is stated rather than enacted with visible cost; no on-page beat shows a character choosing resistance over safety with immediate consequence. Present across all three gates but functioning more as thematic overlay than causal pressure. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure mention +0.7, minus label-only use −0.5 and swappability (any resistance metaphor could substitute) −0.5, yielding ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The monthly molt is introduced in exposition ("last month's brooding pessimist shed...this month's fervent architect") and mentioned again at closure ("Elias molted again—into a sly organizer—but the core endured"). It is labeled but never constrains an on-page choice or creates visible cost; the "architect self" and "sly organizer" personas are indistinguishable in action. Setup present +0.5, closure mention +0.4, minus label-only trait −0.5, ornamental use −0.5, swappability (any determined character would rebuild similarly) −0.6, yielding ~3.6. Late first detailed mention (paragraph 4 of ~50) applies −0.2, final ~3.4 capped at 3.6 by swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is the dominant action: sorting books into barricades, devising scaffolds from rebar, patching roof, sowing seeds. It appears in setup (begins sorting), drives multiple middle beats (scaffolds, water, patching), and is present at closure (library reborn, flowers erupt). The action shapes the stake and tactics under the Accumulative lens. However, no single rebuild moment forces a trade-off with visible cost (e.g., risking punishment, exhausting resources). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, minus summary-only weeks-later payoff −0.5 and lack of on-page cost −0.5, yielding ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The friendship "sparked sorting books" is stated explicitly in one sentence mid-story and recurs at closure ("friends forged in book dust"). Sorting is present early and drives the middle sequence (organizing philosophy, histories, heresies), enabling the collaboration that fuels the rebuild. However, the spark itself is told rather than dramatized through a micro-choice or contested moment. Setup +0.5, one beat (sorting collaboration) +0.4, closure mention +0.7, causal pressure +0.6 (enables joint action), minus summary-only spark −0.5 and swappability (any shared task could bond them) −0.5, yielding ~5.9. Rounds to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is anchored early, recurs across beats (moonlight, rust-veined walls, stars through holes), and is restated at closure ("under endless stars, the library pulsed alive"). The setting supplies scavenged materials (rebar, tarp, soil from exercise pen) that enable the rebuild, meeting the micro-setting test. However, no environmental constraint forces a key choice (e.g., guard patrol timing, tool scarcity). Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, minus postcard description in opening −0.3 and lack of choice-constraint −0.5, yielding ~6.4. Rounds to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"As the moon cleared the skyline" frames the opening and returns at closure ("As another moon cleared the skyline"), with "by dawn's hesitant creep" and "hours bled into the night's luminous fracture" marking passage. The timeframe is present at setup and closure but vague mid-scene ("weeks later" summarizes key developments). No live clock tightens a decision; the night's passage is atmospheric rather than tactical. Setup +0.5, closure reprise +0.7, minus vague middle −0.5, no decision pressure −0.6, and ornamental use −0.4, yielding ~4.7. Rounds to 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"To forge beauty from anarchy" is stated explicitly as Elias's motivation and recurs in his actions (sorting, building, planting, reciting verses). It appears in setup (declared), middle (drives rebuild choices), and closure (final poem echoes the phrase). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice; no on-page beat shows Elias sacrificing safety or another want to pursue this goal. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, minus label-only declaration −0.5, lack of friction cost −0.6, and thematic echo in final poem −0.5, yielding ~5.8. Rounds to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Luminous fracture" is named in the opening ("silver light fractured"), recurs as a phrase ("voice a luminous fracture," "luminous fracture of night," "luminous fracture shone eternal"), and bookends the piece. The tone of lyric defiance remains static across beats without modulation under peak pressure (guards, warden's rage). Setup +0.6, closure charge +0.8, coherence +0.4, minus static mood −0.5, decorative repetition −0.5, and label-only use in final line −0.4, yielding ~4.9. Rounds to 4.9.</comment>
