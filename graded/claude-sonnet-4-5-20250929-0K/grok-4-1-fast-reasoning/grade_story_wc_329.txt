<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("reawaken beauty") is declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her interiority relies on label-only constructs—"fire of her unyielding motivation," "gap between knowing and understanding"—that read as therapy-speak rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic uprooting lacks visible internal cost; she descends and succeeds without facing a genuine trade-off that forecloses a path. The locust shell functions as a talisman but doesn't constrain her action or reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored early enough. Drive lens reads as Causal-leaning Hybrid (music triggers tree awakening, then physical uprooting), but the because/therefore linkage between "resonantly soft" violin pulse and the trees' heartwood response is asserted rather than causally grounded in prior world rules. Closure—iron roots torn free, statues jamming, beauty flooding back—occurs on the page, but the cost is generic scene consequence (gears clattering) rather than a visible personal or tactical price Elara pays. The "gap between knowing and understanding" recurs as abstract motif without reweighting prior choices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard with living statues is vividly anchored through sensory detail (rusting blossoms, gears in tree trunks, lantern eyes). The sky-bridge as setting enables Elara's position above patrol patterns, and the central tree's base becomes the site of uprooting. However, spatial choreography during the descent and uprooting is compressed; we lose track of statue positions and how Elara evades them. The locust shell is handled on the bridge and at the tree, charging the final image with its crack, which lifts the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawaken the orchard—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the central tree groans and statues converge, raising immediate danger. The uprooting itself is Elara's agency, but coincidence (statues arrive "too late") resolves the confrontation rather than her tactical choice under constraint. Cost at closure is scene-level (gears clatter, blossoms unrust) rather than a visible personal price that narrows her future options. No trade-off or foreclosed path is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—beauty versus mechanical order, transformation—emerges from images (locust shell, iron roots, unrusting blossoms). However, the "gap between knowing and understanding" is repeated as abstract label without evolving through concrete particulars. The ending verges on thematic summary: "breaking free forever" and "tarnished wonder reborn" assert triumph rather than letting the final image resonate without a stated moral. The locust shell cracking does offer a non-literal echo, but the prompt-like language ("breaking free," "reawaken beauty") in the final paragraph lowers resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction oscillates between elevated ("liminal space pulsed alive," "coaxing melody from wood and horsehair") and sensory concrete ("ba-dum" rhythm, "fingers digging into soil"), creating register drift under pressure. The repeated phrase "resonantly soft" and "gap between knowing and understanding" function as template anchors rather than voice-particular perceptual signature. Psychic distance widens at key beats (statues "converged" is told summary when dramatization would sharpen urgency). No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are evident: "gap between knowing and understanding" appears three times with minimal reweighting; "resonantly soft" recurs as label without evolving function. Template cadence in the climax—"Statues converged… too late. Elara descended… in a rush… she knelt… she began to uproot"—reads as outline beats rather than propulsive prose. Mixed metaphor: "violin string stretched taut" for the sky-bridge, then "violin weeping triumph" personifies the instrument inconsistently. Stock phrase "fire of her unyielding motivation" and "tarnished wonder" (repeated at open and close without transformation) add to density of artifacts. Apply −1.2 for loops, template stems, and stock phrasing across multiple beats; the final paragraph contains artifacts, triggering the 9+ disqualifier and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Premise—musician using music to free an enchanted place from mechanical oppressors—is familiar (artist-liberator archetype, sentient environment under tyranny). The "signaling through heart rhythms" method and locust shell as transformation emblem offer specificity, but the uprooting scene resolves through asserted power ("iron roots tore free") rather than tactical ingenuity grounded in prior world rules. The "gap between knowing and understanding" and "tarnished wonder" read as concept-label recurrence without fresh synthesis. No bold structural or perspectival risk that heightens stakes; the arc follows a linear rise-to-triumph template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara (sky-bridge violinist) is named and positioned early. Her choice to play and then descend creates two beats, but the decisions feel reactive (playing when patrol passes, descending when tree groans) rather than tactical trade-offs. The uprooting is her action, yet its success is asserted without her making a choice that forecloses an alternative path. Present across setup, middle, and closure, but causal pressure is light; her occupation matters less than her symbolic role. Functional but mid-replaceable: another artist archetype could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Locust shell appears on the bridge (first third), is clutched during violin play (middle), and cracks open at the climax (closure participation). It symbolizes transformation and "breaking free," but its mechanical role is passive talisman rather than constraint or tool that alters tactics. The crack at the end offers a charged reprise that reweights its earlier mention, lifting the score into 5–6 range. However, its properties (brittle, translucent, empty chambers) don't constrain Elara's choices; removing it would weaken thematic texture but not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Breaking free" shapes the dominant stake (freeing the orchard from mechanical control) and is literalized in the uprooting action. It drives setup (Elara's goal), middle (music as signal to "dormant souls"), and closure (iron roots torn free, statues jamming). However, the concept is also stated overtly in the final line—"breaking free forever"—which reduces its integration to thematic echo rather than pure causal driver. The uprooting itself embodies the concept with visible consequence (beauty floods back), meeting the essential-across-beats threshold.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Resonantly soft" is introduced early and repeated five times, but functions primarily as descriptive label rather than constraint. It enables evasion of statue sensors (middle choice: play quietly enough to avoid detection), which is one causal beat. At closure, the pulse "spread" and "united her, shell, and soil," but this is asserted effect rather than a trade-off where softness costs her speed or power. The attribute shapes one key turn (evading sensors) but lacks visible cost or irreplaceable specificity; a similar stealth method could replace it.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Uproot" is signaled by Elara's goal ("uproot the mechanical blight"), enacted at the climax ("she began to uproot"), and delivers the decisive change (iron roots torn free, gears clattering). The action appears in setup (as metaphor), middle (music softens soil), and closure (physical uprooting). It drives two distinct beats—soil erosion by melody, then physical tearing—and is causally linked to the ending's consequence (beauty restored, statues jammed). Removing "uproot" would require fundamental rewrite of the climax and stakes. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage push this into the 7–8 band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Signaling through heart rhythms" is explained in the middle third ("ba-dum, ba-dum—the violin's rhythm mimicked her heart") and said to broadcast to the orchard's hidden life. However, its mechanics are told rather than shown: we don't see the trees' response mechanism or why heart-pulse specifically works. It shapes one beat (music spreading below statue detection) but resolves the climax without prior demonstration that heartwood "throbs in echo" require this exact method. Setup is late (mid-story explanation), development is summary-only, and closure participation is asserted. Functional but swappable with another covert signal method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Enchanted orchard with living statues is anchored early and supplies concrete pressure: patrol patterns Elara must evade, gears embedded in trees, and statues converging at the climax. The sky-bridge enables her vantage, and the central tree's base is the site of uprooting. The setting drives two beats (evasion timing, uprooting location) and is present at closure (trees shedding metal, statues freezing). However, spatial detail during the descent is thin, and statue mechanics (how sap jams them) are summary rather than demonstrated constraint. Essential across beats with moderate causal pressure; not fully indispensable but strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"In the gap between knowing and understanding" appears three times as abstract motif but never functions as time pressure or deadline. It reads as thematic label (Elara seeks "deeper truth" beyond facts) rather than a timeframe that tightens decisions. No clock or urgency tied to this phrasing; the single night's action could occur in any twilight window. The phrase recurs at closure ("In that gap… she had signaled freedom") but does not reweight prior time-based choices. Ornamental; does not constrain tactics or alter the story's temporal logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To reawaken beauty in a mechanical world" is Elara's stated motivation, signaled in the first third and driving her goal to play music and uproot iron. It shapes two beats (violin performance, physical uprooting) and is present at closure ("beauty flooded back"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost; Elara does not face a trade-off between reawakening beauty and another value. The motivation is functional and causally linked to action, but lacks the friction or hierarchy-of-values test that would push it higher. Meets the essential threshold without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Tarnished wonder" is named in the opening ("tarnished wonder that lingered in every shadowed bough") and closing ("tarnished wonder reborn"), creating a lyric frame. Tone is coherent—melancholy beauty under mechanical oppression—and modulates at closure when wonder is "reborn." However, the return is label-repetition rather than tonal shift that charges the final image through rhythm or diction change. The tone supports setup and closure but does not constrain middle choices or deepen under pressure. A purposeful reprise without mid-scene development; eligible for mid-5s under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>
