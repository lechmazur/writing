<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("find the beginning in every ending") is clearly stated but remains abstract throughout; her expertise is asserted more than dramatized through meaningful micro-choices under pressure. The "discarding assumptions" sequence reads as procedural listing rather than embodied struggle with visible internal contradiction. No credible forfeiture or cost appears on the page—the city simply "revives" without consequence to her stance or capacities. The final "ready for the next whisper" undercuts any sense of irreversible change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early). The drive lens reads as Causal-Hybrid: Elara must tune the signal by shedding assumptions, leading to discovery of the gorge's design. However, the closure lacks felt cost—the cables "steadied," towers "revived," and Elara simply succeeds without forfeiting a belief, resource, or path. The "discarding assumptions" beats (stellar maps, linguist codes, bitterness, faith in endings) list mental items without on-page friction or consequence. The reveal that the gorge was "designed to await perigee" arrives as exposition rather than through dramatized action that changes her options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The suspended radio tower city is vividly rendered with spatial detail (catwalk, swaying bridges, perforated steel, thousand-foot abyss). Sensory selection is strong in the opening and climb sequences ("fraying tethers," "gorge's mists," "moon gripped the metal"). The Hollywood star fragment and shard of hush function as micro-setting that constrains her tuning process, shaping the central choice. However, the gorge's transformation from speaker to amplifier basin is told rather than shown through environmental cues that alter her tactics in the moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the perigee signal before the city collapses—is signaled early. One meaningful turn occurs when she discards assumptions and the signal "blooms pure," but this moment lacks on-page cost or a narrowing of options. The "cables steadied" resolution removes the threat without dramatizing what she sacrificed or foreclosed. The protagonist's success feels convenient rather than earned through a decision that trades one good for another. No persistent constraint (tool failure, time pressure, physical toll) shapes her tactics after the midpoint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "beginning in every ending" theme is stated early and reprised at closure, creating a clear arc. The city's transformation from abandoned to reborn embodies the theme through concrete event. However, the final image ("adjusted her earpiece, ready for the next whisper") offers a tidy reset rather than a resonant reconfiguration that reweights prior material with ambiguity or cost. The Hollywood star fragment and shard of hush carry thematic weight (glamour transmuted to utility, void as tool) but remain more ornamental than conceptually indispensable. The ending's Symphony-of-tomorrows phrasing veers toward stated theme rather than earned subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated-practical register ("fantasy practicality," "practical magic") that matches the concept. Diction is controlled and distinct ("void-veined," "serenely electric," "velvet" for hushed static). The piece teaches its compression pattern early (clipped declaratives, fragment closures) and maintains it. However, some lines slide into expository summary ("Assumptions cluttered reception, like preconceived frequencies blocking truth") that tells rather than shows her perceptual signature. The "Wait, recount final" meta-comment at the end is a visible generation artifact but does not obscure the closure beat itself.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance action or setting. Rhythm varies appropriately (short bursts during the climb, longer syntactic units during the tuning). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "Assumptions cluttered reception…she'd learned to shed them" is immediately followed by restating the same idea. Template cadence runs in the discard-assumptions sequence ("Next, old linguist codes… Shed city-fall bitterness… Deeper: discard faith"). The Hollywood star fragment's "thrummed serenely electric" and "etched with faded script" repeat the same concept across adjacent beats. The meta-comment "[Adjusting precision.] No, precise count holds. [Story complete.]" is a visible scaffold artifact. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for the scaffold token totaling −1.1 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "fantasy practicality" frame and tools (Hollywood star fragment, shard of hush) offer a fresh synthesis of whimsy and function. The suspended city and celestial signal interpreter premise is specific and memorable. However, the emotional arc (abandonment → purpose → renewal) follows a familiar template without transformation through non-obvious moral calculus or lived cost. The gorge-as-designed-speaker reveal arrives late without prior groundwork, reading as a convenient rule change. The "discarding assumptions" method is conceptually interesting but executed as a checklist rather than a dramatized struggle with unpredictable cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her decisions (cross the bridge, affix tools, discard assumptions, reroute power) drive all key turns. She shapes the setup, middle tuning sequence, and ending broadcast. However, her choices feel procedurally smooth without on-page friction or visible cost—nothing she discards materially alters her later options. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but swappability is moderate (another interpreter with similar tools could execute the same arc).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The Hollywood star fragment appears in three beats: satchel description, affixed to feed horn to calm chaotic influx, pocketed again at dawn. It enables the tuning by "syncing the array" and "calming chaotic influx to a poised thrum." Setup and middle development are clear; it's present in the closure paragraph ("rested in her satchel, awaiting their next practical verse"). However, its "faded script from some ancient Walk of Fame" backstory is ornamental, and the fragment could be replaced with another resonance-stabilizing relic without breaking the plot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The shard of hush is introduced in the satchel, placed at the signal nexus to drink the perigee's overload whine ("static hushed to velvet"), and pocketed at dawn. It directly enables the core tuning action by removing interference. Setup, middle use, and closure mention are all present. Its properties ("perfect quiet, absorbing interference like a black hole for noise") are specific and irreplaceable for this exact function. Stronger integration than the star fragment because the shard's noise-canceling role is mechanically indispensable to the central task.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" is applied to the Hollywood star fragment's pulse, which "steadied jittery waves without shock or flare" and "synced the array, calming chaotic influx." The attribute constrains the tuning process (calm voltage vs. disruptive shock) and enables the middle action. However, it appears only in one functional beat (the affixing sequence) and is not reprised or reweighted at closure. The trait could be replaced with "stable resonance" or similar with minor edits. Setup is present (satchel description), middle is functional, but closure participation is absent—caps at 4.6 per gate rule.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Tune" structures the entire second half: she climbs to tune the dish, discards assumptions to tune her mind, the signal blooms pure, she tunes minor towers to harmonize, and the "tuned true" phrase appears at closure. The action is signaled early ("she needed to tune it clean"), drives the central sequence (discarding assumptions is the tuning method), and is named in the final image ("tuned her world anew"). Removing "tune" would collapse the story's tactical spine. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement (setup, middle, closure), and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"By discarding assumptions" is named as her core method in paragraph 8 ("not with knobs or coils, but by discarding assumptions"). The middle sequence dramatizes it (discard stellar maps, linguist codes, bitterness, faith in endings), and the method enables the signal to bloom pure. Setup is clear, middle development is present, and closure references it obliquely ("practical magic, tuned true"). However, the discarding beats read as a checklist without on-page friction or cost—each assumption is shed cleanly without forcing a trade-off or mistake. Moderate causal pressure but low felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city suspended over Echo Gorge is established in the opening line and anchors all movement (catwalk, swaying bridge, central tower, access ladder). The suspension and fraying tethers create the "ending looms if they snapped" threat that drives urgency. The gorge's depth and mists are sensory anchors throughout. The setting's final transformation (gorge as speaker, cliffs realigned as amplifier basin) reweights its meaning at closure. The city's architecture directly constrains her path (must cross bridge, climb ladder) and supplies the resources (dish, power feeds). Strong setup, middle choreography, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lunar perigee is named in the opening ("Lunar perigee had arrived"), drives the signal overload ("perigee amplified signals into a frenzy"), and creates the mechanical pressure (moon's tug makes towers creak, vibrates rungs, pulls cables). The middle action hinges on perigee's effect (shard of hush drinks "the perigee's overload whine"). Closure marks its peak ("as perigee peaked, cables steadied") and waning ("Lunar perigee waned, but her work endured"). The timeframe is causally essential—without perigee, the signal would not overload and the gorge transformation would not occur. Strong setup, middle pressure, and closure marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To find the beginning in every ending" is stated as her motivation in paragraph 4 ("a creed born from the city's fall twenty years prior") and echoed at closure ("In every ending, she'd found the beginning"). The motivation frames her response to the perigee crisis (seeking renewal from ruin). However, it remains abstract—no on-page choice dramatizes friction between this desire and a competing cost or fear. The motivation is told rather than tested; she never faces a moment where finding a beginning requires sacrificing a tangible good. Functional setup and closure reprise, but low middle friction and no visible cost tied to the desire itself.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality" is taught early (Hollywood star fragment and shard of hush as "precision instruments," "practical magic") and maintained through the tuning sequence (tools used functionally, not whimsically). The tone blends elevated diction ("celestial symphony," "void-veined") with grounded action (climbing, affixing, rerouting power). The final image ("practical magic, tuned true") reprises the tone explicitly. Coherence is strong, and the tone charges the ending by framing success as both mythic and operational. However, the tone is somewhat static—it does not modulate under peak pressure or shift to reflect cost. Solid setup, middle consistency, and closure charge, but limited pressure-driven variation.</comment>
