<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lirien's motivation ("capture the density of presence") is asserted repeatedly but never embodied in micro-choices or contradiction. The "palette of resolve" alchemy unfolds as a ritual the reader watches rather than a choice-driven struggle; Thorne's passivity and the whispered secret arrive as plot service without earned friction. Interiority consists of abstract metaphysical labels ("scientifically romantic," "directed spontaneity") rather than particular thought under pressure, and the climax—pouring essences into a shell—lacks visible cost or foreclosed options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within bounds, and the alchemy ritual offers a single-scene frame. However, no causal escalation occurs: Lirien returns with a pre-made solution, performs it, and succeeds without obstacle. The whispered secret ("revalue your fire, Thorne") does not arise from prior conflict or narrow options; it appears as thematic delivery. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the columella pearl, but no visible cost or foreclosed path is legible—the bond is "revalued" by assertion, and both characters "move as one" with no on-page price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ember nexus supplies vivid sensory anchors—"smoldering light," "twilight braids of firelight"—and the pocket-sun and nautilus shell are handled on the page. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the single scene. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; no environmental constraint alters Lirien's tactics or shapes the climax, and the "twilight" threshold is invoked repeatedly without mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing "density of presence"—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or complication. Lirien arrives with the solution already prepared, pours her palette into the shell, and the alchemy succeeds without reversal or trade-off. Thorne's grin and the glowing pearl constitute announcement rather than earned tightening. No live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid, and coincidence (the nexus "approving," the secret "igniting" the alchemy) resolves the premise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The theme of presence and relational "revalue" is stated overtly in multiple lines rather than emerging from event and image. The final pearl and whispered secret gesture toward resonance, but thematic weight rests on abstraction ("density of presence," "directed spontaneity") and overt summary ("presence no longer ephemeral but etched in spiral truth"). The ending offers no non-literal answer or cost-driven ambiguity; it mechanically confirms the stated thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization holds cleanly with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated, jargon-dense registers ("logarithmic grace," "solar spectrometry," "relational gravity") that feel authorial rather than character-particular. Thorne's single line of dialogue is distinct, but Lirien's voice in both speech and narration recycles abstract prompt labels. Perceptual signature is generic; under peak pressure the prose does not compress or shift rhythm in character-specific ways.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "density of presence" appears five times; "directed spontaneity," "scientifically romantic," and "revalue" recur as label clusters without new information. Runs of parallel stems ("Lirien nodded... Lirien pocketed... Lirien smiled") and synonym churn ("essence," "conviction," "palette," "hues") dull momentum. Mixed metaphors appear ("honeyed amber" density, "blade's edge" focus). Figurative density in nearly every sentence—"fractalized time," "veiling allies," "ember nexus sighed"—obscures cause without pattern payoff. Filter-verb stacks ("she whispered," "she breathed," "she said") cluster in the peak beat, further flattening immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The "scientifically romantic alchemist" and "nautilus columella" blend feels purposeful, but the alchemy-as-metaphor-for-relationship arc follows a template resolution without transformation or risk. The whispered-secret mechanism and "palette of resolve" are presented as exotic rather than causally irreplaceable. No turn feels non-obvious in hindsight; the story hedges toward the median safety middle with decorative world-building instead of bold emotional stakes or earned surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lirien is the focalizer and performs the central alchemy ritual, but her choices are not tested by opposition or dilemma. She arrives with the solution pre-forged and executes it without complication. Thorne's "recoiled slightly, then grinned" does not constitute a choice-driven turn. Present in setup and ending but does not create key reversals.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The nautilus shell columella curl is introduced early, used mid-scene to hold the palette essences, and produces the final pearl. Three distinct beats. However, its logarithmic spiral properties are described but never constrain tactics or enable a choice under pressure; it functions as a predetermined vessel rather than an active element whose specifics matter to outcome.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Palette of resolve" is named repeatedly and the hues are poured into the shell, but the concept remains ornamental metaphor. No on-page choice hinges on calibrating or selecting among the hues; the palette succeeds by assertion. Present but does not shape stakes or alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Scientifically romantic" is asserted as a label in multiple lines ("her scientifically romantic attribute shining," "scientifically romantic proof") but never constrains or enables a dramatized action with cost. It describes authorial intent rather than a trait that forces trade-offs on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Revalue" appears in multiple beats: Lirien returns to "revalue us," the shell "revalues" the essences, and the friendship is "revalued" at the end. However, the action is enacted by pouring liquids and whispering, not by a decision that transforms prior conflict. The term supplies thematic gloss rather than driving causal turns; swappable with "transform" or "renew" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"By returning differently" is signaled early ("You've returned differently") and Lirien's change is invoked at the climax. However, the mechanics of what changed during her journey remain off-page summary, and the method functions as theme statement rather than a process whose steps matter to the outcome. Present in two beats but does not constrain attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The ember nexus at twilight is anchored early, sustained throughout, and invoked at closure ("twilight nexus watched them go"). Sensory detail is vivid. However, the setting does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome; "twilight" functions as atmospheric timer without mechanical consequence. Postcard description elevated by recurring mention but no tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"In the moment a secret is whispered between friends" is literalized mid-scene and named as the mechanism that "ignites the alchemy." However, the timeframe is invoked once, does not tighten earlier decisions, and the whisper itself arrives as plot convenience rather than a clock-driven pressure point. Present in one beat without shaping attempts.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To capture the density of presence" is stated early, repeated throughout, and produces the final pearl. Three beats. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices; Lirien's desire faces no friction or cost on the page. Functional but lacks on-page struggle between want and obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Directed spontaneity" is named twice as a label and the prose maintains a consistently elevated, ritualistic register. However, tone does not modulate with pressure or crystallize at the final image; the cadence remains uniform rather than charging the climax. Static mood with thematic echo but no turn.</comment>
