<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The shadow keeper's interiority relies heavily on figurative language ("vines of dependency strangling," "false bellows inflating") that substitutes for embodied contradiction. The central motivation—teaching suffocating to breathe—is articulated through metaphor rather than shown through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final act (heating the ring, hearing her first breath) gestures toward earned change, but the protagonist's internal conflict remains abstract: we see no moment where tenderness wars with resolve in simultaneous, embodied action. Therapy-adjacent phrasing ("teach suffocating to breathe," "forced her clinging vines to loosen") lowers specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (charcoal sanctuary, after cutting contact, shadow keeper tending alone). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: pressure builds through the ring's arrival, the linking-through-scars vision, and her encroachment, culminating in his act of heating the ring to stabilize the threshold—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where his refusal crystallizes with her first unassisted breath as felt cost. However, the mechanics of "linking through scars" and how heating the ring teaches her to breathe remain opaque, blunting causality. The closure image (ring discarded, threshold enduring, her cry carrying fresh air) lands with conceptual cost, but the because/therefore chain wobbles at the pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ashen charcoal sanctuary and starlight frame the scene vividly, and the fading threshold functions as a physical constraint that pulses and thins under pressure. The coal bed at the ending allows the protagonist to heat the ring, directly shaping his choice. Spatial choreography is clear (threshold edge, dust, coal bed), and sensory details (pallid glow, phantom heat, gossamer threshold) modulate with pressure. The micro-setting (coal bed, ring, threshold) charges the final image and constrains the protagonist's tactic, meeting the 9+ test's environment requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—maintaining sanctuary versus yielding to encroachment—is signaled early and tightens when the ring materializes and her voice threads the veil. The protagonist's act of heating the ring is agency-driven and forecloses reunion, but the escalation mechanism (how his act forces her first breath) relies on metaphor rather than dramatized consequence. One meaningful turn occurs (ring heats, threshold stabilizes, her presence recedes), yet the cost to her—"gasp of fresh air, the first unassisted breath"—is told rather than shown in embodied struggle. The price is conceptually legible but lacks visceral immediacy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—independence forged through withdrawal, the cost of teaching self-sufficiency—emerges from the ring, threshold, and the controlled burn metaphor. The final image (ring discarded, her receding cry, "loaded emptiness...vessel for harder freedoms") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, lines like "To breathe is to release" and "teach suffocating to breathe" edge toward thematic echo, and the piece leans on symbolic shorthand (vines, bellows, bridges) rather than dramatized particulars. The ending reweights prior material (encroachment halted, lesson etched), but the premise—cruel-to-be-kind severance—remains close to familiar templates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual signature (shadows as charges, memories as visions) is character-specific. Diction remains elevated throughout ("writhing shadows," "gossamer," "ironweed"), consistent with the voice but verging on uniform lyricism that does not modulate under peak pressure. Free indirect access to interiority is clean, and no head-hopping occurs. The line "her grasp like ironweed around his throat" and "her needs devouring light until shadows fled" show metaphorical specificity, but the prose converges into a single register across emotional beats, flattening urgency. Purposeful compression is evident, yet the rhythmic and lexical range is narrow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The piece exhibits high figurative density without pattern-teaching: nearly every sentence in the middle third deploys metaphor ("vines of dependency strangling," "false bellows inflating," "gossamer," "ironweed"), obscuring concrete action. Paraphrase loops appear ("shadows whispered warnings, tender under his care" / "tender shadow keeper...shadows curling content") and template cadence runs with "He [verb]" stems across multiple beats. Mixed vehicles occur ("vines...draw air unaided" conflates botanical and respiratory metaphors). Stock phrasing ("loaded emptiness," "harder freedoms") and filter-verb stacks ("he saw," "he felt," "he knew") dull immediacy in peak beats. Information density is moderate, but momentum drags under ornamental layering. The closure beat itself (ring heated, threshold stabilized) is clearer, limiting global harm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—isolating a dependent partner to force growth—is a recognizable relationship-conflict template. The ashen sanctuary and shadow-tending frame add texture, but the core emotional arc (withdrawal as tough love, final refusal as lesson) follows a well-worn path. The doorknocker ring and linking-through-scars offer fresh details, yet the stakes and resolution (heating the ring to sever connection, her first unassisted breath) lean on symbolic convenience rather than lived behavioral specificity. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies; the story does not transform the template with non-obvious moral calculus or irreplaceable world logic. Particularity in setting partially elevates, but emotional truth remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; his decision to heat the ring drives the ending, but middle beats (lifting, slipping on the ring) are observational rather than choice-driven. Two gates met: setup (tracing outlines, tending shadows), payoff (heating ring, stabilizing threshold). Causal pressure moderate; cost legible at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Appears in three beats: materializes at threshold, slipped onto finger (ignites scars), heated over coals (stabilizes threshold, dulls to ornament). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Mechanics (linking through scars, heating severs connection) shape the ending. Specificity moderate; the ring's etched scars tie to protagonist's history, but heating as severance mechanism is symbolic rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The threshold is present throughout: described as "shimmering veil...growing translucent," pulses when ring is worn, "thinned to gossamer" under encroachment, then "stabilized" at closure. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development weak (protagonist does not test or reinforce it mid-scene). The threshold's thinning raises urgency, and its stabilization marks resolution, but the mechanics of why heating the ring stabilizes it remain opaque. Causal linkage moderate; the concept shapes stakes more than tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Signaled early ("burned bridges carefully...deliberate ember...cauterize without total ruin") and restated at the climax ("he burned bridges carefully; this was no hasty blaze"). Setup and payoff gates met; middle development absent (no on-page scene where carefulness constrains a choice). The attribute is declared twice but not dramatized as a tradeoff or visible cost in action. Label-only use lowers score; swappable with "deliberate withdrawal" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Her encroachment drives the entire second half: ring materializes, her voice threads the veil ("Let me in"), her essence presses through scars, her cry echoes at the climax. Setup (ring as encroachment), development (her voice and visions), payoff (her cry, "first unassisted breath," presence receding). Three beats; causal pressure high. The protagonist's entire climactic choice (heat the ring) is a response to her encroachment. Irreplaceable; removing it collapses the plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Introduced mid-scene when ring is slipped on ("linking through scars: her face gaunt...eyes wild," "scars igniting with phantom heat"). Development beat: "scars align perfectly with his." Payoff: "scars cooling to inert ridges." Two gates met (development, payoff); setup absent (no early signal of this mechanic). The method enables the vision and final severance, but its mechanics are told rather than shown. Functional in two beats but arrives late (past 40% mark), capping at 4.6; strong payoff raises within band to 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sanctuary framed early ("ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight") and reprised at closure ("ashen charcoal hush," "starlight watched"). The coal bed enables the climactic act (heating the ring). Setup and payoff gates met; middle development weak (sanctuary described but does not pressure a middle choice). The coal bed's presence is essential to the ending tactic, and starlight charges the final image. Micro-setting (coal bed) constrains the protagonist's method at closure, meeting higher-band criteria.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Signaled in the opening phrase ("after cutting off all contact") and restated once ("By cutting off all contact, he had withdrawn the prop"). Setup gate met; no middle or payoff pressure. The timeframe contextualizes but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. No clock or deadline forces urgency; duration is vague ("each passing night," "tonight"). Functional but static; swappable with "in isolation" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Declared mid-scene ("to teach suffocating to breathe meant denying her air until she claimed her own") and restated at climax ("She would breathe...having learned through the very severance"). Setup weak (motivation hinted but not explicit); development and payoff present. The desire drives the protagonist's refusal and the act of heating the ring, but it is articulated in abstract metaphor rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices. Cost is conceptual (her pain, his isolation) but felt at closure. Label-only phrasing lowers score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Loaded emptiness" appears three times: opening ("embraced the loaded emptiness"), mid-scene ("In the loaded emptiness, memories stirred"), and closure ("Loaded emptiness prevailed, not void but vessel for harder freedoms"). Setup and payoff gates met; middle beat weak (descriptive rather than pressure-modulating). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly (silence → phantom heat → inert ridges), and the final reprise reweights the stake ("vessel for harder freedoms"). Charges the ending image; irreplaceability moderate.</comment>
