<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "reflect light into dark corners" appears clearly, but her actions feel more like executing a concept than wrestling with genuine internal conflict. The phrase "wistfully pragmatic" functions as a label rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Mira's vulnerability is embodied through posture and silence, but her transformation from hollow-eyed to tentatively resolved occurs too smoothly without sustained resistance. The gauge-tooth gift lands as a symbolic gesture rather than a choice with visible cost that forecloses another path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (fire escape above harbor), and when (after rosebush's final petal) within the opening third. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: images of light/darkness, petals, and gauge teeth recur with modest deepening. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara watches Mira vanish and prunes the rosebush, framing tomorrow's seeds—but the cost is asserted ("wistfully pragmatic—tomorrow's seeds waited") rather than dramatized through a tangible forfeiture or altered tactic on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight supplies vivid sensory anchors (buoys glowing, masts swaying, moonlight fracturing into diamonds) and the skiff provides spatial grounding for the central conversation. However, environment functions mostly as backdrop; the harbor does not constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that alter outcome. The gauge tooth is handled twice (held aloft, pressed into Mira's palm) but its physical properties do not shape tactics beyond symbolic resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara's desire to instill hope in Mira—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira confesses loss and Elara responds by gifting the gauge tooth, narrowing the interaction from observation to intervention. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as pattern reinforcement (petals, rosebush, gauge metaphors) rather than a tightening that forecloses options. The resolution lacks a visible price; Elara climbs home and prunes the rosebush without dramatized cost or altered future tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of resilience through measured depth emerges from the gauge-tooth metaphor and rosebush imagery, but the final paragraph ("wistfully pragmatic—tomorrow's seeds waited in the luminous harbor's promise") states rather than earns the thematic answer. Metaphors stack densely without layering contradiction: petals, light/dark, gauge teeth all point one direction. The piece offers a tidy moral about renewal rather than embracing ambiguity or a non-obvious synthesis that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with Elara as focalizer; no head-hopping. Diction, however, inflates during high-pressure beats: "quivering hush," "protected vulnerability incarnate," "loss etched in her bitten lips" read as elevated authorial commentary rather than Elara's working-class, fire-escape-gardener lexicon. Dialogue ("Row with me? The harbor listens best at night") carries a mannered poetry that feels scripted rather than natural under stress. The two characters' speech patterns converge into the same lyric register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff: "moonlight silvered the waves like spilled mercury," "buoys glowing like fallen stars," "vulnerability peeling back layer by layer." Template cadence appears in parallel structures ("Splash—her rosebush's final petal… Lift—the fire escape garden thrived"). Paraphrase loops cluster in the harbor scene: "quivering hush" repeated three times within six paragraphs, "wistfully pragmatic" twice. Mixed metaphor in "loss etched… fear pooling like oil slicks on shadowed tides" blurs the image. Deductions: density −0.5, loop −0.4, register drift −0.3, totaling approximately −1.2 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The fire-escape gardener meets troubled stranger setup is familiar; the gauge-tooth metaphor (measure depth before turning the key) explicates rather than transforms. The rosebush framing (final petal drops → prune for tomorrow's seeds) follows a predictable renewal arc without fresh synthesis. Mira's hollow-eyed vulnerability and Elara's instilling-hope mission read as archetypal mentor-student without specific lived detail that would make the interaction irreplaceable. The story executes its template competently but does not offer a non-obvious angle or risk that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elara (fire escape gardener) is present throughout and her choice to approach Mira, invite her to row, and gift the gauge tooth drives the central interaction. Setup clear (opening paragraph), middle involvement (boat scene), and closure participation (watching Mira leave, pruning rosebush) satisfy all three gates. However, her decisions feel predictable and do not narrow options with visible cost; the gauge-tooth gift is generous but does not foreclose another path or impose a trade-off. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, but swappability (could be any mentor figure) −0.6 and ornamental final beat (pruning as metaphor without tactical consequence) −0.4. Net ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lockmaster's bitting gauge tooth appears in Elara's pocket (paragraph 4), is held aloft in moonlight (paragraph 19), and pressed into Mira's palm (paragraph 23). Setup clear, middle use (visual metaphor), closure participation (gift charges Mira's resolve). Two distinct beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (etched ridges, slender brass pin) +0.5. However, the object's unique properties (measuring key depths) do not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page; it functions symbolically rather than causally. Swappability −0.6 (any talisman could serve). Net ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"A quivering hush" appears when Elara pauses before Mira (paragraph 8), binds them "like invisible silk" (paragraph 12), and lifts "like mist" when they return to dock (paragraph 26). Setup mid-story (~30%), two beats +0.9, closure participation +0.7. The hush functions as atmospheric tone rather than shaping stakes or altering options; characters do not navigate or test it. Late first appearance −0.4, ornamental use (description without action pressure) −0.8. Net ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Wistfully pragmatic" labels Elara's smile (paragraph 14) and reappears in the final line ("wistfully pragmatic—tomorrow's seeds waited"). Setup mid-story, closure participation clear. However, the trait is told rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses in scene; Elara's actions (approach Mira, row, gift gauge tooth, prune rosebush) proceed without visible trade-off between wishfulness and pragmatism. Label-only −0.8, late first appearance −0.3, swappability −0.5. Net ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Instill" appears explicitly as Elara's motivation ("to instill hope," paragraph 20) and governs her speech and gift. Setup clear (motivation crystallizes paragraph 10), middle involvement (boat conversation), closure linkage (Mira's "tentative resolve"). Causal pressure +1.0 (the instilling attempt shapes the boat scene), two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0. However, the action is largely verbal and metaphorical; removing "instill" and substituting "offer comfort" would not break story logic. Swappability −0.6, summary-only (outcome told: "tentative resolve") −0.5. Net ~5.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"With the rhythm of oars in water" governs the boat scene (paragraphs 18–23): "Elara rowed with the rhythm… steady dips and lifts like a heartbeat," syncing her instilling-hope speech to "splash and creak," "Splash—her rosebush's final petal… Lift—the fire escape garden thrived." Setup in rowing paragraph, middle involvement (metaphor delivery), closure preparation (Mira's tears and breath hitching occur during this rhythm). The rhythm structures Elara's persuasion attempt, though the mechanics do not constrain outcome (she could speak without rowing). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.7, swappability −0.5. Net ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight anchors the entire second half (paragraphs 6–26) and supplies the skiff, oars, and buoys. Setup clear (paragraph 1, expanded paragraph 6), middle involvement (boat scene), closure participation (returning to dock). The harbor provides spatial grounding and beauty but does not constrain choices; Elara and Mira could conduct the same conversation on the fire escape or dockside bench. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, specificity (buoys, masts, skiff) +0.5, but ornamental use (postcard description without tactical pressure) −0.8, swappability −0.6. Net ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the final petal drops from the old rosebush" frames the opening (paragraph 2) and returns in pruning the remains (final paragraph). Setup clear, closure participation clear. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the story unfolds in a single evening with no live clock pressing Elara's choices. The petal drop marks emotional transition (summer to winter) rather than imposing a deadline. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.9, ornamental use (metaphor without time pressure) −0.8, swappability (could occur "at dusk" or "after sunset") −0.6. Net ~3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To reflect light into dark corners" crystallizes as Elara's motivation (paragraph 10) and governs her boat-scene speech. Setup mid-story (~40%), middle involvement (metaphor-driven instilling), closure linkage (Mira clutches the gauge tooth, Elara knows "dark corners held no monopoly on light"). The desire is told ("Her motivation crystallized") rather than dramatized through friction between conflicting wants. Late first appearance −0.4, summary-only (motivation declared, not tested) −0.6, closure linkage +1.0, two beats +0.9, swappability (generic "help her heal") −0.5. Net ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" labels Mira (paragraph 7: "protected vulnerability incarnate, fragile as sea glass yet armored by solitude") and recurs (paragraph 25: "Protected vulnerability had bloomed between them"). Tone of gentle melancholy and cautious hope modulates across the harbor scene, charging Mira's tentative resolve. Setup early, middle involvement, closure participation clear. However, the tone is asserted via label rather than sustained through voice and rhythm under pressure; the final image (pruning rosebush, "wistfully pragmatic") shifts to pastoral optimism without carrying forward the fragile tension. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.7, two beats +0.9, label-only −0.8, tonal drift in final beat −0.4. Net ~5.1.</comment>
