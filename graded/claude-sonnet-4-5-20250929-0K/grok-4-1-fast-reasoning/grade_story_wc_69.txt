<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated but never tested by on-page choice that forecloses a path with cost. The choir members (Joren, Lira, the scholar) are sketched in single traits—"gravel and rage," "sly contempt," "doctrinal weeds"—without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The ending declares transformation ("No hatred lingered") rather than dramatizing a final choice or renunciation that carries visible cost. Interiority remains abstract and label-only: "expectantly resigned," "traveled stillness," "harmonious teaching" recur as decorative tags without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early, but causality operates in summary loops: "Across weeks blurring into months, the timeframe stretched; unlearning hatred became their silent vow." No on-page reversal narrows options; the climax ("Now, braid") is told as accomplished fact without visible cost or a choice that forecloses a path. The closure asserts completion ("harmony prevailed") but lacks a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt price on the page. Drive lens remains ambiguous between Accumulative and Causal without clear pattern-teaching or a cadence shift that reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The velvet library and autumn setting are vividly rendered with selective detail (rain-streaked panes, plush shadows, crimson dusk). The zither and its rosette constrain the teaching method and appear in multiple beats. However, the environment does not pressure a choice at closure; the final image ("The velvet library sighed in contentment") is decorative rather than a constraint that shapes the ending. Spatial choreography (choir encircling Elara) is coherent but the room remains static across the narrative arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—braiding diverse voices into harmony—is signaled early but never tightens through on-page agency. The progression from "snarling, voices clashing" to "no hatred lingered" is summarized across weeks without a dramatized moment where a character's decision narrows options or pays a visible cost. Joren's "hatred's residue cracking like dry leaves" and Lira's voice "shedding its barbed edges" are asserted outcomes, not choices under pressure. The climax ("Now, braid") resolves by cooperative success without meaningful escalation or a trade-off that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of vanishing arts and unlearning hatred emerges from the zither-teaching method and the choir's transformation. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "vanishing arts lived not in preservation alone, but in the motivated act of braiding anew" and "by subtracting noise, harmony prevailed" state the thesis rather than letting the final image resonate without summary. Subtext is present in the rosette as a recurring motif, but its meaning does not shift under pressure—it remains a static symbol of purity rather than a particular that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance. However, voice lacks perceptual signature; diction drifts into elevated register ("preludes," "canticle," "doctrinal weeds," "thicket of doctrinal weeds") that reads writerly rather than character-specific. Dialogue is sparse and functional ("Listen," "Match this," "Now, braid") without subtext or goal pursuit. The prose recycles stock phrases: "traveled stillness," "expectantly resigned," "velvet hush" appear as decorative tags rather than lived perception. Under peak stress, the narrator's internal texture does not compress or modulate—syntax remains uniform and ornamental throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence reduce momentum: "denoted the vanishing world's last map," "denoted the breach," "denoted progress," "denoted completion" recur without added pressure. Synonym churn appears in adjacent lines: "subtracting noise" is restated five times across the piece without functional variation. Stock metaphors cluster in high-pressure beats: "threads from fractured souls," "braid diverse voices," "discord that devours," "leaves pressed like amber sigils." The final third contains scaffold sentences that restate prior material ("Across unlearning hatred, she'd denoted the path; by subtracting noise, harmony prevailed"). Filter-verb stacks ("she believed," "she mused") and passive constructions ("was expectantly resigned," "might fade") dull immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 baseline and disqualifying 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The premise—a choir teacher using a zither to teach harmony as a metaphor for unlearning hatred—follows a familiar template of healing-through-art without a non-obvious synthesis. The rosette, "subtracting noise" method, and "vanishing arts" frame are present but do not transform the arc; the emotional progression from conflict to resolution could map onto any reconciliation narrative with different names and instruments. Specificity exists in sensory detail (abalone inlays, velvet library) but the turn and closure lack a fresh inflection that grows from prior particulars. The piece hedges toward the safety middle: hatred is resolved without ambiguity, all choir members converge equally, and the teacher's vision is validated without complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role as teacher frames the action, but she does not make a choice that creates a key turn. Her teaching method is described and applied, yet the climactic moment ("Now, braid") is instruction followed by cooperative success rather than a decision under pressure that alters tactics. She observes and guides but does not face a dramatized conflict where her agency forecloses a path with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The zither soundhole rosette appears in setup, development (Elara traces it to denote progress), and payoff (final tracing "denoting completion"). However, its function remains static across beats: it symbolizes purity and the teaching method but does not constrain a choice or shift meaning under pressure. Its physical properties (abalone and ebony inlays) are described but not used to enable or block tactics. The rosette recurs with reweighted phrasing ("inlays seeming to glow brighter") but this is asserted observation rather than causal participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Vanishing arts is signaled early ("fragile crafts like zither-weaving and polyphonic chants fading") and returns at closure ("vanishing arts lived not in preservation alone"), shaping the thematic stake. However, it does not constrain on-page tactics or alter choices; the choir's work proceeds without resource scarcity, external threat to the art, or a decision where preserving the art costs something else. The concept functions as thematic backdrop rather than a pressure that changes options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" is applied to Elara four times as a label ("her expectantly resigned gaze," "Expectantly resigned, she watched," "their expectantly resigned teacher," "The vanishing arts, she mused expectantly resigned") but never enables or constrains an on-page action with visible cost. It describes her stance toward vanishing arts but does not force a tradeoff or shape a choice. The trait remains decorative rather than mechanically active.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Denote" recurs across beats: Elara denotes the breach with a chalk mark, denotes progress in the rosette's glow, and traces the rosette one final time "denoting completion." However, the action is observation and marking rather than a choice that redefines options. The denoting tracks progress but does not cause the transformation; it could be replaced with "mark," "note," or "trace" without altering story logic. The action is present at closure but ornamental rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"By subtracting noise" is signaled early ("her method by subtracting noise: muting overtones, silencing harmonics") and demonstrated in the middle beat (Elara damps sympathetic vibrations, leaving a clear drone). The method shapes the teaching approach and returns at closure ("by subtracting noise, harmony prevailed"). However, the mechanics do not create conflict or cost; the choir members mirror the method without struggle shown on the page. The means is thematic rather than a tactical constraint that alters attempts under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The velvet library in autumn is established early with vivid detail (amber leaves, rain-streaked panes, plush shadows, crimson dusk) and remains the continuous setting. Autumn's chill and the library's acoustics support the choir's work, but the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. The space is atmospheric and coherent but does not constrain or enable tactics; it could be any quiet teaching room without breaking the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Across unlearning hatred" appears as a thematic phrase four times, bracketing the narrative arc ("Across unlearning hatred, they came," "the timeframe stretched; unlearning hatred became their silent vow," "Across unlearning hatred, she'd denoted the path"). However, the timeframe is vague ("weeks blurring into months") and does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. No clock or deadline pressures the choir's work; the transformation occurs in summary without time shaping moves on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to braid diverse voices into harmony" is stated early and drives her teaching method. The desire is present in multiple beats (braiding threads, the braid she sought, "Now, braid," "this braid endured") and shapes the dominant stake. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; Elara faces no friction between her goal and a competing want or cost. The motivation directs action but does not create internal conflict or a tradeoff that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" recurs throughout ("Her traveled stillness enveloped the room," "in that traveled stillness," "their traveled stillness," "autumn's traveled stillness unbroken") as a tonal anchor for Elara's presence and the library's atmosphere. The tone is coherent but static; it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image with new meaning. The phrase functions as ornamental repetition rather than a tone that shifts under escalation to reweight the ending.</comment>
