<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to protect the key is declared but never tested by a meaningful choice—he never weighs abandoning it, hiding it, or surrendering it. His "logically emotional" trait is mentioned twice but functions only as a label; no on-page action embodies contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The wraiths appear as obstacles but never force a moral calculus or internal conflict that would reveal character depth. Emotional states are asserted ("heart thundered," "tears carving hot paths") rather than embodied through contradictory micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Causal with some Accumulative layering; closure is a Decisive Change (wraiths absolved, key secured). Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~100 words. However, the climactic solution—tuning the lighthouse to match the wraiths' frequency—is introduced and executed in a single move without prior groundwork or cost; Elias never attempts a failed tactic or sacrifices an option. The wraiths' transformation into "luminous petals" lacks visible price to Elias or the world. The ending resets to stasis ("key secured") without foreclosing a live path or altering his stance with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina and lighthouse are vividly rendered with sensory detail (groaning floes, salt-crusted windows, prismatic halos). Spatial choreography is clear across moves. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a tactical resource that alters the outcome; the console and resonator appear when needed without prior spatial grounding. The golden sunset functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a tightening clock. Micro-setting (body, tool) is present but ornamental; the key's "fleshly click" and the resonator's hum are textural rather than choice-shaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect the key) is signaled early but never tested by a trade-off or reversal. The wraiths advance in a single wave; Elias's sprint to the tower and console calibration succeed on first attempt without setback or visible cost. No live option is foreclosed—he retains the key, disperses the wraiths, and exits unscathed. The "logically emotional" calculus mentioned in paragraph 5 is told, not dramatized through a choice that sacrifices one value for another. Escalation is asserted ("wraiths pursued," "tower shuddered") but not earned by protagonist agency that narrows tactics or raises price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of absolution through vibrational harmony is stated overtly ("sonic absolution," "forgiveness into the ether") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The key's backstory (saving his lover) is told in one line without on-page friction or cost tied to that memory. The ending offers a neat resolution ("logical, emotional peace") that feels like a thesis statement rather than a resonant reconfiguration. The wraiths' transformation into petals is symbolic but generic; the final image does not reweight prior material or impose a non-obvious moral calculus. Recurrence of "fleshly" and "ethereal" reads as motif checklist rather than pressure-bearing pattern.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. However, diction oscillates between elevated register ("vibrational hymn," "orgasmic clarity") and mechanical exposition ("ancient console," "crystalline resonator") without a consistent perceptual signature. Elias's way of noticing is not character-particular; sensory detail reads as authorial catalog rather than filtered through his profession or emotional state. The phrase "logically emotional" is meta-commentary rather than enacted voice. Peak-stress moments default to stock embodiment ("heart thundered," "fingers trembling") and therapy-speak abstraction ("emotional catharsis") instead of idiosyncratic perception. No dialogue on the page to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Severe overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence stacks metaphor or elevated diction ("floes groaned like awakening leviathans," "tendrils of fog coiling like lovers' limbs," "translucent flesh solidifying into peaceful mist"). Mixed metaphors abound—"fleshly glow that seeped into his skin," "sonic waves…fleshly vibrations…orgasmic clarity"—creating register drift and muddled vehicle logic. Paraphrase loops: paragraphs 14–15 restate calibration and resonance in synonym cycles. Template cadence: repeated "He [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems across 8+ sentences. Filter-verb stacks in peak beats ("watched," "knew," "felt"). Stock phrases ("heart thundered," "tears carving hot paths") dull specificity. Artifacts touch the closure beat (paragraph 24), disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core premise (lighthouse engineer uses sonic resonance to absolve wraiths) is functional but derivative of common "magical tuning" and "redemption of tortured spirits" templates without fresh transformation. The solution—matching frequencies to dissolve hostiles—is a stock genre move executed without lived complication or non-obvious cost. Character detail (azure coat, crypt keeper's key, lover saved) reads as assembled prompt elements rather than organic integration. The "logically emotional" trait and "fleshly ethereal" tone are label-only; no specific synthesis makes them inevitable. The wraiths' transformation into "luminous petals" is a generic redemption image. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the arc follows expected beats without surprise or tonal subversion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout but his choices are minimal: sprint to the tower (no alternative weighed), insert the key (no friction), calibrate the console (succeeds on first attempt). Observation and execution dominate; no on-page decision that narrows options or alters tactics. Missing middle development: no beat where his profession or background constrains a choice. Closure participation is passive—he watches the wraiths dissolve. Setup and closure gates met; middle gate weak. Swappable: any competent operator could perform these actions.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The key is handled in three beats: clutched on the docks (setup), inserted into the console (development), withdrawn at the end (closure). Its rune-pulse and backstory (saved his lover) are mentioned but never constrain a choice or impose a visible cost. The key unlocks the sonic core but the core's existence and mechanics are introduced simultaneously; no prior groundwork. Reweighted meaning at closure is minimal—key secured again, back to starting state. Functional across beats but replaceable: any artifact with "unlocking" properties would serve equally. Setup, development, and payoff gates met; causal pressure and irreplaceability are low.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Sonic absolution" is named in paragraph 4 and executed in paragraphs 17–21 but never shapes tactics before the climax. Elias does not attempt or consider alternative means of dealing with the wraiths; the concept appears as the solution when needed. No middle beat where the concept constrains a choice or forces a trade-off. Missing middle development gate; setup (declared) and payoff (enacted) present. Swappable: "vibrational harmony," "frequency matching," or "resonant purification" would require only minor label changes. Functional but not causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Logically emotional" is mentioned twice (paragraphs 5, 14, 25) but never enables or constrains an on-page action with cost. Paragraph 5 tells that Elias weighs "rational calculus fused with the raw ache of memory," but no scene demonstrates contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Paragraph 14 tells "Logically emotional, Elias knew brute force would shatter the marina; instead, adaptation"—the trait labels the choice rather than shaping it through visible friction. Missing development and closure gates; setup is label-only. No visible tradeoff where logic and emotion pull in opposite directions with on-page cost. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Adapt" is present across multiple beats: declared in paragraph 9 ("He must adapt, not flee"), enacted through calibration (paragraphs 14–18), and wraiths "adapted against their will" (paragraph 21). The action shapes the climactic turn but arrives as a single successful execution without prior failed attempt or cost. No middle beat where adaptation constrains a choice or imposes a visible tradeoff. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development weak. Causal role in one major beat (climax) but easily swappable with "attune," "harmonize," or "synchronize" with minor edits. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Vibrational matching" is signaled in paragraph 14 ("tune the lighthouse's song to the wraiths' own frequency") and enacted in paragraphs 17–18 (calibration) and 21 (wraiths align). The method is functional at closure but introduced and executed in a single move without prior groundwork or complication. No earlier beat where the method is attempted, fails, or requires tactical adjustment. Missing middle development gate; setup (signaled at climax onset) and payoff (climax) present but compressed. The mechanics appear when needed; no prior scene establishes the resonator's existence or Elias's knowledge of the technique. Functional but resolves a problem it did not help create, capping at 3.0 under that rule; raised slightly for closure participation but still mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly described across multiple beats (paragraphs 1–2, 6, 10, 20, 23) and provides the spatial stage for the conflict. The shifting ice and fading light are mentioned as "perils" (paragraph 8) but do not constrain Elias's sprint or tactics—he crosses "bobbing planks" without slip or setback. The marina's "cathedral of frozen light" at closure (paragraph 23) is atmospheric but does not alter the outcome or impose cost. Setup, development (spatial stage), and payoff (final image) gates met. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that changes tactics. Functional across beats but replaceable: any isolated structure (island tower, mountain station) would serve equally. Causal pressure low; closure linkage is descriptive rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The "fleeting golden sunset" is mentioned in paragraphs 1, 16, 24 but never functions as a tightening clock. Elias sprints and calibrates without time pressure; the sunset "dipped lower" (paragraph 16) but no beat shows him racing against fading light or losing an option because darkness falls. The wraiths' advance is described but not paced by the sunset's descent. Payoff gate met (sunset "vanished" at closure, paragraph 24); setup present but middle development absent—no choice shaped by diminishing time. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than tactical. A vague or untracked clock trends low per the rubric. Ornamental use; swappable with "approaching storm" or "rising tide" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation to protect the key is declared early (paragraph 4, "protect this key at all costs") and sustained through the sprint (paragraph 10), climax (key inserted, paragraph 12), and closure (key withdrawn and secured, paragraph 24). However, the motivation is never tested by a conflicting desire or cost—Elias never considers abandoning the key, using it differently, or sacrificing something else to keep it. The backstory (key saved his lover, paragraph 5) is told in one line without on-page friction tied to that memory. Setup, development (key actively used), and payoff (key secured) gates met. Causal role in one major beat (climax unlocking) but no visible tradeoff where protecting the key forecloses another option or imposes felt cost. Functional but not deeply integrated; desire is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Fleshly ethereal" tone is present throughout via repeated diction: "fleshly glow" (paragraph 2), "fleshly click" (paragraph 13), "fleshly vibrations" (paragraph 18), "fleshly ethereal embrace" (paragraph 21), "flesh and spirit entwined" (paragraph 25); "ethereal wings" (paragraph 10), "ethereal release" (paragraph 17). The pairing is stated at closure but does not modulate with pressure—intensity remains uniform across calm observation (paragraph 1) and peak stress (paragraph 18). Mixed metaphors muddle the tone: "fleshly vibrations" and "orgasmic clarity" (paragraph 18) clash with "translucent forms" and "luminous petals" (paragraphs 6, 21). Static mood rather than evolving cadence. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development present but without purposeful tension or charge shift. Tone is asserted through repeated labels rather than earned through syntax, rhythm, and image selection that reweight the final moment. Functional but ornamental; the exact pairing could be replaced with "visceral mystical" or "corporeal transcendent" with minor edits.</comment>
