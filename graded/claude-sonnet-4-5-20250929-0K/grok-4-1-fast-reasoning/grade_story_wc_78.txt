<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation ("turn obstacles into instruments") is declared but never tested by internal conflict or embodied contradiction. His actions are competent and sequential, yet no genuine struggle emerges—he grins fiercely, leaps, strikes, and succeeds without visible cost or foreclosed paths. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("restlessness gnawed," "motivation burned deep") rather than specific, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final slump reads as fatigue, not as a renunciation or shift earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when early (Elowen, driftwood orchard, blue hour) and follows a causal sequence: clouds signal storm → debris threatens → Elowen builds xylophone → strikes repel beam. However, the closure unit lacks visible cost: the orchard sails on, euphony lingers, and Elowen's final dream offers conceptual repricing without undeniable pressure or forfeited options. The lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture, but the ending does not reweight prior material with felt consequence. The beam "glances aside" conveniently, and no path is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The driftwood orchard and xylophone-from-debris are vivid micro-settings that enable tactics (lashing debris into keys, roots gripping tighter). Sensory details are filtered through Elowen's professional bias (cloud vortices, fractal eddies, salt-rimed tattoos). The blue hour and sea anchor the atmosphere, and the setting constrains choice when the final beam threatens capsize. However, spatial choreography blurs during the crescendo—where exactly is Elowen standing when he leaps to the circle's edge, and how does the dome of sound form?</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (survive the storm, preserve the orchard) is clear, and pressure escalates from rogue wave to debris to massive beam. Elowen's agency drives the sequence (sketches, lashes, strikes), and the xylophone construction narrows options. Yet the final reversal—the beam "glancing aside"—reads as luck rather than a trade-off; no live option is foreclosed, and the cost remains abstract ("restlessness persisted" is declared, not shown). The escalation is functional but lacks a felt price that charges the final image under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: storm as raw material, sound as survival tool, restlessness as engine. The xylophone and fractal patterns recur purposefully, and the ending resists a tidy moral. However, the final lines veer toward theme statement ("In this afloat eden of driftwood and defiance, he had woven storm into symphony once more. Restless euphony reigned, ever hungry for the next verse") rather than letting the image speak. The piece invites reflection but stops short of a non-literal answer that reweights prior events with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and Elowen's perceptual signature (cloud-reading, fractal thinking) remains consistent. Diction ("leeward tide prophet," "salt-rimed tattoos," "resonance etched in vapor") is purposeful and voice-specific. However, elevated register ("sketched resonance awakening as vibrations leaped") occasionally drifts from embodied perception into abstract narration, and the prose converges on stock metaphor ("ink spilled across bruised sky") during high-pressure beats. No dialogue appears; filter verbs ("clutching," "interpreted") are acceptable within this voice but cluster without adding pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("sea's vast mirror fractured into sapphire shards," "clouds churned like ink," "thunderous applause gone wrong") without pattern-teaching or cumulative payoff, violating the overwriting density check. Adjacent lines loop: "Restlessness gnawed… Restless euphony swelled… Yet restlessness persisted… Restless euphony reigned" recycles the same concept without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "He rose… He lashed… He struck… He leaped" runs across multiple beats. Mixed metaphor: "symphony of unease where harmony clashed against chaos" contradicts itself—symphony implies order, yet the vehicle is disorder. Applying density (−0.5), loop (−0.4), template cadence (−0.5), and metaphor muddle (−0.4) totals ~−1.8 in Q7, and artifacts touch the closure beat ("restless euphony reigned"), triggering the disallow-9+ global cap and high-band 8.8 ceiling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The core premise (sound-wielding prophet on floating orchard survives storm by transforming debris into instrument) offers a fresh synthesis. Specific details (whalebone mallet, fractal xylophone, tattoos mapping currents) are memorable and avoid generic fantasy tropes. However, the emotional arc (competent protagonist overcomes obstacle through skill) is familiar, and the transformation test suggests the plot would work with different names and a different magical system. The fractal-generating method is mentioned but not dramatized with visible trade-offs, limiting ingenuity. No close echoes of famous works detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elowen appears early, acts in every beat (interprets clouds, sketches, lashes debris, strikes xylophone, repels beam), and his decisions drive the causal chain. However, his choices face no meaningful friction or cost on the page—each action succeeds without foreclosing an option. The ending shows him slumped but dreaming, not decisively altered. Two gates met (setup, development); closure participation is passive (he slumps). Causal pressure is present but low-cost. Band guidance suggests ~5.0–6.0; reducing for lack of felt trade-off and swappability (another skilled protagonist could follow the same arc) yields 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The xylophone mallet appears early (Elowen clutches it), is used to strike the makeshift xylophone across multiple beats (blue hour strike, fractal frenzy, crescendo), and participates in the closure (dubbing the final crescendo that repels the beam). Three gates met. Causal pressure: enables the tactic but is not irreplaceable—any striking tool could serve. Cost connection is weak; no trade-off tied to the mallet itself. Band guidance ~6.0–7.0; specificity (whalebone, smoothed by tides) adds +0.3, but swappability (a stone or plank could strike) lowers by −0.3. Final: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Sketched resonance" is introduced early (Elowen sketches fractal eddies on driftwood, lines "birth echoes"), reappears in the middle (sketched lines glow faintly, awakening as vibrations), and is invoked at closure (sketched resonance peaks, creating a dome of sound). Three gates met. However, the concept remains abstract and functionally identical to "sound magic"—swapping it for "carved runes" or "sung harmony" would not alter the plot. No visible cost or constraint tied to the act of sketching versus another method. Band guidance ~5.0–6.0; reducing for high swappability and ornamental mechanics yields 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elowen interprets cloud movements early and throughout (clouds churn, vortices sketch resonance, clouds' movements dance in his ears, clouds part at the end). The trait constrains his initial tactic (he must read the clouds to know how to pattern the xylophone) and enables navigation at closure. Three gates met. Causal pressure: narrows options (he cannot act until he reads the sky). Cost: implicit time pressure, though not dramatized as a trade-off. Band guidance ~6.0–7.0; reducing slightly for lack of explicit visible price yields 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Dub" (overlay sound, echo-prophesy) is introduced at blue hour ("he struck the first bar… a low chime dubbing the sea's growl into melody"), repeated across beats ("Elowen dubbed relentlessly," "mallet dubbing a crescendo"), and shapes the closure (the crescendo dubs the final beam away). Three gates met. Causal pressure: the action is the protagonist's primary tactic. However, "dub" is functionally synonymous with "play" or "strike"—the unique property (overlaying/echoing) is declared but not mechanically distinct on the page. Swappability is moderate. Band guidance ~6.0–7.0; reducing for near-synonym replaceability yields 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Fractal generating" is introduced mid-story ("Fractal generating was his method, strikes patterned in self-similar cascades"), reappears briefly ("Each strike generated fractals in air: visible mandalas"), and is invoked at closure ("fractal peaks layering atop primal roar"). Setup gate missed (not present by end of first third). Development and payoff gates met. Late first appearance after 40% triggers cap at 4.6. The method is declared but not dramatized as a constraint or visible trade-off; it reads as a label for "patterned striking." Swappability high. Capped at 4.6 per late-introduction rule.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard-on-driftwood is introduced in the opening line, pressures choices throughout (roots grip, outer logs splinter, circle's edge is Elowen's final perch), and shapes the closure (the orchard sails on). Three gates met. Causal pressure: the fragile platform drives urgency and constrains movement. Closure linkage: the setting's survival is the resolution. Specificity: the driftwood ring and roots are unique, not generic. Cost connection: splintered logs and scattered apples show damage. Band guidance ~7.0–8.4; strong integration across all beats justifies 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Blue hour" appears in the opening and recurs twice ("At blue hour's deepening hush," "Blue hour faded to starlit truce"). The timeframe anchors tone but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—no clock pressure is dramatized, and the storm's duration is vague. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak (time does not constrain a middle choice). No causal pressure or visible cost tied to the timeframe itself. Band guidance ~3.0–5.0; lyric reprise present but without reweighting the stake yields 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The motivation ("to turn obstacles into instruments") is declared early, dramatized through action (lashing debris into xylophone, dubbing storm into melody), and reflected at closure (he "had woven storm into symphony"). Three gates met. Causal pressure: the desire drives his tactics. However, no on-page friction tests the motivation—Elowen never hesitates, doubts, or pays a visible price for this approach. The motivation is told and enacted but not conflicted. Band guidance ~5.0–6.5; reducing for lack of felt trade-off yields 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Restless euphony" appears in the opening, recurs mid-story ("Restless euphony swelled"), and bookends the ending ("Restless euphony reigned"). The tone is coherent (charged, urgent, lyrical) and modulates under pressure (chords clashing, then triumphant clash, then soft singing). Three gates met. However, the phrase becomes a repeated label rather than an evolving image, and the final invocation feels declarative rather than charged by cost. Swappability moderate (could replace with "urgent harmony"). Band guidance ~5.0–6.5; reducing for label-repetition and lack of cost linkage yields 4.7.</comment>
