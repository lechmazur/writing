<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated (recycle mistakes into wisdom) but her interior life relies heavily on abstract declaration rather than embodied contradiction. The brother's capture and her past deception are told rather than shown through present micro-choices that reveal cost. Kael appears as a functional counterpart but lacks distinct interior texture; their exchange reads as parallel monologues rather than a relationship under pressure. The final "true prisoner freed was her conscience" is label-only resolution without dramatized struggle in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Causal with ritual-framework overlay, but key causality is weak: the drawer pull's symbolic exchange does not earn the shift from war to peace—no on-page resistance, no credible cost that forecloses a path. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (forgiveness dawns) but the felt price is asserted ("true prisoner freed was her conscience") rather than dramatized. Orientation is present early (parapet, mist, Elara), so no Orientation Test penalty applies. The exchange proceeds without meaningful tightening; Kael's acceptance feels unmotivated by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The storm-worn parapet and mist are vividly rendered and sustain atmosphere throughout. Spatial choreography is clear (opposite battlements, Elara stepping closer, prisoners behind). However, the setting remains largely decorative; wind and stone do not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The antique drawer pull appears but its physical handling is minimal. Sensory detail is present but does not narrow options at the closure beat, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (brother's release and clan peace) is signaled early but never tightened by credible resistance. Kael arrives cooperative; no reversal tests commitment. The drawer pull exchange is symbolic performance, not a choice with visible cost—removing it would not break the negotiation's logic. The moon-phase synchronization is ritual decoration rather than a constraint that narrows options. Escalation under the Causal lens is absent; the climax summarizes emotional release without on-page friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme (apology/forgiveness, recycling mistakes) is overtly stated in multiple beats: "between apology and forgiveness," "recycle mistakes into wisdom," "prisoner freed was her conscience." The antique drawer pull is introduced as a symbol and harvested at closure without evolving through intervening pressure. The final paragraph moralizes ("No more raids born of deceit; instead, cycles synchronized to heal") rather than offering a non-literal resonance. Subtext is thin; characters articulate theme directly, flattening implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistently elevated and lyric but lapses into therapy-speak at key moments: "uncommonly thoughtful," "fragile timeframe where words could shatter or mend," "true prisoner freed was her conscience." Dialogue is minimal and functional; Kael's lines ("See this," "The false key that birthed our feud") read as exposition rather than goal-driven subtext. Focalization is stable single-POV. Diction is ornate throughout, with runs of abstract register ("furrowed hush," "untether not just prisoners, but the chains of grudge") that drift from immediate perception under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Pervasive overwriting: figurative density saturates peak beats without pattern-teaching or payoff ("Mist clung...like a shroud," "wind howled impartial judgments," "cycles synchronized to heal"). Paraphrase loops are frequent: "apology embodied" / "false key that birthed our feud" restate across adjacent lines. Template cadence: "Elara's fingers traced...," "Elara approached...," "Elara extended..." within tight span. Stock metaphors ("chains of grudge," "shadows into light") and therapy-inflected abstractions ("fragile timeframe," "uncommonly thoughtful") cluster in the closure paragraph. Artifacts touch the ending, triggering elevated penalty and 9+ disqualification globally per the patterned-artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core premise (neutral-ground prisoner swap with symbolic relic) is familiar; the drawer-pull twin motif and moon-phase ritual add decoration but do not transform the template. Emotional arc is generic (guilt → forgiveness) with no fresh moral calculus or specific lived contradiction. The ending's wisdom ("recycle shadows into light," "every mistake to mosaic") reads as platitude rather than earned particular insight. Proximity to fantasy-negotiation templates is high; specific detail (clan names, lunar mechanics) does not reimagine the scaffolding.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara as negotiator frames the setup and drives the exchange action. She makes the choice to offer the drawer pull and verbally confesses her raid, altering the emotional stance. However, these decisions feel ceremonial rather than under resistance; Kael's cooperation is given, so her agency does not narrow live options with cost. She appears in the closure beat ("true prisoner freed was her conscience") but the realization is told rather than enacted. Present across all three gates but causal pressure is weak; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The antique drawer pull is introduced early (Elara's pocket, paragraph 6), handled at mid-story ("drew the...pull, holding it aloft"), and exchanged at closure ("extended her pull to Kael"). It recurs with reweighted meaning (false key → emblem of apology → talisman in enemy hands). However, its mechanics are vague—does it physically unlock the ropes, or is the "untether" metaphorical? The swap does not constrain a choice under pressure; Kael already agreed. Solid lyric reprise with closure linkage, but swappability is high (any relic could serve); upper mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Neutral territory (the forsaken cliffside ruin) is established early and frames the meeting's possibility ("the only place trust might flicker"). It enables the swap by removing clan advantage, a setup function. However, once on-site, the neutrality does not complicate or constrain—no rival patrols, no terrain hazard, no temptation to break truce. The concept is thematic echo more than tactical pressure. Mentioned in closure paragraph ("neutral territory had birthed possibility") but not causally active there. Two gates (setup, closure mention) with weak middle; low mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Uncommonly thoughtful" appears as a descriptor tag ("her uncommonly thoughtful gaze," "uncommonly thoughtful himself") but does not enable or constrain an on-page action. No visible tradeoff or cost tied to the trait—thoughtfulness is asserted, not demonstrated through a micro-choice that another trait would preclude. Label-only use; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Untether" is the central action: Elara "untethered his bonds with a synchronized tug" and Kael mirrors, freeing Lira. The verb recurs with thematic weight ("untether not just prisoners, but the chains of grudge"). Removing the untethering would collapse the swap's physical and symbolic resolution. It appears early as goal, drives the climax beat, and charges the closure image. Strong causal necessity and closure linkage; essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Moon phases are seeded early ("waning gibbous moon—synchronized through moon phases as per their pact, third quarter for release") and recur at the exchange ("as the moon slipped toward its phase mark"). The mechanics matter as ritual timing but do not constrain—no consequence if they miss the mark, no rival clock. The synchronization is ceremonial rather than tactical pressure. Present in setup and closure mention, but swappable with any agreed signal; functional but replaceable, low functional band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The parapet is described vividly throughout ("storm-worn windblown," "slick," "stones groaning underfoot") and frames all action. It provides neutral ground and atmospheric charge. However, it does not alter a tactic—characters do not navigate hazards or use terrain as leverage. The mist and wind are mood rather than obstacle. The setting supports tone and neutrality concept but lacks causal pressure on choice. Present across all three gates with solid descriptive work, but no cost tied to its features; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Between apology and forgiveness" is declared early and recurs in the closure ("Between apology and forgiveness, they had crossed the chasm"). The timeframe is conceptual rather than a live clock—no ticking deadline or evolving urgency tracks on the page. Actions proceed in ritual sequence without time pressure altering tactics. The frame is thematic rather than a constraint that tightens decisions; present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to recycle mistakes into wisdom" is stated explicitly ("her motivation burned to recycle mistakes into wisdom") and repeated in the closure ("recycling folly into enduring wisdom"). Elara's confession and drawer-pull exchange dramatize the desire, but internal friction is absent—no competing want complicates the choice. The motivation is told and enacted without visible cost or trade-off in the peak beat. Functional presence across gates but lacks on-page conflict; mid-low functional band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" is introduced early ("centuries of tempests whispering in furrowed hush") and recurs ("furrowed with the same hushed gravity," "a furrowed hush settling over the parapet like benediction"). The tone is sustained and modulates slightly at closure (softening: "wind softened to a hush"). It charges the final image atmospherically. However, the phrase is ornamental descriptor rather than pressure-driver. Coherent across beats with closure presence; solid lyric consistency, mid-band.</comment>
