<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to rediscover joy is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses under pressure. The interiority leans heavily on abstract labels ("pensive mirth," "daydream's haze") rather than embodied contradiction. Her decision to display the fragment feels inevitable without visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no competing desire challenged. The final "grinning softly" lands as summary rather than earned transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The piece operates in accumulative/textural mode but lacks a decisive cost at closure. Elara lifts the fragment, paints with light, and the fog retreats—all moves that compound but never narrow options or impose sacrifice. The "daydream" frame is invoked repeatedly but never dramatized as a constraint or cost; orientation within that frame remains vague past the 120-word mark (who else is present? what stakes anchor her here?). The ending offers mood and imagery but no legible before/after with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ruined orchard and fog create vivid atmosphere, and the fresco fragment functions as a micro-setting object. However, spatial choreography is loose—Elara's position relative to wraiths and trees shifts without clear blocking. The fog "parts" and "thins" without causal grounding in her actions. The fragment does constrain one choice (to lift and display it), lifting the score into mid-band, but the environment itself remains mostly decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rediscovering joy—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Elara encounters no friction: the fragment reveals its secret willingly, the light-painting succeeds immediately, wraiths approve, buds hint on branches. One micro-tightening occurs when she lifts the fragment, but no reversal or deepening narrows her options. The accumulative lens requires a cadence shift or reweighting that forecloses a path; here, all moves add without subtracting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of lost-and-found joy emerges through image and action rather than statement, a strength. The fresco-as-exposed-film motif recurs but feels ornamental—it does not constrain Elara's choices or charge the ending with irony. "Pensive mirth" is asserted in nearly every paragraph rather than earned through contradiction. The final image (walking into clearing mist, grinning) offers mood but no non-literal answer to the thematic question; it restates rather than reweights.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual filter (artist noticing light, color, texture) is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("vivid mural artist," "fold of a daydream," "phantasmal whispers") that clashes with immediate sensory experience under pressure. Repeated phrase templates ("pensive mirth," "knowledge network," "paint with light") flatten the narrative voice into a recitative catalog. The wraith's single line of dialogue ("You've unveiled our lost song") reads as thematic echo rather than goal-driven speech.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "pensive mirth" appears six times, "daydream" four times, "paint with light" / "painted with light" three times, "exposed film" twice in identical phrasing. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb], [object]" structures recur across a dozen lines without variation. Stock metaphors cluster in the final third ("heart alight," "soul's fresco," "path forward, one beam at a time"). These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the -1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood without advancing situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—light-painting onto mist to reveal hidden history—offers a fresh synthesis of art and archaeology. However, execution leans on familiar beats: lone artist in ruins, mystical object, approving spirits, symbolic rebirth. "Pensive mirth" as a repeated label substitutes for specific emotional texture. The wraith encounter and fog-retreat feel like convenience rather than character-driven transformation. The story does not take bold structural or perspectival risks; it walks the safety middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes two choices: lifting the fragment and creating the display. These decisions advance plot but do not alter tactics or foreclose options—both succeed without cost. She is signaled early (setup gate met), appears in middle beats (development gate met), and acts in the ending (payoff gate met), but her agency is observational and frictionless. Band guidance: two gates met + causal involvement in two beats = eligible to ~6.0, but swappability (another artist could perform identical moves) and lack of visible cost cap at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The fresco fragment is handled in three beats: discovery, light-painting activation, and final display. It returns with reweighted meaning (joy revealed) and is central to closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. However, its properties are generic—any sensitized artifact could serve the same role with minor edits. Positive signals: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9. Frictions: swappability −0.6. Lands solidly in 7.0–8.4 band but lacks the irreplaceability required for ≥8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Exposed film" is mentioned twice as metaphor ("like developer on exposed film," "its exposed film core") but does not constrain choices or shape tactics—it labels a visual effect without altering Elara's options. Setup gate missed (not present in first third); development gate missed (no middle choice tied to it); payoff gate met (mentioned at closure). One gate met caps at 2.8; ornamental use −0.7; label-only treatment −0.3. Stays in ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is Elara's defining action, used in four beats: initial description, fresco activation, orchard projection, final sealing. It enables her central move (revealing the fresco's layers) and appears in the closure image. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Positive signals: early +0.5, four beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8. Frictions: no visible cost tied to the trait itself (she never exhausts her lantern, struggles with the tool, or sacrifices anything to paint) −0.5; swappability (another light-based tool could replace it) −0.4. Lands at boundary of 5.0–6.9 band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Display" drives the ending: Elara gathers beams, projects the fragment onto trees, and the display draws wraiths and stirs the orchard. Setup gate missed (not signaled in first third); development gate met (she begins the display mid-story); payoff gate met (display is the closure action). Two gates eligible to ~6.0. Positive signals: two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure (wraiths materialize, fog thins) +0.7. Frictions: late signal (second third) −0.3; the display resolves a problem (finding joy) it did not help create −0.9. Caps at 6.3 per lyric-resonance allowance, but lack of prior complication limits upside.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "knowledge network" appears once in the middle third, delivering exposition about the fresco's origin, then mentioned briefly at closure ("network hummed farewell"). Setup gate missed; development gate met (one middle use); payoff gate met (cameo at end). Two gates eligible to ~6.0. Positive signals: two beats +0.9, causal pressure (provides context) +0.4. Frictions: late first appearance (second third) −0.4; summary-only (visions "flooded" rather than dramatized choice) −0.6; swappability (any info-source could deliver the lore) −0.7; piggyback closure (farewell mention is decorative) −0.3. Accumulation and lack of necessity lower to functional band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The ruined orchard and fog frame every scene and supply the fresco fragment (a resource). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Positive signals: early +0.6, present across all beats +1.4, supplies key object +0.6. Frictions: the setting does not pressure choices—Elara moves freely, fog retreats on cue, no constraint forces adaptation −1.0; ornamental fog description (muffles, whispers, parts) without causal grounding −0.5. Setting is present and atmospheric but passive; micro-setting (fresco in roots) does better work than the district itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Within the fold of a daydream" is invoked in opening, middle, and closing lines but never dramatized as a time constraint or cost. No urgency, no countdown, no choice shaped by ephemeral duration. Setup gate met (first line); development and payoff gates missed (never alters a middle or final decision). One gate caps at 2.8. Ornamental use −0.6; label-only −0.3. The frame is decorative mood rather than functional pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To rediscover lost joy" is stated in paragraph three and referenced throughout. It drives Elara's search and frames the ending. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Positive signals: early +0.5, present in three beats +1.4, closure linkage (joy "lingered, etched in her soul's fresco") +0.8. Frictions: motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants −0.7; no visible cost (she achieves joy without sacrifice or trade-off) −0.6; swappability (any emotional quest could substitute) −0.5. Functional but lacks the friction and specificity required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Pensive mirth" appears as a label in six paragraphs but does not modulate with pressure—Elara's tone remains uniformly wistful from discovery through triumph. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Positive signals: early +0.4, recurs across beats +0.9, present at closure +0.5. Frictions: static mood (no shift under stress) −1.0; label-only (asserted rather than embodied in syntax or image) −0.6; template phrase recycled without variation −0.3. The tone is coherent but monochrome; it does not charge the final image with irony or transformation.</comment>
