<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is present but largely abstract ("pondered his past silences") rather than embodied. The neural regeneration motif provides concrete physical anchors (tingling limbs, stim-packs), yet peak beats drift into label-speak ("frostbitten hope," "seraphically mundane atonement") without dramatized contradiction. Thorne's "silent-choir" choreography is vivid but one-note; his final choice to accept the bolt lacks visible internal conflict. The ending gesture ("I understand") reads as therapeutic closure rather than a choice forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The piece teaches its pattern early (lyric compression, motif layering) and the bolt discovery provides a causal turn. However, the closure—Elias pressing the bolt back and choosing to remain—lands more as thematic echo than a legible reconfiguration with visible cost; the "soul" regeneration claim is asserted, not demonstrated through a final image that reweights prior stakes. The Thorne backstory (via neural-link archive logs) is a convenient data-dump that flattens causality rather than dramatizing discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, snow, and spiral staircase are vivid and consistent. The "slightest discoloration" cue and the wobbly piano bench constrain Elias's discovery turn. However, the setting largely remains postcard backdrop; the fortress's "chill embrace" and "vaulted ice ceilings" do not pressure choices beyond the initial mood-setting. The neural-link archive access is an unmotivated convenience that bypasses spatial discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety—is signaled early. The bolt discovery provides one meaningful tightening, but Elias's decision to remain after the revelation lacks agency-driven escalation; he witnesses Thorne's grief and mirrors it without a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. The "nerve regeneration complete, not just nerves, but soul" resolution is declared rather than earned through a choice that alters tactics or options on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of unpardonable silence and safety's cost emerges through specific images (the bolt, the choir's fate, Elias's corporate past). The bolt as a motif with etched script ("Pardoned? Never") charges the discovery beat. However, the final exchange reduces theme to therapeutic statement ("I understand") and the closing paragraph moralizes ("safety was the thief of song, yet in remaining, one wove hope from ice") rather than letting the image resonate. The parallel between Elias and Thorne is earned but resolved with sermonic tidiness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias, but diction drifts into elevated register ("seraphically mundane," "balletic precision," "voiceless aria of regret") that clashes with the protagonist's embodied, regenerating interiority. The single line of dialogue ("I understand") is functional but generic. The archive-log memory flood is a POV breach—Elias accesses Thorne's history with unwarranted certainty, and the passage narrates Thorne's past choices ("fearing job loss, exile") as omniscient fact rather than inference. Rhythmic control is inconsistent; lyric compression in early beats gives way to expository summary in the climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: "seraphically mundane," "frostbitten hope," "cobalt womb," "silent-choir aura thickening into tangible grief" stack figurative language without clear vehicles. Paraphrase loops appear ("safety's cost: a life of seraphically mundane atonement" restates the prior sentence). Template cadence: "He sought refuge…," "He settled…," "He had fled…" runs across multiple paragraphs. The archive-log exposition ("Years prior, Thorne's choir rehearsed…") is scaffolding that summarizes rather than dramatizes. Density is high but clarity suffers at the closure beat, where metaphor ("frost, not tears," "choral waves crashing soundlessly") obscures the stakes of Thorne's response.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The neural-regeneration frame and the silent-bellhop choir concept offer fresh synthesis. The etched-bolt discovery via discoloration is a specific, non-obvious mechanic. However, the piece leans on familiar redemption-through-witness structure, and the ending's "soul regeneration" reads as a template moral arc. The bolt's inscribed message ("Pardoned? Never") and the choir-sabotage backstory feel convenience-plotted rather than inevitable in hindsight; the rival's jealousy and the conductor's fall are stock motivations inserted to justify the motif.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Thorne is present across multiple beats (lobby greeting, linen adjustments, final confrontation). His silent-choir gestures are vivid but ornamental until the bolt reveal. At closure he freezes, eyes well with frost, and accepts the bolt—observation and symbolic reception rather than a decision that alters tactics. His past choice (remaining silent about sabotage) is recounted via archive, not dramatized on the page. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but causal pressure is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piano bench bolt is discovered via the staircase discoloration (first touch), returned to Thorne (second touch), and its etched script drives the revelation beat. It shapes the dominant turn and charges the closure exchange. However, the bolt does not constrain a choice—Elias's decision to remain is thematic rather than causally forced by the object. The bolt's role in Thorne's past is told via archive summary, not dramatized. Strong development and closure linkage, but swappable for another inscribed token with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unpardonable silence" frames the story's central question (Elias's past, Thorne's sabotage witness) and is present by the opening third. It shapes Elias's motive to understand safety's cost and informs his recognition of Thorne's parallel guilt. However, it operates more as thematic claim than on-page constraint; Elias does not face a live silence-versus-outcry choice in the present scene. The concept reweights meaning at closure ("I understand") but does not narrow options or impose visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Seraphically mundane" describes Thorne's routine and aura throughout (lobby activity, linen-fluffing, choir-like flourishes). It is label-only decoration in most beats; the trait does not constrain or enable a key action with visible cost. The descriptor charges Thorne's aesthetic but remains atmospheric rather than causal. Present in setup and middle, absent from closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Remain" is the story's final action—Elias "chose to remain, extending his stay amid the cobalt under snow"—and echoes the opening motive ("sought refuge here"). It closes the arc and forecloses the option to flee. However, the decision is declared rather than dramatized through a difficult choice with visible tradeoff; the story tells us regeneration is "complete, not just nerves, but soul" without showing what staying costs. The action is thematically central but lacks on-page consequence that alters later moves.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase" is the method by which Elias discovers the bolt. It is signaled in setup (the staircase is introduced early), used at the discovery beat (Elias's regenerating touch grazes the banister and halts at the smudge), and its mechanics matter (the discoloration is described as "faint ochre" and causally linked to the pried-loose shard). The method does not shape multiple attempts or constrain tactics beyond the single discovery turn. Present in setup and one key beat, but not revisited or reweighted at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress under snow is vividly rendered and anchors the story's spatial frame. The setting enforces isolation ("a cobalt womb") and the spiral staircase provides the discovery site. However, the fortress does not pressure Elias's choices beyond mood; he could have discovered the bolt and chosen to remain in any isolated venue. The snow and chill are atmospheric rather than tactical constraints. Present in setup, middle, and closure mention, but the setting does not alter outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Nerve regeneration is present in the opening line and recurs as physical sensation (tingling limbs, prickling fire, hypersensitive touch during the bolt discovery). It provides a concrete clock for Elias's recovery. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions; the story tells us "nights blurred into days" without showing how the regeneration deadline alters tactics or forces the final choice. At closure, regeneration is declared "complete" as thematic punctuation rather than causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To understand the cost of safety" is Elias's stated motive in the opening third and recurs in reflection ("he grasped it: safety was the thief of song"). The motive is told more than dramatized; Elias observes Thorne's vigil and mirrors it, but does not face a live choice between safety and outcry on the page. The final decision to remain enacts the motive thematically but without visible friction or competing want. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure, but the desire is asserted rather than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Frostbitten hope" appears as descriptor ("frostbitten promise of wholeness," "frostbitten hope numbing the wait," "Frostbitten hope thawed slightly") and charges the ending's tonal register. The tone is coherent through turns—lyric compression, chilly distance, muted longing—but static rather than modulating with pressure. The final image ("regeneration complete, not just nerves, but soul") declares tonal resolution rather than letting hope's cost reverberate through the image. Present throughout, but does not deepen or shift in response to escalation.</comment>
