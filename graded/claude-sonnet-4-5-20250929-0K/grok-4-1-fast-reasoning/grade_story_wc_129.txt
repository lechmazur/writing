<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's longing to "graft herself onto community" is established early, but her interiority is often abstract ("luminescent ache," "boldly sympathetic") rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. The group-formation beats are told more than dramatized—we're told they "deciphered" and "bonds tightened," but few micro-choices show her wrestling with vulnerability or cost. The final knotting feels declarative rather than earned by prior on-page struggle. Secondary characters (Lir, Mira, Thorne) apply pressure primarily by existing, not by forcing Elara into trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece orients who/where/when by ~120 words (marsh-reed sculptor, crystalline orchard, beyond lost languages), avoiding the orientation penalty. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through the shared search and communal web-building. However, the closure—Elara placing the final knot and declaring "we dedicate this work to our shared becoming"—lands as a ceremony rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The arbor's discovery and the sculpture's completion feel like fulfillment of a quest rather than a reconfiguration that reweights prior loneliness. Cost is asserted ("no longer adrift") but not legibly paid on the page; the ache is "transformed" and "shared," yet no specific price (time, isolation, artistic autonomy) is dramatized in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, shimmering crater, and glimmering obsidian arbor are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory specificity (frost-kissed branches, iridescent mists, volcanic glass facets). Spatial choreography is clear across the search sequence. The arbor functions as a micro-setting that constrains the final action: Elara drapes it with reeds, physically anchoring her communal sculpture. This single constraint-driven choice elevates the score into the 6-band, though the orchard itself remains more backdrop than tactical pressure across the middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara's desire to weave herself into community—is signaled early and maintained. The shared search provides a throughline, but escalation is diffuse: "days blurred," "bonds tightening," "group swelled" are summary moves rather than on-page reversals that narrow options. The arbor discovery feels like arrival rather than a turn that forces a trade-off. The final sculpture is completed without visible friction or resource cost (no mention of time pressure, physical exhaustion, or competing artistic vision). One tightening occurs (the group crests the ridge and finds the arbor), but the agency is collective drift rather than Elara's decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of kinship and belonging emerges organically from the search, sculpture, and communal dedication. The arbor and reed-web serve as resonant images that reweight isolation versus connection. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("In webs of kinship... endured, resilient as obsidian"), replacing earned resonance with a thematic summary. The closing image—Elara walking "home" under the eternal arbor—carries some non-literal charge, but the intervening declarations ("their search had not ended but evolved, a perpetual graft") reduce ambiguity and tell the reader what to feel. The piece invites reflection, yet the moralizing final lines cost it higher-band entry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elara; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is present but generic: "luminescent ache," "boldly sympathetic," and abstract phrasing recur without character-particular idiom. Dialogue is sparse and functional ("I seek the artist's mark," "It haunts me too"), carrying little subtext or character distinction. Psychic distance remains consistent. The voice modulates minimally under pressure—discovery of the arbor elicits "Elara gasped," but the syntax and diction stay elevated throughout. Free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("felt rooted," "smiled through residual ache") occasionally dull immediacy without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Phrasing is often elegant but repetitive: "luminescent ache" appears three times, "webs of kinship" five times, "boldly sympathetic/sympathetically" three times, forming a template cadence that dulls momentum (−0.6). Several beats paraphrase without added pressure: "Their steps synchronized... conversations blooming" followed immediately by "Elara shared tales... Lir spoke of his family's fracture" restates bonding twice (−0.2 paraphrase loop). Figurative density is high but coherent (marsh reeds as community veins, crater as mirror). The final paragraph stacks summary statements ("Yet the artist's mystery lingered... Dawn broke... Elara walked among them now, home") that feel like scaffolding rather than propulsion. Information density is moderate; many lines do single work. No grammar errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—artist's tag as community catalyst, marsh-reed sculptor seeking belonging—is functional but familiar (quest for mysterious artist, found-family formation). The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor add vivid texture, yet the emotional arc (lonely artist finds collective through shared search) follows a template path. The sculpture as communal artifact and the arbor as sentinel are well-executed tropes rather than fresh syntheses. The transformation test fails: swapping "marsh reeds" for another craft and "orchard" for another setting would leave the plot and emotional beats largely unchanged. No bold structural risk or non-obvious moral calculus elevates the work beyond competent fantasy-fable conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her desire to "graft herself onto community" drives the search. However, her choices are passive: she joins the search, shares stories, and completes the sculpture without on-page conflict or trade-off. The final knotting is her most concrete action, but it resolves a goal she pursed cooperatively rather than creating a turn. She observes and participates more than she decides under pressure. Two gates (setup, payoff in the sculpture) are met, but middle development lacks a choice that narrows options. Score: functional but not decision-driven.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The arbor is introduced late (twilight discovery, ~70% mark, −0.4) but charges the closure strongly: Elara drapes it with reeds, making it the physical anchor of the dedication. It appears in three beats: discovery, sculpture framing, and the final eternal-witness image. The specificity (obsidian, volcanic glass, crater-glow veins) matters; another structure would not carry the same weight. Causal pressure is moderate—it enables the sculpture but does not narrow prior options. Closure linkage is strong (+1.2), irreplaceability evident (+0.6). Late arrival and single middle beat limit the score to mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Webs of kinship" is signaled early (street artist's glyph, Elara's longing) and returned in the final sculpture and dedication, meeting setup and payoff gates. It shapes the dominant stake (Elara seeks to weave herself into others). However, it functions primarily as thematic frame rather than tactical constraint—no on-page choice hinges on kinship mechanics (e.g., obligation vs. autonomy). The concept is told and illustrated but does not alter options under pressure. Lyric reprise with modest thematic reweighting places it in the 5–6 band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" is labeled three times ("boldly reaching," "boldly, sympathetically clasping," "boldly sympathetic to the beauty of imperfect ties") but never constrains or costs Elara on the page. No moment shows her sympathy generating conflict, forcing a trade-off, or enabling a breakthrough that another trait would not. It is ornamental character description. Missing middle development gate and label-only use cap the score at 3.8; template repetition and swappability lower it further.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dedication ceremony occurs in the final third and is the explicit culmination: Elara intones the ritual words and the group echoes her, sealing the communal bond. This action is present in the closure image (+1.0) and frames the sculpture's meaning. However, it does not create a turn—it fulfills the search's arc rather than redefining options. Setup is minimal (dedication not foreshadowed), middle development absent, but payoff strong. Two gates (middle implied by completion, payoff clear) and closure linkage lift it to mid-6s. Swappable with "unveiling" or "blessing" with minor edits (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The shared search for the elusive street artist's tag is introduced early (cycles of appearances, Elara and Lir's exchange) and structures the middle beats: "deciphered the tag's subtle migrations," "following the tag's latest echo." It provides the method that brings the group together and leads to the arbor discovery. However, search mechanics are summary ("scouring," "deciphered") rather than dramatized attempts with failure and adaptation. It shapes two beats (initial pairing, ridge discovery) and touches closure indirectly (the arbor hosts the final tag). Three gates met; causal pressure moderate; specificity present. Mid-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard perched at the crater's edge is vividly established in the opening and provides spatial coherence (translucent trunks, crater rim, ridge, arbor at the lip). It supplies the arbor as the closure site, a clear payoff. However, the orchard does not pressure Elara's choices in the middle—it is backdrop for the search rather than a constraint (no mention of harvest season, dangerous terrain, or social rules tied to the orchard). Setup strong, middle development weak, payoff via arbor. Postcard description dominates; micro-setting function is minimal. Score mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" establishes a distant-past or post-collapse timeframe in the opening line. It recurs in the final dedication ("In webs of kinship, beyond lost murmurs") and colors the tone (mythic, elegiac). However, it does not tighten decisions or track a live clock—"cycles," "days blurred," "one twilight" are vague durations that do not create urgency. No middle development; payoff is lyric echo only. Present but ornamental, no causal pressure. Score low-3s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to graft herself onto community" is named early ("luminous yearning to graft herself onto the sparse community") and drives every beat: joining Lir, forming the group, sculpting the communal web. It is conflicted only implicitly (her prior solitude vs. risk of vulnerability, though this is told rather than shown in a micro-choice). The motivation is fulfilled rather than tested—no moment forces her to choose between artistic autonomy and communal obligation. Three gates met (setup, middle via shared search, payoff in sculpture), but friction is low. Told desire with consistent through-line but minimal on-page cost places it in the high-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is introduced as Elara's state ("luminescent ache pulsed within her") and recurs six times, threading through discovery ("Elara gasped, the sight igniting her core") and closure ("smiled through residual ache"). It modulates subtly—ache shared rather than erased—and charges the final image (the crater as "mirror to their inner glow"). Coherent through turns, purposeful reprise. However, the tone is static in register (elevated, lyric) and does not shift cadence under pressure; "ache" remains an abstraction rather than embodied sensation. Three gates met, closure linkage present, but single mood and label-reliance prevent higher score. Mid-6 band.</comment>
