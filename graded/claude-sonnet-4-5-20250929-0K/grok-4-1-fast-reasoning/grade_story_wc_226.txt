<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—avenging her father's exile—appears late and is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her "innocently mischievous" trait reads as a label repeated across beats without embodied contradiction or visible cost; the winking and giggling feel performed rather than rooted in conflicted interiority. The poetry sessions involve a crowd of undifferentiated youths and adults whose reactions are summarized in generic terms ("murmured," "wept verse") rather than shown through distinct speech or gesture. Agency at closure is unclear: Elara "smiles" and "dreams," but no on-page choice forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: by ~120 words the reader knows "canyon," "towers of bone," and "Elara," but the inciting action (poetry sessions as rebellion) does not materialize until midpoint. The drive lens wavers between Accumulative (verse layering) and Causal (sessions meant to disrupt the ritual), yet closure offers only off-page consequence ("Tomorrow, the ritual would falter") without an on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost, or Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior material. The final image—Elara smiling and dreaming—asserts victory but does not dramatize cost or show stakes reconfigured on the page. Under any inferred lens, the ending lacks the required closure unit with legible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "towers of bone," "pale spire," and "marrow pool" are vivid and consistently referenced, establishing a memorable gothic setting. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; no choice or tactic is constrained by proximity, access, or spatial logic (e.g., Elara "slips" freely, youths "follow" without navigating bone architecture). The micro-setting (ribcage arches, vertebrae perch) is decorative rather than tactical. Spatial choreography is vague: the crowd's size, movement, and the chamber's layout remain unclear, and the spire's distance or accessibility is never specified.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—disrupting the elders' forgiveness ritual—is declared early but pressure does not escalate causally. The poetry sessions accumulate verses (Accumulative lens), yet no on-page reversal forces a trade-off or narrows Elara's options; "elders' spies" appear passively and do not intervene. Closure asserts that "the ritual would falter" and "truths would never unify again," but these outcomes are told, not shown. No visible cost or agency-driven choice at the ending reweights stakes; Elara's final smile and dream state victory without dramatized consequence or sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme—fragmented truth versus monolithic forgiveness—is legible and woven through the poetry refrains. However, the piece leans on repeated prompt language ("refract," "price of forgiveness," "single truth into many") rather than dramatizing the theme through specific, irreversible choices with moral calculus. The ending ("The end of unity, the birth of refraction") states the theme rather than charging it with a resonant image or action. Elara's "prismatic victory" is asserted, not earned through a final beat that reweights prior material with visible or felt cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and Elara's perceptual signature ("paint-smeared fingers," "silken hook" voice) is established early. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("forged hush," "spectral halos," "prismatic words") that feels authorial rather than character-bound, especially under stress. Dialogue from the crowd is generic and interchangeable; no character beyond Elara speaks with distinct idiom. The narrative occasionally tells what Elara orchestrates ("Innocently mischievous, she orchestrated chaos with giggles") rather than showing it through action and subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose is dense with figurative language ("bruised sky," "forgotten spines," "spectral halos," "prismatic words," "symphony of doubt") in nearly every sentence, creating register drift and slowing momentum without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Paraphrase loops appear: "The price of forgiveness" is restated multiple times without added pressure. Template cadence is evident in repeated "[Elara] + [past-tense verb]" stems across paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("storm in her eyes," "silken hook," "fire tempered by hush") reduce specificity. These artifacts pervade the final third, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The gothic bone-canyon setting and poetry-as-rebellion premise offer a fresh visual frame. However, the emotional arc—defiant artist versus authoritarian elders—follows a familiar template, and the story does not transform it through lived detail, moral ambiguity, or a non-obvious choice with visible cost. The ending asserts revolution without dramatizing sacrifice, dissent within Elara's camp, or consequence from the elders. The "innocently mischievous" framing and the "prismatic victory" lack the specificity and earned hindsight required for higher originality scores.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her goal (disrupt the ritual) frames the narrative. However, her key "defiant artist" choices—organizing the sessions, prompting verses—are summarized rather than shown as on-page decisions with visible cost. She does not face a meaningful trade-off or reversal that alters her tactics. The closure moment (smile, dream) is passive observation, not a choice that redefines options. Functional but largely replaceable with another rebellious archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The pale spire appears in multiple beats (opening description, poetry chamber backdrop, "seemed to pulse," final sketch), but its function remains static: a visual anchor for the rebellion's setting. It does not constrain or enable a choice, and its meaning does not reweight at closure. Elara sketches it at the end, but this gesture is decorative rather than causal. Present across beats but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"The price of forgiveness" is declared as the thematic core and recurs in dialogue and narration. However, it operates as a thematic claim rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics; no character faces a concrete choice where forgiving or withholding forgiveness alters their options with visible cost. The concept is present and frames the rebellion but does not drive a causal turn or closure moment.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Innocently mischievous" is labeled repeatedly ("innocently mischievous grin," "mischievous delight," "mischief veiling resolve," "innocently mischievous spark") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The trait reads as a tonal descriptor rather than a behavioral driver; for example, Elara's winking and humming do not create friction or trade-offs in her tactics. Label-only use without dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Refract" recurs as both verb and metaphor across the poetry sessions and is central to Elara's stated method. The action shapes one major beat (the collective chant that "refract[s]" the monolithic truth into "many jagged edges") and is invoked at closure ("refraction" as the story's final note). However, the mechanics of refraction—how it alters the elders' control or the ritual's outcome—are asserted rather than shown through a causal turn with on-page cost. Present in setup, development, and payoff, but the payoff is told.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Impromptu poetry sessions are signaled early ("Through impromptu poetry sessions, she would bend light"), dramatized in the middle third (Elara prompts verses, the crowd responds), and invoked at closure ("her sessions had splintered it"). The sessions frame two distinct beats (first session, final collective chant) and their mechanics—prompting, refracting, echoing—are shown on the page. However, the sessions do not face resistance or cost that alters Elara's tactics; the elders' spies observe passively. The method is present across all three gates and drives the middle, but lacks friction or closure cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon are vividly rendered and anchor every scene, providing a memorable gothic frame. The setting supplies resources (alcove, ribcage chamber, marrow pool) and the "endless echoes" motif recurs, charged at closure ("echoes carried it forth, unerasable"). However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; spatial access is frictionless, and no decision hinges on proximity, material, or architectural constraint. Strong atmospheric presence with one clear beat (chamber as poetry venue) and a lyric reprise at closure, but no tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Before the ritual" is stated early and "Tomorrow's ritual loomed" recurs in the final third, establishing urgency. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter Elara's tactics on the page; the poetry sessions unfold without interruption, and the clock does not force trade-offs. The ending asserts that "tomorrow, the ritual would falter," but this consequence occurs off-page. Time pressure is declared but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to refract a single truth into many" is declared early and repeated across beats. Her motivation deepens slightly when her father's exile is revealed, adding personal stakes. However, the motivation is told rather than shown through on-page friction; Elara does not face a choice where refracting the truth costs her safety, alliances, or certainty. The sessions proceed without internal conflict or visible sacrifice. Present in setup and development, but lacks dramatized cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Forged hush" appears in the opening and recurs ("hush cloaked every whisper," "forged hush trembling," "hush before the rite") as a tonal anchor. The tone modulates slightly as the poetry sessions build ("echoes roared softly"), but the overall register remains elevated and static across turns. The final image ("In that forged hush, Elara smiled") reprises the phrase but does not reweight it with new pressure or cost. Coherent and present, but does not charge the closure moment.</comment>
