<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (brother's death, withered groves) is clearly stated and drives her risk-taking journey. However, the pivotal closure choice—pocketing the artifact—lacks on-page struggle or visible cost beyond practical consequence; she "knows" it will revive her groves without dramatized doubt or moral calculus. Interiority remains thin: "her motivation burned hotter" is told, and the moment of prying the tip free skips emotional contradiction. The decision feels inevitable rather than earned through conflicting impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (Elara, glider, Arboris Prime, inversion approaching). The piece follows a causal lens: inversion enables flight → water-flow navigation → cavern discovery → artifact retrieval → planting. The closure is a Decisive Change (artifact planted, echoes stir, groves will revive), but cost is asserted rather than felt: "Her brother would have approved" and a smile substitute for on-page friction or forfeiture. The retrieval scene notes "echoes wailed silently, vines retracting in shock," hinting at planetary harm, yet Elara's exit and planting proceed without consequence or moral reckoning, muting the cost proof at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Floating rock arches, inverted rivers, and hyper-vital moss create vivid, purpose-driven details. The upward-cascading water directly constrains navigation ("surfing the aqueous rush"), and the cavern's translucent roots shape the discovery beat. The final image—artifact planted in withered soil, echoes stirring—charges closure by using the home grove setting to register change. Spatial choreography (glider → arch throat → cavern → descent back through collapsing flows) remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find resilience source to end famine) is signaled early. The inversion window and narrowing arch throat provide one meaningful tightening, and the artifact retrieval deepens knowledge. However, agency at closure is thin: Elara takes the tip "swiftly" without on-page debate, and planting it proceeds without complication or trade-off. The "echoes wailed" moment hints at cost (planetary harm?), but the narrative does not test Elara's values or force a choice between competing goods, leaving the escalation functional but the price under-dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (planetary memory as survival, resilience through echo) emerges from concrete images: the broken arrow tip channeling growth, builders' cataclysm memory, and the nexus accelerating vitality. The final planting offers a non-literal answer to the central question without overt moralizing. However, the piece skirts moral complexity: Elara's retrieval may harm the planet's broader resilience ("echoes wailed," vines retracting), yet this friction vanishes by the landing, and the smile-and-approval ending tilts sentimental. The thematic question of collective versus individual survival is raised but not pressed into Elara's closure choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara. Perceptual signature is present: "gaunt cheeks tightened," "hyper-vital moss," sensory focus on hum and silence. Diction occasionally drifts toward elevated lyricism ("whirling silence profound as a tomb," "liquid starlight") that feels authorial rather than pilot-practical, especially under stress. The phrase "whirling silence" recurs as anchoring idiom but begins to read decorative by the third use. No dialogue on the page; filter verbs ("felt," "glimpsed," "gasped") are frequent but remain legible within the focalizer's stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully (short crisis beats, longer discovery paragraph). Clarity is generally strong, though some constructions blur sequence: "Drawn inexorably, she furled her glider and dropped into the flow, tumbling into the chamber's heart" compresses three actions without causal connectors. The phrase "whirling silence" appears four times, becoming a template cadence that dulls rather than charges (−0.4). "Gaunt cheeks tightened" and "motivation burned hotter" are stock embodiments. Figurative density is high but controlled except for "rivers...threading through...like liquid starlight" and "ancient ribs," which remain legible. Information density is solid; no major loops detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The gravity-inversion conceit and water-navigation method offer fresh angles on discovery/extraction plotting. However, the emotional arc—lone pilot seeks artifact to save home after family loss—is a familiar template, and the piece does not transform it through moral friction or surprising character calculus. The "broken arrow tip as planetary conductor" is imaginative world-building, but the closure (pocket artifact, plant it, smile) follows expected beats without synthesis or risk. The piece commits to its premise but does not press past safe execution into bold thematic territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's choice to release tethers initiates the journey (early signal +0.5), her navigation by water flow enables middle progress (+0.4 for one beat), and her decision to pocket the tip drives closure (+0.7). However, the pocketing moment lacks on-page friction—she acts "swiftly" without dramatized doubt—reducing causal weight. Present across setup, middle, and payoff, but decisions feel inevitable rather than hard-won under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken arrow tip appears late (past midpoint; −0.3) but is causally active: touching it floods Elara with planetary memories (one beat), prying it free causes echoes to wail and vines to retract (second beat), and planting it stirs echoes at closure (payoff +1.0). Closure linkage is strong (+1.2), and its properties (fractal runes, conductor function) are specific and irreplaceable (+0.6). Swappability is low; cost connection is present (vines recoil, though consequence is not explored). Late arrival and summary-only backstory (builders' cataclysm recounted, not shown; −0.4) limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The gathering of echoes is dramatized in the cavern scene (middle beat +0.4) and reappears at closure when "echoes stirred faintly" after planting (+0.5). However, the concept does not constrain Elara's tactics—she observes the nexus but does not interact with the echoes themselves; the arrow tip is the active agent. The echoes function more as world-building atmosphere than a force that alters her choices or imposes cost. Present in setup (scouts' whispers), middle (nexus description), and payoff, but ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Accelerated growth is shown concretely in the cavern ("tendrils elongating inches per second, fruits ballooning"; middle beat +0.4) and at closure when roots "quicken" after planting (+0.5). Early signal via "crystalline fruits swelled impossibly" and "blooms erupting from scorched soil overnight" (+0.4). The trait enables Elara's goal (end famine) and is causally tied to the arrow tip, but no on-page cost or trade-off is dramatized—growth acceleration solves the problem without complication. Functional across beats but lacks visible friction or constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The action "discover" structures the arc: inversion enables access (setup), navigating by water leads to the cavern (middle beat), and finding the arrow tip provides the closure solution (payoff +1.0). Causal pressure is strong (+1.2): the discovery redefines Elara's options and delivers the artifact that will revive her groves. Early signal through "mystery gnawed at her" and "driven to find it" (+0.5). The discovery beat itself ("There, in whirling silence profound as a tomb, hovered a gathering of echoes") is vividly dramatized. Irreplaceability is high; swapping "discover" would gut the narrative.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Navigating by water flow is signaled early ("the method that had saved her before") and used actively in two beats: "She banked into the nearest current, the glider surfing the aqueous rush" (middle +0.9) and "surfing the collapsing flows back through the arches" (closure approach +0.5). The method constrains her path (must follow upflows to reach the spire; +0.8) and is specific to the inversion context. However, the phrase "saved her before" is a convenient setup without prior dramatization, and the mechanics remain somewhat abstract—how surfing water in zero-g differs from air gliding is not detailed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating rock arches shape multiple beats: "only during the hourly gravity inversion...could she reach the forbidden upper arches" (setup constrains access; +0.8), the colossal arch's narrowing throat creates a tightening obstacle ("waters frothing in silent whirlpools"; middle beat +0.9), and the inverted spire houses the artifact cavern (closure linkage +1.0). The arches' "petrified vines that pulsed faintly" add texture and foreshadow the nexus. Early signal (+0.5) and specificity are strong; the setting directly enables and pressures Elara's tactics. Irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The hourly inversion window is signaled early ("Now, the hum deepened; inversion approached") and gates Elara's access to the upper arches (setup +0.6). The reverting gravity ("Gravity trembled, inversion waning; waters began their downward turn") forces her hasty exit (middle urgency +0.5). However, the one-hour limit is declared but not actively tracked—no on-page sense of elapsed time or racing clock during the cavern exploration. The timeframe constrains the setup and exit but does not tighten choices within the discovery beat, reducing causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (find resilience source to end famine, avenge brother's death) is stated early and drives her risk ("driven to find it, not for glory, but because her family's groves had withered"; setup +0.6). It shapes her decision to fly during inversion (middle choice +0.5) and her swift pocketing of the artifact ("this artifact could revive her groves—accelerate growth on command, end famines"; closure rationale +0.7). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized in friction: the brother's approval is invoked at closure without on-page conflict between personal and planetary cost. No visible trade-off between competing wants weakens the felt charge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The phrase "whirling silence" recurs four times, anchoring tone across beats: opening ("whirling silence of Arboris Prime"), navigation ("In the whirling silence, broken only by her breathing"), cavern discovery ("in whirling silence profound as a tomb"), and closure ("In the returning whirling silence, she smiled"). The tone modulates slightly—void-quiet to breath-interrupted to tomb-profound to returned calm—but the repetition becomes mechanical rather than charged by the fourth use (−0.3). The final reprise does reweight the opening motif with closure calm, yet the effect feels decorative rather than essential to the pressure or cost of the ending image.</comment>
