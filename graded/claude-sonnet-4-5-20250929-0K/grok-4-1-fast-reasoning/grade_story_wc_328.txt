<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("to turn that bitterness into a cosmic joke") but never dramatized through conflicting micro-choices under pressure. The brother's rejection is told in summary, not enacted, so the emotional wound feels abstract. The ending ascent lacks embodied contradiction—she simply laughs and floats, with no visible cost or foreclosed path. Interior voice converges with the narrator's purple register, flattening character specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words; the "Missing Return Changed everything" exposition arrives mid-opening without concrete anchors. The closure—Elara floating, weightless and whole—offers a Decisive Change, but the causal chain is broken: the arrowhead blazes without prior constraint, and the phone confessions trigger metamorphosis through assertion rather than earned causality. The drive lens appears Causal early but collapses into summary at closure, undercutting cost legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The underground garden supplies vivid sensory detail—glowing ferns, rime crystals, stalactites—but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The arrowhead and phone are handled, but spatial choreography (how Elara moves between beds, where objects rest) remains vague. The garden's "gravitationally playful" air does not alter tactics or foreclose movement, so the setting remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconciling with her brother—is signaled but never tested on the page. Elara's sole action is pressing the phone to her ear; the metamorphosis arrives without a choice, trade-off, or visible price. The confessions swell and her bitterness "transmutes," but this is summary, not a dramatized narrowing of options. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>"Bitterness into a cosmic joke" is stated repeatedly in prompt-like language without emerging from concrete action. The final paragraph moralizes—"bitterness became the setup for laughter echoing through the cosmos"—replacing scene pressure with thesis. The arrowhead and phone are introduced late and never gain layered meaning; they function as plot keys, not resonant motifs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable, but diction drifts into elevated register ("sylvan whimsy," "primordial skies," "eternal, whimsical flight") that exceeds Elara's on-page lexicon. The brother's single line of dialogue—"See? The ultimate joke—gravity's got a sense of humor"—sounds writerly rather than spoken. Filter verbs stack in high-pressure beats ("felt it," "felt the action"), dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara notices like a neutral camera.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "Her brother's voice broke through" / "Brother, my bitterness was the heaviest stone" restate the same plea. Template cadence runs appear—"The arrowhead pulsed…as if it remembered" / "The arrowhead blazed, and she felt it"—with identical stems. Stock metaphors ("frostbitten void," "spider silk," "quicksilver") cluster without fresh vehicle. Mixed metaphor: "bitterness festered like blackroot blight" then "became the setup for laughter"—blight and joke are incoherent vehicles. Figurative density in the final third obscures propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "Missing Return Changed everything" frame echoes familiar portal-fantasy and transformation templates. "Gravitationally playful" and "harmony untamed" are vivid phrases, but the story leans on their novelty rather than dramatizing unique consequences. The phone-as-confession-conduit offers a fresh angle, yet it arrives late and resolves the problem it did not help create. The ending—weightless ascent, laughter, "eternal, whimsical flight"—reads as genre-conventional catharsis without a non-obvious turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara is labeled "cryptid researcher working undercover" but never observes, logs, or makes a research-driven decision. Her undercover role does not constrain a single choice or create friction with Mira. The attribute is ornamental setup without middle development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The arrowhead is unearthed mid-story, pulsed warm, and held during the phone call; it "blazed" at metamorphosis and is "embedded in her palm" at closure. Three beats, but its "sharp as forgotten oaths" property never constrains a choice. It enables the transformation without prior causal work, so it feels swappable with any magical catalyst.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"A harmony untamed" appears as thematic label in exposition and the brother's dialogue, but does not shape an on-page tactical choice. The garden's gravity becomes "gravitationally playful" without resistance or cost. The concept is echoed at closure but never tested or broken, so it remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Gravitationally playful" is declared in the opening and enacted at the ending (pots levitate, Elara's feet lift). It does not constrain movement or force a trade-off in the middle; Elara walks freely until the transformation. The trait resolves a problem it did not help create, capping it at 3.0; setup and closure presence nudge slightly higher.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" is the climactic action: Elara's skin tingles, bitterness transmutes, she ascends. It is present at closure but arrives without prior failed attempts or visible cost. The transformation is summary ("her body lightening as bitterness transmuted") rather than a choice-driven act, so the action feels declarative, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The phone is introduced in the second half, dusted off, and pressed to Elara's ear. Its "static-laden confessions" trigger the metamorphosis, but the mechanics are asserted, not earned. It shapes the ending but not middle tactics, and it resolves a problem it did not help create, capping it near 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The underground garden is established early with glowing ferns, quartz veins, and stalactites. Elara tends herbs and unearths the arrowhead from a bed. At closure, the garden "blooms brighter" and fades below. Three beats, but the space does not constrain movement or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elara could receive the confessions anywhere. Lyric setup and closure reprise lift it to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"After the Missing Return Changed everything" is declared in the opening but functions as backstory, not a live clock. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The "one evening" marker is vague, and elapsed time does not pressure Elara's choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" is stated in Elara's motivation line and repeated in her whispered confession, but never dramatized through conflicting wants. The desire is told, not enacted through friction or visible cost. It frames setup and returns at closure without middle development.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Frostbitten hope" appears in the opening ("frostbitten void") and closing ("frostbitten hope warmed the air"). The tone modulates from bitterness to laughter, and frost imagery recurs (rime crystals, frozen tears). The reprise reweights the opening stake, but the tone does not coherently pressure choices in the middle; it remains a thematic label rather than a felt atmosphere that constrains action.</comment>
