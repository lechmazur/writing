<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clearly signaled (defy hopelessness through fireworks) and drives his choices, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("hopelessness clung like damp fog") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to replicate the mosaic design is stated rather than dramatized as a moment of internal friction. Chanting functions more as atmospheric tic than character-specific coping mechanism that constrains or enables under stress. No visible cost trades off against his goal; the launch succeeds without complication and villagers simply appear in wonder.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation arrives quickly (wandering designer, blooming fortress, dusk) and the causal lens is clear: Elias seeks the mosaic note → spins fire to filter light → discovers design → builds firework → launches. However, closure lacks felt cost; the firework succeeds without complication, villagers emerge in wonder, and Elias vows to continue—no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The "vow to light every dusk" reads as assertion rather than a crystallized choice shaped by prior pressure. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3 to −0.5) is waived because anchors land early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The blooming fortress is vividly rendered (luminous flowers, iridescent mosaic tiles) and the fire spinner's knot is handled concretely across multiple beats. The mosaic tiles align under firelight to reveal the design, constraining Elias's choice to replicate that specific pattern. Spatial choreography is clear (circling the base, kneeling amid petals). However, the "hush of a night with no stars" functions primarily as atmospheric declaration; it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page, and the overcast skies remain backdrop rather than active constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—pierce the starless void with fireworks to defy hopelessness—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful turn occurs when the mosaic reveals the blueprint, narrowing Elias's design from improvisation to replication. However, escalation is thin: the discovery arrives without complication, the construction proceeds smoothly, and the launch succeeds on first attempt with no visible cost or trade-off. Villagers emerge in wonder, but no prior tension is paid off; the ending distributes satisfaction without forecloses a path or demonstrating what was risked.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—defiance of hopelessness through ephemeral beauty—emerges from concrete action (spinning fire, mixing powders, launching the firework) rather than assertion. The mosaic as relic and the firework as echo of lost sky-painters deepen the concept. The final image of villagers drawn by light and Elias vowing to replicate the design offers a non-literal answer. However, the resolution is tidy and unopposed; no counter-pressure tests the premise that beauty alone can defy despair. The chants risk thematic echo but remain character-voiced enough to avoid sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, and the perceptual signature (fire, sparks, ambient hush) is consistent. Diction occasionally inflates—"pyrotechnic dreams," "ethereal," "radiant defiance"—beyond what a weary wanderer's interiority would generate mid-task. The chants add rhythmic texture but repeat syntactic templates ("Twirl and burn," "Filter the gloom," "Spin the knot") without modulation under pressure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") cluster in the mosaic-discovery beat without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and maintains momentum through most beats, but paraphrase loops appear: "hopelessness clung like damp fog" restated as "hopelessness recoiled" without added pressure; "blooming fortress" recurs six times with synonym churn ("blooms pulsing," "blooms nodded," "fortress bloomed fiercer"). Template cadence runs in the chant lines and several "he [verb]" stems across adjacent sentences. Mixed metaphor: "Filter the gloom, reveal the gleam" pairs a physical verb with an abstract noun awkwardly. The final third carries these patterns into the closure sequence, disqualifying 9+ and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of fire-spinning as a discovery method and mosaic-as-blueprint offers a specific, non-obvious angle. The wandering fireworks designer avoiding passivity by actively decoding the fortress shows ingenuity. However, the emotional arc—isolated artist finds validation and vows to continue—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived friction. The villagers' instant wonder and the fortress's approving blooms distribute tidy satisfaction. Risk is present in the premise (spinning fire to decode light) but the execution avoids complication, reducing the felt stakes of the discovery.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's choices—circling the fortress, igniting the knot, spinning to filter light, building and launching the firework—create the central causal chain. He appears in the opening line, drives the discovery beat, and executes the climax. The final vow to replicate the design across the lands is stated rather than dramatized as a choice under pressure, slightly weakening closure participation. Present in setup, middle, and ending; his agency enables two key beats (discovery and launch).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The kerosene rag knot is introduced early as "prized possession," ignited to spin fire and filter the mosaic's light (discovery beat), extinguished and pocketed, then reignited for a final twirl after the launch (closure beat). Its specific properties (oil-soaked, coarse weave, kerosene scent) matter on the page. However, the final twirl is celebratory rather than causally necessary; the knot's involvement at closure is present but not decisive. Two distinct beats plus closure participation justify mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The note-in-mosaic is the story's pivot: Elias seeks it, the fire-spinning method reveals it, and the discovered blueprint dictates the firework design he then replicates. It shapes stakes (find the lost design) and tactics (filter ambient light to decode tiles). The mosaic design's cascading blooms directly inform the launched firework's motif, and the final vow to replicate the note across lands ties closure to the concept. Present in setup (whispered call), middle (revelation), and ending (replicated in sky and vow).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Chanting appears in four beats: opening walk, fortress perimeter, powder-mixing, and the final echo. The verses are thematically consistent ("defy the pull," "filter the gloom") but do not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. The chants could be removed and the causal chain (spin fire → reveal mosaic → build firework) would remain intact. They add atmospheric texture and signal Elias's playful defiance but function as character decoration rather than tactical necessity. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Filter" is the method's verb and the story's hinge: Elias filters ambient light through spinning flame to decode the mosaic, then filters the gloom with his firework to restore hope. The action is signaled early ("filter the gloom, reveal the gleam"), executed in the discovery beat (fire-spinning projects shifting patterns that align the tiles), and reprised thematically at closure (false stars filter back hope). The verb appears in chants and narration, charging the final image. Removing "filter" would require rewriting the discovery mechanism and thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Ambient awareness" is named three times and described as sensing "subtle currents," "vibrations humming in bones," and a "shift: a ripple in the air." It enables Elias to perceive the mosaic's hidden pattern without staring directly. However, the mechanics remain abstract; the text does not show what ambient awareness offers that direct observation would miss, nor does it constrain his attempt (no mention of failure if he stares too hard). The method is present in the discovery beat and final ripple, but its unique properties do not alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The blooming fortress anchors all action: Elias approaches it at dusk, circles its base, decodes its mosaic under firelight, and works by its ambient glow. The vines and luminous flowers provide light for his powder-mixing, and the fortress "blooms fiercer" at closure, claiming kinship with the launched firework. The setting's specific features (mosaic tiles, cascading vines, ancient stone) enable the discovery and charge the final image. Present in setup, middle, and ending; its properties shape the discovery beat and the closure tableau.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "hush of a night with no stars" appears in the title beat and is restated as "starless hush" and "eternal overcast skies." It establishes atmospheric pressure (hopelessness born from star-swallowing skies) and motivates Elias's mission. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions; hours blur without clock pressure, and no urgency constrains his powder-mixing or launch timing. The night functions as static backdrop rather than a countdown that alters tactics. Thematic presence without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The desire to defy hopelessness is stated in the opening paragraph, drives the fireworks craft across months, and frames the climax (false stars make "hopelessness recoil"). The motivation is consistent and visible in action (mixing powders, launching the rocket). However, the friction between the goal and its cost is absent; the launch succeeds without complication, and the ending distributes hope to villagers with no trade-off shown. The motivation shapes the choice to launch but does not dramatize internal conflict or a competing pull. Present in setup, middle, and ending; drives the main choice but lacks on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Serious playfulness" is embodied in the chants ("playful jab at the gravity of hopelessness"), the fire-spinning described as "hypnotic arcs," and narration that calls moves "deliberate" yet labels the knot's ignition "serious playfulness." Tone is coherent through the discovery and launch, modulating from weary determination to exuberant defiance. The phrase "false stars rained down, their hush-shattering crackle a symphony of serious playfulness" directly names the tone at climax, risking label-dependence. The tone charges the final image (Elias spinning his knot in mimicry of sky lights) without becoming static, but the overt naming slightly weakens its integration.</comment>
