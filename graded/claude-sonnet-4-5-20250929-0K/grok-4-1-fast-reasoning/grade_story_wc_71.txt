<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias exists as a concept vessel rather than a person under pressure. His motivation is declared ("burning need to understand") but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices that reveal cost. The "sanctification" ritual proceeds without friction, error, or genuine struggle—he simply performs actions that succeed, culminating in a community transformation that feels asserted rather than earned. No visible personality, blind spots, or trade-offs emerge; he operates as a benevolent mechanism dispensing shards of hush.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words—"creeping normality noticer" and bay context arrive, but no concrete spatial anchor or present-scene frame appears until the orris-root discovery, triggering a −0.4 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The piece unfolds as a summary of weeks of ritualized collecting and sanctifying with no single dramatized beat where a choice narrows options or changes knowledge. The ending claims community transformation and reversed "creeping normality," but this change occurs off-page through reported neighbor behavior; no on-page closure unit (DC/RR/CR) with felt cost is legible. Drive lens is ambiguous (accumulative pattern is hinted but never coheres into pressure or a reweighting moment), triggering the lens-ambiguity cap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bay, spring cherry blossoms, and streetlights daydreaming establish a lyric atmosphere, and the orris-root shard functions as a tactile anchor. However, the setting does not constrain Elias's choices—objects appear conveniently, the cottage ritual proceeds without spatial friction, and the bungalow garden yields the locket without obstacle. Sensory detail is vivid but ornamental, not purposefully integrated into pressure or the final image, capping the score below 7.0 despite strong textural work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"why some houses feel alive"—is declared but never tested through a meaningful tightening or reversal. Elias's method succeeds in every beat without complication, error, or trade-off; no live option is foreclosed, no cost paid on the page. The climactic sanctification of the locket "unveils" an insight via vision rather than forcing a choice, and the community revival is summary-reported. No protagonist agency or escalation under any lens; coincidence (finding objects) structures all forward motion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme—pauses and displaced objects hold vitality—emerges clearly but is articulated through direct narration ("This shard of hush was inadvertently profound, unveiling...") rather than earned through scene work. "Creeping normality" and "inadvertently profound" echo prompt language without fresh synthesis. The final image of neighbors leaving tokens and the bay reigniting is asserted, not demonstrated with concrete cost or counter-pressure, reducing resonance to a tidy moral about community connection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric register—"streetlights daydreamed," "hushed blaze"—that coheres across the piece. However, psychic distance is unstable: the narration claims knowledge of the entire bay's transformation and neighbors' internal states ("stirred by the noticer's quiet fervor") without clear POV grounding. Elias's internal voice lacks specificity; his perceptual signature does not modulate under the supposed pressure of discovery, reading as a generic observer rather than a distinct mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting and density issues pervade high-pressure beats: "profound stillness that tugged at his core," "pauses pregnant with possibility," and stacked metaphors ("yearning for reclamation," "thread weaving silence into form") in adjacent lines without payoff. Template cadence runs appear ("Placing... he drew... He whispered... As the essence mingled..."), and paraphrase loops recur ("alive homes," "houses live," "houses felt alive"). Figurative language clusters without clear pattern-teaching, and elevated diction ("sanctify," "hushed intensity") drifts from the POV's established lexicon. Applying cumulative artifact penalties (density, template stems, loops) totals approximately −1.4 in Q7, with an additional penalty for touching the closure beat, yielding a base near 4.9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—objects carry home vitality—reads as a familiar metaphor for domestic memory and connection. "Creeping normality noticer," "shard of hush," and "sanctify through displaced objects" feel constructed to fit prompt elements rather than arising organically. The transformation-test fails: swap "orris shard" for any ritual object and the emotional arc remains unchanged. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis; the ending's tidy community revival mirrors numerous prior stories about restoring lost connection through symbolic acts.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout but his "noticing" never creates a turn; he observes, collects, and performs rituals that succeed without complication. Missing middle development (no choice constrained by this trait) and closure participation (the ending reports neighbor actions, not his decision).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The orris shard appears early (setup), is used in multiple sanctification beats (development), and returns in the final paragraph as "warm in his palm" (closure). However, its specific properties (violet scent, root oils) do not constrain choices—any ritual object could substitute with minor edits. Two-gate participation with low irreplaceability caps the score near mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "shard of hush" materializes during rituals and is described as capturing quietude, but it does not shape on-page tactics or choices—Elias uses it to distribute meaning, not to solve a problem or face a cost. Present in setup and closure narration but not causally active in middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" is a label applied to the locket sanctification insight without on-page demonstration of unintended depth or cost. The trait does not constrain or enable a dramatized action; it functions as thematic summary rather than embodied attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Sanctify" is the method Elias uses across multiple beats, but each sanctification succeeds identically without escalation or variation. The action shapes structure but is easily swappable with "bless," "consecrate," or any ritual verb. Present in setup, development, and closure, but low specificity and no visible trade-off cap the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Through displaced objects" is signaled early (marble, teacup, ribbon) and guides the collection-and-sanctification method across beats. The mechanics (finding objects, applying orris shard, creating hush shards) structure the plot. However, the method does not face friction or force adaptation—objects appear conveniently and the process never fails—reducing causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The "quiet bay in spring" anchors the setting and recurs in the final line ("the bay whispered its eternal fire"), but the locale does not constrain choices or supply resources that alter outcome. Houses, gardens, and the cottage are interchangeable backdrops. Missing middle development; the bay functions as atmosphere, not tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydream" appears in the opening and twice more as lyric punctuation, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions. The narrative spans "weeks" in summary without a live clock that alters moves. Streetlights are ornamental, not a temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To understand why some houses feel alive" is declared early and frames the quest, but the motivation is never dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. Elias's desire drives the plot's direction but not its pressure—no moment where understanding competes with another need or exacts a visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" is woven throughout ("quiet fire," "hushed intensity," "shared silence," "whispered... eternal fire") and modulates subtly with the ritual beats. The tone coheres and charges the final image, but the single static register—reverent and muted—does not shift under the supposed escalation, capping the score in mid-4s despite consistent execution.</comment>
