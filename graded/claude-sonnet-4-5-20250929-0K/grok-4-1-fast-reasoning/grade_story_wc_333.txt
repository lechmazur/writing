<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The locksmith character remains largely external and archetypal—"neither tall nor imposing, yet his presence disoriented the air"—without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The woman's desperation is declared rather than embodied through specific sensory experience or micro-choices under pressure. Internal states are labeled ("improbable longing," "fear") instead of dramatized through embodied perception. The locksmith's final decision to work on his own lock feels unmotivated by prior on-page struggle; no visible cost forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague past 120 words: "shadowed nexus under starlight" and "across the hush of cosmic possibility" offer atmosphere but no concrete spatial or temporal anchor. The closure attempts Earned Stasis (locksmith remains at his post) but the cost is asserted in summary ("Improbable longing fulfilled, yet ever-renewing") rather than shown through a decisive on-page choice that narrows options. The accumulative/textural lens is signaled but the final dozen fragments dissolve into a list of theme statements without a legible reweighting image. Orientation Test penalty applied: −0.4; Q3 capped at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The nexus and starlight recur but remain abstract postcards—"paths from forgotten worlds converged," "cosmic possibility humming"—without constraining a choice or supplying a tactical resource. The anvil and ribbon are named but not handled in ways that alter options; spatial choreography is unclear (where does the woman stand relative to the locksmith, pillar, anvil?). No micro-setting detail (body, tool, small object) charges the final image or forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing the woman's idea—is declared but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The locksmith's work proceeds without obstacle; the ribbon dissolves in starlight and the woman laughs, a convenient resolution with no visible price paid on the page. The locksmith's own enveloped secret appears only in the final third as a second, unearned stake; no escalation links the two.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Theme is stated overtly and repeatedly: "enveloped secrets," "improbable longing," "ideas freed danced like fireflies." The final dozen lines are a thematic summary—"Secrets enveloped, then set free. Fear's trap broken, possibilities bloomed"—rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. No non-literal answer emerges; the piece tells its thesis instead of showing it through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice relies on elevated, abstract diction throughout—"the hush of cosmic possibility," "disorienting his own steadfast world"—that reads as ornament rather than character-particular perception. Dialogue carries little subtext; the woman's "This holds my truth" and the locksmith's "freedom demands disorientation first" sound like thesis statements. The final fragments abandon narrative stance for a list of conceptual claims without a stable focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "improbable longing" appears six times, "enveloped secrets" five, "shadowed nexus under starlight" three, "across the hush of cosmic possibility" four. Template cadence runs in the final section: "Longing improbable, yet achingly real. Across hush unending, locksmith's enigma endured. Starlight bore witness, hints forever given." Stock metaphors—"secrets spilling forth like nebulae," "ideas freed danced like fireflies"—appear in peak beats without fresh specificity. The final third is a sequence of summary fragments with no propulsion. Artifacts touch closure; baseline −1.2 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The premise—mystic locksmith frees metaphorical locks—is a familiar writing-prompt trope executed without transformation. The woman's lock of hair and the locksmith's ribbon are interchangeable symbolic objects with no specific properties that matter. The starlight hint and cosmic setting remain abstract; no lived detail grounds the world. The piece reads as a genre exercise rather than a singular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The locksmith is present throughout and performs the central action (heating the ribbon, unraveling it), but his choices do not create reversals; the woman's problem resolves without obstacle. He decides to work on his own lock in the final third, a late turn that does not alter prior tactics. Two gates (setup, development) met; closure participation is ornamental (he "began the work" but no outcome). Functional but replaceable; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The lock of hair appears early (setup), is placed on the anvil and heated (middle development), and dissolves in starlight at the woman's release. It returns as the locksmith's talisman in the final section. Three gates met, but the object's properties are generic; any personal item could replace it. Causal role in one major beat (the woman's release) and a reprise that reweights slightly. Mid-to-upper middle band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Enveloped secrets" is declared repeatedly as theme but does not shape on-page tactics. The woman's secret is told ("her abandoned dream of sailing uncharted skies"), not dramatized through a choice. The locksmith's secret appears late and is summarized. The concept echoes in exposition rather than constraining options or enabling action. Functional mention without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Unassumingly bold" is a label applied to the locksmith three times without visible tradeoff. No on-page action demonstrates the tension between modesty and daring; the trait does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic with cost. Ornamental descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Disorientation" recurs as a theme statement—"freedom demands disorientation first," "disorienting his own steadfast world"—but is not enacted. The woman experiences visions (childhood laughter, herself aloft), described in summary; no on-page action makes her disoriented in a way that alters her next move. The action is told rather than shown and does not drive a turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The first star at twilight "winks" and its position aligns with a rune; the locksmith weaves "seven knots mirroring its trail." The hint appears in the middle but its mechanics are opaque; the knots do not visibly enable or constrain the ribbon's dissolution. The woman later gives the locksmith a coin "etched with the first star," a late reprise without causal work. Present but its function is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The "shadowed nexus under starlight" is named in the opening and recurs as atmosphere. It does not supply a resource or obstacle; the locksmith's workshop hums with longing but no spatial detail alters a choice. The pillar etched with constellations is mentioned once when the woman steadies herself, a brief touch without consequence. Setting is postcard description.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Across the hush of cosmic possibility" recurs as a phrase but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. "Time stretched," "eons passing in heartbeats," and "time folding" are abstract claims without a clock that alters tactics. The timeframe is ornamental linguistic texture, not a constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation—"to free an idea trapped behind fear"—is declared by the woman and echoed by the locksmith. The woman's longing is told ("her improbable longing mirroring his own"), not dramatized through a choice with friction. The locksmith's parallel motivation appears late. Desire is stated but not tested by competing costs or wants. Functional mention without on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Improbable longing" is named six times and recurs in the final fragments, creating a static mood rather than modulating with pressure. The tone remains elevated and abstract throughout; no shift in cadence or density charges the final image. Consistent but does not intensify or reweight at closure.</comment>
