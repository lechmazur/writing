<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to read scars is stated but operates at an abstract level; the surgery's effect and her wound-probing remain largely metaphorical rather than embodied choices under pressure. The plants provide guidance but Elena's agency in the tunnel remains reactive—she follows rather than wrestles with contradictory impulses. The childhood accident backstory is introduced late and told rather than shown, weakening the earned quality of her closure moment. Interiority leans toward poetic declaration ("scar-thirst") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening lines and the lens reads as accumulative/textural—pressure builds through layered imagery (hourglass, ivy, coffee rings) toward a revelatory object. However, the tunnel action and the box discovery feel coincidentally placed rather than causally prepared; the letters resolve an external mystery (parents' concealment) rather than a tension Elena has wrestled with on the page. The closure offers resonant reconfiguration (scars as owned narrative), but the cost is more asserted ("wounds staunched—not closed, but read") than shown through a visible forfeiture or choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tower setting is anchored early with vivid details (ivy, stone walls, subterranean springs, floor stones) and the hourglass as object constrains her digging action—she uses its base to pry the stone. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elena's scar-seeking lens, and the impossible moonlight at dawn adds atmospheric charge to the discovery. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the tunnel sequence, and the frosted-then-thawing hourglass charges the final image by marking time's resumption.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to read scars for closure—is signaled early, but the escalation feels more thematic than tactical. The tunnel action narrows her path physically, yet the plants' guidance removes much of the decision weight; she follows their directions rather than making agonizing trade-offs. The coffee-ring divination and reopened surgical wound suggest cost, but the wound's consequences (pain, bleeding) don't visibly alter her tactics or force a renunciation. The letters provide emotional closure, but the discovery feels handed to her rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the hourglass, ivy, coffee rings—and resists overt moralizing until the final lines, which edge toward summary ("wounds birthed wisdom"). The scar-reading concept integrates with the plot through the tunnel and letters, and the displaced miracle (plant telepathy) offers a fresh angle on communion and knowledge. However, the ending's thematic statement ("she could read it now, every line a chapter owned") tells more than the image earns, and the phrase "miraculous dance" in the final line tilts toward abstraction rather than letting the thawed hourglass resonate without gloss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyric and densely metaphorical ("meteor hush," "verdant rustle," "scar-thirst"), creating a distinct texture, but the register remains consistently elevated even during physical action (tunneling, bleeding). POV is stable third-person limited with clean focalization on Elena. However, the prose occasionally slips into exposition that tells rather than inhabits her perception—"convinced that true endings hid in the raw edges of scars" reads like summary rather than thought-in-motion. The plants' telepathic voices are differentiated by italics and verdant diction, but Elena's internal voice doesn't modulate meaningfully under the physical stress of digging.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistically dense, but several lines carry figurative overload without clear payoff: "meteor hush, a silent vastness pressing against the stone walls like cosmic dust settling after a star's quiet death" stacks three metaphors in one breath. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions—"The air hung... She was... Her deepest motivation burned... The surgery below had promised"—that flatten propulsion. Paraphrase loops surface: "closure lay buried" is restated as "dig, reopen the fresh surgical wound if needed, for closure lay buried" within two lines. The coffee-ring method is introduced but its mechanics (how rings map to action) remain vague, reducing information density at a key turn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The displaced miracle (telepathy with plants instead of humans) and the coffee-ring divination offer fresh angles, and the synthesis of scar-reading, surgery fallout, and plant communion feels specific rather than template-driven. However, the emotional arc—seeking closure through painful excavation—follows a familiar contour, and the letter-box revelation (hidden parental guilt) is a stock closure device. The frosted hourglass and ivy voices create memorable images, but the final turn (ownership of scars as narrative) resolves into a tidy epiphany without the ambiguity or moral calculus that would elevate originality into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena as closure seeker is present throughout and her choice to tunnel is on-page, but the decision feels prompted by external voices (plants, coffee rings) rather than driven by internal contradiction. She opens the surgical wound, which aligns with her trait, but the action is narrated in summary ("the reopened surgical wound seeping red") rather than dramatized as a choice with visible hesitation or cost in the moment. Present in setup, middle action, and closure, but her agency is more reactive than decisive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frosted hourglass appears in the opening beat, is handled (she reaches for it, it warms, sands thaw), used as a tool (pries the floor stone), and returns in the final image (fully thawed, she turns it). Its state changes across three distinct beats and the thawing tracks Elena's progress, charging the closure image. Removing it would weaken the time motif and eliminate the tool that enables her physical action, making it essential across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Displaced miracle (telepathy accidentally wired to plants) is explained in exposition and provides the mechanism for guidance during the tunnel, shaping one key turn (the plants direct her path). However, the concept could be replaced with a dream, intuition, or memory without major structural loss; the miracle label does thematic work but doesn't constrain Elena's choices with unique cost or friction. Present in setup and middle, minimal closure participation beyond a brief callback ("miracle relocated").</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plant telepathy is introduced early, enables the middle action (plants guide her left, sustain her), and is acknowledged at closure ("telepathy fading"). It constrains her tactics (she must follow verdant directions) and the surgery fallout provides causal grounding. However, the telepathy's cost—what she loses by hearing plants instead of humans—is never shown on the page, and the trait could be condensed to any form of guidance (notes, map, instinct) with moderate edits. Functional across all three gates but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tunneling is the central action from midpoint to climax; Elena pries the stone, digs through earth, follows plant directions, and the physical act (bleeding, sweating, hours passing) drives the escalation. The chamber discovery and letter revelation both require the tunnel, and removing it collapses the plot. Present in middle and closure with clear causal pressure, though the decision to tunnel feels prompted rather than agonized over, keeping it just below the indispensable threshold.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Coffee-ring examination appears once in a single beat, confirms the plants' advice, and is tied to Elena's established practice ("a method honed over years"). The rings' pattern (outermost curve like her scar, inner spirals) shapes her resolve to dig, influencing one key choice. However, the method's mechanics remain vague—how evaporation maps to tactics is asserted, not shown—and it could be replaced with any symbolic confirmation (tarot, dream, reflection) without deep structural loss. Present in setup and development; minimal closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The quiet tower at dawn is anchored immediately and provides spatial resources (floor stone, ivy, subterranean springs) that enable the tunnel and plant telepathy. The setting's isolation supports the tone and the dawn-to-brightening time arc tracks her progress. The tower's stone and earth constrain her physical action, and the impossible moonlight in the underground chamber charges the discovery moment. Present across all three gates with moderate causal pressure, though a different isolated space could substitute with adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The anesthesia timeframe is signaled in the opening line and situates Elena in a liminal, vulnerable state that justifies the disorientation and surgical wound. However, time pressure is minimal—"hours blurred" and "dawn's lingering pallor" suggest passage without urgency, and no ticking clock forces her choices. The waking-from-surgery moment primes the plant telepathy (surgery fallout), but the timeframe itself doesn't tighten decisions. Present in setup, weak development, modest closure participation (dawn brightens).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation to read scar stories is stated early, drives her decision to tunnel (seeking narrative closure), and is fulfilled at the ending ("she could read it now"). However, the desire is told more than dramatized—her actions follow external prompts (plants, coffee rings) rather than wrestling with the cost of probing wounds. The childhood accident backstory arrives late and in summary, weakening the motivation's grounding. Friction between want and cost is asserted (reopening wounds) but not embodied in a choice that visibly forecloses another path. Present across all gates but not deeply conflicted on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Meteor hush is introduced in the second line, recurs in description ("hush unbroken," "meteor hush amplifying each grain's whisper"), and modulates subtly—the hush supports the quiet, interior intensity during the tunnel and then "brightens" with the dawn at closure, suggesting release. The tone coheres through turns and charges the final image (quiet persistence). However, the phrase "meteor hush" functions more as atmospheric label than as a tone that actively shapes Elena's perceptual signature or narrows her choices; it decorates rather than constrains. Present in setup, development, and closure, but not indispensable.</comment>
