<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior life relies heavily on abstract labels ("warmly curious," "cautious enchantment") rather than embodied contradiction. The motivation to restore faith is declared but never tested through a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost—she excavates, finds artifacts, rebuilds the sundial without meaningful resistance or trade-off. The final paragraph asserts transformation ("faith, once lost, stood solid") but the text never dramatizes what she renounces or what specific impulse she overcomes. Memory fragments appear but do not tilt present stance through micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: Who/where/when anchor by ~120 words (satisfied). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (orchard imagery, layered excavation, gradual faith restoration through artifact discovery). However, closure lacks visible cost: the sundial is rebuilt, faith is "kindled anew," but no option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The ending delivers thematic echo ("testament to purposeful wandering's quiet power") instead of a Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. Causality is linear (arrival → dig → discovery → rebuild → resolution) but escalation is absent; each artifact deepens theme without narrowing options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered with concrete detail (apple blossoms on bones, roots snaking through ribcages, mossy vines on the mound). Setting details are filtered through Elara's perception and support the tone. The sundial base and tomb constrain her rebuilding project across multiple beats. However, the environment never forces a difficult choice or alters tactics under pressure; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active constraint at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore lost faith) is signaled early but never tightened or tested. Elara excavates for fourteen days without obstacle, doubt, or competing pressure. Each discovery (satchel, staff, sundial base) adds thematic resonance but does not narrow options or raise cost. The final rebuilding is achieved through methodical assembly with no reversal, trade-off, or visible price. Agency is present (she decides to rebuild) but the decision costs nothing and forecloses no path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (interrupted journeys, diaspora return, faith restoration) emerges through concrete imagery (pilgrim artifacts, roots cradling the sundial). The orchard's dual life-and-death harmony supports the central question without overt thesis statements. However, the ending resolves theme through assertion ("faith, once lost, stood solid") rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. The sundial's shadow pointing toward the sacred mountain is a strong particular, but the closure paragraph retreats into abstract summary ("badges of restoration," "quiet power") instead of holding the image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a consistent perceptual signature (archival attention to artifact detail, reverent tone). Diction remains within Elara's reflective register throughout. However, emotional peaks are narrated through label clusters ("warmly curious," "cautious enchantment," "wary wonder") rather than embodied sensation or contradictory impulse. The voice lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; sentence cadence remains uniform across excavation and closure. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and templated phrasing recur: "warmly curious" appears three times as a standalone beat intro; "interrupted journey" cycles through synonyms (interrupted paths, interrupted journeys, journeys interrupted); "cautious enchantment" is repeated identically in three separate beats. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to sigh," "felt the orchard's pulse") dull immediacy in the final section. Scaffold phrases ("Through purposeful wandering," "Back at the tomb, across final days") signal seams. Information density is moderate; many sentences do double work (setting + interiority) but the repeated phrase stems reduce propulsion. The artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the disallow-9+ rule globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard premise (tree roots entwined with bones, pilgrims' interrupted paths literalized as excavation) offers a fresh visual synthesis. Elara's diaspora return and faith restoration arc follows a recognizable template (exile → wandering → homecoming → spiritual renewal) without transformation through non-obvious moral calculus or lived friction. The sundial rebuild is purposeful but predictable; no turn feels inevitable-in-hindsight surprise. The story commits to its premise but plays the premise straight without risk or subversion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara (diaspora returnee) is present throughout and her return frames the story. She makes the decision to excavate and rebuild, but these choices are uncontested and do not alter tactics or foreclose paths. Her returnee status is established early (setup ✓) and colors her reverence for the site (development weak), but at closure she simply executes her plan without complication. Swappable with "outsider seeking connection."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sundial base appears at the midpoint (day ten), is excavated and examined across several beats (middle ✓), and is rebuilt in the final section (closure ✓). Its inscriptions ("Mark thy path ere it breaks") and gnomon slot provide concrete detail, and its restoration is the story's culminating action. However, the base does not constrain a difficult choice or impose cost; Elara gathers replacement parts without obstacle. Strong presence, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Interrupted journeys (core concept) is signaled in paragraph four ("her own journey had been interrupted"), recurs in artifact descriptions (pilgrim satchel, snapped staff, "journeys cut short"), and is mirrored in Elara's arc ("exile ended, faith kindled anew"). The concept shapes thematic stakes and ties the excavation discoveries to her personal motive. It does not, however, force a tactical choice or trade-off on the page; it remains thematic scaffolding rather than plot constraint. Setup ✓, development (thematic), payoff (thematic).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" appears three times as a standalone paragraph opener with no action consequence. Elara is described as curious when tracing a root, piecing together the pilgrim's story, and testing the sundial at noon—all observational beats. The trait is never pitted against caution or cost; it does not enable a risky choice or constrain behavior. Label-only, ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rebuild (action) is signaled as resolution midway ("resolved to rebuild the sundial"), pursued through scavenging and assembly across the final third, and completed at closure ("the sundial stood rebuilt"). The rebuilding is Elara's primary plot action and her means of restoring faith. However, the rebuild is uncontested and does not generate a reversal or narrow options; she gathers parts, fits them, and succeeds. Essential to plot arc but lacks friction or cost. Setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Purposeful wandering" is named twice in the text ("Purposeful wandering drew her deeper," "testament to purposeful wandering's quiet power") but its mechanics are vague. Elara wanders to find the tomb and later scours the orchard for replacement parts; the method is present but not differentiated from ordinary searching. It shapes the middle beat (scavenging for stones and root-gnomon) but does not impose constraint or cost. Setup (weak), development ✓, payoff (thematic mention only).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is established in the opening line, provides vivid sensory anchors throughout (bones protruding, roots snaking, mossy vines), and supplies the raw materials for Elara's rebuild (root for gnomon, stones for markers). Roots tug at her ankles "like spectral warnings" and the orchard "approves" the final sundial placement, creating embodied presence. The setting does not force a difficult spatial or tactical choice at closure, but it constrains and enables the rebuild action across multiple beats. Setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The excavation spans fourteen days with explicit markers (third day, tenth day, fourteenth sunset). Time structures the plot and creates a rhythm of discovery. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose urgency; each day brings steady progress without deadline pressure or tactical adjustment. Time is tracked but does not escalate stakes or alter Elara's approach. Setup ✓, development (structural), payoff ✓.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The motivation to restore lost faith is declared early ("she yearned to restore that lost faith"), recurs in memory fragments (childhood chants, shattered pilgrim rites), and is satisfied at closure ("faith, once lost, stood solid"). The desire drives Elara's decision to excavate and rebuild. However, the motive is never tested through conflicting wants or costs; faith restoration proceeds without friction, doubt, or trade-off. Told more than dramatized. Setup ✓, development (asserted), payoff (asserted).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Cautious enchantment" is named identically three times and modulates weakly across the arc (initial encounter, mid-dig thrill, final approval). The tone is coherent and supports the orchard's liminality, but it does not shift under pressure or charge the final image with fresh intensity. The closing lines retreat into abstraction ("enchanted yet ever cautious") rather than letting image hold tone. Setup ✓, development ✓, payoff (label repeated, image weak).</comment>
