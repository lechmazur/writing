<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation ("warmly inquisitive," "affectionate detachment") is labeled rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. The diary revelation that she is Elowen's child arrives as pure surprise without prior micro-choices testing her curiosity against risk. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("her heart ached fondly") and the final resolve ("tender resolve") is declared, not earned by on-page struggle. The ending choice to "claim the heights" lacks visible cost or foreclosed options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after ~150 words of ornate setup, and the promotion backstory ("ascending servant") remains vague. The drive lens reads Causal (diary unlock → identity reveal → decision to claim inheritance), but the final image ("ready to claim the heights") asserts closure without showing a decisive change in tactics or options. Cost is conceptual (Elowen's legacy accepted) but not dramatized; the final beat tells us she has "tender resolve" rather than showing a trade-off or forfeited path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire, glass elevator, and fractal-lens goggles anchor setting vividly, and the scattered light mechanism is purposeful. However, spatial choreography inside the elevator is minimal—no body or tool constrains Lira's choices. The setting pressures atmosphere more than action; the goggles enable discovery but do not force a tactical dilemma. Floor-by-floor markers track time but remain decorative rather than tightening options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Lira's search for "joy beneath anguish"—is declared in interiority but never tested by a competing want or obstacle. The diary unfolds passively; Lira does not wrestle with whether to read, stop, or act on what she learns. The tenth-floor arrival coincides with the final revelation, but no reversal or tightening narrows her options beforehand. The ending "ready to claim the heights" is asserted without visible price or trade-off; agency remains unopposed throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme "joy beneath anguish" is stated repeatedly in interiority and matched by diary content, but it never emerges through scene pressure—Lira simply receives confirmation. The goggles and scattered light function as motifs but are introduced to serve the plot rather than accumulating meaning. The final image ("captain's blood in her veins") restates the reveal without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer. No thematic tension or counter-reading exists.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited, and the perceptual signature ("warm inquisitiveness," focus on joy/anguish) is consistent. However, diction drifts into overwritten registers ("affectionate detachment," "phantom love," "captain's blood in her veins") that exceed Lira's scullery-to-servant lexicon. Filter verbs and summary predominate over immediate perception. No dialogue appears. The mid-story self-correction artifact ("Wait, too many—trimming in mind…") and word-count commentary break narrative immersion and signal scaffolding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Severe line-level issues: the metafictional aside ("Wait, too many—trimming in mind…[599—error, recount: full tally 712 now adjusted.]") is scaffolding left on the page and destroys immersion. Paraphrase loops abound: "anguish spilled forth" / "more torment unfolded" / "anguish dominated still" / "anguish peaked." Stock metaphors cluster: "iron-willed," "joy snatched from duty's jaws," "frozen dagger," "captive auroras." Figurative density in the opening paragraph (icebound spire, frozen dagger, glass-walled, frost-laced, ice-veined, prismatic, captive auroras) overloads without pattern-teaching. Template cadence: "Third floor: anguish… Fourth floor: more torment… Fifth floor: Lira deciphered… Sixth floor: Lira smiled… Seventh floor: the diary's core…" —seven consecutive structural parallels without variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise (encrypted diary decoded by light-refracting goggles during a timed ascent) offers a fresh constraint, but the emotional arc (orphan discovers noble parentage) is a stock template without transformation. The metafictional word-count commentary and self-correction undercut any authorial vision. The ending asserts legacy acceptance without a non-obvious synthesis or earned cost. No bold perspectival or structural risk heightens stakes; the piece retreats into convenient revelation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira (ascending servant) is present throughout but makes no contested choice. She opens the case, dons the goggles, reads the diary, and accepts the revelation—all passive reception. The final "tender resolve" is declared, not shown. Setup and middle presence qualify for mid-band, but no causal pressure or closure-shaping decision elevates the score. Swappable with any passive protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The goggles appear in setup (mentioned in first third), are donned at the second floor, and enable the diary decryption through fractal-lens light diffraction. They return in the final image ("goggles perched atop her head"). However, the goggles do not constrain a choice—they simply unlock information. Their mechanical function is explained but never tested or traded off. Two-beat involvement and closure cameo reach mid-6s, but lack of causal pressure or irreplaceability caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Encrypted diary discovery frames the entire middle sequence and drives the revelation that Lira is Elowen's daughter. Setup (case opened, diary noticed), development (decryption floor by floor), and payoff (identity confirmed at tenth floor) all present. However, the discovery is passive—Lira faces no dilemma about whether to read or how to use the knowledge. The encryption mechanism (light through goggles) is clever but does not shape tactics. One major beat (revelation) plus closure linkage, but no agency or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Warmly inquisitive" is labeled in the opening and restated ("warm inquisitiveness blooming" at sixth floor) but never constrains an on-page choice. No moment shows Lira's curiosity costing her caution, time, or safety. The trait exists only as narrative assertion. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unfold" (the action) is literal (diary pages, encryption via scattered light) and metaphorical (truth revealed floor by floor). The unfolding mechanism drives the middle beats and enables the climactic reveal. However, the action is passive observation rather than protagonist-driven effort—the light does the work. Setup, development, and payoff present, and causally necessary, but no choice or trade-off tied to the act of unfolding. Essential to plot structure but replaceable with any reveal mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through scattered light" (the method) is signaled early ("scattered light filtering through the elevator's ice-veined glass") and explained in the fifth-floor beat ("fractal patterns… diffracted the light into keys"). The method enables the decryption across multiple floors. However, it does not shape Lira's tactics or impose cost—she simply benefits from the coincidence of light and lens. Mechanics matter, but the method is convenient rather than constraining. Setup, development, payoff present; causal role in one beat (decryption); no choice friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The icebound spire and glass elevator frame the entire ascent and supply the scattered light mechanism. Setting is vivid and purposeful, but does not constrain Lira's choices—she is a passive passenger. The ten-floor climb provides temporal structure but no tactical dilemma. Micro-setting (elevator interior, goggles, diary) is present but ornamental. Setup, development, and payoff present; setting enables the plot but does not pressure decisions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The ten-floor elevator climb provides a clear temporal frame, with floors explicitly marked from first to tenth. Time tightens the pacing and structures the revelation in discrete beats. However, the timeframe does not impose a tactical cost—Lira has no competing urgency, and the ascent is uninterrupted. The clock is visible and shapes the narrative rhythm, but does not alter Lira's moves. Setup, development, payoff present; one structural role (pacing); no decision friction.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To seek out the joy beneath anguish" (motivation) is stated in the third paragraph and restated at the sixth and ninth floors. The diary content (Elowen's anguish and hidden joy) mirrors the motivation, but Lira never wrestles with whether to pursue painful truths or protect herself. The motivation is told, not tested. Setup and thematic echo present; no on-page choice or cost tied to the desire. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" (tone) is declared in the opening and closing but not modulated under pressure. The narrator maintains a static, elevated register ("tender resolve," "phantom love," "captain's blood") regardless of emotional intensity. No tonal shift reflects Lira's mounting discovery or final acceptance. Present as assertion, but does not charge the final image or evolve with stakes. Ornamental.</comment>
