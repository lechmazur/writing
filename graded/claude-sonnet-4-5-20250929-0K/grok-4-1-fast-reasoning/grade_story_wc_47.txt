<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated ("to graft new meaning onto them") but the character functions more as a vessel for thematic language than as a mind under contradictory pressure. The exchange with Kai lacks internal conflict—she proffers the pendant without visible hesitation, foreclosing no competing impulse. Micro-choices that would reveal hierarchy of values are absent; the action reads as preordained by the thematic design rather than earned through on-page struggle. Interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("watchful dreamer," "protected vulnerability") rather than embodied, character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens: the moss garden and amber pendant recur, aiming for Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. However, the icicle pattern/"Seek the amber glow" summons arrives with no prior setup or cost, reading as a convenience that moves the plot rather than a tactic shaped by prior pressure. The pendant exchange lands as Charged Poise, but the cost is asserted ("viral storm outside faded") rather than felt through a forfeited option or visible consequence. Orientation is established early (data center, post-confession), satisfying the test. The closure image reconfigures the viral/private dynamic, but the reconfiguration lacks causal grounding in Elara's prior choices—Kai's arrival and acceptance feel inevitable rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The moss garden setting is vivid and consistently rendered (rusted racks, cracked skylights, ferns on mainframes), and the amber pendant functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final exchange. The drip pattern and icicles provide spatial texture, though they serve plot convenience more than constraining choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's contemplative stance. The setting does not visibly narrow or open tactical options during the confrontation; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure, capping the score below the 7.0 threshold despite strong descriptive work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming public confession into private connection—is signaled early and held, but escalation is thin. Kai's arrival is frictionless; no complication tests Elara's resolve or forces a trade-off. The pendant transfer is offered without visible competing need (e.g., its personal value, risk of rejection, alternate use). The viral context is mentioned but exerts no on-page pressure; no countdown, no intrusion, no tactical adjustment. The "quiet proaction" trait means Elara faces no obstacle that her watchfulness or patience must overcome. One tightening occurs (the summons → the meeting), but the sequence lacks a moment where options narrow or a live alternative is foreclosed with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme—healing through connection, public-to-private transformation—is stated overtly ("to graft new meaning," "viral chaos into intimate renewal") rather than emerging from particulars. The amber pendant and moss-on-silicon motif are deployed as symbolic tokens without accumulating enough pressure or reweighting prior material in a fresh way. The final lines ("honeyed hush deepened, guarding their vulnerability forever") assert thematic closure instead of offering a resonant, non-literal image. The piece prioritizes thematic vocabulary ("protected vulnerability," "quietly proactive") over the dramatic specifics that would let theme arise organically. Subtext in gesture and silence is minimal; much is announced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara, but the narrative distance is uniformly elevated and abstract. Perceptual signature is generic—phrases like "watchful dreamer," "honeyed hush," and "protected vulnerability" recur as thematic labels rather than character-specific idiom. Dialogue is sparse and functional; Kai's lines ("It called to me, like code from a forgotten drive," "your words gave mine a shape I couldn't alone") mirror Elara's register, reducing voice distinction. The prose often filters action through metaphor rather than immediate perception, diluting urgency. No head-hopping, but the narrative stance remains static across emotional beats rather than modulating with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: nearly every sentence carries figurative language ("moss spores danced faintly in the light," "icicles dripping final notes to their silent pact," "honeyed hush amplifying her voice like a secret shared in honey"), obscuring momentum and creating a lyric gloss that stalls action. Paraphrase loops appear ("protected vulnerability," "vulnerability armored in the garden's embrace, where vulnerability could breathe"). Template stems recur ("Elara's watchful…," "quietly proactive," "honeyed hush"). The final third ("viral storm outside faded," "no more old wounds untreated; new meanings grafted") stacks summary and theme statements instead of propelling the ending through image and action. Stock metaphors ("moss claiming silicon bones," "bridges built from shared fractures") accumulate without fresh precision. Register drift into abstraction ("to graft new meaning onto them") clashes with embodied urgency. Combined artifacts trigger −1.4 within Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact-penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The core premise—viral confession healing in an abandoned tech-garden—offers a conceptual hook, but the execution leans on familiar template beats: public pain, private sanctuary, symbolic object exchange, tidy mutual healing. The moss-on-servers image is the freshest element, yet it functions as backdrop rather than driving transformation. The icicle summons and amber pendant feel convenience-deployed rather than inevitable. Emotional specificity is thin; the arc could transfer to other settings and stakes with minimal adjustment, failing the transformation test. The piece commits to its lyric register but does not take structural or perspectival risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is labeled "watchful dreamer" multiple times but her observation does not create key turns. She etches the icicle pattern before dawn (told, not shown), waits, and proffers the pendant—sequential actions that feel preordained rather than choice-driven. The "watchful" trait does not constrain a decision or enable a tactic under pressure; it remains ornamental. Present in setup and ending, but middle development lacks a moment where her observation alters her approach. Caps at mid-band for two-gate presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The amber pendant appears in setup (Elara touches it, explains its history), middle (she unclasps it), and ending (Kai accepts it, bridging the final image). It enables the proffering action and charges the closure image. However, its properties are generic (warmth, grandmother's resilience); swapping for another heirloom would require minimal edits. The pendant's meaning is told rather than dramatized through Elara's struggle to part with it. Present across three beats with closure linkage, but lacks irreplaceability and visible cost tied specifically to its amber/sunlight nature.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Honeyed hush" appears as repeated descriptor (opening, middle, ending) but does not shape stakes or tactics. It colors the atmosphere without constraining Elara's choices or altering the confrontation's outcome. Present as thematic echo but not as concept-that-changes-options. Functional as tone-marker but swappable with "sacred silence" or "sheltered quiet." Late-setup (emerges gradually), minimal middle pressure, and ornamental closure mention place it in the replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Quietly proactive" is stated twice and exemplified by the icicle summons, but the trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. Elara's quietness faces no obstacle that her proactivity must overcome; the method works without friction. The trait is a label rather than a source of tactical tradeoff (e.g., missing a faster, louder option). Present in setup and ending description, but middle development lacks a beat where the attribute visibly shapes a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The proffering action is the climactic beat and drives the closure image. Elara extends the pendant, Kai accepts, and the exchange reweights their relationship from parallel isolation to connection. However, the action is not prepared by competing impulses; Elara does not weigh alternate uses or wrestle with the cost of parting with her grandmother's relic. The proffer is signaled, executed, and pays off, satisfying all three gates, but the ease of the action reduces its causal weight. Essential across beats and ending, yet lacks the friction that would make it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The icicle-drip pattern is introduced mid-scene ("that morning"), serves as the summons mechanism, and reappears at closure ("icicles dripping final notes"). Its mechanics are vague—"Elara's own method, etched before dawn"—implying she shaped the pattern, but how ice drips spell "Seek the amber glow" is not explained. The method enables the meeting but could be swapped for a digital message or physical note with similar effect. Present in middle and ending, missing deliberate setup, and the specificity of drip-patterns versus other summons methods is not leveraged. Caps for swappability and summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The data-center-turned-garden is vividly described and present throughout, framing every beat. It provides the "honeyed hush" insulation from the viral storm and serves as thematic backdrop (tech decay, organic renewal). However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices or supply a resource that alters the outcome—she could proffer the pendant in any quiet sanctuary. The moss and servers enrich atmosphere but do not pressure tactics. Strong setup and ending presence, but middle beats lack moments where the space narrows options or enables a specific move.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"After the confession goes viral" anchors the premise and is mentioned in opening and middle ("viral storm outside"), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions. No countdown, no threat of intrusion, no tactical adjustment driven by the public scrutiny. The "after" frame is static rather than dynamic. The element is present but ornamental, failing to shape the pacing or stakes of the confrontation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to graft new meaning onto old wounds" is stated early and repeated at closure ("new meanings grafted, thriving"). It frames Elara's goal and the pendant exchange enacts it. However, the motivation is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—Elara does not wrestle with the risk of rejection, the pendant's personal value, or an alternate path. Told and enacted, but friction between want and cost is absent. Present in setup, middle (implicit in the proffer decision), and ending, satisfying gates but lacking the on-page struggle that would push the score higher.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is named repeatedly and the tone is coherent—contemplative, intimate, guarded-yet-open. The tone modulates slightly from solitary watchfulness (opening) to shared intimacy (ending), supporting the closure image. However, the tone remains static across beats rather than sharpening under pressure; the confrontation lacks escalation that would test the "protected" armor. Present and purposeful, shaping the reader's experience, but does not charge the final image with new intensity or break its own pattern. Solid thematic integration without the tonal turn that would reach higher bands.</comment>
