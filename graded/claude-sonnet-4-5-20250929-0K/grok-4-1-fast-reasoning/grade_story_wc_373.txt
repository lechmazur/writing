<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is established early and drives her three attempts, though her internal contradiction—"curiously steadfast" resolve versus "fraying nerves"—reads more as descriptive label than dramatized tension. The micro-choices (approaching Thorne, murmuring to the runner, flashing the fob) show goal pursuit, but the emotional progression feels somewhat mechanical across the false starts. The final choice to expose Thorne publicly is earned by prior causality, though the cost (emotional aftermath, what she's forfeited socially) remains understated. Body and emotion are present but lean toward stock pirate-market clichés rather than character-particular embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Lila's three attempts fail, forcing escalation to public exposure; the truce breaks, deal thwarted, and she escapes with her recording. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure—trust shattered, recording captured, Lila vanished—delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost (the market's truce "forever scarred," her own lingering unease), though the emotional and relational price for Lila herself could be sharper on the page. One meaningful tightening (from covert sabotage to public accusation) is sufficient for this length, and the because/therefore linkage remains legible throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rotting pier, swaying lanterns, and dripping timbers anchor the pirate market vividly in the opening, and the setting provides social constraint (the truce, the need to scatter by sunrise). Sensory detail is atmospheric but leans generic ("salt, fish guts, tang of illicit brews") rather than character-filtered or action-integrated. The fob and wax cylinder function as micro-objects that charge the final image, but the pier itself doesn't constrain a middle choice—Lila could attempt her sabotage in any crowded illegal venue. Spatial choreography (stalls, piling, dice game) is coherent, and the sunrise deadline is tracked, yet the setting feels more like backdrop than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thwart the deal to capture the sound of trust breaking) is signaled early and pursued through three escalating attempts. Each false start narrows options under causal pressure: Thorne laughs off the first, the runner shrugs at the second, the lookout accepts Thorne's tale at the third, forcing Lila to public exposure. The final reversal—Thorne's token revealed, the runner draws steel—is driven by protagonist agency and breaks the truce with visible cost (chaos, market scattered, deal thwarted). The price paid (her own safety, the market's future distrust) is legible on the page, though the emotional cost for Lila herself could be more visceral. One meaningful tightening (covert to overt) fits this length and the causal lens holds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of trust's fragility emerges through the truce of hush, the fob as token of betrayal, and Lila's quest to "bottle" the sound of trust breaking. The final image—playing back the recording, "trust's demise echoing like her pa's last breath"—reweights prior material without overt moralizing. Yet "comforting unease" and "curiously steadfast" are repeated labels rather than dramatized contradictions, and the closing reflection ("shadows always reformed") edges toward thematic echo. The piece invites reflection on cycles of betrayal and the limits of revenge, but the conceptual repricing feels more stated than embodied. Subtext operates in the market's hush and Lila's hidden cylinder, though the final wisdom trends toward platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and focalization remains anchored to Lila throughout. However, certain phrases—"curiously steadfast," "comforting unease"—recur as narratorial labels rather than emerging from Lila's perceptual signature, creating slight distance drift. Dialogue (Thorne's leer, the runner's accusation) is sparse but functional, carrying goal pursuit and subtext. Diction largely fits the setting, though occasional elevated turns ("truce of hush demanded all scatter") feel more authorial than character-filtered. Psychic distance is consistent, and the narrative voice has rhythmic texture, but the repeated descriptors and stock pirate-market idiom prevent a fully distinct perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across beats, and information density is generally high, but several patterns recur: "curiously steadfast" appears three times, "comforting unease" twice, and "truce of hush" is restated in multiple forms across paragraphs. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines ("the market pulsed with life" / "Lila circled back"; "Hours waned; the sea whispered warnings as the first pink streak teased the horizon" / "By sunrise, Lila vanished into the dunes"). Stock pirate-market descriptors ("tattooed vendors," "cursed compasses," "Jolly Rogers") cluster without fresh specificity. Grammar and syntax are clean, and the opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively, but the template cadence and synonym churn in the middle third dull momentum. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and label recurrence combined.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The premise—moonshine runner's daughter sabotaging a pirate deal to record trust breaking—offers a fresh synthesis of revenge plot and sound-collection MacGuffin. The wax cylinder as recording device and the "false starts" structure provide specific twists. However, the pirate market under a rotting pier, the antique fob as betrayal token, and the sunrise deadline are familiar genre elements executed competently but not transformed. The emotional arc (revenge to ambiguous closure) and the thematic question (can trust ever be rebuilt?) feel earnest but not surprising. The transformation test suggests the plot and arc could function in other betrayal/revenge settings without major change. Risk-taking is present in the sound-collection conceit, yet the execution stays within safe bounds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lila's choices create all three false starts and the final public exposure; her agency drives every key turn. She is present and decision-active from the opening through closure, and the cost (her safety, the market's trust) is tied to her actions. Removing her exact role would break the story's causality and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The fob is introduced early (first paragraph), handled in beats (flashed at the lookout, dangled at the parley), and shapes the climax when Lila cries out its provenance. It returns with reweighted meaning at the end ("Lila pocketed the fob anew"). However, the fob's unique properties (gold chain, antique status) matter less than its symbolic link to betrayal; a different token could serve similar narrative work with minor edits. It is essential but not fully irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The truce of hush frames the market's operating logic (silence about each other's sins, scatter by sunrise) and constrains Lila's tactics—she must break it to thwart the deal. It appears in the opening, middle reflection, and climax ("truce of hush in tatters"), shaping stakes and the final outcome. The concept is causal rather than merely thematic, and removing it would require substantial restructuring. It is essential across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast" is repeated three times as a descriptive label but never constrains an on-page action or creates visible cost. Lila's persistence is shown through her three attempts, but the attribute itself functions as thematic echo rather than trait-driven tradeoff. It is present but ornamental, not integrated into choice or escalation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lila's goal to thwart the deal drives all major turns: three failed attempts and the final successful public accusation that scatters the market and breaks the truce. The action is specific, repeated, and causal—removing it would eliminate the story's central conflict and closure. It is indispensable to structure and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The false-starts method is signaled early ("Tonight's big deal… Lila aimed to thwart it… through false starts if need be") and then dramatized across three distinct attempts, each failing and forcing escalation. The method shapes her tactics and the story's rhythm. "False start one," "False start two," and "another stumble" are explicitly tagged, teaching the pattern. Removing this exact method would require a different escalation structure. It is essential to the narrative arc.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is anchored early, provides social constraint (the truce, the need to scatter by sunrise), and supplies micro-setting (the piling Lila climbs for the final accusation). However, the setting's unique properties (rotting timbers, swaying lanterns, dripping beams) function more as atmosphere than as resources that alter tactics. The market could be replaced by another illicit gathering space without breaking core causality. It is purposeful and present across beats but not fully irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sunrise deadline is established early ("until sunrise, when the truce of hush demanded all scatter") and tracked through "Hours waned," "the first pink streak teased the horizon," and "By sunrise, Lila vanished." It tightens pressure by limiting Lila's window and forcing her final gambit. However, the clock is not tight enough to alter micro-tactics within beats—she attempts three moves without visible time-cost trade-offs. The timeframe is functional and present at closure but not indispensable to moment-by-moment choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lila's desire to "capture the sound of trust breaking" is introduced early, dramatized through her hidden wax cylinder, and paid off when she plays back the recording at home. The motivation is conflicted (revenge versus proof, "not for revenge alone, but to bottle it") and shapes her choice to provoke public chaos rather than private sabotage. The friction between her want (the sound) and the cost (her safety, the market's future) is legible. Removing this exact motivation would flatten the closure's thematic charge. It is essential across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Comforting unease" is repeated three times and anchors the market's atmosphere ("welcoming her like an old, uneasy lullaby," "the market's comforting unease," "the unease lingered, comforting as a siren's song"). The tone modulates slightly—opening acceptance, middle tension, closing ambiguity—but the oxymoron feels more like a recurring label than a tone that charges the final image through cadence or rhythm shift. It is present and purposeful but trends toward ornamental recurrence rather than tonal escalation that reweights the ending.</comment>
