<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is stated early but her choices feel constrained by the grafting procedure rather than internal contradiction. The backstory (father's arson, her burns) is told rather than pressuring present action—it anchors her purpose but doesn't force a visible trade-off on the page. Embodied emotion appears in "callused hands" and "gracefully alert," but these remain labels; no moment shows her struggling with fear, doubt, or a competing impulse during the graft. The ending whisper "Sing for us both" and the line about "father's shadow fading" declare resolution without dramatizing the cost of letting go.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece orients who/where/when by the second paragraph (Lira, obsidian lagoon, cloud migration timeframe). The dominant stake—healing the land and her heritage—is signaled early. However, the grafting action unfolds as a demonstration with no on-page reversal or complication; Lira completes each step without friction. The closure ("kelp-drift peace enfold her, father's shadow yielding to harmony") reconfigures her stance (Resonant Reconfiguration / Charged Poise), but the cost is asserted rather than shown—no visible forfeiture or choice that forecloses a path. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (kelp-drift peace, volcanic imagery, scars-as-song motif), but the final image restates the opening tone without a decisive tightening or pattern break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, kelp, volcanic black sand, and dune scars anchor the setting vividly and filter through Lira's firefighter attention ("subtlest shift in wind or warmth"). The black sand and rootstock are handled on the page, and the lagoon's "kelp-drift peace" charges the final image. However, no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters her tactics during the graft—she moves through the procedure without spatial or material friction. The setting functions as backdrop and thematic mirror rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (prove scars can sing, heal land and legacy) is clear, but pressure does not escalate. Lira proceeds through the graft without complication, pause, or cost—each step (slice, sand, bind) succeeds immediately. No reversal or tightening choice narrows her options; the father's shadow "fading" is declared in the final line without an on-page moment of renunciation or visible price. The piece accumulates tone and imagery but does not force a trade-off or crystallize a before/after in her stance through dramatized action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The scars-as-song motif is signaled early and returned at closure, and the theme (compassion healing legacy wounds) emerges from imagery rather than statement. However, the final whisper "Sing for us both" and "father's shadow yielding" summarize the thematic answer rather than letting the grafted scion, black sand, or kelp image speak without narration. The piece resists overt moralizing until the last two paragraphs, where "kelp-drift peace enfold her" and "harmony" risk abstraction. The volcanic/fire duality (destructive father, healing daughter) is purposeful but not fully particularized—removing the arsonist backstory would not break the graft action itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lira; perceptual signature ("gracefully alert," fire-attuned senses) is character-specific. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("unyielding compassion," "relentless as the tide," "harmonize the soul") that reads more authorial than a firefighter's internal voice under pressure. The self-interruptions ("Wait, over—trim"; "No, restart count properly in mind"; "Wait, adjust last") break immersion and signal generative scaffolding rather than character thought. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she felt") appear but do not overwhelm. No dialogue is present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prose carries vivid imagery ("obsidian shards gleamed like forgotten blades," "grains like pulverized midnight"), but several issues accumulate. Paraphrase loops appear: "scars can sing" is stated three times across the piece without variation; "kelp-drift peace" recurs as a label rather than evolving. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with participial phrases ("Kneeling by," "Threading a length," "Looping the red-threaded coin," "Rising, Lira felt"). The self-interruptions ("Wait, over—trim"; "Actually, precise count needed") are scaffold artifacts that should have been removed. Stock metaphors ("soft as compassion," "red as fresh lava yet soft as compassion") mix vehicle and tenor clumsily. The final third contains the highest density of these loops and scaffolds, touching the closure beat and preventing entry to the 9-band globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise (firefighter daughter of arsonist grafting scorched land) offers a fresh synthesis of legacy, repair, and literal/figurative scars. The foreign coin drilled and strung on red thread is a specific, non-obvious detail. However, the emotional arc (compassion healing legacy wounds) follows a familiar template, and the ending's harmony/peace resolution is predictable from the opening kelp-drift tone. The grafting procedure itself is credible and grounded, but the thematic payoff does not surprise—Lira's father-shadow fades exactly as signaled. The piece commits to its premise but does not transform the arsonist-daughter frame beyond surface particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and her firefighter identity shapes her attention ("senses attuned to the subtlest shift in wind or warmth"). However, her choices are procedural (slice, sand, bind) rather than turning the plot—she completes the graft without complication. Her status as the arsonist's daughter provides backstory motivation but does not force an on-page decision that alters her tactics or stance. She appears in the closure image but as a passive receiver of "kelp-drift peace" rather than an agent whose final choice redefines her relationship to her father or the land.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The black sand is introduced early (paragraph 5, "small leather pouch"), handled mid-scene ("sprinkling the black sand around the union"), and appears in the grafting beat with functional purpose (anchor, drainage, invoke regenerative fire). It participates in two beats (introduction, use) and its volcanic origin ties to the father's arson thematically. However, it does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure—after the sprinkling, it is not mentioned again. The sand is causally present but not indispensable; another binding agent could serve the same plot function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Unyielding compassion" is declared in paragraph 6 ("Lira's unyielding compassion had driven her") and echoed in the red silk cord description ("soft as compassion"). It frames her motivation but does not create on-page friction or force a trade-off between mercy and another value. The grafting itself demonstrates care, but no moment shows her choosing compassion over a competing impulse (revenge, self-protection, efficiency). The concept remains thematic assertion rather than a stake that alters her tactics or the plot's outcome.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Gracefully alert" is introduced in paragraph 4 ("Gracefully alert, she moved with the poised vigilance") and ties to her firefighter training. It colors her perceptual signature but does not enable or constrain a specific action with cost. No moment hinges on her alertness—she notices the lagoon, kelp, and rootstock, but these observations do not force a decision or reveal a trade-off between grace and another trait. The attribute is label-only, not dramatized through choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The graft is the central action, occupying paragraphs 10–14 with concrete procedural detail (slice rootstock, fit scion, sprinkle sand, bind with coin and thread). It is signaled early (paragraph 9, "prepared the cleft graft") and shapes the closure image (the scar that will "seal, new leaves unfurl"). The action is specific and irreplaceable—removing the graft breaks the story's logic and thematic payoff (scars singing). However, the graft proceeds without complication or cost; no step fails or forces Lira to adapt. It drives the plot but does not create a reversal or test her under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The foreign coin is introduced mid-scene (paragraph 14, "unclasped her talisman"), drilled, and strung on red thread to bind the graft. The method is specific and its mechanics matter (weight secures the join, talisman infuses "outsider mercy"). It participates in two beats (introduction, use) and contributes to the closure image (the bound graft will heal). However, it appears late (past the midpoint) and resolves the grafting problem it did not help create—Lira does not struggle to find a binding method or adapt the coin under pressure. The coin is functional but somewhat swappable; wire or cord alone could serve a similar role with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is established early (paragraph 2) and anchors the scene spatially. The kelp, black water, and volcanic setting provide vivid sensory detail and thematic resonance (fire/water, destruction/peace). The lagoon's "kelp-drift peace" charges the final image. However, the setting does not pressure Lira's choices—she kneels by the lagoon's edge, but no feature (depth, instability, exposure) constrains her movements or alters her grafting tactics. The setting is atmospheric and thematically essential but functionally static; it shapes mood rather than action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The cloud migration is named in the opening line and returned in paragraph 16 ("As clouds migrated onward, unveiling shafts of light"), but it does not tighten Lira's decisions. The timeframe is described as "fleeting" (paragraph 9, "this fleeting timeframe of drifting clouds"), yet no moment shows her racing against fading light or shifting conditions. The clouds provide atmospheric mood (diffused glow) but no live clock that forces her to skip steps or accept risk. The timeframe is present but ornamental—removing it would not alter the grafting sequence or its outcome.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation ("to prove that scars can sing") is stated explicitly in paragraph 13 and drives Lira to the lagoon and through the graft. It is dramatized in her choice of materials (blackened rootstock, unburned scion) and the act itself, and it shapes the closure whisper ("Sing for us both"). However, the motivation is not conflicted—no moment shows her tempted to walk away, doubt the graft's success, or weigh the cost of this symbolic act against another desire. The motivation is present and consistent but not tested under friction; it is told and then executed without visible struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Kelp-drift peace" is introduced in paragraph 2 ("Kelp drifted in languid peace") and returned at closure ("lagoon's kelp-drift peace enfold her"). The tone is coherent, meditative, and accumulative rather than tense. It modulates subtly—opening with shadows and scars, closing with harmony—but does not shift under pressure because no pressure disrupts Lira's procedure. The tone charges the final image (peace settling within her) and supports the Accumulative/Textural lens, but it remains static rather than intensifying or breaking. The kelp-peace motif is purposeful and integrates theme, setting, and closure, elevating it above mid-band.</comment>
