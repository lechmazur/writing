<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared but never meaningfully tested by contradictory impulses or embodied choices under pressure. Interior texture leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("prism-minded," "latent blaze") rather than concrete, character-particular thought. The final "clutching the tome" moment asserts transformation without showing a credible choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Therapy-speak and label-only traits ("seeds of vigilance," "prismatic soul") replace dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by the second paragraph satisfies early grounding. The piece attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure ("forgotten combinations no longer hid"), but no decisive on-page action or visible cost accompanies the claim—Elara simply "memorized the patterns" without trade-off or foreclosed option. The gravitational inversion provides a time constraint, but causality is weakly linked (she leaps, floats, touches a crystal, and emerges transformed by assertion rather than earned struggle). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet no meaningful cadence shift or pattern break reweights the stake at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto and gravitational inversion are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (mist coiling, pebbles lifting, walls undulating). However, the environment functions primarily as spectacle; spatial choreography is coherent, but the setting does not meaningfully constrain a choice or charge the final image—Elara's success is unimpeded by the grotto's features. Micro-setting (the central prism, the manuscript) is handled but does not alter tactics or impose cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding forgotten combinations—is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or a meaningful tightening that narrows options. The gravitational inversion provides a ticking clock, yet Elara encounters no friction, reversal, or trade-off during the hour; she simply proceeds and succeeds. The "latent blaze" intensifies by assertion ("motivation burned brighter") without a choice or price that forecloses a path. No agency-driven escalation under the chosen lens; coincidence (the cosmic whim of inversion) enables resolution rather than protagonist decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>A theme of vigilance and recovery of lost knowledge emerges through recurring images (spirals, seeds, prism) and the concept of "forgotten combinations." However, the ending offers no non-literal reconfiguration or earned insight—"they danced in her prismatic soul, ready to reshape the world" is abstract assertion rather than a resonant final image. The piece gestures toward complexity (archons guarding against cosmic unraveling) but does not dramatize a thematic question or allow for ambiguity. Motifs recur without constraining choice or accumulating genuine pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is ornate and consistent but leans heavily on elevated diction ("clandestinely luminous," "serpentine curves undulating") that clashes with the urgency of a timed quest. Perceptual signature is abstract and generic ("prism-minded nature reveled in it, parsing the effects into navigable spectra") rather than character-specific. Filter verbs and stock metaphors accumulate without voice-motivated purpose. Psychic distance remains stable, but the prose reads as committee consensus rather than a singular, embodied perspective under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting: nearly every sentence stacks figurative language ("mist coiling like forgotten thoughts," "latent blaze simmered in her veins," "seeds of vigilance flowered fully") without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing clarity and momentum (−0.7). Paraphrase loops appear (paragraphs on "seeds of vigilance" restate the same concept across multiple beats; −0.4). Template cadence runs in the middle third ("She traced…feeling…" / "She reached…touching…" / "She swam…reentering…"; −0.5). Stock metaphors and register drift into pseudo-mystical abstraction pervade peak beats. Information density is low; many lines describe rather than advance. Artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—archivist seeks lost alchemical keys in an inverted-gravity labyrinth—combines familiar quest and portal-fantasy templates without transformation. The gravitational inversion and margin doodle offer surface novelty, but the emotional arc (enter, discover, memorize, emerge empowered) is generic and could transfer to any treasure-hunt frame unchanged. No bold risk or earned turn distinguishes the material; the ending's "ready to reshape the world" is a stock payoff. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −1.0 for unearned template use.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her archive-knowledge is mentioned repeatedly, but her decisions are passive observations rather than choices that create turns. She pauses, traces, leaps, and memorizes without friction or trade-off. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, closure) but only as observer, not agent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The manuscript doodle appears in three distinct beats: initial discovery in lamplight, reexamination in the grotto (where it glows and guides), and dimming after the hour wanes. It enables access (the threshold ripple) and returns with reweighted meaning at closure. However, Elara does not face a cost or constraint tied to the doodle itself—it simply works. Strong setup and payoff; development is functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Seeds of vigilance" is label-only: mentioned four times as a thematic flourish ("tiny embers awakening," "patterns aligning," "flowered fully") but never dramatized as a concrete stake or tactical constraint. It does not shape on-page choices or narrow options. Ornamental presence without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Clandestinely luminous" describes the doodle's glow and the veins in the chamber. It provides visual spectacle but does not constrain or enable an action with visible cost—Elara reads the glow and proceeds unimpeded. Present in setup and middle; label-only at closure. Decorative rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Reenter" is the stated central action: Elara seeks to reenter the hidden sanctum she glimpsed years ago. It appears in setup (stated goal), middle (she leaps into the threshold and reenters), and closure (she emerges). However, the act of reentering is not a turn—no prior failed attempt or visible cost distinguishes this entry from the earlier one. Functional presence in all three gates, but easily swappable with "enter" or "discover" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Threshold effects" are signaled early (ripples at the stone's edge) and used once in the middle beat (Elara leaps into the ripple to access the chamber). The mechanics are asserted rather than dramatized—no trial-and-error or cost tied to the method itself. Present in setup and middle; cameo mention at closure ("fading threshold effects") but not causally active there. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto is vividly described and present throughout (setup, middle, closure). It provides atmosphere and houses the inversion event, but it does not pressure Elara's choices—she navigates without spatial constraint or environmental cost. The gravitational inversion is the active element; the grotto itself is backdrop. Present in all three gates but does not alter tactics or charge the final image with specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The one-hour inversion window is signaled early, tracked during the middle ("the hour waned"), and present at closure ("gravity tugged downward once more"). It provides genuine urgency and shapes the structure of the scene. However, Elara does not race the clock or face a trade-off tied to the time limit—she completes her task before the hour ends without visible cost. All three gates satisfied; causal pressure moderate; cost indirect.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The goal—"to find where forgotten combinations hide"—is stated in the opening paragraph, pursued in the middle (she enters the sanctum and sees the combinations), and claimed as achieved at closure ("Forgotten combinations no longer hid"). It drives the plot but is never dramatized as a conflicted choice with visible cost. All three gates present; functional but told rather than shown under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"Latent blaze" is asserted four times ("simmered in her veins," "blazed latently," "burned brighter," "now a beacon") but functions as a label rather than a modulated tonal effect. The prose remains uniformly ornate and declarative throughout; no tonal shift under pressure or at closure. Present across all three gates but static and decorative rather than integrated with rhythm or final charge.</comment>
