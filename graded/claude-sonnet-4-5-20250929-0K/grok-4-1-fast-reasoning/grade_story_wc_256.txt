<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation ("to feel that texture again, not in flesh, but in the resonant hush") is declared rather than dramatized through competing impulses. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves through chambers with seamless resolve, questioning assumptions without visible cost to her certainty. The "powerfully gentle" attribute appears as a label without constraining choice or creating friction. Embodied emotion is thin—tears at the end feel asserted rather than earned by contradictory pulls across the journey.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of chamber-by-chamber deepening with recurring motifs (golden shadows, prism-song, carbide lens). Orientation is clear early. However, closure cost is vague: "scarred, resonant grit binding all" is thematic assertion rather than a visible forfeiture or reconfiguration that alters her stance. The "artificial pilgrimage" frame promises a journey structure but delivers a tour without meaningful tightening of options—each chamber adds texture but does not narrow her path or force a trade-off. The final kneeling moment gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks on-page evidence of what she has renounced or what new constraint she now faces.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The laboratory setting is vivid and consistent: vaulted ceilings, suspended gongs, holographic maps, chambers named with purpose. The carbide lens is handled across multiple beats, focusing sound waves and enabling tactical shifts. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Elowen moves freely from chamber to chamber without spatial friction or resource scarcity. The lens charges the final image ("lens in hand") but its unique properties (thick glass, acetylene-etched curve) do not create a visible trade-off or limit her options at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled: to reclaim connection's texture. Pressure accumulates through chamber progression, and small reversals appear ("hollow" laughter forces lens adjustment; grief "lances" her). But escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical—no live option is foreclosed, no resource spent, no relationship altered. The pilgrimage is declared "artificial" yet operates as ritual without genuine obstacle. Cost at closure is thematic ("scarred, resonant grit") rather than a visible forfeiture that narrows her future.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (connection as "scarred, resonant grit" rather than smooth perfection) emerges through recurring imagery: golden shadows, prism-songs, carbide lens, coal-dust metaphor. The piece resists easy moralizing until the final paragraph, where "true light came from within the lost sounds" edges toward thesis statement. Subtext operates in the gap between "artificial pilgrimage" and genuine discovery. However, the ending's thematic answer ("connection's raw, golden weave") is stated rather than enacted—no on-page choice dramatizes acceptance of imperfection's cost. The carbide lens as miner's relic could ground the theme in labor and scarcity, but that specificity is ornamental rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present but generic: "golden shadows," "prism-song," "texture" recur without character-specific bias. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, with no modulation under pressure—crisis vocabulary matches calm. Figurative density is high and consistent, teaching a pattern, but at peak beats ("pain lanced her") the prose remains abstract rather than embodied. The phrase "powerfully gentle" recurs as a label without syntactic enactment. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, but voice lacks idiosyncrasy—it could belong to any archivist of lost sounds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Severe overwriting pervades the piece: nearly every sentence carries figurative language ("golden shadows stretched long and languid," "prism-song bloomed," "whispers of extinct dialects lingered"), creating a dense, uniform texture that flattens urgency. Template cadence is evident in repeated "She struck… and [result]" constructions across chambers. Paraphrase loops: "texture of connection" and "weave of souls entwined" restate the same concept; "powerfully gentle" appears three times without added meaning. Mixed metaphors: sound "fracturing into harmonious shards" then becoming "silken threads," then "fibrous and warm," then "gossamer yet unbreakable"—vehicles shift without coherent physical logic. Register drift into elevated diction ("vortexed cries," "multisensory hymn") clashes with the immediate present. The closure beat is dense with metaphor ("scarred, resonant grit binding all," "golden weave") that obscures rather than clarifies the final image. Apply −1.4 for pervasive density, coherence breaks, and closure-beat opacity; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—an archivist using sound refraction to recover lost connection after a blackout—offers a fresh angle. "Artificial pilgrimage" is a striking label but underexplored: the journey is declared contrived yet functions as earnest ritual without irony or cost. The carbide lens salvaged from mining depths is specific and promising, but its use is functional rather than revelatory. Emotional arc (questioning assumptions to reach acceptance of connection's grit) is familiar; the piece does not transform it through lived detail or non-obvious calculus. The final image (kneeling, tears, lens in hand) reads as tableau rather than inevitable consequence. Proximity check: "laboratory of lost sounds" and "archive of echoes" echo familiar post-apocalyptic/museum settings without distinct worldbuilding that alters stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elowen is present throughout and her actions (striking bells, adjusting the lens, moving through chambers) drive the sequence. However, her choices do not create key turns—each chamber visit adds texture without altering her tactics or foreclosing options. Setup is early, beat involvement spans the piece, but causal pressure is low: she observes and adjusts without cost. Closure participation: she kneels and holds the lens, but the action is symbolic rather than decisive. Swappability: another archivist could perform the same journey. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (weak, tableau only) +0.3, subtract swappability −0.7, ornamental peak use −0.5 = ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The carbide lens appears early ("In her palm, she cradled…"), is used in at least four beats (Threshold Gong, Whisper Bell, Heart Vault, Nexus Spire, Apex Chamber), and is present in the final image ("lens in hand"). Its function—focusing and refracting sound—enables tactical adjustments (tightening laughter's weave, focusing void between words, refracting grief). However, cost tied to the lens is absent: it does not break, run out, or demand a trade-off. Specificity is moderate: "thick glass etched by years of acetylene glow" is vivid, but any focusing tool could serve the same function with minor edits. Early signal +0.6, five beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure (moderate) +0.8, subtract swappability −0.6, ornamental closure cameo −0.4, no cost −0.5 = ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Artificial pilgrimage" is named early and frames the structure: a simulated journey through chambers replacing "dusty roads or starry vaults." It shapes the sequence (chamber-by-chamber progression) and surfaces in Elowen's questioning ("the pilgrimage was no mere echo-chase"). However, the concept does not constrain options—each chamber is accessible, no sacred trek cost (hunger, danger, temptation) is dramatized, and "artificial" irony is declared but not enacted. At closure, the pilgrimage is "complete," but no contrast between artificial and genuine is paid off. Setup early +0.7, two beats (mid, closure) +0.9, causal pressure (frames structure but no constraint) +0.4, closure linkage (label only) +0.3, subtract swappability (could be "journey" or "quest") −0.8, summary-only resolution −0.5 = ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Powerfully gentle" appears three times: opening description, mid-pilgrimage resolve, final heart. It is a label without enactment—no scene shows her exercising restrained force or choosing gentleness at a cost. The attribute does not constrain or enable a choice; it describes her manner without friction. Setup early +0.5, three mentions (same beat, label-only) +0.4, subtract label-only −0.9, no cost −0.6, swappable with "calm" or "determined" −0.6 = ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Propel" and "propelled" appear eight times, tied to the pilgrimage's forward motion, the lens focusing sound beams, and Elowen's questioning driving her onward. The action shapes attempts (lens propels sound, doubt propels her deeper) and is present at closure ("propelled by questions"). However, major turns do not hinge on propulsion—each chamber visit adds rather than redirects. Specificity is low: "propel" is abstract; swapping for "drive" or "push" would change little. Setup early +0.6, five beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, causal pressure (frames attempts, no decisive turn) +0.6, subtract swappability −0.7, abstract use −0.6, no unique cost −0.4 = ~5.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Questioning assumptions" is signaled early ("No dusty roads…this journey unfolded in simulated chambers") and recurs: "she questioned her assumption that connection was born of volume alone," "challenging the assumption that language bridged souls," "challenging the belief that belonging required permanence," "propelled by final query." The method drives her chamber-by-chamber adjustments (tightening laughter, focusing silence, weaving grief) and shapes the ending ("propelled by questions"). However, the mechanics are told rather than shown—each question is stated in narration, not enacted through trial and error with visible cost. Setup early +0.7, four beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure (frames moves, no constraint) +0.7, subtract summary-only −0.7, no cost (questions do not misfire or exact a price) −0.6 = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The laboratory is established early with vivid specifics: vaulted ceilings, golden shadows, suspended gongs, holographic maps, named chambers (Threshold, Whisper Bell, Heart Vault, Nexus Spire, Apex). Setting provides resources (bells, lens, emitters) and structures the pilgrimage. However, the lab does not pressure choices—rooms are freely accessible, no door is locked, no resource is scarce. At closure, "The laboratory hummed alive," charging the final image. Setup early +0.8, five beats (chambers) +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure (supplies tools, no constraint) +0.6, specificity +0.5, subtract no constraint on choice −0.9, postcard spans (named rooms without friction) −0.5 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the power grid stabilizes" is the opening anchor and appears once more ("powered now by steady current"). The timeframe enables the journey (holographic maps, emitters function) but does not tighten decisions—no clock, no urgency, no risk of another blackout. The "months" of blackout are past, and the restored grid is backdrop, not pressure. Setup early +0.6, one beat (enabling condition) +0.4, closure absence 0, subtract vague/untracked time (no clock or deadline) −0.7, ornamental −0.5, resolves a problem it did not help create (backstory only) −0.7, cap 3.0 per late-resolver rule, but enabling condition present lifts to ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of connection" is stated early ("her motivation burned soft yet insistent") and drives the pilgrimage structure: each chamber seeks a facet of texture (laughter's intimacy, silence's knot, grief's warmth, transience's gossamer). At closure, "she had touched the texture: connection's raw, golden weave." However, the motivation is told rather than conflicted—no competing want (safety, solitude, pride) creates friction. Cost is thematic (acceptance of imperfection) rather than visible forfeiture. Setup early +0.8, five beats (each chamber) +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure (frames attempts) +0.7, subtract told-only desire −0.8, no competing want −0.6, thematic cost (not visible trade-off) −0.5 = ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" appears in the opening line and recurs nine times, modulating with pressure: "stretched long and languid," "pulsing in sync," "deepened," "pooled like molten amber," "gilded spires," "crowned the Final Bell," "whispering approval," "golden paths" (tears), "golden weave." Coherence is high; the tone charges the final image. However, the mood is static—elevated and elegiac throughout, with no tonal shift at reversal beats. Setup early +0.8, six beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, coherence +0.6, charges final image +0.9, subtract static mood (no modulation under pressure) −0.9, ornamental recurrence (some mentions decorative) −0.4 = ~6.0.</comment>
