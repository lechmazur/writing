<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve his wife's songs is stated rather than earned through contradictory impulses in scene. The pivot from fraud to honesty arrives through summary ("mapping frantically, he traced a new pattern: honesty") rather than embodied choice under pressure. Lila's accusation "You're a fraud" and immediate forgiveness feel under-motivated; her internal conflict is absent. The final death scene tells us he held a "faint smile" but does not dramatize what choice or renunciation he made in that moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (dust-mapping recurs, pigeons ferry notes, chip hums), but the closure—Elias dies peacefully, Lila carries on—lacks visible cost or decisive reconfiguration. Orientation is delayed: we learn "vintage bookshop attic" and pigeons early, but Elias's present goal (amplify chip, preserve songs) emerges only after extended backstory. The betrayal/fraud/confession arc is summarized in rapid blocks rather than dramatized turns, weakening causal linkage. No on-page cost forecloses a path at the ending; the "faint smile" and Lila's pigeon-training are asserted without showing what was lost or reweighted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The attic, skylight, and pigeons anchor space adequately. Dust motes under the skylight recur and are mapped, but their role remains descriptive; they do not constrain a tactical choice on the page. The chip is "balanced precariously on a needlepoint" calculated from mappings, yet the mechanics of balance never alter an action or foreclose an option. Sensory detail is present but often ornamental ("feathers blooming soft grays," "motes swirling wildly") rather than pressure-driven.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve songs via chip balance—is signaled early but never tested on the page by a live obstacle or trade-off. The fraud revelation could tighten options, but Lila's forgiveness arrives in the next scene without visible friction. The confession pigeon and the chip's final hum are told outcomes, not turns that narrow tactics. No price is paid for the fraud; the ending grants Elias and Lila "trust fully relearned" and "balance held" without foreclosing a path or extracting a felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of trust/reinvention emerges from the fraud-confession arc and pigeon motif, but the final image—Lila training a pigeon after Elias's peaceful death—resolves the question tidily rather than reweighting it. The meteorite's shift from "alien magic" to "love's quiet gravity" is stated in the narration rather than discovered through image or action. Blooming/withering recurs but functions as verbal texture rather than accumulating pressure that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and perceptual signature (Elias's obsessive mapping, pigeon-training lens) is present. Register drifts into elevated diction ("celestial score," "cosmic voids," "budding duet") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Lila's two lines of dialogue ("It's beautiful, like stars trapped in wind" and "You remapped everything") carry thematic echo rather than subtext or goal pursuit. Elias's interiority at peak beats (fraud accusation, final death) is summarized rather than rendered in embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Pervasive overwriting: "blooming," "withering," "dust motes," and "paper trails" recur as verbal tics without causal pressure. Paraphrase loops: "Elias no longer needed to reinvent; his history was theirs now" is immediately followed by "Their story etched new trails." Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "One [time]" or "[Noun] [verb]ed" stems. Mixed metaphors: "feathers blooming," "laughter bloomed," "weeks bloomed," "songs blooming" dilute specificity. Stock phrasing: "Trust bloomed anew, fragile yet rooted." These artifacts pervade the ending and foreclose 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Core premise—courier pigeon trainer fakes Mars expedition, maps dust to preserve wife's songs via meteorite chip—is high-concept but derivative of "eccentric inventor seeks redemption through pseudoscience." The fraud-confession arc follows a template (lie → accusation → honest letter → forgiveness) without a fresh inflection. Dust-mapping and pigeon-love-notes are specific but serve ornamental rather than causal roles. No bold risk heightens stakes; the ending grants symmetric satisfaction (trust restored, songs preserved, Lila continues his work) without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Elias trains pigeons, sends messages, and confesses via pigeon, but no on-page choice turns on his courier expertise. The profession is present across beats but swappable with "reclusive inventor" or "eccentric archivist."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The chip appears early (Elias holds it, believes it hums), is balanced mid-story (Lila helps steady it), and gleams in the final image. It drives two beats (balance attempt, confession) but the mechanics of balance never constrain a choice; it remains symbolic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Paper trails" recurs as motif (pigeon scrolls, forged journals, dust-maps, confession notes) but functions thematically rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. The metaphor is decorative; removing it would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elias reinvents his history (forged journals, Martian myths) and the fraud is discovered, but the trait does not constrain an on-page choice. The confession is summarized; we do not see him struggle over whether to lie or tell the truth. Mentioned in setup and payoff, but middle development is absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Balance" appears literally (chip on needlepoint), emotionally (trust relearned), and thematically (past/future equilibrium). It drives the balancing-chip beat and the final stand, but the act of balancing is told rather than shown to narrow options. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but swappable with "attune" or "harmonize."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Mapping dust motes is signaled early and recurs (Elias sketches paths, calculates needlepoint, maps frantically at crisis), but the method never alters a tactic or outcome on the page. The mappings are described but not shown to fail, succeed, or impose a cost. Present in setup and middle; faint closure linkage (Lila maps with him).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The attic houses all action, supplies the skylight for dust-mapping, and provides pigeons and yellowed pages. It anchors mood and recurs in the final image ("attic's light"). It does not constrain a choice—Elias could work elsewhere—but it is irreplaceable for the skylight mechanic and tone. Present in setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Across learning to trust again" frames the arc, and "weeks bloomed," "months later," "one spring" mark passage, but time does not tighten a decision. The timeline is vague and does not create a deadline or alter tactics. Present as thematic frame but not as pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Elias wants to preserve his wife's songs, which motivates chip-balancing and dust-mapping. The desire is told rather than dramatized in a conflicted choice; no on-page moment shows him sacrifice another goal to preserve the songs. Present in setup and reflected in closure ("songs that would outlast them both"), but middle friction is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Blooming" and "withering" recur throughout (feathers bloom, laughter blooms, weeks bloom, trust blooms; pages wither, heart withers, warmth withers). The diptych charges description but becomes repetitive texture rather than modulating with pressure. It is present in the final image ("blooming eternal") and reweights the opening "withering yellowed pages," achieving a lyric reprise without causal development.</comment>
