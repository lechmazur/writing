<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Thorne's interiority is consistently abstract and declarative rather than embodied—"his guarded nature a fortress," "motivation burned fiercer"—without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The climactic blood-offering reads as symbolic gesture rather than genuine internal conflict with visible cost; the "guard cracked" moment tells rather than shows fracture through competing wants. The confession reveal provides backstory motivation but arrives as exposition dump rather than through present choices that test his guardedness. Emotional progression from guarded to "unguarded soul" feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within bounds. The closure unit—Thorne accepting his confession and stepping from the lake "unguarded"—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization), but the cost is declared ("carrying seed remnants and a unguarded soul") rather than made visible through a specific forfeiture or altered tactic. Causality holds in the plant-melts-ice sequence, but the vortex's "unbending" and Thorne's internal transformation occur in parallel summary rather than because/therefore linkage. The final image ("Mirrors would still lie, but he knew their deceit") restates theme without reweighting prior material through concrete action or renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The vortex setting supplies vivid images—rotating apple trees, frost-kissed soil underwater, ice shard at core—but functions primarily as backdrop. Spatial choreography (kneeling, pressing seed, wading out) remains legible. The seed and ice constrain the central action sequence, and the frozen confession shard provides a goal-object, lifting the setting's role slightly. However, the orchard's "warlike serenity" and the trees' "retaliation with gusts" describe rather than mechanically alter Thorne's tactics; no environmental cost (cold, drowning risk, root entanglement) forces a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—confronting the hidden confession—is signaled early. The plant-to-ice action provides one meaningful tightening (he must yield his own flesh), but the escalation is mechanical rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure: the vortex "tightened" and he "hesitated," then complied without visible internal friction or competing option. The blood-prick registers as symbolic gate rather than costly trade-off; no live alternative is foreclosed. The final "unbent" state is declared outcome rather than a decision with on-page consequence that narrows future options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The mirrors/hidden-truth theme emerges from images and the confession premise. The closing assertion "Mirrors would still lie, but he knew their deceit now" restates the theme rather than charging it through a non-literal final action. The flesh-eating plant and frozen confession work as symbolic architecture, but the piece leans on overt statements—"What mirrors didn't show was this," "No longer just the finder of things, he was the unbinder of self-deceit"—rather than letting the enacted sequence speak. The elder-betrayal backstory adds moral weight, yet the on-page resolution offers declaration ("a man fractured") without embodied cost or ongoing friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Thorne. However, diction drifts between high-register abstraction ("serene inevitability," "insidious whispers," "hypnotic spirals") and declarative summary ("his guarded nature a fortress," "no longer just the finder of things") that flattens voice into narrator-essay hybrid. Perceptual signature is generic—no character-specific bias in what Thorne notices or how he interprets. Psychic distance oscillates without purpose: close on blood-drip action, distant on emotional turns ("guard cracked," "soul unguarded"). The prose reads more like mythic narration than lived focalization, weakening immediacy at peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence saturate the text. "Guarded" appears seven times, often in recycled phrases ("guarded druid," "guarded nature," "guarded heart," "unyielding guard," "unguarded soul"). Synonym churn: "serene inevitability / warlike serenity / poised tranquility," "expanding circles / tightening spirals / methodical serenity." Stock metaphors cluster without variation: "fortress," "fire," "shattering mirrors." Sentence stems repeat: "The [noun] [verb]ed… / Thorne [verb]ed… / The [noun] [verb]ed…" Figurative density in high-pressure beats (plant growth, confession thaw) piles modifiers—"acidic relish," "serrated blades," "confession's fire"—that blur rather than sharpen action. Information density is low; many lines restate without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The druid-confronts-past premise and mirror/reflection motif are familiar templates. The orchard vortex and flesh-eating plant add surface detail, but the emotional arc—guilt over betrayal, symbolic confrontation, self-acceptance—follows a well-worn path without fresh inflection. The "warlike serenity" oxymoron is introduced as tone label but not transformed through action. The frozen-confession-in-ice image is vivid yet functions as straightforward symbol. No risk-taking in structure or perspective; the piece opts for mythic summary voice that abstracts rather than particularizes, and the final declaration ("unbinder of self-deceit") replaces surprise with thesis statement.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Thorne's guardedness is mentioned throughout but functions as label rather than constraint that forces trade-offs. His key choice—pricking his palm—alters tactics (activates the plant) and the text states "his guard cracked," qualifying as a decision with cost. However, the choice is mechanical (plant requires blood) rather than revealing internal hierarchy of values. Present in setup (named trait), middle (hesitation), and payoff (guard "cracked" and "unguarded soul"), meeting all three gates. Swappability moderate; a more trusting or reckless protagonist would not require the same internal battle, but the blood-prick itself could occur without the guardedness layer. Mid-band: shapes one beat with modest cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The seed is introduced early ("glint in the frost"), used in the central action (planted, fed blood, grows to consume ice), and present in closure ("carrying seed remnants"). It constrains Thorne's method (must plant it, must feed it flesh) and enables the central turn (melting the confession shard). Three beats: discovery, planting/blood-offering, growth/consumption. Causal role is strong—without it, the vortex cannot be "unbent." Specificity is clear (flesh-eating, acidic, vein-pulsing). Cost is tied (blood sacrifice). Slight swappability: another magical catalyst could replace it with minor edits (a heat-stone, a dissolving rune), preventing top-band score. Strong integration across setup, middle, and closure, with visible causal pressure and cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The frozen confession—ice shard imprisoning Thorne's spectral betrayal—is the goal-object and shapes stakes throughout. Introduced in setup (core image), drives middle action (plant must reach it), and payoff delivers the reveal ("For power, I yielded him"). The concept changes Thorne's understanding (knowledge shift) and the text claims it leads to his "unbent" state. However, the confession functions as static reveal rather than forcing a new on-page choice after it thaws; Thorne simply "staggered" and "rose," then left. Cost is thematic (shame, self-knowledge) but not tactical—no forfeiture or altered action follows the revelation on the page. Mid-high band: essential goal, but impact is declarative rather than operationalized through subsequent decision.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Finds lost things" is stated as Thorne's attribute and directly enables the seed discovery: "He'd found it, as always, drawn by the unseen threads." This allows the central action to proceed. However, the trait is invoked once without visible cost or trade-off—no scene shows him using the skill under pressure, no choice between competing lost objects, no price for the finding. Present in setup (introduced), middle (seed discovery), and thematically reprised at closure ("forever finding not just lost objects, but lost selves"). Swappability: moderate; the seed could be embedded in the vortex or Thorne could simply spot it without the finder trait. Functional but not indispensable; shapes one key beat (discovery) with modest causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Unbend" appears repeatedly as goal and outcome: "to unbend the vortex's tightening spirals," "To unbend meant yielding his own flesh," "Unbent, Thorne rose." The plant's action—devouring roots and ice—mechanically enacts the unbending, and the text states the vortex "faltered" and trees "straightened in release." However, "unbend" functions as thematic verb rather than a distinct physical act; the actual moves are plant-growth and ice-melt, which could occur without the "unbend" framing. Present in all three gates (stated goal, central struggle, declared outcome) but swappable with synonyms like "unravel," "release," "break." Mid-band: thematic spine but not mechanically irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Expanding circles" is stated as the method: "plant it through expanding circles, mirroring the orchard's rhythm." The plant's growth is described in concentric stages: "first tiny circle," "outermost roots," "Deeper circles bloomed," "final circle engulfed the shard." The method is signaled and tracked through the action, shaping the sequence's structure. However, the circles are descriptive pattern rather than constraining mechanic—Thorne does not adjust tactics based on circle progression, and the plant could grow in another pattern (spiral, straight roots) with minor edits. Present in setup (stated plan), middle (enacted), and payoff (completed). Functional but replaceable; the geometry matters thematically (mirroring the vortex) but not tactically.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The vortex is the story's spatial frame and central obstacle. Setup: introduced early, vivid ("swirling orchard vortex," rotating trees, frost-kissed soil underwater). Middle: provides the goal-object (ice shard at core), supplies sensory detail (gusts, groans), and the text states it "tightened" as pressure. Payoff: "unbent" and "appeased" at closure, releasing Thorne. The setting constrains movement (inward to the core) and the orchard's "expanding circles" motif shapes the method. However, the vortex's mechanics are static backdrop—no tactical cost (drowning risk ignored, cold not pressing), and the trees' "retaliation with gusts" is mentioned but does not force a choice. Strong presence across all gates, moderate causal role (goal location, thematic mirror), but lacks mechanical constraint that alters Thorne's approach.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the magic trick failed" anchors the inciting event. The timeframe provides causal entry (backfire sucked Thorne in), but no live clock or urgency shapes his choices within the vortex. The sequence unfolds in continuous present without time pressure—he could plant the seed immediately or wait, with no stated cost for delay. The vortex "tightens" (spatial/intensity term, not temporal). Closure occurs after an unspecified duration; Thorne simply "waded from the lake" when done. Present in setup (clear trigger) but absent from middle escalation and payoff urgency. Functional framing, but easily replaceable with any catalyst ("after the portal opened," "after the curse activated") without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The desire to discover "what mirrors don't show" is stated early and reprised throughout: "what mirrors refused to show, the shadowed motives of his own heart," "What mirrors didn't show was this." It drives Thorne into the vortex (seeking truth) and frames the confession reveal as goal-attainment. Setup clear, middle pursuit (plant-to-ice sequence aims toward the frozen confession), payoff thematic ("Mirrors would still lie, but he knew their deceit now"). However, the motivation is largely told rather than dramatized through conflicting on-page wants—Thorne's "guarded heart resisted vulnerability" is stated, not shown through a live choice between retreat and pursuit. Cost is conceptual (self-knowledge) but not tactical (no forfeiture of safety, power, or alternate goal). Strong thematic spine and closure linkage, but dramatization through friction is thin.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Warlike serenity" is introduced early and repeated: "warlike serenity," "calm ferocity," "poised tranquility," "methodical serenity," "serene, unyielding truth." The oxymoron is applied to setting (orchard, vortex), action (plant consumption), and Thorne's final state ("the warlike serenity now his own"). The tone is consistent and modulates slightly (initial threat, calm action, final integration). However, the effect is label-reliant—assertions of "serene inevitability" and "warlike peace" rather than embodied tension in diction or rhythm. The final image attempts to charge the tone ("calm readiness forged in confession's fire") but remains declarative. Present in setup, middle, and payoff; thematically coherent but not operationalized through syntactic or sensory craft. Mid-band: sustained motif without deep integration into pressure mechanics.</comment>
