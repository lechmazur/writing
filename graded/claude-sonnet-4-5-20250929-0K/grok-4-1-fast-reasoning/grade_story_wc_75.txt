<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated clearly but her interior landscape remains flat—she clutches the lens, declares intent, commands action, yet we never glimpse contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The displaced persons function as a mass rather than individuals who apply relationship pressure. The bread-baking ritual arrives late and resolves too neatly without visible cost that forecloses a path; the ending shift to the opera house reads as convenient relocation rather than earned renunciation or alteration with on-page price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes Elara and the grotto early, satisfying orientation, and infers an Accumulative/Textural lens through densely layered imagery. However, the closure—fleeing to an opera house after Veilfall breaks—lacks visible cost; the displaced persons "vanish into legend's embrace" via summary rather than on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration. The thaw complicates but does not narrow options through protagonist agency, and the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure, leaving closure unearned under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The grotto city behind Veilfall is vividly rendered with bioluminescent fungi, ice fissures, and rosewater-perfumed air, and the waterfall's ice shattering drives the evacuation choice. Spatial choreography remains clear across the museum halls, hearth, and secret vents. The lens (emerald-tinted opera glass) is handled twice and the bread-baking anchors tactile detail, together charging the final third, though the opera house destination arrives late without prior spatial grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing dying arts from the thaw—is signaled early and the ice cracking provides external pressure. Yet escalation relies on environmental coincidence (thaw acceleration, scouts glimpsed through the lens) rather than Elara's agency narrowing options or forcing a trade-off with visible cost. The bread-baking and lens-distribution are presented as solutions without prior friction, and the ending relocation does not foreclose a live path on the page, leaving the tightening incomplete under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between preservation and exposure, and the bread ritual embodies memory as tactile art. The emerald lens and rosewater dread recur with shifting connotations, and the opera house offers a spatial echo of the lost stage. However, the final paragraph's "vanished into legend's embrace" and "perfumed with eternal rosewater dread" veer toward overt thematic summary rather than letting the final image answer the central question implicitly, and the moral calculus—rescue via relocation—resolves too tidily without ambiguity or cost that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric-elevated register with purposeful archaisms ("intoned," "luthiers," "sigils") that suit the museum-guide POV and the grotto's antiquarian ethos. Psychic distance remains stable in close third, and perceptual signature—"emerald distortion," "rosewater cloying on tongues"—is specific to Elara's cultured filter. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven ("Pack the loaves!"), and the final shift to omniscient retrospect ("vanished into legend") is brief enough to read as intentional closure framing rather than POV leakage, though it does soften immediacy at the end.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"rosewater dread," "emerald hues," "doughy initials rising like defiant sigils"—and while individually vivid, the accumulation in peak beats (ice shattering, fleeing) slows propulsion without adding causal detail. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "Elara shaped… Elara seized… Elara distributed" across consecutive short paragraphs. Paraphrase loops surface in adjacent lines: "thaw begins" / "thaw accelerating" and "displaced persons gathered" / "displaced would be dragged back." These artifacts dull momentum and trigger baseline deductions (−0.6 for template stems, −0.2 for paraphrase loop, totaling roughly −0.8), though clarity at closure remains intact, preventing heavier penalties.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The grotto-behind-waterfall refugee haven combines familiar sanctuary and preservation tropes, and while the emerald lens and bread-initial ritual add textural specificity, the emotional arc—communal resolve through baking, then escape—follows a predictable mutual-aid template without a non-obvious moral calculus or risky structural choice. The lens-as-talisman and opera-house destination feel narratively convenient rather than inevitable in hindsight. The rosewater-dread coinage and bioluminescent-fungi detail elevate atmosphere but do not transform the underlying frame enough to escape the safety middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present across all three thirds, frames the tour (setup), commands the bread-baking (development), and leads the evacuation (payoff), satisfying all gates. She makes two on-page decisions—initiating the communal baking and ordering the flight—but both arise from external pressure (thaw, scouts) rather than internal conflict or visible cost tied to her role as guide. Her choices advance the plot but feel reactive and swappable with a generic leader; removing "museum guide" specificity would not break story logic. The cultured voice colors narration but does not constrain tactics or force a trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lens appears in three beats: Elara peers through the ice fissure (observes skeletal forests), scans the breach to spot scouts (tactical use that triggers the evacuation decision), and is sharded for distribution as talismans (reprise with reweighted communal meaning). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The emerald tint is specific and visually cohesive, and the lens enables the key scouting choice. However, the final talisman use is summary-only—"magnifying their will"—without on-page demonstration of how the shards constrain later action or charge the opera-house arrival, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Displaced persons" is named early (setup), the refugees' skill-set (weavers, calligraphers, luthiers) matters for what is rescued (development), and they flee together at the end (payoff), meeting all gates. The concept shapes the dominant stake—preservation of dying arts—and the threat of being "dragged back to erasure" provides external pressure. Yet the displaced persons remain a collective mass without individual agency or friction; their status does not force Elara into a trade-off or visible cost at closure. The concept frames theme and atmosphere but does not narrow options or alter tactics in a way unique to "displaced" versus generic "refugees."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Historically oriented" is labeled twice—refugees "sworn to rescue dying arts" and Elara's "mind racing through chronicles of past deluges"—satisfying setup and a mid-story reference. The trait enables Elara to recall precedent and informs the decision to fortify morale before stone, a brief development touch. However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost or force a trade-off at closure; a character without historical knowledge could still flee the flood and rally the group. The attribute is swappable with "experienced" or "educated" without structural loss, and it does not appear in or shape the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Thaw" is seeded early (beekeeper's warnings), escalates at midpoint (Veilfall ice cracks), and drives the climactic evacuation when floodwaters breach the grotto, satisfying all gates. The action is causally indispensable—without the thaw, no urgency and no exodus. It narrows options (stay and drown versus flee) and the scouts' arrival during the breach adds a secondary cost (exposure risk). The thaw is not swappable; substituting another disaster would require different setup and different resources (ice-specific language, frozen cascade). The ending's "thaw into rebirth" recurrence charges the final image with conceptual cost, linking physical and communal transformation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The bread-baking custom is introduced past the 40% mark (middle third), capping the score at 4.6 per the late-arrival rule. It appears in one extended beat: Elara leads the ritual, shapes the 'V' loaf, and the group consumes the breads to "thaw resolve into steel," providing a development touch and a thematic link to the ending's "thaw into rebirth." However, the custom does not constrain earlier choices or create a problem it later solves; it functions as morale boost rather than a method with tactical friction. The initials are consumed and vanish rather than carried forward or reweighted at closure. Late arrival, single-beat use, and lack of causal pressure prevent higher scoring despite emotional resonance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The grotto behind Veilfall is anchored early (setup), the ice fissure and secret vents enable the evacuation (development), and the location's breach forces the exodus (payoff), meeting all gates. The waterfall's ice encasement provides the thaw mechanism, and the bioluminescent fungi and cavern layout shape the museum-tour staging. The setting supplies the central constraint (flood risk) and the escape route (vents), making it integral to two beats. However, the opera house destination—though spatially specific—arrives in the final fifth without prior grounding, and the grotto's properties (fungi, vents) are used but not irreplaceable; a generic underground refuge could serve similar functions with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the beekeeper's last visit" is established early ("three moons past"), meeting the setup gate. The beekeeper's warnings of "impending thaw" prime the stakes, and his honey is used in the bread-baking, providing a mid-story glancing reference. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; "three moons past" marks backstory rather than a forward-counting deadline. The thaw arrives without tracked urgency or countdown, and the ending does not return to or reweight the beekeeper reference. The element is ornamental context rather than a tactical constraint, and it is absent from the closure unit.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to rescue dying arts" is declared in Elara's second beat ("her motivation burned fierce") and dramatized through the museum tour and bread-baking, meeting setup and development gates. The evacuation with "arts bundled like babes" shows the goal carried to closure, satisfying payoff. The desire is tested once—stay and preserve in place versus flee and relocate—but the friction is external (flood) rather than internal conflict between competing wants. Elara's choice to flee is unanimous and immediate, without visible cost or a path foreclosed; she does not sacrifice an art or person to save the rest. The motivation shapes the ending's direction but lacks the want-versus-fear tension or trade-off needed for higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Rosewater dread" is introduced early as "delicate floral haze… masking the chill" and recurs across beats: "perfumed foreboding of exposure," "cloying on tongues as if the flowers themselves wept toxin," and "perfumed with eternal rosewater dread" in the final line, meeting setup, development, and payoff gates. The tone modulates from olfactory beauty to sinister sweetness as pressure rises, and the final reprise reweights the phrase with elegiac permanence. However, the tone does not constrain a choice or force a tactic; it colors atmosphere without altering options. The phrase is poetic but swappable with another dread-descriptor without structural loss, and the lyric final-line return feels ornamental rather than causally charged.</comment>
