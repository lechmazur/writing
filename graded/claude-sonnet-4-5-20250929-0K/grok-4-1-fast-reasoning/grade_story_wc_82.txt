<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elar's grief motive is clear and his crafty identity established early, but his interior reads as label-heavy ("luminous torment," "grief's weight") rather than contradictory impulse dramatized in real time. The final crane-folding sequence demonstrates embodied choice under pressure, but the path there leans on abstract emotion tags—"radiant agony," "torment flaring brighter"—instead of concrete sensory perception that would anchor his mind. Micro-choices exist (selecting gems, folding cranes) yet the progression feels more decorative than driven by competing wants colliding in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early (shadow detachment, luminous grief, ascending/descending paradox) and returns motifs at closure when cranes scatter torment into sparkles. Orientation anchors (Elar, floating isle tea garden, post-shadow detachment) arrive promptly. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): the final image reweights grief into "folded echoes" and the cranes wheeling eternal, cost felt in "lighter now" and shadow's outline detaching. However, the middle stretch—gem polishing, tea-induced dream, basilica approach—reads as sequential decoration rather than causally linked tightening; the dream-recording mechanics appear but don't narrow options so much as allow the transformation ritual. One meaningful deepening (grief materialized, then folded) is present, satisfying minimal threshold, but the beats between setup and climax lack because/therefore pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tea garden, glass basilica, floating isle thermal updrafts, and bonsai camellias are vivid and atmosphere-rich. The "paradoxical helix" staircase offers a concrete spatial metaphor that mirrors Elar's internal state. The basilica's "refractive splendor" and "prismatic grief" lodge in memory. However, these elements function primarily as backdrop; the environment doesn't constrain a choice or supply a tactical resource—Elar's path (polish gems, drink tea, ascend, fold cranes) would play out similarly in a different enchanted locale. The body and gem-lantern anchor micro-setting, yet their role is illustrative rather than restrictive. Solid sensory work, but the 9+ gate (environment/tool/object constrains choice or charges final image) is only partially met—cranes scatter "through glass vents," a detail that enriches but doesn't pivot the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform grief into folded cranes, signaled early. The piece shows one meaningful tightening when ether solidifies into gossamer sheets and Elar begins folding, forecloses his prior static torment, and earns the "lighter now" state. Yet the escalation path—selecting gems, polishing, drinking tea, ascending, projecting dream—reads as ritual steps rather than narrowing tactical pressure; each beat adds texture but doesn't raise cost or force a trade-off until the final folding action. No reversal complicates the plan; coincidence (dream-quartz availability, basilica's amplifying glass) enables rather than tests. The transformation act itself is protagonist-driven and the cost (shadow's outline detaching, cranes scattering torment) is legible on the page, lifting the score into the 6-band, but the middle lacks friction that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—grief as material that can be transformed through craft and ritual—emerges through image and action rather than statement. The interplay of luminous torment, origami cranes as "soaring symbols of fragile peace," and the ascending/descending paradox creates a coherent symbolic field. The ending offers a resonant answer: cranes scatter grief into "harmless sparkles," and Elar is "reborn amid folded echoes of loss," avoiding a stated moral. However, "luminous torment" and cognates recur as overt thematic labels rather than letting particulars do the work; the basilica's "archived dreams of archipelago drifters" gestures at universality but remains ornamental. The final image—"Lira's cranes wheeling eternal"—charges the closure without sermonizing, pulling the score toward 7.0, but the prompt-like phrasing ("fragile peace," "radiant agony") slightly undercuts earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Elar's perception. Diction is elevated and lyric—"veined with dream-quartz," "gossamer sheets," "refractive splendor"—creating a consistent voice. However, perceptual signature is generic: a grieving artisan could sound this way in many stories. Sentence rhythm shows variation but leans on repeated stems ("Elar's," "grief," "luminous") and stacked modifiers ("luminous torment," "radiant agony") that flatten rather than sharpen under peak stress. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance holds steady, and there's no head-hopping. The prose feels purposeful but not character-particular; the voice could belong to any contemplative craftsperson in a fantastical setting. The 9+ gate (distinct perceptual signature) is not met.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Information density is moderate; many sentences do double duty (e.g., "porcelain cups amid bonsai camellias" anchors setting and mood). However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn cluster throughout: "luminous torment" / "radiant agony" / "lacerating" / "luminous yet lacerating" recur across five beats without functional variation. Template cadence appears in parallel structures: "Elar's crafty mind," "Elar's crafty precision," "crafty lantern maker" (three mentions). The final third repeats "luminous" and "torment" in tight proximity without pattern-teaching or payoff beyond first use. Mixed metaphor: "shadow peel away like smoke" (solid→gas) followed by "detachment" (solid anchor) creates slight vehicle wobble. Filter-verb stack: "watched," "began," "approached," "entered," "ignited" in close sequence dull immediacy. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops, −0.4 for template stems, −0.3 for filter density: total ~−1.5 in Q7. Figurative language in most sentences of the transformation beat (ether, gossamer, veined, unfurling) without clear pattern justification adds −0.3 for density. No clarity break at closure, so artifact penalties stay within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—grief as material to be folded into origami via dream-recording lanterns on a floating isle—feels specific and memorable. The ascending/descending paradox and luminous torment motif create a coherent aesthetic. However, the emotional arc (grieving craftsman seeks ritual transformation and finds cathartic release) follows a familiar template; the glass basilica and dream-gem mechanics add fantastical detail but don't fundamentally challenge the structure. The transformation test is borderline: swap "lanterns" for "tapestries" or "cranes" for "butterflies" and the arc holds. Risk is present in the lyric density and the Charged Poise ending, but the piece hedges toward beauty over bold narrative choice. No close echo of famous work detected. Fresh inflection in the final image (cranes scattering torment into sparkles) elevates the score modestly, but the derivative grief-journey template and ornamental fantastical elements cap originality in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elar ("crafty lantern maker") is present throughout and his choices—selecting gems, polishing, brewing tea, folding cranes—drive the sequence. Setup: clear by first paragraph. Development: gem-polishing and tea-drinking (middle beats) are his actions. Payoff: the folding decision and "channeled the polished gems' power" directly shape the ending. Three beats, causal pressure moderate (the ritual follows his plan without friction), closure linkage strong (he performs the final transformation). Swappability low (his craft identity and prior lantern work matter). However, the story tells us he is "crafty" three times without showing ingenuity under constraint; his method proceeds unimpeded. Cost is present (shadow outline detaching, "lighter now" with visible emotional shift). Positives: +0.8 setup, +1.4 three beats, +1.0 causal pressure, +1.2 closure linkage, +0.5 specificity = ~+4.9. Frictions: label-only "crafty" trait −0.3, ornamental artisan identity −0.2 = −0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.9 − 0.5 = 7.4, round down to 7.4. But "crafty" is invoked without on-page cleverness overcoming obstacle; apply additional −0.6 for trait swappability, final 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Glass basilica appears in beat 1 (shimmered on the isle's crest, capturing dreams), beat 2 (approached threshold, hummed with archived dreams), beat 3 (entered, core nave, vaulted panes, chiming as cranes multiply), and payoff (cranes burst through glass vents). Setup early, development middle (provides amplification for dream projection), payoff (glass vents allow cranes to scatter). Three beats, causal role (the structure's acoustics and vents enable the final transformation), closure linkage (cranes exit through it). Specificity moderate (translucent spires, refractive walls). Cost connection indirect (the basilica facilitates rather than costs). Positives: +0.8 setup, +1.4 three beats, +1.0 causal pressure, +1.0 closure linkage, +0.4 specificity = +4.6. Frictions: the basilica could be swapped for another amplifying temple with minor edits −0.5, slightly ornamental in middle paragraphs −0.3 = −0.8. Base 3.0 + 4.6 − 0.8 = 6.8. The glass-vents detail and chiming resonance at closure add +0.4 for textural charge, final 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dream recording (polished gems etch visions into light) is introduced in paragraph 6, elaborated in gem-polishing sequence (paragraph 11–13), and executed when the lantern projects the recorded dream (paragraph 19) enabling transformation. Setup: late (~30% mark). Development: shapes the method (polishing to unveil facets that trap dreams). Payoff: the projection is the mechanism for materializing grief as ether. Two beats, causal pressure strong (without recording, no ether to fold), closure linkage direct (recorded dream becomes the folding material). Specificity high (dream-quartz, facets pulsing like heartbeats). Positives: +1.4 two beats, +1.2 causal pressure, +1.4 closure linkage, +0.6 specificity = +4.6. Frictions: late first mention −0.4, the concept is told more than shown in action (we see polishing and projection but not the mechanic's constraint or cost) −0.5 = −0.9. Base 3.0 + 4.6 − 0.9 = 6.1. However, the dream-recording enables the core transformation cleanly; add +0.3 for irreplaceability, final 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Descends while ascending" appears as the paradoxical helix staircase motif (paragraph 18–19) and thematic frame ("ascending physically, plummeting emotionally"). Setup: staircase described ~60% into text. Development: mirrors internal state but doesn't constrain a choice. Payoff: the final line "ascending the isle to descend into healing" reprises the paradox as closure commentary. One beat (staircase), lyric reprise at end. The attribute shapes mood and theme but not tactics; Elar's path is unchanged by the paradox. Positives: +1.4 closure linkage (final line reweights), +0.4 specificity (helix image). Frictions: late setup −0.5, ornamental (no tactical impact) −0.7, swappable (could be "balancing loss and hope") −0.5 = −1.7. Base 3.0 + 1.8 − 1.7 = 3.1. The lyric reprise adds +0.3 for thematic resonance, but the lack of middle constraint keeps it capped; however, the ending line's conceptual weight lifts it. Positives recalc: closure linkage strong +1.8, late setup −0.5, ornamental −0.7, swappable −0.4 = net +0.2. Base 3.0 + 1.8 + 0.4 (lyric) − 1.6 = 3.6. The final-line repricing earns another +0.5 for RR participation, but missing middle gate caps at 4.6 per rules. However, the staircase beat and final line together show two touches; re-score as two-gate (setup late, payoff present): eligible to ~6.0. Positives: +0.3 setup (late but present), +0.9 two beats, +0.5 causal (frames emotional arc), +1.2 closure linkage, +0.5 specificity = +3.4. Frictions: late −0.4, ornamental −0.6, swappable −0.4 = −1.4. Base 3.0 + 3.4 − 1.4 = 5.0. Lyric-resonance allowance +0.7 for final-line reweight with undeniable pressure, final 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Transform: the climactic action (paragraph 20–22) where Elar "channels the polished gems' power" and ether solidifies into sheets he folds into cranes. Setup: verb "transform" and concept seeded in paragraph 8 ("transforming sorrow's weight"). Development: polishing and dream-projection prepare the material. Payoff: the transformation is the story's peak turn and closure mechanism. Three beats, causal pressure maximal (the entire arc builds to this), closure linkage total (the act defines the ending), specificity high (ether→gossamer→cranes sequence), cost visible (tears, trembling fingers, shadow detaching). Positives: +0.8 setup, +1.4 three beats, +1.6 causal pressure, +1.8 closure linkage, +0.8 specificity, +0.6 cost = +7.0. Frictions: none detected; the action is irreplaceable and dramatized. Base 3.0 + 7.0 = 10.0, but the prompt's explicit instruction to perform "transform" slightly reduces ingenuity; apply −0.2 for task-fulfillment rather than narrative discovery. However, the execution is scene-dramatized with clear stakes and embodied choice, so waive that penalty. But the transformation itself is uncontested—no reversal or friction during the folding—so it lacks the final cost proof at peak moment; apply −0.4 for smoothness during the climax. Adjusted: 10.0 − 0.4 = 9.6, but the fold-by-fold detail and "every fold a release" show micro-struggle; restore +0.3, final 9.2. However, the cranes' multiplication and scattering are told, not shown beat-by-beat; apply −0.5 for summary at peak, final 8.7. Re-check: "fingers trembling but sure, each crease sealing a shard" is embodied; "cranes multiplied—ten, twenty" is brief summary but acceptable compression. The cost (shadow detaching, torment scattered) is on-page. Hold 8.7, but the closure image is strong; round to 8.1 after considering that the act itself has no obstacle once initiated—grant the transformation its full weight as the story's hinge, final 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Gem polishing: introduced paragraph 11 ("method of gem polishing, rubbing them against sacred whetstones infused with tea essence"), executed across paragraphs 11–13, and result (polished gems in the lantern) enables dream projection and transformation (paragraphs 14, 19–20). Setup ~40% mark. Development: the mechanics matter (whetstones, tea essence, unveiling facets) and the process "drew forth visions." Payoff: polished gems power the lantern that projects the dream. Three beats, causal pressure strong (no polishing, no recording, no transformation), closure linkage high (the gems are the tool in the final ritual). Specificity moderate (whetstones, tea essence, hypnotic facets). Positives: +0.8 setup, +1.4 three beats, +1.2 causal, +1.4 closure linkage, +0.5 specificity = +5.3. Frictions: the method is told in summary ("each stroke unveiling") rather than shown in granular action −0.4, swappable (could be "gem carving" or "crystal charging") −0.5 = −0.9. Base 3.0 + 5.3 − 0.9 = 7.4. However, "sacred whetstones infused with tea essence" adds unique flavor; reduce swappability friction to −0.3. Adjusted: 3.0 + 5.3 − 0.7 = 7.6. But the polishing itself doesn't face obstacle or cost on the page; it succeeds smoothly. Apply −0.7 for lack of struggle during method execution, final 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Floating island tea garden: present from paragraph 2 onward, provides the location for gem selection (paragraph 10, "dream-quartz harvested from the island's misty roots"), the pavilion workspace (paragraph 9), the staircase terraces (paragraph 19), and the scatter-target for the final cranes (paragraph 23, "tea mists parting to reveal stars"). Setup early, development middle (supplies dream-quartz resource, workspace, transit path), payoff (cranes scatter over it, mists part for closure image). Four touches across beats. Causal role: the isle's resources (dream-quartz, thermal updrafts, tea-essence whetstones) enable the plan; the terraces and basilica structure the journey. Closure linkage: cranes scatter "over the tea garden below" and final mists-parting image anchors resolution. Specificity high (bonsai camellias, porcelain cups, iridescent dew, eternal dusk). Positives: +0.8 setup, +1.4 three+ beats, +1.2 causal, +1.2 closure linkage, +0.7 specificity = +5.3. Frictions: the garden is more atmospheric stage than active constraint; Elar's choices aren't limited by it −0.5, postcard-description moments (camellias weeping dew) without tactical use −0.3 = −0.8. Base 3.0 + 5.3 − 0.8 = 7.5. The dream-quartz harvest and thermal updrafts do supply resources, reducing ornamental penalty to −0.4. Adjusted: 3.0 + 5.3 − 0.6 = 7.7. However, the resource use is brief mention, not on-page scarcity or access challenge; apply −0.3 for thin development, final 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the shadow detaches" frames the timeframe from paragraph 1 and recurs in paragraph 9 ("After the shadow's departure") and final paragraph ("After the shadow detached"). Setup immediate. Development: the "after" state motivates the quest but doesn't create urgency or ticking pressure; the narrative unfolds at a meditative pace without time constraints. Payoff: the final-paragraph reprise closes the frame ("this was his reckoning: ascending the isle to descend into healing"). Two beats (opening frame, closing callback). The timeframe marks a threshold but doesn't tighten decisions; Elar has unlimited time to polish, brew, ascend, fold. Positives: +0.8 setup, +0.9 two beats, +0.8 closure linkage (frame closure). Frictions: no tactical pressure from time −0.8, told rather than felt −0.4, swappable (could be "after Lira's death") −0.5 = −1.7. Base 3.0 + 2.5 − 1.7 = 3.8. The lyric frame earns +0.3 for thematic bookend, but the lack of urgency limits functional score. However, "after" as a liminal marker does establish emotional stakes; the shadow's absence is the wound he addresses. Adjust frictions: no urgency −0.6 (not −0.8), told −0.3 (not −0.4). Base 3.0 + 2.5 − 1.4 = 4.1. Lyric +0.3, specificity (shadow detachment as inciting event) +0.4, final 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to fold grief into origami cranes" is explicit in paragraph 8 ("he yearned to fold it into origami cranes, transforming sorrow's weight into soaring symbols of fragile peace, as Lira had taught") and drives the entire second half: selecting gems to record grief (paragraph 10–13), projecting the dream (paragraph 19), and executing the folding (paragraph 20–22). Setup early (~30%), development throughout (every action serves this goal), payoff total (the cranes are the story's climax and closure image). Three beats, causal pressure high (the motive explains all tactics), closure linkage maximal (cranes scatter grief, final image "Lira's cranes wheeling eternal"). Specificity strong (origami as Lira's teaching, cranes as the exact form). Cost visible (tears, trembling, shadow detaching). Positives: +0.8 setup, +1.4 three beats, +1.4 causal, +1.8 closure linkage, +0.7 specificity, +0.5 cost = +6.6. Frictions: the motive is told ("he yearned") rather than shown through conflicted micro-choices −0.4, no competing want or obstacle tests commitment −0.5 = −0.9. Base 3.0 + 6.6 − 0.9 = 8.7. However, paragraph 8 does show internal friction ("grief refused simple release"); restore +0.2. The final folding sequence includes embodied struggle ("fingers trembling but sure"), reducing told-only penalty to −0.2. Adjusted frictions: −0.2 told, −0.3 lack of obstacle = −0.5. Base 3.0 + 6.6 − 0.5 = 9.1. But the absence of a live competing desire (e.g., fear of letting go vs. need to transform) limits dramatized conflict; apply −0.6 for want/need simplicity. Adjusted: 9.1 − 0.6 = 8.5. The motive is character-particular (Lira's teaching) and irreplaceable; add +0.3 for specificity bonus. However, already credited in positives; hold 8.5. Re-check cost proof: "each crease sealing a shard of torment" and "shadow's faint outline detaching" are on-page. The score fits high integration. But no mid-journey doubt or tactical shift tests the motive; it proceeds linearly. Apply −0.5 for friction absence during execution, final 8.0. However, the motive *is* the stake and shapes every beat without deviation—this is strength, not weakness in a ritual-driven accumulative design. Restore to 8.5, but the lack of on-page hesitation or complication during folding slightly undercuts dramatization; settle at 8.2. The trembling fingers and tears are embodied; upgrade to 8.4. The element's integration is near-indispensable but the telling in paragraph 8 and smooth execution cap it below 8.5. Final: 7.6 after accounting for told-first presentation and one-directional drive without friction that tests commitment on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tone "luminous torment": the phrase and cognates ("radiant agony," "luminous yet lacerating," "luminous mists," "luminous paths") appear in paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 13, 16, 18, 19, 23. Setup immediate, sustained throughout, payoff in final image ("cranes scattering luminous torment into harmless sparkles"). The tone is coherent and consistent, modulating from oppressive (early beats) to cathartic (ending). The oxymoron (luminous + torment) charges the conceptual field and the final transformation reweights "luminous" from pain-marker to beauty-marker. Positives: +0.8 setup, +1.4 three+ beats, +1.2 causal (tone shapes perception and stakes), +1.6 closure linkage (final image redefines "luminous"), +0.7 specificity (the paradox is memorable). Total +5.7. Frictions: overuse as a label (appears seven times) without varied embodiment −0.6, some static repetition ("luminous torment" in paragraphs 1, 16, 23 without functional shift until the last) −0.4 = −1.0. Base 3.0 + 5.7 − 1.0 = 7.7. The final reweighting (torment→sparkles) is earned and pays off the recurrence; add +0.4 for pattern payoff. Adjusted: 7.7 + 0.4 = 8.1. However, mid-story uses (paragraphs 13, 16, 18) feel ornamental rather than escalating; the tone doesn't modulate with pressure so much as repeat. Apply −0.3 for static middle, final 7.8.</comment>
