<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer remains a static vessel for ornamental atmosphere rather than a character with contradictory impulses. Her motivation is declared ("to find the Library of Unspoken Words") but never tested by on-page friction or meaningful cost—she simply follows clues to success. Interiority consists of label-only feelings ("cautious exuberance," "cautious thrill") recycled across beats without embodied degradation under pressure. The final transformation is asserted ("emerged transformed") rather than earned through a renunciation or difficult choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (veiled dreamer, glowing library, fateful letter). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: mists, runes, and propagation delays layer toward the discovery of the inner sanctum. However, closure lacks visible cost—she simply "sealed her tome" after documenting words with no on-page price, forfeiture, or stance crystallization that reconfigures prior stakes. The "second letter's shadow loomed" is a gesture toward future consequence but delivers no felt change in the present, failing the on-page closure gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glowing library with mist-shrouded shelves and amber-violet stacks establishes vivid sensory atmosphere early. Spatial choreography tracks clearly (pedestal, archway, inner sanctum progression). The watch functions as a micro-setting object that constrains her cipher-solving attempt, and "propagation delays" manifests as both auditory lag and visual flicker, pressuring her decoding method. The setting does not evolve causally after early establishment, and the final sanctum is described but does not impose a new obstacle or choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (find the Library of Unspoken Words) is signaled early but never genuinely threatened. The watch cipher unfolds through patient observation with no failed attempt, dead end, or trade-off; she documents delays, follows the trail, and succeeds without visible cost or tactic alteration. "Emboldened yet alert to illusions" promises pressure from the confidence man's legacy, but no illusion materializes to test her. Escalation is decorative (mists thicken, lights flicker) rather than a narrowing of options or a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of unspoken truths and silenced words threads through the library's nature and the protagonist's quest, emerging from imagery rather than direct statement. The watch's cyclically reversed mechanism subtly mirrors recovery of deferred narratives. However, the ending dissolves into abstract catalog ("regrets unspoken, loves unconfessed, truths buried deep") and asserts resonance ("delays dissolving into timeless clarity") instead of delivering a concrete image or choice that reweights prior material. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves with sentimental satisfaction rather than earned ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV distance and tense remain stable in third-person limited. Perceptual signature shows some bias (veiled vision, whispered secrets), but diction often drifts into elevated register ("liminal time," "deferred narratives," "arcane") that exceeds the focalizer's lived idiom under pressure. The single line of dialogue ("Seek the heart where words unspoken dwell, beyond the mist's delay") reads as thematic echo rather than character-specific speech. Psychic distance is consistent, but the prose converges on a decorative lyricism that flattens urgency during the cipher-solving beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence stacks figurative language ("veil fluttering like whispered secrets," "mists curling like tentative fingers," "delays dissolving into timeless clarity") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density penalties. Paraphrase loops recur: "cautious exuberance" appears three times, "cyclically reversed" twice in adjacent paragraphs restating the same mechanic. Template cadence in the middle section: "She [verb], [gerund]" across four consecutive beats. Synonym churn ("exhilaration," "exuberance," "thrill") and stock metaphors ("heart racing yet restrained") dull momentum at the cipher-solving climax. Combined artifacts touch closure ("emerged transformed"), disallowing 9+ globally and applying −1.4 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The confidence man's watch with reversed hands and the propagation-delay method offer some specificity, but the quest-into-mystical-library frame is a widely used template executed without transformation through lived contradiction or non-obvious moral calculus. The cipher unfolds as patient decoding with no setback or friction, and the protagonist's success feels preordained rather than inevitable in hindsight. Emotional arc (cautious exuberance → triumph) follows a predictable line without risk. The particulars (veiled dreamer, glowing library, unspoken words) could swap into adjacent fantasy-quest premises with minimal structural change.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer is present throughout and makes micro-decisions (lift the watch, listen, document, follow the trail, enter the archway), satisfying setup, development, and payoff gates. However, her choices do not narrow options or create visible cost—each decision flows smoothly to success without trade-off or consequence. She observes, decodes, and succeeds in a linear path; no choice alters tactics or forecloses a meaningful alternative. Swappable protagonist: the role could transfer to any curious seeker without restructuring the plot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The confidence man's watch appears early (pedestal beat), is examined and used to decode the cipher (middle beats via tick delays), and is pocketed at closure, crossing all three gates. Its cyclically reversed hands and unfolding runes drive the decoding attempt across at least two distinct beats. However, its role is ornamental mechanically—she simply listens, documents, and follows; the watch does not impose a constraint or trade-off. The legend of the confidence man promises trickery but delivers none, reducing irreplaceability. Present across beats but functional rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The unfolding cipher (runes that shift and require sequential alignment via propagation delays) is introduced early on the watch face, constrains her method in the middle (she must document delays to unlock the sequence), and yields the path to the inner sanctum, crossing all gates. It shapes one key turn: the cipher's solution directs her inward. However, the mechanics remain decorative—no failed interpretation, no ambiguity cost, no choice between competing readings. The concept enables rather than pressures, and its causal work is singular rather than iterative.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Cyclically reversed is labeled twice in adjacent paragraphs, describing the watch's hands and the cipher's logic. It appears early and is invoked at the middle confirmation beat ("The watch's hands looped reversed again"), crossing setup and development. However, it functions as description rather than constraint—no on-page action depends on reversing direction or timing a reversal. She adapts by documenting delays, but reversing per se does not enable or block a choice. Swappable with "nested" or "layered" ciphers without restructuring stakes, capping at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Document (scribbling patterns on parchment, documenting the cipher, capturing unspoken words in her tome) recurs across at least three beats and drives the protagonist's method throughout: listening, marking delays, recording the sequence, and finally sealing her findings. It is present early (she clutches the missive), central to the cipher-solving turn, and shapes the closure image (sealed tome). The action is essential to her tactics and irreplaceable—without documentation, no cipher unlock or sanctum record. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage elevate the score, though the lack of visible trade-off (no choice about what to omit or risk in recording) prevents highest-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Through propagation delays is introduced at the cipher beat ("the mists carried echoes of the watch's ticks, sounds lingering and overlapping") and returns in the deeper-library passage ("propagation delays now visual in flickering shelf lights"), crossing setup, development, and a visual reprise near closure. The method shapes her tactic: she listens for lagged chimes and marks intervals to align runes. However, the mechanics remain ornamental—no false delay, no timing failure, no cost for misreading lag. The method enables but does not constrain or pressure a choice, limiting it to mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Glowing library in mist is anchored in the opening line, populates every beat (shelves, pedestal, archway, mists thickening), and the inner sanctum forms the closure destination. The fog imposes propagation delays that shape the cipher-solving method, and mist dampening her veil is noted. The library supplies the resource (watch, cipher, echoes) and pressures her path (dense fog, delayed lights). However, the environment does not evolve causally or impose a trade-off choice—no navigational cost, no mist-induced ambiguity she must resolve under pressure. Strong presence and tactical shaping across all gates, but passive rather than dynamic constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Between two fateful letters is declared in the opening block ("This liminal time, between those two fateful letters, was her window") and returns at closure ("just before the second's shadow loomed"). It frames the quest but does not tighten tactics—no countdown, no urgency forcing a trade-off, no consequence for delay. The timeframe is told rather than tracked on the page; she proceeds at a measured pace without time pressure altering her choices. Functional framing but ornamental in execution, capping in low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>To find the Library of Unspoken Words is stated early ("Her motivation burned steady") and pursued across every beat, culminating in entry to the sanctum at closure, crossing all gates. However, the desire is declared rather than dramatized through friction or cost: no competing pull, no temptation to abandon the quest, no sacrifice required to enter. She wants, seeks, and succeeds without internal contradiction or visible price. Functional motivation that drives the plot but lacks the conflicted choice or trade-off that would reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Cautious exuberance is labeled three times ("cautious exuberance," "cautious thrill," "Cautious exuberance peaked") and modulates in the prose (wariness + joy, restraint + excitement). It is present early, sustained in middle beats ("exhilaration surged," "emboldened yet alert"), and named again at closure. However, the tone is asserted via labels rather than enacted through rhythm or diction shift under pressure—the prose remains uniformly elevated and decorative throughout. The final image does not charge or break the tone; it simply repeats the label. Present and coherent but static, fitting low-functional band.</comment>
