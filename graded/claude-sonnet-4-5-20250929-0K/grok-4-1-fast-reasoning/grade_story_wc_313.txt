<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "spin stories into shared meaning" is asserted but his on-page choices read as patrol and passive observation until Mira arrives. The guilt-driven vigilance is told retrospectively rather than shown through embodied contradiction in scene. Internal conflict is summarized ("guilt had driven him to vigilance") rather than acted simultaneously, and the boyish-Elias memory arrives as backstory dump without altering present tactics until the final exchange. The burning of photographs and handing over the label feel like gestures of resolution without visible cost foreclosing a live path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—Elias's name, role, and the resurfacing-town premise arrive gradually across the first third without early anchoring. The trail of photographs functions as a situational complication but lacks causal linkage: each photo is discovered in sequence without Elias making choices that narrow options. The closure—burning photos and sharing the label—gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is abstract ("expunged shadows") rather than a visible forfeiture on the page. The lens wobbles between accumulative (trail of images) and causal (guilt revelation) without resolving to one dominant mode at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The midnight ridgeway and resurfacing spires provide atmospheric anchors, and the sapphire label functions as a micro-object. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (shack, levee edge, overlook), though the ridgeway's geography remains vague. The label and photographs constrain the trail Elias follows, but the environment itself does not pressure his choices—he could walk this trail anywhere. The final image of spires "like sapphire promises" repeats the hue but does not charge the closure with environmental cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias reckoning with his buried guilt—is signaled midway but never tested by a choice that narrows options. The photographs lead him to the memory, but he does not resist or alter tactics; discovery is linear. Mira's arrival provides a conversation partner but no opposition or complication that raises cost. The act of burning photos is framed as resolution but lacks a visible price: what does Elias lose or foreclose by expunging the memory? The resurfacing town promises stakes but remains scenic backdrop.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory, guilt, shared narrative—is declared in abstract phrases ("spin stories into shared meaning," "expunge is not to erase") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The sapphire label recurs but its meaning shift is asserted ("promises") not earned through action. The ending's "healed waters" and "woven light" replace scene pressure with thematic summary. The story states its moral rather than letting the burning of photos and the label-passing embody it without commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("mirrored hush," "midnight's embrace," "fracturing souls") that reads ornamental rather than voice-specific. Dialogue between Elias and Mira is sparse and functional but lacks subtext or character-specific idiom—both speak in the same register of careful, thesis-adjacent lines. The repeated phrases ("mirrored hush," "precisely humane," "sapphire hue") function as motif anchors but become template cadence when over-deployed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "hush" and its variants appear eight times, "sapphire" six times, "precisely humane" three times, often in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs ("The ridgeway... The hush... The trail...") and filter-verb stacks ("spotted," "knelt," "lifted," "turned") dull immediacy. Figurative language clusters in non-pressure beats ("twilight bled into the ridgeway's midnight veil") without pattern-teaching. The final third repeats closure gestures ("whole," "peace," "grace") in summary rather than scene. Line-level artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The guilt-driven-warden-confronts-past-mistake premise is familiar, and the story does not transform it through unexpected choices or world logic. The sapphire label and photograph trail function as discovery devices but could be replaced with other objects without structural change. The resurfacing town offers visual potential but remains scenic metaphor rather than active constraint. Emotional beats resolve predictably: guilt revealed, stranger arrives, catharsis through shared ritual, lighter ending. No bold risk heightens stakes or complicates the redemption arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his final choice to burn the photos and give Mira the label occurs on-page, satisfying setup, development, and payoff gates. However, his warden role—vigilance, patrol, levee knowledge—does not constrain or enable the key turn; his guilt and storytelling motivation drive the arc, not his occupation. He observes and reacts to the trail rather than making decisions that alter tactics. The closure gesture is thematically consistent but swappable: another character with guilt could perform the same arc with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The label appears early (first third), is lifted and examined in one beat, and is passed to Mira in the final beat—three touches across setup, middle, and closure. Its sapphire hue recurs as motif anchor, and the closing image reweights it as "promises." However, the label itself does not constrain Elias's choices or enable tactics; it is discovered, kept, and transferred without cost tied to its properties. Removing the label and replacing it with another keepsake would require only surface edits, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The resurfacing town is the inciting condition (drought gnaws, town emerges) and frames the ending image (spires glinting, "reborn"). It appears in setup, middle (emerging spires), and closure, satisfying all three gates. The concept shapes Elias's emotional stakes (guilt resurfacing with the town) but does not alter his on-page tactics or choices—he could confront his guilt through other triggers. The town functions more as thematic metaphor than active constraint, keeping it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Precisely humane" is asserted three times as a label ("precisely humane in his vigilance," "gaze meeting hers," "act precisely humane") but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. The trait is told rather than shown through a decision where precision or humanity forces a tradeoff. Burning the photos is framed as humane, but the act does not dramatize tension between precision and mercy. The attribute reads as decorative characterization without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Expunge" appears in dialogue ("To expunge is not to erase") and frames the thematic resolution, satisfying closure participation. However, the action of expunging—burning the photos—is introduced late (final third) and does not shape earlier tactics or create a problem it must then solve. The act could be replaced with another ritual (burying, scattering, keeping) without breaking the story's logic. Late arrival and swappability cap the score at 4.6 per the missing-setup penalty.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The trail of photographs is signaled early ("what became a trail of photographs"), structures the middle beats (Elias follows from image to image), and delivers the forgotten memory at the overlook, satisfying all three gates. The method constrains Elias's path and enables the reveal of his guilt. However, the mechanics are passive—photos are simply discovered in sequence without requiring choices or imposing cost. The trail could be replaced with another discovery device (inscriptions, artifacts) with moderate edits, keeping it in the essential-but-not-indispensable range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The midnight ridgeway is named and described in setup, provides the path for the trail in the middle, and frames the final image ("ridgeway held its midnight peace"). It satisfies all three gates but functions primarily as backdrop: the ridgeway's properties do not constrain Elias's choices or alter tactics. Removing "ridgeway" and replacing it with "levee path" or "hillside" would require only surface edits. Spatial grounding is present but not load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The wind chime falling silent is mentioned in the opening beat and reprised briefly near the end ("wind chime stirred faintly, but silence had taught its lesson"). It satisfies setup and closure participation but is absent from middle development. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Elias's patrol and conversation with Mira unfold without time pressure. The chime functions as atmospheric detail rather than a clock that alters moves, and its silence carries thematic weight but no tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to spin stories into shared meaning" is stated early ("His motivation burned steady") and enacted in the final exchange with Mira ("he wove the trail's tale," "spin this into your story now"), satisfying setup and closure. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices in the middle. Elias's storytelling is frictionless—no cost or competing want tests his motivation. The motivation could be replaced with "to atone" or "to heal" without structural change, and the lack of on-page friction keeps it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" appears in setup, middle, and closure, satisfying all three gates and functioning as a recurring tonal anchor. The phrase is present across beats and modulates slightly (from solitary to "no longer solitary but echoed"), supporting the ending's emotional shift. However, the tone is consistent rather than dynamic under pressure—no tonal break or dissonance charges the final image. The hush mirrors Elias's interior state but does not constrain his choices or impose cost, keeping it in the purposeful-but-not-indispensable range.</comment>
