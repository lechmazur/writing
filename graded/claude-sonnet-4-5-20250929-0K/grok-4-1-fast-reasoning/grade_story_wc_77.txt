<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes mid-story ("to trick Fear"), but her interior life is overwhelmed by ornamental horror imagery rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The suicide confession arrives late without prior embodied struggle, reading as a reveal rather than earned psychological erosion. Emotional states are labeled ("Terror gripped her") instead of enacted through perception and micro-choices. The final walking-away lacks visible cost—her "repulsive allure" persists as decoration, not a foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly. However, causality fractures: the whispering advisor appears without setup, the dream dictionary's "paradoxical notes" solve the problem they did not create, and Fear's weakness is declared rather than dramatized through prior pressure. The closure unit—Fear dissolving after Elara hurls the clasp—feels mechanical; the cost (lingering luminance, retrieved clasp) contradicts the stated victory. Drive lens reads Causal but because/therefore linkage breaks at the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The funhouse setting supplies vivid sensory detail (moldy cotton candy, warped mirrors, mercury tears) and recurs across beats. Spatial choreography remains clear. However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices—she moves freely through chambers without the funhouse layout forcing trade-offs. The mirrors and booth function as backdrop rather than tactical pressure points, keeping this in the functional mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("escape post-resuscitation limbo") is declared but never tested on-page; Elara encounters no failed attempts or visible prices before the climax. The unbosoming recitations occur without prior resistance or cost, flattening escalation. Fear's lunge and dissolution happen in rapid sequence without a tightening that narrows options. The ending claims victory but shows no foreclosed path or tactical alteration, only decorative persistence of the luminance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges around shame, confession, and survival, but the final image ("Victory curses the victor" note, luminance pulsing, clasp winking) asserts paradox rather than earning it through particulars. The unbosoming ritual and Fear's vulnerability to "unspoken truths" are told, not woven into prior choices. Elara's arc—from unwilling resuscitee to self-liberator—lacks on-page friction; the last lines ("forever changed") state transformation without a resonant image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("hulking silhouette coalescing," "operatic tragedies," "magnetic pull, putrid breath") that clashes with a carnival survivor's immediate cognition under stress. The advisor's "silken rasp" and Elara's own narration share ornamental texture, flattening voice distinction. Filter verbs cluster ("seemed to flex," "promise of oblivion") in peak beats, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Pervasive overwriting: figurative density in nearly every sentence ("bioluminescent slime trailing from a deep-sea abomination," "lovers in agony," "mercury tears") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops abound: "repulsive allure" recurs five times; "luminance/glow" chains across adjacent lines. Template cadence: "She [verb], the [noun]…" runs through multiple beats. Stock metaphors (maw/vortex of teeth, weeping mirrors) and therapy-speak ("unbosom," "shame photographically cursed") in the climax trigger cumulative penalties. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final "luminance pulsed once more"), disallowing 9+ and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The carnival-funhouse frame and "photographically cursed luminance" offer surface novelty, but the core arc—protagonist defeats personified Fear through confession—follows a familiar exorcism template without transformation. The paradoxical notes and unbosoming method appear suddenly to resolve the conflict. Elara's final state (glowing, walking into dawn, cursed lifted yet allure lingering) hedges rather than commits, sacrificing bold closure for tidy ambiguity. Specificity (opera clasp, Polaroids) remains ornamental rather than causally irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The whispering advisor appears mid-story without setup, offers tactical guidance ("Seek the dream dictionary," "Now, the clasp—offer it as bait"), and is revealed as "Fear's echo" in the final third. It narrates rather than deciding; Elara executes the advisor's instructions without friction. Counts as two beats (dictionary guidance, clasp-bait instruction) but resolves a problem it did not create, and the echo-reveal is told rather than earned. Cap 3.0 for late problem-solving; further reduce for summary-only involvement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The opera cloak clasp is seeded early (pilfered from trunk, grandmother's heirloom, "pulsing faintly in sync with her luminance"), pinned to her dress mid-story, hurled into Fear's maw at climax (emerald eyes flare, latches onto throat), and retrieved in the final lines ("winked mockingly"). Beats: discovery, anchoring ritual, weapon, recovery. However, any bat-shaped talisman could substitute; the "operatic tragedies" echo never constrains a choice or alters tactics. Setup, development, and payoff gates met, eligible for mid-6s, but swappability and ornamental operatic detail cap at 5.9; round to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lingering luminance is seeded immediately ("sickly glow emanating from her skin"), recurs across beats (photographs ignite, mirrors reflect "iridescent veins," luminance blazes to flood the funhouse, dims at dawn, pulses in final line), and shapes the repulsive-allure tone. However, it does not constrain a tactical choice—Elara's movements and unbosoming proceed identically with or without the glow. The luminance functions as atmospheric marker rather than causal lever. Setup and closure-reprise gates met; middle development weak. Lyric resonance (early seed → final pulse) and tone-charging lift to low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Photographically cursed" is explained mid-story (any photograph of Elara ignites, burning viewers' eyes with visions of buried horrors; scattered Polaroids smoke when she nears). It appears in one beat (Polaroids smoking) and is referenced in the unbosoming recitation ("each flash a wound that weeps luminance eternal"). The curse is lifted off-page ("curse lifted, photographs now mere shadows"). No on-page cost or enabling action tied to this trait; the smoking Polaroids do not alter Elara's tactics. Setup and closure mention present but middle development and visible tradeoff absent. Cap 3.8 for swappability and ornamental use; label-only recitation and summary-only lift −0.6 to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Unbosom" is signaled via the advisor's command ("it hungers for your unbosoming"), executed in the climactic beat (three confessions: resuscitation drowned the girl, photographically cursed shatters lenses, died willing it), and stated as the method that starves Fear ("I thrive on hidden truths; unbosom all, and I starve!"). The action drives the resolution but is swappable with "confess" or "reveal." The unbosoming recitations occur without prior resistance or failed attempts, reducing causal necessity. Setup, development (recitations), and payoff gates met; eligible for mid-6s, but ease of synonym swap and summary-declared outcome cap at 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dream dictionary with paradoxical notes is introduced at the advisor's instruction, found in the fortune-teller's booth, and Elara reads entries ("Shadows grant clarity" beneath "light"; "confession silences the soul" opposed by "unbosoming frees the chained"). The notes fuel her recitations and Fear howls paradoxes from the dictionary when dying. However, the dictionary appears in second half (late setup −0.3), its mechanics are told rather than demonstrated (Elara does not puzzle through contradictions; she recites), and any book of riddles could substitute. Setup weak, middle functional, payoff present; swappability and summary-only use cap at 4.6, ornamental −0.3, template phrasing on beats ("note read," "flipping to note") −0.2 cumulative to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival funhouse anchors setting from the opening (Elara wakes inside), supplies spatial progression (dim corridors → mirror chamber → fortune-teller's booth), and recurs at closure ("funhouse silent after her resuscitation's echo"; "funhouse mirrors cracked in distant applause"). The warped mirrors multiply Elara's reflection and provide the surface where Fear coalesces; the booth houses the dictionary. Setup, development (mirrors and booth as discovery sites), and payoff (final image references funhouse) gates met. However, the funhouse does not constrain a choice—Elara moves freely without the layout forcing trade-offs. Eligible for low-6s; round to 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the resuscitation" frames the timeframe from the opening line and recurs in final-third references ("post-resuscitation limbo," "after her resuscitation's echo"). The timeframe establishes Elara's altered state (luminance, curse) but does not tighten decisions—no clock, no time pressure that narrows options. The "after" is static context rather than live constraint. Setup and closure mention present; middle development (no urgency or ticking cost) absent. Cap 4.6 for missing development gate; ornamental use −0.5, label-only −0.3 cumulative to 3.8; round to 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to trick Fear into revealing its weakness" crystallizes mid-story and drives the climactic unbosoming sequence. However, the motivation is declared ("Her motivation crystallized") rather than shown through prior struggle or conflicting impulses. The trick succeeds on first attempt without friction between wants and costs. Setup mid-story (−0.4 for late signal), development (unbosoming recitations pursue the goal), payoff (Fear reveals weakness and dissolves). Told-only framing and lack of on-page friction cap at 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Repulsive allure" is seeded in the opening third ("repulsive allure drew her deeper," "alluringly hideous," "begged to be touched yet repulsed the hand"), recurs through the story (Fear's "grotesque charm," "alluring in its promise of oblivion"), and closes the piece ("In the repulsive allure of survival, she thrived"). The tone is consistent and charges the final image. However, the oxymoron is asserted through adjective pairing rather than enacted through contradictory sensory or emotional pulls that alter Elara's choices. Setup, development (recurrence), and payoff gates met; lyric reprise present. Static mood without modulation under pressure caps at mid-6; label-reliance −0.3 to 5.9; round to 5.6.</comment>
