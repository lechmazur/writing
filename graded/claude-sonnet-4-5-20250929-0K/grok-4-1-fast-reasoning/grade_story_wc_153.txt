<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find "the moment before deciding" is clear and sustained, but her choices feel driven more by the story's need to deploy elements than by contradictory interior impulses. The fierce tenderness label appears repeatedly without embodied friction—no moment shows her torn between pride and vulnerability in real time. The healing shard and spirit-song mechanics dominate her actions, leaving little room for micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. Thorne materializes as a vision-reward rather than through an earned confrontation with her own agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: spirits' songs, unsent letters, and condensation motifs layer toward a final reunion. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The closure—Thorne's appearance and mutual embrace—lands on the page, but the cost remains abstract: "wounds sealed" and "love fierce and whole" declare resolution without showing what Elara forfeited or what live option she foreclosed. The shard's healing and the spirits' cooperative weaving make the reunion feel granted rather than earned through a decision that narrows her world.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth supplies vivid sensory anchors—twisted roots, brackish tides, glass-like leaves—and the setting pressures Elara's path through shifting trails and spirit-thorn injuries. The shard heals her thigh wound, a micro-constraint that ties body to environment. However, spatial choreography at the heart-throne and the condensation windows remains illustrative rather than tactically decisive; the environment stages rather than forces her final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconnecting with Thorne via unsent apologies—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the labyrinth's resistance and the spirits' songs, but no on-page reversal forces Elara to trade one good for another or alter her tactics under cost. The shard warms, the spirits cooperate, and Thorne appears when evoked; coincidence (the spirits' empathy, the shard's moonlight pulse) resolves rather than complicates. The vision of Thorne turning away is a micro turn, yet it does not foreclose a path—Elara pushes deeper without visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of regret, silence, and healing emerges from the unsent letters and the repeated phrase "apology waited unspoken," avoiding overt thesis. The final image—hand-in-hand emergence, "apology no longer unspoken"—offers thematic closure. However, the resolution into "fierce and whole" love smooths complexity; no counter-reading survives the ending, and the shard's healing becomes a literal cure rather than a resonant metaphor that reweights prior cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated and lyric ("ethereal hymns," "cathedral of green gloom"), which fits the atmospheric mode but occasionally drifts into decorative register ("fierce tenderness" recurs as a label rather than emerging through syntax under stress). Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices spirits, roots, moonlight—but does not shift distinctly when pressure peaks. Dialogue with Thorne is brief and serves closure without subtext or goal-conflict.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Density is high, but overwriting and template cadence weaken propulsion. "Fierce tenderness" appears six times, often as a stock phrase; "unsent letters" and "apology waited unspoken" loop without added nuance. Sentence stems repeat: "The shard [verb]," "Spirits [verb]," "She [verb]." Mixed metaphors cluster: spirits "weave" hymns, vines "claim" shores, fog "condenses" into messages—vehicles shift without coherent physical logic. Figurative saturation in nearly every sentence (especially around the heart-throne climax) blurs concrete action. Paraphrase loops: "fierce tenderness" is declared, then "fiercely tender words," then "fierce tenderness" again within three paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The mangrove-spirit setting and condensation-window mechanic offer fresh texture, but the core arc—protagonist seeks lost lover via mystical means, apologizes, and reunites—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived cost or non-obvious moral calculus. The shard's healing and the spirits' cooperative empathy resolve obstacles conveniently. No bold risk or structural choice heightens stakes; the journey feels illustrative of the prompt elements rather than an inevitable synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her quest frames all beats, but her choices (kneel, trace runes, evoke, push deeper) advance the plot mechanically rather than creating key reversals. Her decision-making does not narrow live options or force trade-offs; the spirits and shard enable rather than resist. She observes visions and reacts, but does not make a choice that fundamentally alters tactics or stakes at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The gargoyle shard appears early (salvaged from the spire), heals Elara's thigh mid-journey (one functional beat), glows during evocations, and "bridges" her to Thorne at closure (three touches across setup, middle, end). Its moonlight-healing property enables rather than constrains; removing it would require minor edits but not break the closure logic, since the spirits and condensation already perform the reunion work. The shard's symbolic charge—captured storm, healing light—remains ornamental at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Unsent letters are seeded early (in her satchel, "stained with ink and unshed tears"), drive her motivation, and their words etch into the condensation at the heart-throne climax, materializing as Thorne reads them. The concept shapes two key beats (evoking at the pool, final reunion) and the closure hinges on the apology becoming "no longer unspoken." Cost is implied—years of silence—but the letters themselves do not constrain a present choice or force Elara to sacrifice an alternative path on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The shard "heals in moonlight" is mentioned early and demonstrated once (knitting her thigh gash). At closure it "heals deeper wounds—the regret" and "bridges" the reunion, but these uses are asserted rather than shown with on-page cost or tactical constraint. The healing enables rather than complicates; no visible trade-off (e.g., moonlight required at a dangerous moment, or healing one wound prevents another) shapes her decisions. Label-only at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Evoke" appears in setup ("evoke the past's echo"), twice at the pool clearing (tracing runes, spirits swell), and again at the heart-throne ("She evoked again"). Each evocation advances pressure and the final one materializes Thorne, making it central to closure. However, the mechanics are vague—"evoke the spirits," "evoking the unsent"—and the action could be replaced with "summon" or "call forth" with minor rewrites. It drives turns but lacks irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Messages in condensation on glass-like mangrove leaves are seeded at the pool ("fog rose," "condensation beaded"), used once there ("drew in the mist: 'Thorne, forgive...'"), amplified by her tears mid-journey, and return at the heart-throne where Thorne "read the condensation's truths." The method shapes two distinct beats and participates in closure. However, it remains somewhat decorative—mist-writing could swap for spirit-song lyrics or written runes without structural collapse—and the mechanics (how condensation persists, how Thorne reads ephemeral fog) are not rigorously traced.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is introduced early, supplies obstacles (shifting paths, spirit-thorn lash, fog), and houses the spirits whose songs pressure and assist Elara. The setting frames all action and its "heart" provides the closure stage. However, the labyrinth does not meaningfully constrain tactics—Elara pushes deeper without navigation cost or resource trade-offs—and the spirits ultimately cooperate rather than resist. The setting stages rather than forces the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"The moment before deciding" and "space where apology waited unspoken" recur as thematic anchors and frame Elara's goal. The timeframe is conceptual rather than literal—no ticking clock or temporal constraint tightens decisions. At closure Thorne says "I waited...for this moment before deciding," which reprises the phrase, but the "space" functions as metaphor rather than a pressure that alters Elara's moves on the page. Present in setup and closure but does not shape middle tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to find the moment before deciding, to apologize for silence—is stated early, drives her journey into the labyrinth, and is dramatized through her actions (clutching letters, tracing runes, weeping). The motivation persists to closure where it is fulfilled. However, internal friction between pride and vulnerability is told ("haste and pride...chose silence") rather than shown in contradictory on-page impulses; no scene forces her to choose between apology and self-protection with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Fierce tenderness" appears in the opening line, recurs six times as a descriptor ("her heart a fierce tenderness," "fierce, tender chorus," "fierce tenderness"), and closes the story ("their love fierce and whole"). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly (aching → mourning → weeping → embracing), but the phrase functions as a static label rather than emerging through rhythm or diction under pressure. The repetition feels ornamental rather than charged with evolving cost at the final image.</comment>
