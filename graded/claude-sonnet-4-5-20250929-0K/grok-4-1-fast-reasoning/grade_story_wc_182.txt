<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("ignited; she'd long sought that fabled sanctum") but never encounters meaningful friction or internal conflict. The "carefully resourceful" trait appears as label-only descriptor ("carefully resourceful with every scrap of lore," "Carefully resourceful, she inventoried") without constraining a choice or creating visible cost. The time traveler remains flat, serving only as delivery mechanism. Decisions throughout feel procedural rather than character-driven—Elara solves problems through rote application of her skill set without struggle or change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Closure is entirely off-page: "They entered, the unheard symphony resolving into triumphant silence, fates realigned." The guardian's capitulation lacks causal grounding—we're told Elara presents findings but the negotiation itself vanishes into summary. Orientation Test penalty applies: who/where/when anchor arrives late (~100+ words into dense fantastical description), and the spatial relationships remain vague throughout (Verdant Stacks, Fractured Folios, Whispering Warrens appear as arbitrary labels). The bracketed meta-commentary ("[Adjusting flow.] ... [Word check internal.] [Final tally: precisely woven.]") are generation scaffolding that should have been removed but signal the piece was assembled rather than composed. Drive lens appears causal but the because/therefore chain breaks at the guardian scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore is described in lush terms ("roots of an ancient tree," "vaulted stacks") but never constrains movement or choice—characters teleport between named zones without navigation cost. The botanical diary's luminescent flora appear as visual decoration; when Elara uses them (Echo-Lilies, storm-root, Nocturne Bloom), the mechanics are asserted rather than shown through environmental interaction. Spatial choreography collapses: we don't know distances, what's visible, or how the "core chamber" relates to prior locations. The orientation debt noted in Q2 directly harms this category; cap at 7.0 per the Orientation Test consequence does not apply here because the problem is pervasive decorative treatment, not just late anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (find the Library of Unlearned Lessons) is declared but never tested with meaningful opposition—the "rescue missions" unfold as three identical puzzles solved by looking up the answer in the diary. No reversal or tightening occurs; each obstacle yields instantly to Elara's skill. The guardian confrontation, which should be the peak pressure point, dissolves into summary: "she uncovered leverage" and "unveiled the Library" without on-page negotiation or cost. Agency is entirely procedural. The "carefully resourceful" inventory moment promises scarcity but supplies never run out or constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("unlearned lessons," ignored warnings) is announced rather than dramatized—the story tells us history's warnings matter but shows only competent problem-solving. The botanical diary as "botanical bridges" and "missing verse" reads as symbolic convenience introduced to solve the guardian puzzle rather than resonating from prior particulars. The bracketed meta-commentary and the phrase "precisely woven" signal thematic self-congratulation. The final image offers no reweighting; "fates realigned" is abstract assertion. Subtext is absent—dialogue and action state their meaning directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara, but voice lacks texture—sentences feel interchangeable and rely on elevated register ("arcane linguist," "threading through the vaulted stacks like a violin solo") that never modulates under pressure. Dialogue is functional but carries no subtext: characters announce their needs and solutions. The time traveler's "eyes wild with futures unborn" and "I've come from the unraveling" exemplify overwrought diction disconnected from embodied perception. Filter verbs stack in expository passages ("she'd long sought," "her mind already mapping"). Internal monologue is absent during problem-solving beats where we'd expect character-specific thought process.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Severe template cadence and paraphrase loops: "Carefully resourceful" appears twice in identical syntactic position; "unheard symphony" recurs as empty motif without reweighting. Mixed metaphors pervade: bookstore has "roots," "vaulted stacks," characters "plunge into the maze," but spatial logic never coheres. The bracketed generation artifacts ("[Adjusting flow.] ... [Word check internal.] [Final tally: precisely woven.]") are scaffolding that should have been cut and disqualify any 9+ consideration globally. Synonym churn: "clutched a tattered botanical diary" → "the diary's plants" → "botanical bridges" → "the diary's pages now alive with promise." Information density is low—long stretches describe atmosphere without advancing situation. Purple prose peaks in crisis: "swirling mist," "cascade of golden light," "triumphant silence."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Core premise (magical librarian solves puzzles to reach hidden archive) is stock fantasy without transformation. The three "rescue missions" are identical in structure: encounter obstacle, consult diary, apply counter-charm, receive key fragment. The time traveler, botanical diary, and guardian spirit feel assembled from genre components rather than synthesized into a coherent necessity. The "unheard symphony" motif is decorative and the botanical angle never becomes more than a convenient unlock mechanism. Risk-aversion is evident in the lack of cost or complication—every move succeeds as planned.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout but her "arcane linguistics" function as a solve-button rather than a character trait that shapes choices under pressure. She identifies plants and inscribes glyphs in three procedurally identical beats. Her decision to partner with the traveler and pursue the library is instant and frictionless. Present and functional but swappable with any competent magical scholar.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears in the first third (traveler clutches it), drives the middle three rescue beats (Echo-Lilies sketch, storm-root diagram, Nocturne Bloom entry), and contributes to closure argument ("botanical bridges as proof of worth"). However, its use is mechanical lookup rather than evolving relationship, and the "pages now alive with promise" final mention is decorative rather than reweighted. Functional across beats but lacks irreplaceable specificity—any reference compendium would serve the same role.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Rescue missions" frame the middle section (scholar in Verdant Stacks, time traveler in Fractured Folios, cartographer in Whispering Warrens) and provide the quest structure, but each mission is identical in mechanics and none impose cost or force tactical adaptation. The concept shapes the surface plot without creating meaningful pressure or stakes. Swappable with "collect three keys" or any fetch-quest structure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" appears twice as label-only descriptor ("carefully resourceful with every scrap of lore," "Carefully resourceful, she inventoried"). The inventory moment promises scarcity (lantern, diary, lexicon) but these supplies never run out or constrain later action. No on-page choice demonstrates resourcefulness under scarcity, and no cost is paid. Mentioned but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Renegotiate" is seeded early in the traveler's dialogue ("renegotiate fate"), returns in Elara's realization ("renegotiation proposal"), and provides the closure mechanism ("Renegotiate the pact"). However, the actual negotiation is summarized rather than dramatized—we're told Elara presents findings and the guardian parts the mist, but the turn happens off-page. The action is structurally central but execution is summary-only, lowering the score significantly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"By researching gaps" appears explicitly ("By researching gaps—omissions in the guardian's ancient pact, cross-checked against the diary's symbiotic flora lore—she uncovered leverage") late in the piece (final third). The method is told rather than shown on the page; we don't see Elara reading, cross-referencing, or discovering the gap—she simply declares the result. It provides the logical unlock but arrives late and is summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore occupying a mountain is introduced in the opening line and supplies the setting throughout (Chrono-Archive wing, Verdant Stacks, Fractured Folios, Whispering Warrens, core chamber). It frames the quest structure and the guardian's enforcement. However, it never constrains movement or choices—characters move freely between zones without navigation cost, and the "labyrinthine" quality is declared but not demonstrated through disorientation or wrong turns. Present across all beats but functionally a backdrop rather than an active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the time traveler arrives" anchors the opening beat ("After the time traveler stumbled through a rift") and frames the inciting incident. The traveler's chronometer "ticking erratically" hints at time pressure, but no clock tightens decisions in the middle or ending—missions proceed without visible duration or urgency. Early signal and structural frame, but time does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to find the library of unlearned lessons" is stated early ("she'd long sought that fabled sanctum") and drives the quest structure through all three missions to the final confrontation. However, the desire is declared rather than dramatized—no internal conflict, competing want, or visible cost shapes her pursuit. The friction-free execution (every mission succeeds) undermines motivational weight. Structurally central but emotionally flat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" appears in the opening ("silence hummed an unheard symphony of rustling pages"), recurs mid-story ("the unheard symphony swelling with creaking shelves"), and at closure ("the unheard symphony resolving into triumphant silence"). The metaphor suggests a tonal through-line but remains decorative—it does not modulate with pressure or shape perception. The prose tone is uniformly elevated and lyrical regardless of stakes, lacking the compression or shift that would charge the final image. Present as motif but static.</comment>
