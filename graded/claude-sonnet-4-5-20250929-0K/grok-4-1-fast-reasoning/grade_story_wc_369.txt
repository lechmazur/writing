<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation ("to discover what trees witnessed") is clearly stated, but his interior reasoning remains abstract rather than embodied in contradictory impulses under pressure. The deconstruction ritual proceeds methodically without genuine struggle or competing desires; he encounters no friction that would force a micro-choice with visible cost. Emotions are labeled ("feeling the weight," "Elias smiled") rather than enacted through specific physical or perceptual shifts. The astronomer's quantified grief is a clever conceit, but Elias's response to it lacks the contradiction or flawed reasoning that would make his final insight feel earned by his own limits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is late: who (Elias), where (tower), and why (tree-witnessing quest) coalesce only after multiple paragraphs of descriptive setup, triggering a −0.4 penalty in Q2 and capping Q3 at 7.0. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (moonlight heals, dreams map, sorrow dilutes through ritual layering), and closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing: trees witness "healing, not heavens." However, the cost remains abstract—numbers "zero," the sextant "reborn"—without a visible forfeiture or tactical trade-off on Elias's part. The causal chain is more catalog than pressure: he collects, overlays, repeats, without a reversal or tightening that narrows his options. Closure reconfigures the premise intellectually but does not land a felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Capped at 7.0 per the Orientation Test penalty applied in Q2. The tower's labyrinthine corridors, arrow-slit windows, moonlit stone, and storm are vividly rendered and contribute atmosphere; the moon-healed stone is a purposeful constraint that enables Elias's ritual. Sensory detail is dense and mostly filtered through the setting's symbolic weight (moonlight, storm flashes), though spatial choreography of the workbench, corridors, and sextant parts remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias's quest to understand what trees witness—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. The deconstruction ritual unfolds as a series of parallel steps (arc → map, tube → map, vane → map) without escalation; no attempt fails, no resource is depleted, no choice forecloses a path. The "moment a pin was heard" arrives as a coincidental revelation rather than a decision-driven turn. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density or pattern break; here the pattern merely repeats until the epiphany is declared, leaving escalation weak and cost invisible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme—witnessing as healing rather than celestial observation—emerges from the sextant ritual and tree-root imagery, avoiding overt moralizing. Quantified sorrow and the oak-rings motif ("1,247 storms weathered into strength") are specific and non-literal. However, the final line ("reborn to map not stars, but the subtle graces binding sky to soil") edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image speak. The insight feels asserted more than earned by prior particulars; the numbered griefs dilute cleanly without friction, reducing thematic complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias throughout; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent lyric register—elevated diction ("sentinel oaks," "quantified sorrow," "ephemeral wisps")—that matches the tone and world. However, under peak pressure (the final corridor walk, the pin-drop epiphany), the voice does not compress or modulate; it maintains the same ornate distance, reducing urgency. Perceptual signature is present (moonlight as balm, dreams as motes) but does not shift with Elias's internal state. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are inapplicable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "moonlight silvered the puddles," "sorrow not vast and poetic but precisely measured," "dreams drifted through the labyrinth like motes"—figurative language appears in most sentences without taught pattern or payoff, triggering −0.6. Paraphrase loops are visible: "he spotted it: an astronomer's broken sextant" immediately followed by "The instrument, relic of a stargazer lost to madness," restating the same content (−0.2). Template cadence runs: "First, the main arc… Next, the telescope tube… Deeper into the night, he ventured" (−0.5). Register drift into elevated diction ("quantified sorrow," "ephemeral wisps," "lunar essence") clashes with the POV's grounded maintenance-worker role in peak beats (−0.4). Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8. Clarity remains mostly intact, but momentum is dulled by scaffold and ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—deconstruct grief-infused instrument via dream-maps and moonlight healing—is imaginative and non-obvious. However, the execution leans on familiar fantasy furniture (lunar magic, labyrinthine tower, mad astronomer's relic) without transforming these tropes through specific grounded choices. The quantified-sorrow conceit is fresh, but the ritual proceeds without friction or risk, reducing boldness. Emotional specificity is present in the numbered griefs but dilutes into abstraction at closure. The final reweighting (trees witness healing, not stars) is thematically coherent but predictable given the setup, lacking the surprise or inevitability that marks high originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and performs the deconstruction, but his choices do not create key turns—he follows a known ritual without friction, and no decision alters tactics or options. His role is more curator than agent; the epiphany arrives as revelation rather than choice-driven consequence. Present in setup, middle, and ending, satisfying two gates (setup, payoff) but missing causal development. Caps at ~6.0 for two-gate; score reduced for ornamental agency and lack of cost-tied decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sextant appears early, is handled across multiple beats (discovery, deconstruction of arc/tube/vane, reassembly), and returns "zeroed" at closure with reweighted meaning (now maps "subtle graces"). Satisfies all three gates (setup, development, payoff). Causal pressure is moderate—it enables the ritual but does not narrow Elias's options or impose cost. Specificity is high (brass arms, fractured lenses, numerals). Score eligible for ≥6.1; raised for beat involvement (+0.9) and closure linkage (+0.9), but causal pressure and cost connection remain weak, capping uplift.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Quantified sorrow is framed early (47, 112, 3,204 tallies) and shapes the ritual's logic: Elias dilutes numbered griefs via dream-maps. It constrains his method (must deconstruct piece by piece, mapping each tally) and participates in closure (numbers "zeroed"). Satisfies all three gates. However, the concept does not impose a visible cost or force a trade-off; the dilution proceeds smoothly without friction. Causal pressure is present but mild. Score eligible for ≥6.1; adjusted down for lack of felt consequence and swappability (grief could be "unquantified" with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Moonlight healing is introduced in the first third ("shafts of light healed what they touched," "infused long ago with lunar essence"), enables the on-page ritual (seals cracks, knits dents, heals Elias's knees), and is present at closure ("reassembled the sextant whole under moonlight"). Satisfies all three gates. Causal enablement is clear (+0.8), but no cost or trade-off is shown—moonlight simply works when invoked. Swappability is moderate; another magical light could substitute with minor rewrites. Score eligible for ≥6.1; adjusted for missing cost connection and mid-band irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Deconstruct" frames the entire ritual: Elias lays out pieces, overlays dream-maps, dilutes tallies, then reassembles. The action structures all middle beats and culminates in the zeroed sextant. Satisfies all three gates. However, the deconstruction itself is linear and unopposed—no piece resists, no map fails—so it does not create a reversal or narrow options. Major turns trace to the action, but it feels procedural rather than decisive. Causal pressure is present but mild; swappability is low (the ritual depends on taking apart). Score eligible for ≥6.1; raised for beat involvement and closure linkage, capped by lack of cost and friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dream-mapping is signaled in the first third ("by mapping scattered dreams," "pinning ephemeral wisps to parchment with ink distilled from moonlight") and executed in middle beats (child's kite dream, farmer's harvest dream, oak visions). It constrains Elias's method—he must collect and overlay dreams—and shapes closure (oak dream reveals the answer). Satisfies all three gates. Causal pressure is moderate; the maps enable but do not impose cost or force a trade-off. Specificity is high (wisps, charts mirroring corridors). Score eligible for ≥6.1; adjusted for missing friction and swappability (another symbolic medium could replace dreams with edits).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The stormlit tower and moonlight are present throughout, framing atmosphere and enabling the ritual (moonlight heals, storm flashes sync with Elias's breaths). The setting supplies the lunar-essence stone and labyrinthine corridors, which guide Elias's movements. Satisfies all three gates. Micro-setting (workbench, highest corridor, arrow-slit windows) is clear. However, the tower does not pressure Elias's choices or impose a constraint with cost; it functions as backdrop and resource. Causal pressure is mild. Score eligible for ≥6.1; adjusted for lack of tactical friction and moderate irreplaceability (another magical ruin could substitute).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The pin-drop moment appears late (final third), marking the epiphany but not tightening prior decisions or altering tactics. Time is vague throughout ("decades," "one storm-ravaged evening," "tonight," "deeper into the night") with no live clock or deadline that narrows Elias's options. The moment qualifies as a lyric marker (closure participation) but does not function as a timeframe that shapes choices. Missing setup and development gates; only payoff is present. Caps at 2.8 per the missing-closure-only rule. Score reflects ornamental use—the pin-drop is atmospheric, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The desire "to discover what trees witnessed" is stated early and frames Elias's quest. It motivates the ritual and is answered at closure (trees witness "healing, not heavens"). Satisfies setup and payoff gates, but middle development is weak—no friction between this want and a competing cost or fear is dramatized. The motivation is told more than shown in micro-choices under pressure. Eligible up to ~6.0 for two gates; reduced for summary-only use (−0.5) and lack of conflicted decision-making that would reveal hierarchy of values. Desire is present but not tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mundane-miracles tone ("trees witnessed healing," "subtle graces," "growth from grief") is established early and sustained through the ritual's quiet, methodical progress. The tone modulates subtly—elevated lyric diction in descriptive passages, measured procedural voice in the deconstruction beats—and charges the final image (sextant reborn as tool for "subtle graces"). Coherent through turns without static monotony. However, the tone does not heighten under pressure; peak beats (pin-drop, final reassembly) maintain the same register, reducing dynamic range. Satisfies all three gates. Score eligible for ≥6.1; raised for closure linkage and coherence, capped by lack of modulation under stress.</comment>
