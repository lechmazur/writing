<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to build intergenerational support is clear and her gently persistent approach shapes several beats, but her interior life remains largely abstract—we see her "motivation burned softly" and her "eyes kind but unyielding" rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The community's shift from resistance to ritual follows her urging rather than emerging from Mira's own visible struggle or blind spot. Lena's orphan backstory and her "thrill cementing loyalty" gesture toward depth but read as told rather than dramatized through body and micro-choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an accumulative lens: repeated midnight runs and the bell's toll stitch the community into a covenant. Orientation anchors (arbor, ridge, sanctions period) arrive early. The closure—Lena ringing the bell years later, declaring the tradition anew—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) that shows endurance across generations. However, the cost remains largely asserted ("sanctions raged on," "unbreakable") rather than concretely dramatized; we don't see a specific forfeiture or tactical constraint that the final image reweights with undeniable pressure, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor, its acoustics ("amplified quiet," bell toll), and the ridge's shadows are vividly rendered and recur across beats. The arbor's curved arches and the antique silver bell constrain the community's ritual and charge the final image when Lena rings it. Spatial choreography (ridge, doorsteps, sanction lines) remains clear. However, the setting functions more as atmospheric backdrop than tactical constraint—no on-page moment where the arbor's layout or the ridge's terrain alters a choice under immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—community survival under sanctions through anonymous giving—is signaled early and tightens as enforcers sweep near and Lena's basket becomes heavy with risk. One meaningful reversal occurs when Tomas shifts from skepticism to ringing the bell himself. Yet the escalation relies on summary ("sanctions tightened") rather than a dramatized on-page choice that narrows options or imposes a visible trade-off. Lena's frozen mid-run moment gestures toward cost but resolves immediately ("shadows held"), deflating the pressure before the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of resilience through anonymous reciprocity emerges organically from midnight runs, the bell's toll, and intergenerational bonds rather than overt statement. Mira's "Because giving anonymously teaches our children resilience" comes close to thematic echo but is embedded in a dialogue beat with Tomas rather than final-paragraph moralizing. The ending image—Lena ringing the bell, the cycle persisting "gently, eternally"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the premise. However, "gently, eternally" and "unbreakable" veer toward abstraction that slightly undercuts the particularity elsewhere.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person POV tracks Mira's perceptual signature ("amplified quiet," "silver hair catching starlight") and the community's collective stance without head-hopping. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit (Tomas grumbling, Mira kneeling to persuade). However, repeated stems and template cadence ("her voice a steady ripple," "her eyes kind but unyielding," "her gently persistent steps") and filter verbs ("She saw the potential," "Mira knew the moment") accumulate in peak beats, dulling immediacy. The phrase "gently persistent" recurs four times, flattening what should be a dynamic trait under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear across adjacent lines: "anonymous donations" / "gifts" / "bundles" / "donations" cycle without added pressure; "gently persistent" appears four times; "amplified quiet" recurs as a stock phrase. Template cadence runs: "Mira watched... She saw... Her motivation burned... Mira began... Mira knelt... Mira organized... Mira knew... Mira lifted... Mira smiled." Filter-verb stacks ("She saw the potential," "Mira knew the moment") and elevated diction ("ripple in the amplified quiet," "shadow fairies," "malevolent fireflies") clash with the POV's otherwise grounded texture. These artifacts touch multiple beats including the climax assembly, triggering the −0.6 to −1.4 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—exiles sustaining themselves through anonymous midnight food runs under sanctions—offers a fresh angle on community resilience, and the antique silver bell as ritual anchor is specific. However, the emotional arc (skepticism → collective resolve → generational endurance) follows a template structure without a non-obvious turn. The piece commits fully to its premise but leans on stock metaphors ("threads of forgotten hope," "flame from grandparent to grandchild," "hidden rivers") and the closure's "gently, eternally" / "unbreakable" phrasing reads as generic rather than inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mira appears early (setup), urges the community mid-story (development), and her legacy is invoked at closure when Lena rings the bell "declaring the tradition anew" (payoff, though off-stage). Her decisions—organizing the first runs, persuading Tomas—shape two beats, but her final on-page action is lifting the bell and delivering the speech; the covenant declaration itself is a collective moment rather than Mira's sole choice. Present across all three gates with moderate causal pressure; swappability is low (the "exile community leader" role is integral), but the final beat disperses agency across the community rather than hinging on Mira's last decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The antique silver bell appears early (setup: "antique silver bell in the arbor's center"), is used mid-story (Tomas rings it to signal safe returns, development), and Mira lifts it at the climax and Lena rings it at closure (payoff). The bell's toll—"muffled by cloth, resonated like a heartbeat"—accrues symbolic weight and its etched symbols tie to the lost homeland. It drives three distinct beats (ritual signal, Mira's declaration, Lena's continuation) and charges the final image. However, its mechanics (why one soft peal, how the cloth muffles, who else rings it between beats) remain vague, and the bell's specific properties beyond "antique silver" and "etched symbols" do not constrain a choice under pressure—e.g., no moment where its sound or fragility alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Anonymous donations frame the premise (mysterious baskets at the arbor's edge) by the second paragraph (setup), drive the midnight runs and Mira's persuasion of Tomas (development), and the climax declares the "Shadow Harvest—a covenant of anonymous donations" (payoff). The concept shapes stakes (survival, secrecy) and tactics (midnight runs, no signatures) across multiple beats. It appears in the ending when "anonymous donations flowing like hidden rivers" and Lena continues the tradition. Causal pressure is strong (the concept enables survival and community bonds), but "anonymous donations" as a phrase recurs eight times with near-synonyms ("gifts," "bundles"), reducing specificity. The concept is indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is assigned to Mira in the third paragraph (setup) and recurs as a label four times ("gently persistent grace," "Mira persisted," "Gently persistent, Mira began," "gently persistent, carrying to every corner"). It constrains one on-page action: Mira's repeated urging despite Tomas's resistance (development). The trait is invoked at closure ("gently persistent against the storm," "so the cycle persisted, gently, eternally"), but this is summary rather than a visible tradeoff. The attribute reads more as thematic decoration than a lived constraint that narrows options or imposes cost in a peak beat; swappable with "patient" or "steady" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Declare" appears late—Mira's climactic speech occurs in the final third (setup missing, late penalty applies). The declaration ("we declare our Shadow Harvest—a covenant of anonymous donations") is the story's major turn: it formalizes the underground practice into explicit covenant, draws cheers, and Tomas and Lena step forward to pledge (development and payoff compressed into one beat). The act redefines the community's stance from reactive survival to proactive legacy-building and is causally prepared by the prior midnight runs and Mira's persuasion. However, "declare" is not irreplaceable—"proclaim," "announce," or "vow" would serve similarly—and the scene could function with "we begin our Shadow Harvest" without structural collapse, capping swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Midnight food runs appear early (mysterious baskets "left anonymously at the arbor's edge each night," setup) and Mira organizes "the first community midnight food runs" in the middle (development). The runs are the story's engine: small groups gather supplies, leave bundles, and the bell signals safe returns. Lena's frozen mid-run encounter with enforcers dramatizes the method's risk (development). At closure, "midnight runs continued" and the tradition persists (payoff). The method shapes tactics (secrecy, timing, routes taught intergenerationally) and is causally indispensable. However, the mechanics remain generic—"slipped down the ridge, gathering... returned before dawn"—without specific constraints (e.g., patrol schedules, route hazards) that alter a choice under immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor on the ridge is named in the opening line (setup) and recurs as the gathering site for Mira's climactic speech (payoff). Its curved arches glow under moonlight, its acoustics amplify Mira's voice ("amplified by the arbor's acoustics, echoing into the night"), and the bell hangs at its center. The arbor provides shelter and ritual space but does not constrain a choice—no moment where its layout, accessibility, or material properties alter tactics. The ridge's shadows help Lena evade enforcers (development, though the arbor itself is not involved), but the setting functions more as atmospheric anchor than tactical pressure. Present in setup and closure with moderate symbolic charge but replaceable with "stone sanctuary" or "hidden grove" without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sanctions period is named in the opening line ("during the endless sanctions period," setup) and recurs throughout: "sanctions had choked their supplies," "sanctions enforcers patrolling," "sanctions tightened," "sanctions raged on" (development and payoff). The timeframe establishes scarcity as the story's engine and motivates the midnight runs. However, the sanctions remain abstract—no specific edicts, durations, or escalations dramatized on the page that tighten decisions in real time. The phrase "endless sanctions period" and "sanctions unbroken" at closure imply static rather than escalating pressure. The timeframe is present across all three gates and causally necessary but does not function as a live clock that alters moves beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to build intergenerational support" is stated in the eighth paragraph ("forge intergenerational support, binding young and old," setup) and drives her organizing the midnight runs and persuading Tomas (development). At closure, "generations intertwined" and Lena leading "the tradition anew" fulfill the motivation (payoff). The desire is dramatized through Mira's speech, the elders teaching routes to teens, and Lena's orphaned purpose, but the friction between Mira's want and cost is told rather than shown—no on-page moment where building this legacy forces Mira to sacrifice another goal or face a personal price. The motivation shapes two beats and closure but remains more thematic claim than lived tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" is introduced in the second paragraph ("whispers of wind amplified the quiet," setup) and recurs across beats: "in the amplified quiet" (Mira's speech to Tomas), "amplified into a chorus of resolve" (climax cheers), "the amplified quiet held their story" (closure). The tone modulates from hushed survival to collective murmur to legacy echo, coherent through turns. The arbor's acoustics tie the tone to setting, and the bell's "muffled" toll reinforces it. At closure, "amplified quiet" charges the final image by holding the exiles' story. However, the phrase recurs unchanged rather than evolving in texture, and the tone does not constrain a choice—no beat where maintaining silence or risking sound alters tactics under pressure. Purposeful early-to-final reprise with moderate reweighting.</comment>
