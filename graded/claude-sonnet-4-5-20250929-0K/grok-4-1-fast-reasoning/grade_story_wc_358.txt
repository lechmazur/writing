<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's core motivation ("cultivate foresight in action") remains abstract and told rather than earned through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The patch object functions as a talisman but doesn't complicate his decision path—he simply continues surveying. Interiority relies heavily on label-only constructions ("his motivation burned clearer") and the final transmitted report feels mechanically resolved without visible internal cost or foreclosed path. Embodied emotion is minimal; the protagonist moves through the labyrinth with steady purpose but no genuine struggle between competing wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors orientation adequately (investigator, port, post-crash) and attempts an accumulative lens through survey documentation. However, no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs—Elias enters, documents wind patterns, finds a patch, continues documenting, then transmits findings. The closure ("foresight sown") is asserted rather than demonstrated through a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The causal chain is linear (survey → data → report) without a pressure point that narrows options or forces a trade-off. Cost is conceptual at best and not legible in a specific on-page image or forfeited choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (rusted reds, faded blues, wind whispers) that coheres across the piece. Spatial choreography remains clear as Elias moves deeper, climbs stacks, and reaches the crater. The anemometers and survey tools ground the investigative action in concrete equipment. The hazy atmosphere modulates appropriately, tightening at the crater. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; while visually strong, it does not constrain a pivotal choice or charge the final image in a way that would lift the score into high bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understand crash cause to prevent recurrence) is signaled early but remains stable throughout without a meaningful tightening or cost. Elias encounters no obstacles, competing pressures, or trade-offs—the survey proceeds smoothly from entry to transmission. The patch discovery is a clue, not a complication. No reversal or deepening occurs; the resolution (transmitting the report) arrives without agency-driven escalation or visible price. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist choice under pressure. The accumulative lens requires a cadence shift or density increase that reweights the stake; here the tempo and stakes remain flat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "foresight" theme emerges from event and image but is undercut by repeated direct statements ("cultivate foresight in action," "foresight sown") that function as thesis placards rather than earned resonance. The final image (patch fluttering, winds documented) gestures toward a non-literal answer but lacks the undeniable pressure or conceptual cost required for strong thematic closure. The container-labyrinth-as-maze metaphor works adequately but does not deepen or shift meaning across the arc. Subtext in gesture and silence is minimal; the piece mostly tells its theme rather than allowing it to emerge from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping; Elias's perceptual bias (wind patterns, investigative focus) is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("singular convergence," "cultivate foresight") that sits awkwardly against the investigative frame. Psychic distance is controlled and filter verbs are sparse. The prose has some rhythmic variety, though sentence openings show moderate repetition ("Elias + verb" pattern across multiple paragraphs). No dialogue present. Voice is competent but not distinctive; the investigator's internal texture lacks the idiosyncratic stamp that would elevate this into higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy use of templated phrasing and repeated key terms without pattern-teaching: "singular convergence" appears five times, "rapidly adapting" four times, "cultivate foresight" three times, "hazy precision" twice—often as label drops rather than evolved motifs. Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third (wind documentation beats rephrase the same data-collection action). Several runs of "Elias + past-tense verb" sentence stems ("Elias surveyed," "Elias moved," "Elias stood," "Elias exited") create template cadence without voice justification. Stock metaphors ("loomed like urban canyons," "engines howling like banshees") appear without fresh inflection. Information density is moderate; some sentences advance plot while others loop. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("foresight sown"), triggering the Q7 cap disqualification for 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The investigator-in-wreckage premise is familiar; the wind-pattern survey and container maze add specificity but do not transform the template. The patch as inherited-vigilance talisman and the AI-foresight recommendation conclusion feel derivative of standard accident-investigation narratives. Emotional and physical particulars (anemometers, breath mask, tablet pings) provide plausible detail but do not cohere into a memorable synthesis. The transformation test fails: swapping names and setting to a forest fire investigation or collapsed mine would require minimal structural change. No bold risk-taking; the piece opts for safe execution of a conventional arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his survey actions drive the documentation beats. However, his choices are procedural (place anemometers, climb stack, kneel at crater, transmit report) without a key turn that alters tactics or stakes. Early signal, multiple beats, closure presence, but no causal pressure or visible cost tied to his decision-making—observation dominates over consequential choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The patch appears in the middle third (late for setup), is physically handled ("pinned to his vest," "sewn hastily onto his sleeve"), and returns in the final image ("fluttered lightly"). However, its meaning remains static (engineer's warning, inherited vigilance) without evolving use or reweighted significance across beats. Present in closure but not causally active there. Swappable with any memorial token. Two-touch functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Singular convergence" is signaled in the opening paragraph, recurs in the survey analysis ("containers funneling drones into deadly choke"), and is named explicitly in the crater beat and closure explanation. It shapes the investigative stake (understanding convergence cause) and directly informs the transmitted recommendation. Present in all three gates with causal weight, though the repeated label-only mentions and lack of visible cost keep it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Rapidly adapting" is mentioned four times but functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains or enables specific action with cost. Elias adapts by donning a mask and recalibrating his path—generic adjustments, not choices where the adaptation trait creates visible trade-offs or failures. Present but ornamental; could be removed with negligible structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The survey action frames the entire arc: Elias enters to survey, deploys anemometers across multiple beats, documents patterns at the crater, and transmits findings at closure. Early signal, drives at least three distinct beats, and the transmitted report is the culminating act. Removing "survey" would fundamentally break the story's logic. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with clear causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Documenting wind patterns between buildings" (containers as buildings) is signaled early ("began documenting wind patterns"), executed in the middle beats (anemometer deployment, velocity logs, "22 knots at 3 meters"), and feeds the final explanation transmitted to authorities. The method shapes multiple attempts and the closure recommendation directly references wind-channeled convergence. Present in all three gates with causal mechanics visible on the page. Could be swapped for another forensic method but would require substantial rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is established in the opening line, pressures Elias's movement across the arc (disorienting turns, precarious climbs, narrow alleys), and supplies the causal explanation at closure (containers channeling wind into lethal convergence). The setting is not merely postcard description—it actively alters tactics (climbing for sensor placement, mask donned against dust) and the crater convergence point is indispensable to the resolution. Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage, and causal pressure all present with specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the town goes silent" is signaled in the opening and recurs in the final beats ("town still silent"). However, time does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Elias surveys at his own pace with no clock pressure or tactical constraints tied to elapsed hours. The three-day gap since the crash is mentioned but does not shape moves. Present in setup and closure but functionally vague; "silent" operates more as atmosphere than temporal driver.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To cultivate foresight in action" is named explicitly in the opening, middle ("his motivation burned clearer"), and closure ("foresight sown"). It frames the investigative stake. However, it remains told rather than dramatized—no on-page friction between this desire and competing costs or wants. The motivation is label-only, not enacted through conflicted micro-choices. Present across beats but never tested or complicated, capping score despite setup and closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Hazy precision" is introduced in the opening line ("haze that blurred edges but sharpened his focus"), recurs in sensory beats ("hazy precision of post-disaster calm," "hazy but precise in his adapted gaze"), and modulates appropriately as Elias moves from fog-cut flashlight work to dust-devil breathers at the crater. Tone coheres through turns and charges the final image ("town still silent" echoing the opening hush). Strong setup, beat involvement, and closure linkage; the diction pairing ("hazy"/"precise") is specific and irreplaceable, earning mid-high band despite some repetition.</comment>
