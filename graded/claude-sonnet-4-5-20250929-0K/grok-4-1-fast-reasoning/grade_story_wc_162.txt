<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation is declared ("featherly determined," "to know why some boundaries pulsed holy") but her interiority reads as abstract philosophical musing rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The father reunion at the end arrives without earned cost or visible trade-off; she "crosses—not erasing distance, but weaving it into arrival" is label-only resolution. Emotions are asserted through poetic modifiers ("featherly," "resolute as quill barbs") rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. No meaningful change or renunciation forecloses a path with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when remain vague past 120 words ("drifting prism terrace," "after the butterfly effect" as abstract frame). The causal chain—grain analysis → logbook discovery → compass unlock → reunion—reads as convenience plotting; the compass emerges late to solve a problem it did not help create. Closure lacks visible cost: Elowen crosses the threshold and finds father waiting with no on-page sacrifice, forfeiture, or trade-off that alters options. The ending asserts "fractured no more, yet ever hushed" without a legible before/after change in stakes or stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The prism terrace, wooden furniture grain, and logbook weather code ground the piece in tactile specificity and constrain Elowen's method. The grain "curved like flight paths, avoiding invisible storms" uses micro-setting to charge investigation. However, spatial choreography of the drifting terrace and the descent to the maze below remains abstract; no anchor for how she moves between them or what the prisms physically do to enable descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reuniting with father—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens through protagonist agency. The logbook and compass discoveries are passive finds; Elowen hesitates once ("Close the distance, lose the light") but crosses anyway without visible price. No reversal, trade-off, or foreclosed path; the maze "resolved below" and father simply waits. The ending grants reunion without cost, violating the story's own rule about sacred thresholds demanding sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" as theme is declared repeatedly in the final third ("They did because necessary distances birthed them," "Thresholds sacred for the distances they demand") rather than emerging from concrete choices. The father's whisper "you intuited the why" is thematic echo that replaces scene pressure. The grain/weather-code/maze connection offers one earned particular, lifting the score slightly, but the ending moralizes instead of offering a resonant image with ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Diction is elevated and ornamental throughout ("featherly determined," "quill barbs etched in wind," "sanctity," "hush's true architecture"), creating consistent lyric distance but little perceptual signature specific to a lost child. Sentences often begin with abstract nouns or -ing participles, generating template cadence. No dialogue to test voice distinction. The register remains uniformly poetic under both calm investigation and supposed climax, flattening urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "necessary distances" repeated across seven paragraphs, "sacred thresholds" five times, "fractured hush" four times without reweighting. Template stems abound: "She drifted," "She traced," "She intuited," "She crossed." Figurative density is high in nearly every sentence ("light whispered," "distances that begged," "chaos knelt"), obscuring concrete action. The compass discovery ("twisted a chair's arm, unlocking a panel") is the clearest beat; most moves are abstract. Final-third artifacts touch the closure image, disqualifying 9+ globally per rubric.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The grain-as-flight-log connection offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis that elevates the piece. However, the butterfly-effect frame, lost-parent quest, and symbolic-object puzzle are template elements executed without fresh moral calculus or character-specific transformation. The "necessary distances" concept is abstract philosophical everywhere rather than grounded in Elowen's lived particulars. Proximity to lyric-fiction templates (poetic diction, vague setting, thematic declarations) without risk or subversion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elowen is present throughout but her choices are passive observations (tracing grain, reading logbook, twisting chair) rather than decisions that narrow options. She hesitates once at the threshold then crosses without visible cost, undercutting the sole decision point. Seed/development/cameo gates met, but no causal pressure or trade-off tied to her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Logbook appears mid-story (~35% mark), is read for weather code, cross-referenced with grain, and warns about closing distance. Three beats, but late arrival and the code itself does not constrain her final choice (she crosses anyway). Closure participation is summary ("logbook clutched") rather than active use. Setup missing; development and payoff present but swappable with any guidance object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" is declared as theme nine times but does not shape on-page tactics or choices. Elowen's actions ignore the concept's constraint (she crosses without sacrifice despite the log's warning). Present as philosophical frame, not as stakes-altering rule. Setup/development via repeated mention, but no closure participation beyond label.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" appears three times as poetic modifier but never constrains or enables action with cost. No trade-off between lightness and resolve, no scene where this trait alters her approach. Label-only attribute; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Intuit" governs multiple beats: grain analysis, logbook code, compass vector, balance calculation. However, the method is vague—no on-page demonstration of how intuition differs from reading or logic. Major turns trace to it, but the action is generic and swappable with "decipher" or "sense." Seed/development/payoff present; causal pressure moderate; specificity low.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Analyzing grain is signaled early (~15%), used to decode flight paths and cross-reference logbook, and returns at closure when she "etched her own code into the table's grain." Three distinct beats; mechanics matter (swirls as paths). Causal pressure moderate; the method enables the vector solution. Specificity and irreplaceability modest (could swap with map or runes).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Prism terrace is named early and houses the furniture investigation, but its "drifting" quality and prism mechanics never constrain choice or supply resources. Description is ornamental ("facets catching echoes of storms"). It fades mid-story; the maze below becomes the operative setting. Setup present; development and closure participation weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" frames the world but does not tighten decisions. No live clock, no urgency escalation. Time is vague and untracked; Elowen investigates at leisure. Ornamental frame; no tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Desire to discover why thresholds feel sacred is stated early and drives investigation, but it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. She hesitates once then crosses without friction. Told motivation without on-page trade-off. Setup/development present; payoff is thematic echo rather than choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" is named in the opening and closing lines and modulates slightly (initial mystery, final sealing). Tone is static lyric-poetic throughout with no pressure-driven shifts. The final image attempts to charge it ("The fractured hush sealed them"), creating modest reprise. Coherent but does not deepen under escalation.</comment>
