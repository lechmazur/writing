<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and sustained, with embodied grief ("broken heart a fresh wound") informing her archival work. Her choices at the inciting incident (investigating the dust patterns, prying open the seam) show agency under pressure. However, the final transformation feels overstated rather than earned through contradictory impulses: "her steps lighter toward the door" and "healed not just history, but herself" declare change without dramatizing the internal friction that would make it credible. The connection between finding one letter and healing her betrothed's death lacks sufficient on-page cost or complication.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes orientation (archivist, 1872, file room) within the first paragraph. The discovery of the hidden compartment and Amos's letter accumulates toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Eleanor's purpose is renewed. However, the closure lacks felt cost—her grief is declared resolved ("healed...herself") without forfeiting a live option or paying a visible price on the page. The Cost Proof Test fails: no specific sentence in the ending beat demonstrates what Eleanor sacrifices or relinquishes to achieve this renewal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The file room is vividly anchored with sensory detail: "aged paper and mildew," "scarred oak desk," "sagging shelves like weary sentinels." The dust patterns constrain Eleanor's investigation, guiding her to the false compartment and driving the discovery. The infantryman's button and the hidden seam function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the 1872 post-emancipation atmosphere saturates the piece without becoming a museum tour.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Eleanor's desire to magnify small kindnesses and illuminate unknown histories—is signaled early and sustained. The discovery of the letter provides one meaningful deepening that reweights her purpose. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is modest: the find doesn't narrow options or impose a trade-off; it simply affirms her existing motivation. The ending declares renewed purpose without demonstrating what tactical choice or live path is foreclosed. One tightening is present but the cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Eleanor's archival work: small acts of kindness persisting through bureaucratic neglect. The infantryman's button and Amos's letter embody this without overt moralizing until the final paragraphs, which slip into explicit statement: "every kindness a light against oblivion" and "she healed not just history, but herself." These declarations replace scene pressure with thematic summary. The core question—can compassion endure through institutional erasure—receives a resonant answer through the artifacts, but the ending's directness reduces complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, anchored to Eleanor's perception throughout. Diction matches the period and her educated archivist role: "fragile paper trails," "tactfully hopeful," "weary sentinels." Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the discovery sequence. However, rhythmic control slips in the final third with repeated "she" + past-tense verb stems ("She imagined," "She transcribed," "She would seek") that flatten propulsion. No head-hopping, and the perceptual signature remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clarity is generally strong, with vivid images like "dust motes dancing in slivers of afternoon sun" and "eagle seeming to gaze back with steadfast promise." However, line-level artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("unknown histories" repeated across paragraphs), template cadence in the final third (eight consecutive "she [verb]" constructions), and figurative density that occasionally overreaches ("her broken heart, though scarred, now beat with purpose renewed"). The scaffold sentences in the ending ("Tucking the artifacts safely away, she locked the box, her steps lighter...") summarize rather than propel. Apply −0.8 for distinct loop and cadence issues touching the closure section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—archivist discovering hidden Civil War compassion via forensic document analysis—has specificity but closely follows the "historical detective finds redemptive artifact" template common in literary historical fiction. The dust-pattern mechanism and the infantryman's button offer textural freshness, but the emotional arc (grieving woman finds purpose through another's kindness) resolves predictably. Amos's cross-racial fostering and the Bureau context provide authentic period detail, yet the transformation test suggests the core plot could function in multiple archives with different names. No bold structural risk; a competent, well-researched execution of familiar material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eleanor appears in setup, makes the discovery choice at midpoint, and is present in the ending. Her broken-heartedness motivates her quest for kindness but does not constrain a key choice with visible cost—the discovery affirms rather than challenges her. Two beats (investigation, transcription) but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The button is introduced in the discovery beat, handled with reverence ("Eleanor touched the button"), appears in Amos's letter as a talisman, and is polished in the ending ("Eleanor polished the infantryman's button, its eagle seeming to gaze back"). Three distinct beats with reweighted meaning (shield → protection for Lila → promise), but its physical properties don't alter Eleanor's tactics—it functions more as charged symbol than active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Unknown histories" is stated in the opening as Eleanor's motivation and echoed in the discovery ("unknown history: Amos...had crossed lines") and ending ("Unknown histories demanded such patient scrutiny"). It shapes her interpretive stance but remains abstract—it doesn't create a tactical choice or visible trade-off on the page. Present across the arc but more thematic echo than causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Tactfully hopeful" is labeled in the opening ("her approach was tactfully hopeful") and echoed once during the investigation ("her tactfully hopeful nature whispering"). It describes Eleanor's demeanor but does not constrain an on-page action with cost—no moment where tact or hope forces a specific choice or forecloses an alternative. Label-only use with no demonstrated friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Unfurl" drives the inciting discovery: "Her fingers trembled as she unfurled it, the action deliberate, reverent, like awakening a long-slumbering secret." This physical act reveals Amos's letter and redefines Eleanor's purpose. The verb is specific and non-swappable (unrolling a tightly wound parchment), and the moment pivots the narrative from archival routine to emotional revelation. Central to one major turn and charged at closure when the letter's contents reshape Eleanor's mission.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dust patterns are introduced early ("peculiar patterns of accumulated dust on its lid"), constrain Eleanor's investigation ("dust patterns suggested a seam"), and enable the discovery of the false compartment. The method shapes two beats (noticing, uncovering) and is mentioned in the ending reflection ("Dust patterns...had unveiled a tapestry"). However, the mechanics are passive—Eleanor responds to what dust reveals rather than using dust-reading as an active forensic skill. Functional across the arc but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The foster care file room anchors all action, provides the archive's resources (file boxes, shelves, desk), and historically situates the stakes in post-emancipation bureaucracy. It constrains Eleanor's search spatially and thematically, and the closing image ("within these walls, small mercies endured") charges the setting with resonance. Three gates met (setup, resources enable discovery, charged at closure) with specificity that ties directly to the Bureau's mission.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the emancipation" (1872, seven years post-war) is established in the opening and contextualizes the contraband camp, freed-slave orphans, and Amos's cross-racial fostering. It provides historical texture and moral weight but does not create urgency or alter Eleanor's tactics on the page—no ticking clock or deadline pressure. Present in setup and thematic resonance but passive in escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Eleanor's desire "to magnify small kindnesses" is articulated in the opening, tested by the discovery of Amos's letter, and reaffirmed in the ending when she transcribes and annotates the file. The motivation is present across all three gates and shapes her interpretive lens. However, it does not generate friction or force a trade-off—every beat confirms rather than challenges this desire. Clear causal role but no visible cost or competing want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Examined unknown" manifests as Eleanor's patient, forensic attention to overlooked details (dust patterns, margins, scraps). The tone is consistent—measured, reverent, scholarly—and modulates slightly during the discovery (pulse quickening, breath catching) without breaking register. It charges the final image ("archive whispered on, its secrets waiting") but remains a single static mood rather than a tone that shifts under pressure. Present throughout with coherent texture but limited dynamic range.</comment>
