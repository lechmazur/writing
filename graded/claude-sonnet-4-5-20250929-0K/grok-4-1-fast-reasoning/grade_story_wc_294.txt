<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias remains a passive label-only presence throughout. His "perceptively calm" demeanor is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized in contradictory impulses or embodied costs. The startup mechanics unfold in summary with no on-page micro-choices; Raoul's retreat happens without visible agency from Elias. The final "discovery" of calm versus chaos is declared rather than earned through prior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story follows causal mode but relies on summary rather than scene work. The Orientation Test is satisfied early enough, but the startup's rise and Raoul's confrontation are told in compressed blocks without dramatized turns. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Elias remains at the train), but the cost is abstract—no on-page forfeiture of a live option or felt price is legible. The claim "paths circled to reveal" substitutes exposition for an image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The circus train setting is vivid in the opening ("rusted tracks," "faded stripes," "cracked windows") and recurs at closure, but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics in the middle beats. The territorial markers (hoops with LEDs) are described but function as decoration rather than lived-in spatial pressure. The micro-setting allowance is not met: no tool, body, or recurring object forces a decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming the train into a startup—is signaled early but never tightens on the page. The Raoul confrontation is the only pressure beat, yet it resolves via his hesitation rather than Elias's agency. No meaningful reversal or cost: the startup "crumbles" in summary, and Elias's endurance carries no visible forfeit of a live option. Escalation is absent under causal lens; the piece summarizes outcomes rather than dramatizing trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of paths circling back is stated explicitly in the final paragraph rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The foreign money collection and territorial markers are mentioned repeatedly but do not accumulate pressure or shift meaning at closure. The ending moralizes ("robbery's thrill was fleeting chaos, but this polished calm... forged enduring harmony") instead of offering a resonant image. Subtext is absent; every beat is explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic: "dusky," "harmonious," "perceptively calm" recur as labels rather than character-specific filters. Dialogue with Raoul ("You're sitting on a fortune" / "See these hoops?") is functional but lacks subtext or distinct idiom. The prose remains distant from Elias's interior; no diction shift under pressure. Filter verbs ("noted," "envisioned") dull immediacy in opening beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting throughout: "bruised purple and fading gold," "monsoon ink," "dragon scales," "twilight lanterns," "melancholic peace" stack figurative language in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear: "perceptively calm" / "polished calm" / "perceptively calm" across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence: "Word spread... The startup surged... Elias dissuaded..." creates drumbeat rhythm. Synonym churn ("dissuaded," "dissuasion") and stock metaphors ("moths to twilight lanterns") reduce clarity. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("paths circled," "dusky embrace"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and global 9+ disqualification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The circus-train-as-startup premise is a novel synthesis, but execution flattens it into a template: rise, investor threat, fall, quiet endurance. The "highway robber's son redeems legacy" arc is familiar and not transformed through specific lived detail. The foreign money collection and territorial markers are quirky ornaments rather than irreplaceable logic. No bold risk in structure or moral calculus; the ending hedges into safe introspection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present in all beats but makes no on-page decisions that alter tactics. His heritage is mentioned early (setup) and surfaces in the "Highwayman's Heir" media label (middle), but the closure discovery is narrated rather than chosen. His passivity caps the score; the element is functional but replaceable with any protagonist pursuing startup transformation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The collection appears early (satchel described in paragraph 4), is handled in the Raoul negotiation ("eyeing the satchel's treasures"), and valued at closure ("valuations soared," "sifting his father's collection"). Three distinct beats, but the collection does not constrain a choice or shift meaning—it remains a static asset. Swappable with any valuable heirloom; no unique property matters.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Asserted as label ("polished calm") but never dramatizes on-page stakes or tactics. The concept is claimed in the final paragraph ("this polished calm... forged enduring harmony") without prior cost. No middle development where calm enables or constrains action. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The trait "perceptively calm" is mentioned six times but never shown constraining or enabling an action with visible cost. In the Raoul beat, Elias's calmness is described ("perceptively calm, leading him") but does not alter the outcome; Raoul hesitates due to the markers, not Elias's demeanor. Label-only use; no tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dissuasion appears in three beats: Elias "dissuaded opportunists," explains the hoops to Raoul ("the circle snaps shut"), and "dissuaded them evenly" during the thugs' intrusion. The Raoul and thugs beats hinge on this action, giving it causal weight. However, both resolutions rely on the intruders' hesitation rather than Elias's agency, reducing irreplaceability. Present in closure (thugs "falter"), meeting payoff. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Territorial markers (hoops with LEDs) are introduced early ("marked the perimeter"), explained to Raoul in the lion-tamer car, and referenced at closure ("illuminating the hoops"). They appear in three beats and shape the Raoul and thugs encounters. However, their mechanics are decorative; the intruders retreat due to "primal hesitation" rather than any physical constraint the markers impose. Swappable with any symbolic boundary. Functional but mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train is introduced in paragraph 1, houses all middle beats (boxcar exhibits, lion-tamer negotiation), and remains at closure ("circus train, now his eternal outpost"). It provides spatial continuity and a thematic anchor. The train does not constrain a choice—no locked door, weather, or layout alters tactics—but its particulars (solar panels, peeling posters) recur and the final image relies on it. Solid integration across all three gates; specificity lifts it past mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The startup's rise and fall bracket the middle section ("Word spread... The startup surged... valuations soared... markets shifted... startup crumbled"), compressing months or years into summary. Time is marked in phases (rise, peak, decline, aftermath) rather than tracked with urgency. No live clock tightens a decision. The timeframe provides structure but does not alter tactics. One strong beat (the collapse forces Elias to remain) and closure linkage (aftermath), but no middle pressure from elapsed time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The motivation is stated in paragraph 3 ("why some paths insist on circling back") and echoed at closure ("the truth his paths had circled to reveal"). It frames the premise (setup) but is never dramatized in a conflicted choice. Elias does not struggle between diverging from his father's legacy and repeating it; the discovery is narrated, not fought for. Told-only use; no friction between want and cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The tone is established early ("dusk painted the sky," "dusky harmony") and recurs in nearly every paragraph ("dusky negotiation," "stormy dusk," "dusky embrace," "starlit harmony"). Consistency is high, but the tone remains static—no modulation under pressure. The final image ("hummed softly in the dusk") reiterates rather than reweights. Functional atmosphere but ornamental; does not charge the closure with cost or shift.</comment>
