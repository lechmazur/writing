<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The coachman's interior life is established through repeated label phrases ("closely attentive," "ambient awareness," "motivation burned clear") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His decision to unpick and re-stitch the tapestry unfolds without visible cost or competing impulses; the work proceeds smoothly to a tidy resolution. The passenger remains a cipher, adding no relational pressure. Interiority reads as thematic summary rather than lived tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is ambiguous—oscillating between Accumulative (fog, needle, percolation motifs) and Causal (the unpicking reveals a core vow)—and never stabilizes by midpoint. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive but the coachman's goal and the passenger's role remain vague until late exposition. The closure image (yarn needle tucked safe, fog yielding) asserts resolution without demonstrable cost: no option is foreclosed, no stance crystallized on the page. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) and lens ambiguity (−0.4) apply; cap all categories at 8.0 per cross-caps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The fog-bound crossing and gutters' ticking are vivid and recur, but they do not constrain a choice or alter the coachman's tactics. The yarn needle and tapestry function more as thematic objects than as environmental pressure. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, yet the setting remains a backdrop rather than a crucible that shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("distill complexity into essence") is declared but never tested by a competing pressure or visible cost. The coachman sits until the rain stops, works steadily, and finishes; no reversal or tightening narrows his options. The passenger's murmured approval and the ferry's crossing arrive without friction. Under any lens, escalation is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The palimpsest and distillation motifs create thematic texture, but the final image ("spindrift peace distilled his soul's complexity forever") states the theme rather than embodying it through a non-literal turn. The piece invites reflection through layered imagery, yet the ending's declarative summary ("No more tangled oaths; only essence") flattens resonance. Motifs recur without constraining choice or charging closure with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is present (fog tendrils, gutters ticking, river pulse), but diction drifts into elevated registers ("palimpsest promise," "spindrift serenity," "servient") that clash with a working coachman's plausible lexicon. Repeated template phrases ("ambient awareness," "closely attentive," "percolate") create rhythmic monotony and suggest scaffold artifacts. Psychic distance is stable, but voice lacks the coachman's distinct idiom under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "fog-bound" appears six times, "ambient awareness" and "closely attentive" recur without variation, and lines like "Gutters ticked languidly now, rain's serenade fading to whispers" restate earlier beats. Template cadence dominates mid-story ("As raindrops percolated... so too did memories begin to percolate"). Figurative density (spindrift, palimpsest, percolation) in nearly every sentence blurs propulsion. Apply −1.4 for patterned artifacts and loops; since artifacts touch closure ("spindrift peace distilled his soul's complexity forever"), disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The coachman-at-crossing frame and palimpsest motif offer texture, but the core premise (ancestor vows distilled through needlework) resolves predictably without friction or cost. The yarn needle and fog imagery are generic symbols; substituting other objects or settings would require only minor edits. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis emerges.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The coachman is present throughout and his needlework anchors the scene, but his choices do not create turns—he sits, stitches, and finishes without opposition. Setup and payoff gates are met; development (a middle choice with cost) is absent. Cap 4.6 for missing development gate; swappability and lack of causal pressure lower further.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The yarn needle appears early, is used to mend the tapestry across multiple beats, and is mentioned in the final paragraph ("yarn needle tucked safe"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the needle's specific properties (bone shaft, worn smooth) do not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under stress; any sewing tool would serve. Two-beat involvement (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.7), but high swappability (−0.6) and ornamental specificity limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The palimpsest promise is introduced early and anchors the thematic claim, but it functions as metaphor rather than stake: unpicking and re-reading the layers does not alter the coachman's options or impose a cost. Setup and payoff gates are met; development (a middle choice shaped by the concept) is missing. Cap 4.6 for missing development; thematic-only use (−0.5) and swappability (−0.4) lower further.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Closely attentive" is labeled repeatedly ("He was a man of closely attentive nature," "Closely attentive to the ticking gutters," "Closely attentive, he sensed the shift") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. Setup and closure mentions present, but development is absent; cap 4.6. Label-only use (−0.3), no causal pressure (−0.8), and swappability (−0.6) apply.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Percolate" recurs as metaphor ("raindrops percolated," "memories begin to percolate," "Percolation complete") but does not drive a turn or alter options—it describes an internal process without causal work. Setup and payoff gates met; development missing; cap 4.6. Ornamental use (−0.6) and swappability (−0.4) apply.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Through ambient awareness" is labeled five times but never demonstrates mechanics that shape a choice: the coachman senses fog, river pulse, and rope creaks without those perceptions altering his tactics or imposing cost. Setup and closure mentions present, development absent; cap 4.6. Label-only trait (−0.3), no causal pressure (−0.8), template phrasing (−0.3), swappability (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The fog-bound river crossing is established early and frames the entire scene. The coachman waits there, the ferryman poles across, and coach wheels "kiss solid earth" at the end. Setup, development (provides the waiting-ground), and payoff gates are met. However, the crossing does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it is atmospheric backdrop. Early signal (+0.5), three-gate presence, but no causal constraint (−0.5) and postcard description limit the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The gutters' ticking is introduced early, recurs across beats ("plink, plink," "ticked languidly," "stopped ticking entirely"), and the silence marks the crossing. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. The timeframe provides ambient rhythm but does not tighten a decision or alter tactics—the coachman works "until" rather than racing a deadline. Early signal (+0.5), closure linkage (+0.7), but vague constraint (no visible cost or narrowed window; −0.5) and replaceable timer (−0.4) place it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation ("to distill complexity into essence") is declared early and restated ("motivation burned clear," "motivation gripped him fiercer"), but it is not dramatized through conflicting wants or a visible cost. The coachman proceeds smoothly to distillation without friction. Setup and payoff gates met; development (a middle choice where the desire is tested) is missing. Cap 4.6. Told-only use (−0.5) and lack of friction (−0.6) apply, though closure participation (+0.7) prevents a lower score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Spindrift serenity" is labeled repeatedly ("serene calm," "spindrift serenity," "serene duty," "spindrift peace") but the tone remains static—no modulation under pressure, no charge at the final image beyond assertion. Setup and payoff present, development (tonal shift that reweights stakes) absent; cap 4.6. Single static mood (−0.6), label-only (−0.3), and template phrasing (−0.3) lower further.</comment>
