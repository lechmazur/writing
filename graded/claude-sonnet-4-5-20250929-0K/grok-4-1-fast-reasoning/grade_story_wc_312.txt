<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elowen's "lukewarm" and "earnestly naive" traits are declared heavily but function primarily as labels rather than embodied contradictions that drive micro-choices. His devotion is stated as "brittle" yet never dramatizes a genuine moment where doubt nearly fractures it; the claim "one doubt, and it would crumble" remains assertion. Interior voice relies on recycled stems ("lukewarm," "earnestly naive," "brittle devotion") in a way that flattens interiority into repeated thematic tags. The final "naive heart swelled" repeats label-speak at closure rather than earning the shift through embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Elowen is, where precisely he stands, and what the viaduct's function entails emerge slowly across the opening third without anchoring "when" or spatial coordinates early. The bell-repair sequence strings actions (chart drips, heat oil, pierce channels) in and-then fashion without clear because/therefore linkage; the "surge cracked the repair wider" reversal arrives as external coincidence rather than a consequence of his choices. Closure offers a toll that "righted" imbalance, but the mechanism—drip-synced bronze—remains asserted rather than causally demonstrated; cost is claimed ("brittle devotion tempered") yet the on-page forfeit or visible change in options is thin. Drive lens reads Causal by intent but execution drifts toward summary declaration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct's "crystalline arches" and the dripping condensation supply vivid visual anchors, and the drips' accelerating/lagging rhythm constrains Elowen's repair tactic in the middle beat. Dawn's prolonged "lingering light" feels temporally vague, and the sea "far below" lacks concrete spatial reference (height, access, proximity). The bell and tools (phosphorescent oil, Leviathan-bone pendulum) are named but their physical handling—temperature, texture, resistance—remains abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore cosmic balance by repairing the bell—is signaled early, and the "surge cracked the repair wider" moment offers one mid-sequence reversal. Yet the reversal feels externally imposed (the imbalance "fought back") rather than arising from Elowen's own misjudgment or choice; his response ("refocused, divining deeper rates") summarizes rather than dramatizes a tactical shift. The final toll's success is declared rather than earned through a visible trade-off or foreclosed option. Cost remains largely told ("devotion's fragility forging strength") without on-page forfeit that alters his stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Lukewarm mend the broken worlds" and "small acts mend vast rents" arrive as explicit thematic statements rather than emerging from image and action. The sapphire drips function as a conceptual metronome but their return at closure feels mechanical; the bell's restored hum is stated to "bind devotion eternally" in prompt-language echo. The final paragraph's "naive heart swelled—proof that fragile faith rebuilds worlds" summarizes theme rather than letting the toll's resonance speak. The piece gestures toward complexity (devotion as brittle, magic as lukewarm) yet resolves into a tidy moral that undercuts ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable in limited third, but diction oscillates between high-register lyricism ("ethereal blue," "essence of drowned sailors' oaths") and explanatory exposition ("a secret his grandmother claimed mirrored cosmic equilibrium") that pulls out of Elowen's immediate perception. Recycled stems—"lukewarm," "earnestly naive," "brittle devotion"—appear in nearly every paragraph, flattening rhythmic variety. Interiority leans on filter verbs ("he believed," "he recalled") and summary self-awareness ("why him, the half-mage, when titans had failed?") that distances the reader from embodied thought. The prose voice reads more as narrator commentary than character-specific perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Pervasive label loops ("lukewarm," "earnestly naive," "brittle devotion") and paraphrase cycles (devotion "teetered on shattering; one doubt, and it would crumble" then "devotion's fragility forging strength" then "brittle devotion tempered to resilient vow") stall momentum across the middle third. Template cadence runs: "He unpacked… He etched… He heated…" and "Elowen knelt… Elowen's hands shook… Elowen slumped" in uniform subject-verb stems. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh inflection: "faulty lanterns," "half-hearted candle flames," "beggar's promise." These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("naive heart swelled," "dripping precision"), diluting the final image's charge. Apply −1.2 cumulative in Q7 for loops, stems, and stock phrasing; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The core premise—"lukewarm mage repairs cosmic bell by syncing to drip rates"—offers conceptual novelty, but execution defaults to quest-repair template without transforming it through lived detail or moral calculus. The "plausible impossibility" frame is asserted rather than dramatized; drip-timing mechanics remain vague. Elowen's naivety and feeble magic are declared but do not generate specific mistakes or trade-offs that complicate the arc. The ending's "legend's seed" and "fragile faith rebuilds worlds" echo generic underdog uplift rather than offering a non-obvious synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elowen (lukewarm mage) is present throughout and his decision to repair the bell frames the arc, but his choices within the sequence—chart drips, heat oil, refocus—read as procedural steps rather than trade-offs that narrow options. The "refocused" moment is summary rather than a dramatized pivot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken ship's bell appears in the opening third, is worked on across multiple beats (oil application, micro-channel piercing, final toll), and the toll at closure produces the cosmic reset. Its cracked state and humming leak are concrete, and the repair's success hinges on the bell's properties. Swappability is low; however, the bell's mechanics (how bronze "threads" bind via oil and drips) remain asserted rather than shown, capping causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Brittle devotion is labeled heavily ("devotion teetered on shattering," "brittle devotion cracking under fatigue," "devotion's fragility forging strength") but never dramatizes an on-page moment where doubt nearly stops him or forces a choice with visible cost. It functions as thematic echo rather than a stake-shaping pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Earnestly naive is declared in multiple paragraphs ("earnestly naive eyes," "earnestly naive plan," "naive certainty," "smiled naively") but does not constrain a specific action or generate a mistake with consequence. The trait remains label-only without trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rebuild (the bell) is the central action, signaled early and executed across the middle third (charting, heating, channeling drips, sealing cracks). The final toll completes the rebuild and triggers the cosmic reset, making it indispensable to closure. The procedural beats (oil pour, needle channels) are specific enough to resist easy swap.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Understanding dripping rates is introduced in the first third ("sync the repair to the viaduct's tears"), shapes the charting beat (pendulum timing, pattern recognition), and the final success is attributed to rate-matching. The mechanics remain abstract ("rate-matched to cosmic leaks") rather than showing how a mis-timed drip would fail; mid-band for functional presence across beats without full causal transparency.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct at dawn is anchored early with vivid visuals ("crystalline arches," "sapphire dew") and the drips supply the resource Elowen uses. Dawn's prolonged "lingering light" and the viaduct's height/access remain vague, and the setting does not impose spatial pressure (no threat of falling, no time constraint from sunrise ending). Mid-band for atmospheric contribution and drip resource without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>After the last fish is caught frames the cosmic imbalance as backstory and motivation, but the timeframe itself does not tighten Elowen's decisions; no countdown or escalating consequence tied to elapsed time. "Hours blurred" compresses the repair without tracking urgency. The element sets context but does not function as a live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>To right a cosmic imbalance is stated early and drives Elowen's goal throughout. The motivation is told rather than shown through conflicting wants (no personal cost or competing desire dramatized on the page), yet it anchors every beat and the closure toll fulfills it. Solid presence across setup, development, and payoff; cap shy of 7.0 for lack of friction or visible trade-off tied to the desire itself.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plausible impossibility is asserted in lines like "plausible only to the desperately hopeful" and "plausible impossibility weaving through reality," but tone execution oscillates between lyric ("ethereal blue," "viscous hum") and mechanical explanation ("drips as cosmic metronomes") without a consistent register that charges the final image. The concept is present but not integrated as a modulating tonal layer.</comment>
