<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is defined almost entirely by trait labels—"gently systematic," "brazen calm"—repeated across the text without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. His decision to wire the orchard unfolds as a settled plan executed without genuine struggle; the terminal diagnosis lands with declarative acceptance ("Plenty of time") and never resurfaces as an on-page cost that forecloses paths or alters tactics. The ending shows his "spirit lingering" and the work succeeding, erasing the promised mortal cost and reading as wish-fulfillment rather than earned endurance. Interior life remains abstract and therapized ("brazen calm eternal") instead of showing perception degrading under dying or choices riven by contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—Elias's name, role, and the island setting arrive incrementally across the first ~200 words, and the temple orchard's spatial logic (pillars, oaks, vines, copper) is assembled piecemeal without a clear anchor by the 120-word mark. The dominant lens appears accumulative/textural (layering wire-wrapped branches toward a hum), but escalation is mostly additive ("ten branches... extended... final wrap") without a meaningful tightening or reversal that narrows options. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the humming lattice and arriving pilgrims, yet Elias's bodily death is elided ("vision faded, body stilling") and his "spirit lingered," which softens the promised cost into mystical persistence rather than a decisive forfeiture. No on-page beat shows a live alternative foreclosed or a felt price paid—his work simply succeeds posthumously without friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The temple orchard is sketched with vivid images—"living stone pillars," "quartz veins," "copper coils"—but spatial choreography remains vague (ladder access? shed location? distance between trees?) and the environment never constrains a choice or alters Elias's tactics. Anchors shift without transition: ferry → orchard → shed → branches, with no consistent through-line of where he stands or moves. The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop; when he "sinks against an oak" at the end, the tree is simply there, not a body-scaled obstacle or resource that shaped prior action. Sensory detail trends visual and generic ("sunlight sparking," "quartz glowing warmer") without POV-specific filtering or urgency shifts under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—fostering interspecies respect—is declared in exposition rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or on-page resistance. Elias encounters no opposition; trees "trembled as if sensing," stone "hummed back," and pilgrims arrive post-mortem to instantly accept the revelation, collapsing any potential escalation. The wiring proceeds as planned across "days... weeks" in montage summary with no reversal, setback, or trade-off that forces a tactical pivot. Cost is asserted ("pain clawed his gut," "body weakened") but never shapes a choice—he completes the work on schedule, and the ending rewards him with immortality ("his spirit lingered") rather than a visible forfeiture. Coincidence drives closure: pilgrims simply show up because "the orchard thrummed," not because Elias's agency made their arrival possible or necessary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme is stated overtly ("Respect flows both ways. We listen now." / "fostering bonds across species divides") rather than arising from concrete dramatic tension, and the final paragraph moralizes with prompt-adjacent phrasing ("remodeled reverence," "true harmony rooted deep"). The copper-wire motif is functional but not reweighted at closure—it does what it was designed to do without a shift in meaning or cost. Elias's "gently systematic" method and "brazen calm" are repeated as labels but never complicated by impatience, doubt, or a moment where care and haste collide. The ending offers tidy wish-fulfillment ("Elias had given six months; the orchard gave immortality") that resolves complexity into a platitude rather than inviting ambiguity or lingering friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, but narrative distance is static—Elias's perception never modulates under stress or terminal illness, and interiority relies on trait labels ("gently systematic," "brazen calm") recycled across beats. Diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a caretaker's lexicon: "architectural secrets," "arboreal entities," "fostering respect," "conceptual repricing" read as authorial rather than voice-motivated. The prose carries a uniform cadence that does not shift with urgency; dying and dawn, wiring and visions, all flow at the same stately tempo. Minimal dialogue—three brief lines—precludes testing subtext or character voice distinction. Psychic distance stays fixed in summary-reflective mode, never zooming into embodied immediacy at peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops: "Gently systematic, he began at first light" is echoed by "No rush marred his calm; each measurement was a meditation, brazen in its certainty," then "No force, just gentle pressure, systematic loops." Trait labels recur as sentence stems across the text. Stock metaphors ("stone in still water," "living stone," "roots spoke before words") accumulate without transformation. The final third contains summary montage ("Months passed in his mind's eye") and thematic summary ("Architectural secrets now sung aloud") that stall closure. Filter-verb stacks and abstract nominalization ("motivation burned clear," "respect bloomed") dull immediacy. Multiple paraphrase pairs appear: "brazen calm" / "brazen calm unbroken" / "brazen calm eternal"; "interspecies respect" recurs five times without variation. Baseline artifacts across beats trigger −1.4; closure-adjacent summary adds −0.3 for a net around −1.7 in this category, disallowing 9+ globally and capping entries near 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—dying caretaker uses mystical wiring to awaken sentient trees—closely tracks archetypal eco-fantasy templates (guardian completes sacred task, nature rewards with transcendence) without a non-obvious moral calculus or transformation. The copper-wire method is introduced as established lore ("diary notes," "ancients had used similar bindings") rather than discovered or tested under friction, eliminating risk. Emotional arc is linear and frictionless: calm acceptance → systematic work → mystical success. The ending's immortality reward ("his spirit lingered," "the orchard gave immortality") removes the promised cost and reads as wish-fulfillment. Details (quartz veins, shipwreck copper, fossilized wires) serve world-building but do not converge into a synthesis that reweights prior material. Middle-ground hedging softens every edge: trees "as if sensing," Elias "laughed softly," pilgrims "gasped"—no bold, irreversible choice that stakes the story's identity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout but primarily executes a plan without on-page decision points that alter tactics. His key "choice"—to wire the orchard—arrives pre-formed from diary knowledge, and no friction forces a pivot. Present across all three gates but mostly observational and label-driven.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The diary is packed early, sketched at dawn ("pages yellowed with sketches"), consulted at noon ("diary open, sketching"), and lies "open, its pages fluttering" in the final image. It provides backstory exposition but never becomes a tool that constrains or enables a contested choice. Present in all three gates but functions as static reference rather than dynamic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Architectural secrets" is declared as motivation and recurs as a phrase ("unveiling its architectural secrets," "Architectural secrets unfolded," "Architectural secrets now sung aloud"), but the concept remains abstract—no on-page moment shows Elias deciphering, testing, or risking failure based on hidden design. The pillar-spiral pattern is sketched but not leveraged in a contested beat. Setup and closure mentions without middle development or causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is repeated as a trait label across multiple beats ("gently systematic man," "Gently systematic, he began," "systematic loops," "gently systematic daring") but never constrains action—no moment shows impatience or haste as a tempting alternative with cost. Functional label without visible trade-off or enabling friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The remodel (wiring installation) structures the middle montage and is present in the closure image ("remodeled testament," "remodeled reverence"), but it proceeds without setback or alternative path, making it a linear project rather than a pivot that redefines options. Present in all three gates with some causal involvement but swappable with "restoration" or "awakening" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Copper wire wrapped around branches is introduced early ("spools of pure copper wire"), used across multiple beats ("wound the wire spiral-tight," "ten branches gleamed," "extended the wiring skyward," "secured the final wrap"), and appears in the ending ("glowing lattice," "wire-wrapped oak," "copper-veined wood"). The method's mechanics matter (conductivity, resonance with quartz) and shape the accumulative escalation. Present in all three gates with specificity; however, no on-page beat shows the wire failing or requiring adjustment under pressure, capping ceiling near mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The temple orchard is anchored early (dawn arrival), provides resources (shed, oaks, pillars), and is present in closure ("orchard thrummed"). Spatial details (pillars, vines, branches) recur and the quartz-glow mechanic charges the final image. Present across all gates with some environmental pressure, but no moment where the setting's layout or constraint forces a tactical pivot—Elias simply works within it. Mid-band for presence and atmosphere without decisive chokepoint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The six-month diagnosis is declared in paragraph two and mentioned once more ("death's deadline"), but no on-page beat shows time tightening choices—"days blurred into weeks" and "months passed in his mind's eye" are vague montage. He completes the work and dies on an unspecified schedule without urgency altering tactics. Setup present, closure coincides with death, but middle development is absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Fostering interspecies respect is stated as motivation multiple times ("motivation burned clear," "remodel... fostering respect," "Respect flows both ways," "fostering bonds") but remains an expositional claim rather than a dramatized want tested by friction. No on-page beat shows Elias weighing this desire against a conflicting cost or encountering resistance that forces compromise. Setup and thematic closure participation without middle conflict or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Brazen calm" recurs as a phrase across the text ("met the news with brazen calm," "brazen in its certainty," "brazen calm unbroken," "brazen calm eternal") but functions as a static label rather than a modulating tone. The narrative voice remains uniformly stately and declarative from diagnosis through dying; no shift in cadence or sentence rhythm under pressure. Present at setup and closure but not dynamically charged by the ending's stakes.</comment>
