<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her pacifism never faces a genuine test—the sheathed dagger becomes a symbol rather than a choice under fire. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("tranquil blaze," "senseless perception") rather than embodied contradiction. The roses' agency in the climax deflects her own moral calculus, leaving her core conflict unearned. Jax's return and acceptance feel summary-level rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when adequately and offers a single tightening when looters arrive, but the closure—roses blooming with "engraved" petals and Jax's nod—reads as symbolic tableau rather than decisive change with visible cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image recycles prior diction ("tranquil blaze," "engraved quiet") without reweighting stakes or revealing a foreclosed path. Elara's choice to sheathe the dagger occurs mid-beat and is immediately validated by plant-magic, bypassing felt consequence. The cost proof test fails: no on-page sentence in the ending demonstrates what Elara has lost or sacrificed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The glass dome and rose beds are anchored early and provide spatial coherence. The sandbag scrap and its "QUIET" engraving constrain one choice (mixing residue into soil), lifting the score slightly. However, much of the setting remains postcard-descriptive ("fire-kissed crimson," "scorching sands beyond") without tactical pressure on Elara's moves. The breach and looter approach are noted but not leveraged as spatial puzzles or resource limits during the confrontation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the farm—is signaled early, and the looter intrusion provides one escalation. Yet Elara's agency is undercut by the roses' autonomous action (thorns trip, pollen calms) rather than her own difficult trade-off. The sheathing of the dagger is framed as a vow but costs her nothing on the page; the plants immediately validate her choice. No visible price (stamina, injury, lost time, social consequence) alters her tactics or charges the final image. The escalation reads as setup → magical resolution rather than protagonist-driven tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of continuity through chaos is stated repeatedly ("weave continuity," "engraved quiet," "tranquil blaze") rather than emerging from particulars. The final paragraph moralizes with "We weave, not break," delivering thesis in place of resonant image. The sandbag scrap's "QUIET" engraving is pressed into symbolic service without earning its weight through prior friction or cost. No counter-reading or ambiguity remains; the text telegraphs its meaning at every turn.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable, but diction drifts into elevated register ("inculcating," "engraved quiet," "psychic weight") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Elara's "senseless perception" is asserted repeatedly but not dramatized through distinct perceptual signature or micro-choices. Jax's single line of dialogue is functional but generic. The prose uses template stems ("she knelt," "she lifted," "she tore") across adjacent beats, flattening rhythm under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The piece suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "quiet" recurs as engraved/quiet/hush/silence without added pressure; "tranquil blaze" appears five times unchanged. Template cadence runs dominate action beats ("She knelt… her hands sinking… she coaxed… A glint caught… she lifted… she tore"). Heavy figurative density in high-pressure moments ("petals a serene inferno," "allies now steeped in her inculcated values") muddies clarity. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to lean," "felt its history hum") dull immediacy during the looter confrontation. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the disallow-9+ cap and heavy penalty in this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The pacifist-daughter-of-bounty-hunter and plant-magic defense are familiar genre templates executed without transformation. The sandbag scrap's "QUIET" engraving is a token symbolic object rather than a fresh synthesis. Emotional specificity is thin; Elara's arc follows a predictable want-versus-world trajectory resolved by convenient plant agency. The final image (roses with vein-engravings, Jax softened) offers surface novelty but no deeper friction or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes the sheathing decision, but that choice is immediately validated by the roses' autonomous action, undercutting causal pressure. Her pacifism is stated rather than tested by a genuine trade-off. She appears in the closure tableau but does not drive the final turn; the plants and Jax's acceptance do the work. Mid-band, replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The sandbag scrap appears mid-story, is handled in two beats (discovery, tearing strip into soil), and returns in the closure image (scrap-vested roses). It constrains one choice (mixing residue) and charges the final visual. However, it could be replaced with any talisman object bearing a thematic inscription without breaking story logic. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Engraved quiet" is present as a label and symbol throughout but never shapes on-page tactics or alters Elara's options under pressure. It functions as theme echo rather than stake-driver. Ornamental, replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Senselessly perceptive" is asserted six times but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. Elara knows the looters' path via "the roses' subtle tremor," but this is told rather than dramatized as a trade-off or error. Label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sheathing action occurs at the climax and is signaled as a vow, framing Elara's pacifist stance. It shapes the middle turn and is reprised in the closure tableau. However, the roses' subsequent defense undercuts the sheathing's cost, and the act could be replaced with another symbolic renunciation. Essential to one beat, present in ending, but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Inculcating plants is mentioned in setup and middle (murmured litanies, mixing sandbag residue) and pays off when vines and pollen act autonomously. Yet the mechanics remain vague and the method could be swapped for generic plant-magic without edits. Functional across beats but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm is anchored early, supplies the breach for looter entry, and recurs in the closure image. The dome functions as both spatial constraint and thematic container. The setting pressures the confrontation and charges the final visual. Strong integration across beats and ending, nearing essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the tower falls" is mentioned in the opening and frames the chaos, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or track a live clock. Days pass vaguely ("days ago," "sunset," "night," "dawn," "midday") without altering Elara's tactics. Present but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to weave continuity is stated in the opening and closing and drives her choices to nurture and defend the farm. However, the want never conflicts with a competing need or cost; the roses validate her choices immediately. The friction between continuity and chaos remains abstract rather than embodied in a difficult trade-off. Functional, one key turn, but not deeply tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" recurs five times unchanged and is asserted rather than modulated with pressure. The tone remains static—serene defiance—throughout setup, confrontation, and closure without cadence shift or tension with events. Present as label, ornamental.</comment>
