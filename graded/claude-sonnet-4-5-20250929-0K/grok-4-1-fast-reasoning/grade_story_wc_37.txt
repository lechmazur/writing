<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's goal—rekindling the realm—is clear, but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("scattered memory keeper," "mosaic of fragmented recollections") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The spectral communities are mentioned but never dramatized as individuals with competing needs; they exist as props that conveniently cohere when the song begins. The final "alignment" of memories and the protagonist's shift to "dawn-weaver" feel declared rather than earned through on-page struggle or visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines, satisfying the test. The closure effect—realm rekindled, night dispelled—reads as a Decisive Change, but causality is weak: the three songs succeed without obstacle, and no on-page reversal narrows options or imposes felt cost. The accumulative lens is signaled (layered songs, gathering spirits), yet the escalation is additive rather than tightening, and the final image ("light prevailed") summarizes rather than dramatizing a before/after with visible price. The cost-proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what Elara sacrifices or forecloses.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly sketched—crystalline panes, glowing sap, Heart Tree with elixir veins—and the mica window recurs with shifting function (glimpsing true dawns, then clearing at closure). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's focus. However, spatial choreography remains vague (spectral figures "at the edges," no blocking of Elara's kneeling relative to the window or tree), and the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it is backdrop rather than pressure. The mica window charges the final image, elevating the score into the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rekindle the dying realm—is signaled early and sustained. Yet pressure does not escalate: the three songs succeed in sequence without complication, reversal, or visible tradeoff. Shadows "resist" and "coil tendrils," but Elara presses on without altering tactics or paying a legible price; the spectral communities join without friction. The closure effect is a successful restoration, but agency is passive (singing without decision branches) and cost is unfelt on the page. One tightening or deepening that narrows options is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—community knit through shared song, rebirth from fragmentation—emerges from events rather than statement, and the mica window's shifting role (glimpse → clear mirror) offers a non-literal reprise. However, the final image ("light prevailed," "harmony's embrace") leans toward abstract declaration rather than earned resonance from concrete particulars. The spectral communities solidify without dramatized friction or counter-pressure, reducing thematic complexity. The ending whispers of "other realms dying" gestures toward depth but arrives as setup for a sequel rather than reweighting prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is consistent and no head-hopping occurs. Diction is elevated and lyric ("threads golden filaments," "molten dawnlight"), fitting the fantastical register, though it risks purple density in peak beats. Perceptual signature is present but generic (fragments swirling, memories aligning). No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets are not triggered. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and filter verbs are minimal. The voice is distinct and controlled, earning mid-6s; reaching higher would require sharper interior contradiction or elision that pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and occasionally mixed ("veins of glowing sap," "bark like bruised skin," "molten dawnlight")—most images are legible, but the accumulation risks overwriting without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear: "Shadows howled, the bound night fracturing" immediately followed by "Endless night peeled back in veils" restates the same shift. Template cadence is light but present: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or "Elara [verb]." Information density is moderate; some sentences advance atmosphere more than plot. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, capping deductions under the non-closure cap. Propulsion is steady but not urgent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The alchemical-orchard-in-mirror-world setup and the scattered-memory-keeper archetype echo familiar fantasy templates (fractured keeper, songs-as-magic, spectral realm rebirth) without a sharp angle. The mica window as truth-warping mineral and the "woven dawns" image offer textural freshness, but the emotional arc—gathering fragments to sing restoration—follows a predictable collect-and-cast structure. The spectral communities cohere without friction or surprise, and the ending's promise of "other realms" signals sequel rather than transformation. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: core premise is widely used; transformation is partial, yielding mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara (scattered memory keeper) is present throughout and her goal drives the plot. Setup is immediate; development sees her humming and weaving songs; closure notes her "memories aligned" and shift to "dawn-weaver." However, her choices are passive execution (sing three songs in sequence without friction); observation and action are present, but no key turn hinges on a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The trait "scattered" is label-only, not shown through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Two gates (setup, closure mention) met; middle development is summary rather than choice-driven. Late first-third arrival not applicable (present from line one). Swappability: a "fragmented seer" or "broken mage" would function identically with minor edits. Causal pressure is weak (−0.6). Closure linkage is nominal (mentioned but not causally decisive, +0.3). Specificity is low (−0.5). Total adjustments: +0.3 −1.1 = net −0.8 from a 5.0 midpoint → 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mica window appears in three beats: early (glimpsing true dawns), middle (lending power), and closure (framing the horizon). Setup met (+0.5). Development: "Through the mica window, the true dawns pulsed brighter, mirroring her weave, lending power across the veil" shows it enabling Elara's tactic (+0.6). Closure: "The mica window framed a horizon ablaze" charges the final image (+0.9). Three beats (+1.4). Specificity: "mineral that warped reflections into truths" is unique (+0.5). No cost connection (neutral). Swappability: a magic mirror or crystal lens could replace it with minor edits (−0.5). Total: 3.0 base +0.5 +0.6 +0.9 +1.4 +0.5 −0.5 = 6.4 → round down 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Woven dawns (core concept) is signaled early: "woven dawns" named in paragraph 6, "threads of light" and "dawn-weave" in paragraphs 13–14. Setup late-first-third (−0.2). Development: "swaddling the first dawn-threads around the Heart Tree's roots" and "wrapping it in layered woven dawns" show the concept shaping Elara's tactic (+0.9). Closure: "woven dawns their eternal shield" and "woven dawns unfurl" frame the ending (+0.9). Two beats (+0.9). Causal pressure: the weaving enables the tree's revival (+0.8). Cost connection: no visible price tied to the weaving itself (neutral). Swappability: "woven light" or "dawn threads" could replace with minor edits (−0.5). Total: 3.0 +0.9 +0.9 +0.9 +0.8 −0.2 −0.5 = 5.8 → 5.3 after rounding.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Knits communities together (attribute) is named in paragraph 9 ("attribute that knits communities together") and demonstrated when spectral figures gather and "communities reforming in luminous clusters" (paragraph 16), then "communities' voices joined hers" (paragraph 21), and finally "communities forever intertwined" and "communities thrived" at closure. Setup by first third (+0.5). Development: the gathering constrains Elara's solo effort into a chorus, altering the tactic from individual to collective (+0.9). Closure: "communities forever intertwined" and "Spectral friends nodded, knit as one" charge the final image (+0.9). Three beats (+1.4). Causal pressure: the attribute enables the weave's amplification (+0.9). Cost: no visible price for the knitting itself (neutral). Swappability: "unites communities" or "binds people" could replace (−0.5). Total: 3.0 +0.5 +0.9 +0.9 +1.4 +0.9 −0.5 = 6.1 → 5.8 rounded.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Swaddle appears in paragraph 10 ("weave those dawns through song, swaddling the realm's essence"), paragraph 18 ("lullaby of rebirthed stars, swaddling the first dawn-threads"), paragraph 22 ("swaddled the Heart Tree fully, wrapping it in layered woven dawns"), and closure references ("swaddled in harmony's embrace"). Setup early (+0.6). Development: "swaddling the first dawn-threads around the Heart Tree's roots" is the first concrete instance, shaping the middle tactic (+0.7). Major turn: "swaddled the Heart Tree fully" triggers "The tree convulsed, bark splitting to reveal a core of molten dawnlight"—the decisive transformation (+1.2). Closure: "swaddled in harmony's embrace" reinforces the final image (+0.8). Three beats (+1.4). Causal pressure: the act of swaddling causes the tree's revival (+1.1). Swappability: "wrap" or "enfold" could replace with edits (−0.6). Total: 3.0 +0.6 +0.7 +1.2 +0.8 +1.4 +1.1 −0.6 = 7.2 → 6.7 rounded.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Through forgotten songs (method) is named in paragraph 9 ("forgotten songs held the attribute") and paragraph 12 ("Fragments swirled in her mind: a verse from a long-gone harvest festival, another from lovers' twilight vows"). Setup by ~20% (+0.6). Development: paragraphs 13–14 "began the first forgotten song," paragraph 18 "second song," paragraph 20 "third song"—the method structures all three middle beats (+1.2). Closure: "Through forgotten songs, she had bound the fracture and released the dawn" and "release the new dawn's song" frame the ending (+0.9). Three beats (+1.4). Causal pressure: the songs enable the weave and community gathering (+1.0). Cost: Elara's "Pain lanced Elara's temples as memories scattered further" ties cost to the singing (+0.5). Swappability: "ancient hymns" or "lost melodies" could replace (−0.6). Total: 3.0 +0.6 +1.2 +0.9 +1.4 +1.0 +0.5 −0.6 = 7.0 → 6.4 rounded.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night is established in the opening line and sustained throughout. Setup immediate (+0.8). Development: "orchard's alchemical core pulsed weakly" and "Heart Tree, its trunk a nexus of elixir veins" supply the resource Elara uses to anchor her weaving (+0.8). The endless night is the antagonist condition ("endless night resisted, coiling tendrils of shadow") that pressures the climax (+0.7). Closure: "The alchemical orchard bathed in the first woven dawn" and "alchemical haven, communities thrived" charge the final image (+0.9). Three beats (+1.4). Causal pressure: the setting's dying state motivates the quest and its revival is the outcome (+1.0). Specificity: "alchemical" + "orchard greenhouse" + "endless night" is unique (+0.6). Cost: no visible tradeoff tied to the setting itself (neutral). Swappability low. Total: 3.0 +0.8 +0.8 +0.7 +0.9 +1.4 +1.0 +0.6 = 9.2 → but missing cost cap at 8.4 per ≥7.0 rule; adjust to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>In the mirror world (timeframe) is named in the opening and closing, framing the entire narrative. Setup immediate (+0.8). Development: the mirror-world condition (endless night, spectral folk) constrains Elara's options throughout, and the mica window links mirror world to true world, enabling the weaving tactic (+0.7). Closure: "in the mirror world, light prevailed" and "The realm endured" frame the ending (+0.7). Two beats (+0.9). However, the "timeframe" element reads more as setting/condition than temporal constraint; no live clock or deadline tightens decisions. The mirror-world framing is conceptual rather than pressure-driven time. Specificity moderate (+0.4). Swappability: "in the shadow realm" or "in the dark dimension" could replace (−0.5). Total: 3.0 +0.8 +0.7 +0.7 +0.9 +0.4 −0.5 = 5.0 → 4.9 rounded.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>To rekindle a dying realm (motivation) is stated in paragraph 3 ("compelling her to rekindle its dying heart") and sustained as Elara's goal. Setup early (+0.6). Development: "resolved to weave those dawns through song, swaddling the realm's essence to spark renewal" (paragraph 10) shows the motivation driving her choice to act (+0.8). Closure: "the dying realm alive once more" and "The realm endured" confirm the motivation's fulfillment (+0.8). Two beats (+0.9). Causal pressure: the desire structures the entire plot (+1.0). Friction: "Pain lanced Elara's temples as memories scattered further—She pressed on" shows want versus cost (+0.5). Told-only risk: the motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory choices (−0.4). Swappability: "save the fading world" could replace (−0.5). Total: 3.0 +0.6 +0.8 +0.8 +0.9 +1.0 +0.5 −0.4 −0.5 = 6.7 → 6.2 rounded.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Bound release (tone) is signaled in paragraph 9 ("tone of bound release") and recurs at closure ("The bound night was but a memory, release the new dawn's song"). Setup by first third (+0.5). Development: the tone of constraint (endless night, scattered memories, spectral isolation) transitions to release (shadows unbound, light embraced, communities intertwined) as the weaving progresses, modulating with pressure (+0.7). Closure: "shadows unbound, light embraced" and "The bound night was but a memory, release the new dawn's song" charge the final image with the tone (+0.9). Two beats (+0.9). Coherence: the oppressive-to-liberated arc is consistent (+0.5). However, the tone is static within beats (descriptive rather than dynamic) and does not shift mid-scene to heighten a turn (−0.3). Swappability: "captivity and freedom" could replace (−0.5). Total: 3.0 +0.5 +0.7 +0.9 +0.9 +0.5 −0.3 −0.5 = 5.7.</comment>
