<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to harmonize tradition and progress is clear, but his arc suffers from over-articulated interiority that reads diagnostic rather than embodied. The "encrypted compassion pierced his dappled resolve" moment epitomizes therapy-speak that distances rather than immerses. His trembling appears as a repeated physical label without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to redesign the floodgates feels inevitable from the prompt rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens through Elias's discovery and analysis of the envelope, but the escalation feels mechanical: he finds, decodes, realizes, and implements without meaningful resistance. Orientation anchors "who" and "where" within bounds, though the volcanic amphitheater's spatial logic remains hazy. Closure arrives on the page as Elias's redesigned system succeeds and clans align, but the cost—"machinist's vigilance harmonizing flux"—is asserted in abstract language rather than made viscerally felt. The "building breathes" refrain becomes a structural crutch rather than a pressure device.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The amphitheater inside the dormant volcano is vividly rendered with sulfurous vapor, fractured stone tiers, and steaming basin. The antique surveyor's chain and its brass runes anchor tactile detail. However, spatial choreography wobbles—Elias moves from rim to rubble to makeshift camp without clear transitions. The environment enables the envelope discovery and informs his final hydraulic design, satisfying the micro-setting constraint test and charging the closure image with "stone lungs" and volcanic conduits.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—flood control versus sacred preservation—is signaled early and maintained. Elias's discovery of the envelope provides one meaningful turn that narrows his options, and the clan arrival tests his solution on the page. However, the escalation is largely internal and cerebral; no external antagonist pressures him, and the clans' skepticism dissolves instantly upon reading the letter. The cost of his choice—"eternal vigilance"—is stated rather than shown as a forfeited path or tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—harmonizing progress and tradition through empathy—emerges from the encrypted message and Elias's redesign, but the piece leans toward statement rather than implication. "Encrypted compassion" and "values woven whole" appear as thematic labels in the final third, violating the no-moralizing guideline. The parchment's line "Flood not the heart of the mountain, lest it drown your own" offers resonance, yet the ending's "Harmony, once cryptic, now flowed clear" telegraphs resolution too cleanly. The story's central question is answered, but the answer feelsasserted rather than lived.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register—"dappled resolve," "slyly heartfelt," "compassion armored against betrayal"—that strains against the machinist's practical lexicon. The elder's single line of dialogue, "Forged in mercy, hidden for such a time," carries distinct idiom, but Elias's interior voice blends prompt language ("harmonize conflicting values") with character-specific perception unevenly. Psychic distance is consistent, though filter verbs and abstract phrasing dull immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Pervasive template cadence and decorative phrase repetition mar momentum: "dappled resolve" appears four times, "the building breathed" recurs as scaffold, and "slyly heartfelt" is recycled without functional variation. Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third—"harmonize conflicting values" / "blend their values," "compassion encrypted" / "encrypted compassion"—triggering the −0.6 penalty for template runs. Mixed metaphors ("dappled resolve," "armored compassion," "stone lungs") reduce clarity. Information density is moderate; many lines serve atmosphere over plot. The closure beat itself remains legible, preventing deeper penalty, but line-level craft throughout lacks the precision required for high bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The volcano-amphitheater setting offers visual appeal, but the core premise—engineer discovers ancestor's message urging harmony—follows a familiar template of historical wisdom resolving present conflict. "Encrypted compassion" as prompt language appears undigested in the text. The adhesive-analysis method and chain-as-calibration-device provide mechanical ingenuity, yet the emotional arc and clan resolution proceed without surprise. Transformation test: the plot and emotional arc could transfer to another setting (ancient library, hidden cave) with minor adjustments, signaling insufficient specificity to elevate originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias, the ingenious floodgate machinist, is present throughout and his profession shapes his approach—measuring, analyzing adhesive, sketching hydraulic plans. He makes the key decision to retrofit sluices and later to redesign the system as "veins," altering tactics and driving closure. However, his ingenuity is more asserted than demonstrated; the adhesive analysis and valve calibration are summarized rather than shown in mechanical detail. Two gates clear (setup, closure), but middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The antique surveyor's chain appears in the opening, slips from Elias's lap during the revelation, and is "woven into new mechanisms" that calibrate gates to the vents' cadence, then coiled at the end as "a bridge between eras." It is handled across at least three beats and gains symbolic weight, but its unique properties—runes, brass links—do not mechanically constrain a choice. The closure image references it, satisfying all three gates, yet swappability (any heirloom tool) and modest causal pressure limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Encrypted compassion is the envelope's content, decoded via chemical cipher, and its message—"pleas for mercy hid within geometric proofs"—shifts Elias's understanding. It shapes the dominant stake by revealing his great-grandfather's intent and urging "invention over destruction." However, the concept is more thematic echo than tactical constraint; Elias's redesign follows logically from his profession, and the encryption does not narrow options in a high-pressure beat. Present in setup and closure, but middle development is summary.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Slyly heartfelt" is attached to Elias's actions ("His hands…moved with sly precision, heartfelt beneath") and the encrypted message ("slyly heartfelt, weaving empathy"). The trait recurs as a label but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost; no moment shows Elias choosing indirect expression over bluntness and paying a price. Late closure mention ("Encrypted compassion endured, slyly heartfelt across generations") is ornamental. One gate (closure cameo) at best; functional but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Tremble" appears when Elias decodes the final line ("The message trembled in his grasp…His fingers began to tremble"), after the revelation ("Trembling still from the revelation"), during the clan presentation, and at closure ("trembling faintly with quiet triumph"). It marks the story's emotional pivot and recurs across beats, charging the ending. However, the action itself—trembling—is somewhat swappable (shudder, shake); the beats turn on the revelation's content rather than the trembling itself altering tactics. Three gates clear; strong integration, modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elias scrapes adhesive, dissolves it in a solvent brewed from local minerals, and reveals microscopic glyphs—this method unlocks the envelope's code and drives the revelation beat. It appears in setup (discovery) and middle (analysis), and the result shapes closure. Yet the mechanics are summarized in one paragraph without tactile detail or false starts; the method succeeds immediately, reducing cost and tension. Two gates clear (setup, middle); closure is indirect (consequence, not method). Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crumbling amphitheater inside the dormant volcano is the sole location, richly described with fractured tiers, steaming basin, sulfurous vapor, and hidden vents. The setting supplies the envelope buried in rubble, the "building breathes" rhythm that becomes a design principle, and the final system that mimics the volcano's natural conduits. It appears in every beat and shapes Elias's solution, satisfying all three gates. However, spatial choreography wobbles and the amphitheater does not block a choice or force a trade-off; Elias operates freely. Strong presence, modest constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"As the building breathes" recurs as a refrain marking beats: initial survey, discovery, analysis ("the building breathed again in a deep inhale"), final sigh. The phrase gestures toward rhythmic time but does not impose a deadline or tighten decisions. Elias works "for months" before the story, then "days blurred" during construction—vague duration without tactical pressure. The breath motif is atmospheric rather than a live clock. Present across beats but does not alter moves; cap at 4.6 for missing middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—"to harmonize conflicting values"—is declared in paragraph four and drives his survey, his reaction to the ancestor's message, and his final redesign. The friction between flood control and preservation is dramatized through clan debates (mentioned) and the elder's recognition at closure. However, the conflict is more external (clans disagree) than internal (Elias never wavers or faces a forced choice between the two). Present in setup, middle realization, and closure, but dramatized friction with visible cost is thin.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears as phrase and image: light through cracks mottles steam, Elias works in "dappled resolve," dawn "dappled his work," twilight "dappled the stones," and the final line holds "Dappled resolve." The tone is coherent—determined yet layered—and the motif charges the closure image. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure; Elias remains steadfast throughout without tonal shift during the revelation or clan confrontation. The refrain risks decorative repetition. Early signal, closure reprise, but static mood and phrase-recycling lower the score.</comment>
