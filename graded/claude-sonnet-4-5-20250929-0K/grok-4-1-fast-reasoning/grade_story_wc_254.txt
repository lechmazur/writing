<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The cloud-shadow poet lacks contradictory impulses; his aesthetic drive operates smoothly without internal friction or cost until the very end. Motivation is declared ("aesthetically driven," "hungered to stride through boundaries") rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The tremor of certainty arrives as assertion—"absolute and unyielding"—without prior doubt or struggle to earn it. No secondary character applies pressure, and the transformation at closure ("emerged transformed, cloud-shadows now laced with quartz gleam") reads ornamental rather than a foreclosed path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural (the piece builds through repeated images and verse fragments toward a final resonance). Orientation anchors who (cloud-shadow poet) and where (cobalt atrium by frozen lake) by the second paragraph, passing the test. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration via final image ("verses the new map," "hush deepened, pregnant with possibilities"), but cost is asserted rather than demonstrated on the page—no line shows what he gave up or what path closed. The ban-lifting frame and the dissolution sequence lack because/therefore linkage; events happen in sequence without causal pressure narrowing options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and quartz colonnade anchor place vividly with sensory specificity (lantern-moth hush, translucent quartz veined with starlight, steam rising in wisps). The colonnade constrains the crossing attempt—pillars lean inward to form the archway—satisfying the 9+ gate partially. However, spatial choreography blurs: the poet moves from "before them" to "through" to "the far side" without clear distances or thresholds, and the lake's edge appears suddenly after the crossing. Micro-setting (quartz pulse syncing with his pulse) charges one early beat but does not recur at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: to stride through boundaries once thought sacred. No meaningful tightening occurs; the poet paraphrases verse, boundaries yield without resistance, and he crosses successfully in a smooth escalation with no reversal or trade-off. The ban's lifting removes the only potential obstacle before the story begins, leaving no on-page antagonistic pressure. Agency is present (he chooses to paraphrase) but cost is absent—nothing is risked, lost, or foreclosed. The tremor of certainty functions as confirmation rather than a complicating turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through repeated images (boundaries, shadows, quartz, hush) and the opposition sacred/aesthetic, but the final lines state the thesis overtly: "Sacred no more, for beauty claims all thresholds" and "No force could reclaim what aesthetic dissolution had freed." The tremor of certainty motif recurs but does not shift meaning—it remains an affirmation rather than a reweighting. Subtext is thin; the poet's intent and the world's response align without friction or ambiguity. The ending offers satisfaction rather than a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (aesthetic vocabulary, focus on light and texture) but not character-particular—diction drifts into elevated register ("otherworldly light," "profound knowing," "aesthetic audacity") that reads ornamental rather than voice-specific. Psychic distance is inconsistent: "A tremor of certainty quivered through him then, absolute and unyielding" tells certainty rather than showing its embodied effect. Free indirect style is attempted but filter verbs and abstract nominalizations ("his motivation burned," "his form flickering") dull immediacy. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "aesthetically driven" (×2), "tremor of certainty" (×3), "dissolving boundaries" (×4), and repeated sentence stems ("He [verb]," "The [noun] [verb]"). Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "lantern-moth hush," "cloud-shadow poet," "cloak woven from fleeting umbras," "quartz essence," "lantern-moth wisps" cluster without clear payoff at closure. Register drifts into abstract philosophical diction ("aesthetic audacity," "profound knowing," "conceptual repricing") mid-scene without voice motivation. Mixed metaphors: moths drawn to lanterns vs. cloud-shadows striding; quartz turning liquid vs. pillars leaning. Information density is low—many lines restate the crossing theme without advancing situation or narrowing options.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—a poet crossing forbidden boundaries through verse after a ban lifts—echoes familiar portal-fantasy and artist-as-magician templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The cloud-shadow poet, humming quartz, and lantern-moth hush are vivid tokens but function ornamentally rather than as a synthesis that charges the ending. The tremor of certainty and aesthetic dissolution remain abstract concepts rather than specific stakes with texture. No bold structural risk; the linear crossing sequence follows a conventional quest arc (approach, attempt, success) with elevated diction in place of fresh insight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Cloud-shadow poet present throughout but his choices (paraphrasing verse, stepping through the archway, kneeling at the water's edge) do not create reversals or narrow options—each move succeeds without friction. Setup in paragraph two, middle beats (tracing quartz, paraphrasing ode, striding through), closure presence (walking on as living map). Swappable with "dream-walker" or "threshold-poet" with minor edits; the cloud-shadow attribute is ornamental. No cost tied to his agency; the transformation is asserted ("emerged transformed") rather than earned through sacrifice or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Humming quartz colonnade introduced early (paragraph four), handled in two beats (tracing facets, pillars leaning to form archway), returns in final third ("colonnade stood sentinel, humming softer"). Its hum synchronizes with the poet's pulse and swells as he paraphrases, enabling the crossing. However, its mechanics remain vague—why does paraphrasing affect quartz?—and the final reprise is static description rather than reweighted meaning. Closure linkage weak: the colonnade watches but does not charge the final image. Specificity present (translucent, veined with starlight) but no visible cost tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>A tremor of certainty appears three times (paragraphs 13, 17, 24) as a label for the poet's confidence but does not shape stakes or tactics—it confirms rather than complicates. Introduced late (past the 40% mark) and functions thematically rather than causally. The poet's certainty never wavers or costs him anything; no friction between certainty and doubt. Easily swappable with "surge of conviction" or "wave of clarity." Setup missing, no middle development that narrows options, closure mention ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Aesthetically driven stated twice (paragraphs 3, 17) and mentioned implicitly ("elegance, verse as solvent"). Constrains method (he refuses crude force, uses verse) but this constraint is never tested—no moment where aesthetics cost him speed, safety, or success. Label-only trait without visible trade-off. Present early, returns in middle, absent from closure. Swappable with "artistically motivated" or "beauty-obsessed" with minimal revision.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase action central: poet paraphrases the ancient ode (paragraph 9), continues paraphrasing to thaw the lake (paragraph 18), seals the crossing with a final paraphrase (paragraph 20). Drives three beats and enables the boundary-crossing. However, the mechanics are opaque—why does rephrasing words dissolve quartz and thaw ice?—and no cost is visible. The verses quoted are generic ("Where once walls of frost divided dream from waking") rather than specific transformations. Setup clear, development present, closure linkage strong (verses become "the new map"), but swappability moderate (could be "rewrite" or "translate" with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Through dissolving boundaries method signaled early (paragraph 3) and repeated (×4). Mechanics: verse dissolves sacred lines, quartz turns liquid, boundaries yield. Present in setup, middle (pillars dissolving, boundaries yielding), and closure (boundaries "forever permeable"). However, the method is asserted rather than dramatized—no resistance or cost. The dissolution happens smoothly without tactical adjustment. Swappable with "by unraveling barriers" or "via melting thresholds." Functional but replaceable; no unique properties matter.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium by frozen lake anchored in paragraph one, returned in final paragraph ("The cobalt atrium by the frozen lake watched, eternal and approving"). The lake's thawing (paragraph 19) affects atmosphere but not the poet's tactics—he was already crossing. The atrium's cobalt color is mentioned but not leveraged. Spatial choreography unclear (how far from colonnade to lake edge?). Setup strong, middle presence weak (setting does not constrain choices), closure reprise static. Micro-setting (quartz colonnade) does more work than the larger frame.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>After the ban lifts timeframe stated in opening line and recalled once ("post-ban," paragraph 14). The ban's lifting is backstory that removes obstacle rather than tightening decisions; no live clock pressures the crossing. Time is vague—how long does the paraphrasing take? No urgency tied to the timeframe. Setup present, no middle development (time does not narrow options), closure absent. Swappable with "in the new era" or "when restrictions ended."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>To stride through boundaries once thought sacred motivation stated explicitly (paragraph 3) and echoed (paragraphs 7, 14, 28). Desire is told ("hungered to stride") rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. No friction between wanting to cross and cost of crossing—he succeeds without sacrifice. Setup clear, middle presence as repeated assertion, closure link weak (he achieves the goal but pays no visible price). Label-only motivation without trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Lantern-moth hush tone established in opening line, returned in paragraphs 14, 24, 28, and final line ("the hush deepened, pregnant with possibilities"). The tone is consistent—quiet, reverent, suspended—and modulates subtly (the hush "settled," "invited boldness," "deepened"). However, it does not charge the final image with new pressure; the ending hush is identical to the opening hush. Coherent through turns but static mood rather than dynamic reweighting. Setup strong, development present (tone supports aesthetic method), closure reprise reinforces rather than transforms.</comment>
