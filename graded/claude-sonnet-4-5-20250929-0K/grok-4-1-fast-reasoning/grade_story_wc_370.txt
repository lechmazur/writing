<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's empathy is labeled rather than dramatized through embodied contradictions. The young man materializes without earned interiority and exists solely to validate her arc. Her "mistake" is told in backstory without present friction—she already knows what she wants and faces no genuine obstacle to joining. The final transformation ("compassionate recluse no more") is asserted rather than earned through on-page choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words with dense exposition before anchoring who/where/when in a comprehensible frame (−0.4). The closure unit—Elara stepping through the wall and receiving a tome—lacks felt cost; she gains membership without forfeiting anything on the page. The drive lens oscillates between causal (invitation mechanics) and accumulative (nested paradoxes as texture) without teaching a coherent pattern, and the ending does not land a decisive change, earned stasis, or conceptual repricing with undeniable pressure. Backstory dominates the present without altering a live choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The library's dual nature is established early and the restricted mezzanine provides spatial staging for the climax. However, the "hidden archive pulsing with ethereal light" and brass lanterns remain postcard description without constraining a choice or altering tactics. The crumpled invitation's physical properties (frayed edges, shimmering ink) are ornamental and do not pressure the decision to enter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara seeking redemption for her past refusal—is declared but never tested. She faces no opposition; the young man's "trap" fear evaporates without consequence, and the wall opens on cue. No meaningful tightening or reversal narrows her options; the escalation is summary-only ("As midnight bloomed"). The resolution is coincidental (a wall panel and elder await her) rather than driven by protagonist agency with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme of "wisdom in mistakes" and "nestled paradoxes" is stated repeatedly ("In mistake's shadow, wisdom gleams," "to hide is to be found") rather than emerging from dramatized events. The final paragraph moralizes ("the ultimate wisdom: to hide is to be found") in place of a resonant image (−0.6). The young man's "crumpled fears smoothing into resolve" is told summary, not earned through scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The register is elevated and uniform, with phrases like "enlarged tranquility," "nestled paradoxes," and "stardust" that sit outside Elara's librarian POV. Dialogue is sparse but serviceable. Psychic distance is inconsistent: the narrator asserts the young man's "paradox of his terror" and later his "crumpled fears smoothing" without access. Diction remains abstract ("ethereal light," "infinite library") during peak beats rather than grounding in embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "compassionate recluse" appears three times, "nestled paradoxes" four times, "crumpled" six times across invitation and fears. Template cadence dominates exposition ("Her keenly empathetic nature allowed…," "That error haunted her…," "Now, driven by that very regret…"). Stock metaphors ("beacon of quietude," "whispered secrets," "bloomed into sagacity") accumulate without earning resonance. Filter-verb stacks ("felt the paradox," "recognized the seal," "felt her guidance") dull immediacy in peak beats (−1.2 baseline; −0.5 additional for filter stacks in high-pressure moments; total artifacts touch closure, triggering the 9+ disallow).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The secret-society-in-a-library premise is a widely used template without fresh transformation. The "nestled paradoxes" conceit is stated rather than dramatized through specific world logic or moral calculus. The midnight ritual, hidden panel, and robed elders are stock genre furniture. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and frames the premise, but Elara's compassion is label-only; her reclusiveness does not constrain a choice with cost. She guides the young man to a carrel (one beat) but the act is summary-only and ornamental. Swappable with "thoughtful librarian" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The invitation appears in three beats: young man's arrival, Elara pockets it, and it disintegrates at the wall. Early signal and closure participation present, but middle development is weak—pocketing it does not constrain a tactic. The disintegration is ornamental rather than causal. "Crumpled" recurs six times, triggering pattern-artifact debt (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Introduced at the 50% mark when Elara reaches the mezzanine. The concept is theme-stated ("nestled paradoxes, where every truth contained its opposite") rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. It does not alter her decision to enter or the mechanics of the rite. Ornamental and late (cap 4.6; decorative mention −0.3; late arrival that does not transform prior material −2.2).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Present early ("keenly empathetic nature allowed her to sense the unspoken sorrows") but remains label-only. It does not enable or constrain an on-page action with cost. Elara's empathy is asserted in summary ("feeling the paradox of his terror") without embodied tradeoff or tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The action "hide" is conceptualized ("the method of staying while leaving") but not dramatized with causal pressure. Elara guides the young man to hide in a carrel (one ornamental beat) and then "hides in full view" by stepping through the wall—metaphorical rather than a concrete tactic with cost. Swappable with "enter" or "join" without major structural edits (cap 3.8; one beat +0.4; closure mention without causal activity +0.0; metaphorical use −0.1).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Introduced at ~60% ("the method of staying while leaving") and glossed as metaphor. It does not shape a middle attempt or alter the ending's mechanics; the wall-passage is a straightforward entry, not a paradoxical tactic. Summary-only use at closure (−0.3); late introduction (−0.4); label-only (−0.3); cap 4.6 for missing setup, further reduced by frictions.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Established early and frames all action. The library's dual nature pressures Elara's hiding tactic and provides the concealed panel and archive for closure. Present in setup, development (spiral staircase to mezzanine), and payoff (archive reveal). However, the "hidden archive" itself is postcard description without constraining a live choice. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, ornamental description −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Clock chimes appear twice (eleven-fifty, midnight blooms) but do not tighten a decision or alter tactics. Time is decorative rather than a live constraint. Present in setup and mentioned at closure but does not shape the pace of Elara's choices. Two touches +0.9, closure mention +0.3, ornamental use −0.8, vague tracking −0.4; cap 4.6 for missing middle development pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Introduced early ("driven by that very regret, she sought to transform folly into enlightenment") and frames the arc. However, the desire is backstory-told without present friction; Elara already knows she wants to join and faces no obstacle. The elder's line "You return wiser for the mistake" at closure tells rather than dramatizes the payoff. Early signal +0.6, closure mention +0.4, summary-only development −0.6, no on-page cost tied to the motivation −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Enlarged tranquility" appears in three passages but reads as a static label rather than a tone that modulates with pressure. The phrase is ornamental diction outside the POV's idiom and does not charge the final image with felt cost. Present throughout (three mentions +1.4), closure mention +0.3, ornamental/label-only −0.6, register drift −0.5; cap 4.6 for missing pressure modulation, reduced by frictions.</comment>
