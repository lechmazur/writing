<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's observational habits are clearly embodied through physical action (unfastening the tube, splinting the bird), and her lateral thinking process shows character-particular cognition. However, the final "choice" to encode rather than report reads more like habitual recording than a consequential decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The interiority occasionally drifts into label-only terms ("credibly curious," "integrity") without sufficient embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately by the courtyard arrival. The closure—encoding her intuition and choosing solitude over reporting—qualifies as Earned Stasis, but the cost (withholding potentially critical intelligence) is asserted rather than dramatically felt on the page. The Causal lens holds through the pigeon arrival and lateral deduction sequence, though the follower's identity and the "zone-touched scout" conclusion arrive via summary rather than on-page dramatization. One meaningful tightening occurs when she connects the breach to weaponized pigeons, but the final stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The courtyard functions as a lived-in space (wrought-iron gate, olive tree, workbench, lantern) that both shelters and constrains Elara's choice to work alone. Sensory details (bruised purple sky, gravel paths, golden lantern pools) are filtered through her recorder's attention and modulate with dusk's progression. The setting charges the final image of solitude as bastion, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, though some phrases ("fog-shrouded alleys," "shadowed fringes") trend toward stock atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—verify the rogue zone's existence while preserving meticulous integrity—is signaled early and tightens when the message reframes her storm logs. However, the escalation relies heavily on Elara's internal cross-referencing rather than external resistance or a trade-off that narrows live options. The follower and the pigeon both function as clues rather than active pressures, and the final decision to withhold her findings lacks a dramatized consequence that would elevate cost legibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of integrity-in-solitude emerges organically from Elara's choice to verify alone rather than fracture truth with premature reports. The courtyard's "layered tranquility" and the closing image (bastion, journal, message tube) resonate without overt moralizing. However, the thematic vocabulary ("nurturing integrity," "solitude's forge," "integrity bloomed") edges toward direct statement in the final third, and the rogue zone's drift as metaphor for oblique truth remains underdeveloped in concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent third-person limited POV with a scientific, observational texture ("barometric pressures," "theodolite," "anemometers"). Perceptual signature is evident in her habit of cross-referencing data and sketching vectors. However, elevated diction ("credibly curious," "encroaching chaos," "unyielding anchor") occasionally drifts above the practical voice established in her physical work, and some phrases ("her mind sidestepping linear suspicions") explain rather than enact her lateral thinking process.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "solitude was her sanctuary" / "In this courtyard's layered tranquility"; "integrity" recurs five times with similar framing; "layered tranquility" appears three times. Template cadence runs appear in the final third ("Solitude nurtured, integrity bloomed. The pigeon's distant coo…"). Figurative language is dense without always advancing pressure ("storms mask the spread," "solitude's forge," "calm eye"), and the closing string of short declaratives reads mechanical. Information density is high in the deduction sequence but dilutes in the reflective closing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rogue quarantine zone and bio-storm premise offers a fresh speculative angle, and the use of carrier pigeons as infiltration vectors shows ingenuity. Elara's lateral reasoning method is specific to her profession. However, the core arc—solitary expert decodes a hidden threat and chooses to investigate alone—follows a familiar template without a non-obvious moral trade-off or transformation that reweights the premise in hindsight.</comment>
