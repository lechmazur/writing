<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's insomnia and artistic drive are established early, but his micro-choices remain largely observational until the exchange near the end. The meeting with Mira feels convenient rather than earned through prior pressure. Interior contradictions are present ("wryly earnest") but don't sufficiently constrain his actions; the brooch exchange reads more thematic than character-compelled. Embodied emotion is visible in "heart pounding with weary wonder," yet the final shift toward sleep's edge lacks the visible cost of a path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: rain trails, tidal rhythms, and war-scarred setting build density toward a final reconfiguration. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the brooch installed on the easel crystallizes purpose and the convergence of past/present—but the cost remains largely asserted ("purpose") rather than shown as a forfeited alternative. Orientation anchors land clearly by the opening paragraph. The rain-to-pool sequence provides one meaningful tightening, sufficient for this length, though Mira's arrival introduces coincidence that complicates without fully resolving under causal pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tidal island is vividly rendered with war-scarred basalt cliffs, tidal pools, and kelp; these details constrain Elias's movements and charge the closure image (brooch on easel as tides roar). The rain trails function as micro-setting, guiding discovery with purposeful sensory hierarchy. Spatial choreography remains clear across transitions from easel to pool to shack. The island's twice-daily isolation operates as both prison and muse, directly shaping the final stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—threshing meaning from survival—is signaled early and sustained. The rain-trails discovery provides one meaningful tightening that narrows Elias's focus, and the exchange with Mira offers a visible trade (painting for brooch). However, the exchange itself feels more cooperative than costly; no live option is demonstrably foreclosed on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres through layered imagery, but the final act lacks a sharp price that charges the image with undeniable weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the convergence motif—wars/wonders, isolation/connection, past/present—without overt statement. The brooch as trapped dragonfly becomes a purposeful image that reweights survival as potential flow rather than stasis. The exchange moment ("thresh the awe from our haggard lot") edges toward thematic echo but is embedded in character action. The final image (brooch gleaming, Elias glimpsing sleep's edge) offers resonance without moral, though "life flowed anew" risks mild summary. Subtext operates in gesture and object rather than declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice remains stable in third-person limited with a distinct texture ("wryly earnest," "haggard awe"), but the diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("thresh meaning," "savage beauty") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. The repeated phrase "wryly earnest" and "haggard awe" anchor tone but verge on mannerism. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Mira's exposition ("trails like these don't lie post-wars") carries purpose but lacks strong subtext. POV control is clean with no head-hopping, and psychic distance modulates appropriately under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates purposeful rhythm and vivid imagery ("fat drops splattered," "kelp clung like war banners"), but several text artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("his endless nights painting isolation, her wanderings chasing ancestral echoes"), template cadence in the opening beats, and stock metaphor strings ("ringed with perpetual shadows," "burned with wryly earnest focus"). The phrase "wryly earnest" recurs eight times, creating a mannerism that dulls immediacy. Filter verbs ("felt the weight," "glimpsed sleep's edge") cluster in peak moments. Information density is generally high, but scaffolding like "Something in their fleeting paths tugged at him" slows momentum. No loops directly obscure the closure image, capping deductions at −0.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The post-water-wars tidal island and convergence motif offer a fresh synthesis, avoiding generic dystopia through specific sensory detail (amber dragonfly, war-fissured aquifers). The emotional arc—two insomniacs finding meaning in shared exchange—transforms potential cliché through the island's embodied constraints. However, the "brooch as ancestral marker" backstory arrives late and feels convenient, and the resolution risks the safety middle by granting both connection and artistic renewal without a sharp trade-off. The rain-trail method and convergence concept are purposeful but not wholly non-obvious. Risk-taking is moderate; the structure and emotional beats remain within conventional bounds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias appears throughout and makes the exchange choice, but his agency remains largely observational until the final third. The decision to trade painting for brooch shapes the ending, meeting two gates (present early, shapes closure). However, the choice feels thematic rather than pressured by prior constraint; swapping him for another artist would not break story logic. His insomnia colors perception but does not demonstrably narrow options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The brooch is unearthed mid-story, exchanged in a key beat, and installed on the easel at closure—three distinct touches. Its specific property (dragonfly in amber) charges the final image and reweights the convergence theme. Early signal is absent, triggering a −0.3 penalty, but causal pressure (exchange alters Elias's artistic focus) and closure linkage are strong. Removing it would weaken the ending's resonance significantly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The concept is articulated explicitly ("unearthed convergence of stone and shell," "convergence point for smugglers") and frames theme, but it remains largely decorative rather than constraining tactics. The rain trails converge at the pool, and past/present converge in the exchange, yet these are illustrative rather than mechanically shaping Elias's options. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is thin. Swappability is moderate; "intersection" or "meeting" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Wryly earnest" recurs as a label throughout (eight instances) but seldom constrains action with visible cost. It colors Elias's tone in dialogue ("You flew before the wars drowned ambition") and his final smile, meeting setup and payoff gates, but no on-page choice hinges on this trait's specific tension. The attribute reads as voice garnish rather than causal lever. Middle development is absent, and swappability is high.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The exchange occurs in the penultimate beat, transferring brooch for painting and catalyzing Elias's shift ("ignited it"). This action meets development and payoff gates but arrives late (past the 60% mark), applying a −0.3 penalty. It is not easily swappable—removing it would eliminate the relational turn—but the exchange itself lacks sharp on-page cost (Mira "pressed" the brooch into his palm with no visible hesitation or forfeiture). Two beats (exchange, installation on easel) provide solid integration, yet the emotional price remains asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rain trails are signaled early ("Something in their fleeting paths tugged at him") and drive the middle sequence (following trails to the pool), meeting setup and development gates. The method shapes one key turn (discovery of the brooch) and is referenced at closure ("rain trails already fading in memory but etched in his art"). However, the mechanics remain vague—how trails "snaked through bramble" or "converged like veins"—and swappability is moderate; "tracking erosion patterns" could substitute. Closure participation is indirect (mentioned in summary), not causally active in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tidal island is established in the opening paragraph and pressures choices throughout: twice-daily isolation traps Elias, tidal rhythms structure his art, the exposed pool is accessible only at slack tide, and the shack provides refuge as "tides roared beyond the walls" at closure. Three gates are met with strong causal pressure. The setting is irreplaceable—removing the island would collapse the convergence logic and the tidal clock that enables discovery. Specificity (basalt cliffs, war-era bombardments, kelp as war banners) anchors the world and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The water wars frame the world (parched except for tidal zones, aquifers fissured by bombardments) and provide thematic weight ("wars drowned ambition"), meeting setup and payoff gates. However, the timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions; decades have passed, and no live clock or escalating post-war pressure alters Elias's tactics. The setting could function identically with a different historical scar. Summary-only integration and high swappability lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elias's desire to "thresh meaning from the haggard grind of survival" is declared early and dramatized in his choice to follow the rain trails and accept the exchange. The motivation meets all three gates and drives two beats (trail pursuit, brooch installation). However, friction between want and cost is muted—no on-page moment shows him weighing meaning against another need. The final shift ("convergence with purpose") is asserted more than earned through visible trade-off, and swappability is moderate; "find purpose in chaos" could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Haggard awe" is established in the opening ("eyes, ringed with perpetual shadows," "haggard wonder") and recurs at key beats ("haggard awe on their faces," "In haggard awe, he worked"). The tone modulates with pressure (from "weary wonder" to "earnest brush steady") and charges the final image, meeting all three gates. However, the phrase is repeated five times, verging on mannerism, and the tone could be approximated by "weary reverence" or similar near-synonyms with minor edits. Closure linkage is present but not indispensable.</comment>
