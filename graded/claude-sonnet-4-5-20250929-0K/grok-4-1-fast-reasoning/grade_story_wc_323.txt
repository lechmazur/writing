<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kai's motivation is declared but never tested by competing impulses or genuine obstacle; he arrives wanting to learn navigation and simply receives instruction without internal friction. Elara functions as exposition vehicle rather than character with her own stake. The "balanced curiosity" attribute appears only as narrator assertion ("embodied a balanced curiosity") without constraining a single on-page choice. Interiority consists of stock phrases ("heart pounding," "eyes widened") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No closure effect occurs on the page: Kai departs "ready for starlit depths" without any decisive change, cost, or stance crystallization—merely a declaration of future intent. The single scene is a lecture with holographic demonstration; no reversal or tightening narrows options. Orientation is delayed (benthic city, discovery context, alien nature all front-loaded in ~150 words of preamble before anchoring who/when/where in present action), triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The piece reads as setup for an adventure rather than a complete pressure unit with on-page resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Benthic setting provides vivid sensory anchors (bioluminescent glow, pressure seals, phosphorescent fish) and the vaulted chamber is spatially coherent. However, environment remains postcard description; no choice is constrained by depth, pressure, or resource scarcity. The chain link is handled twice (extended to Elara, clutched during simulation) but does not alter access or options—it serves as visual aid rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is clean but the setting does not pressure the instructional exchange.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled (learn starlight navigation) but never tested by obstacle, cost, or competing pressure. The scene is a lecture: Elara explains, Kai observes and practices a simulation without failure or friction. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the hologram "unfolds" smoothly and Kai departs with new knowledge at no visible price. Coincidence does not complicate because nothing complicates—progression is flat instruction without escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Somber marvel" is asserted repeatedly ("somber marvel," "quiet thrill," "shadow") but never earned through specific loss or tradeoff on the page. The chain link recurs but does not shift meaning; it remains a teaching tool in both beats. Theme of expansion versus lost anchors is stated directly ("expanding worlds while contracting the soul's familiar anchors") rather than emerging from dramatized consequence. The final departure image offers no non-literal reweighting—Kai simply leaves with the artifact, motivation intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Narration holds third-person limited on Kai without head-hopping; psychic distance is stable. However, diction drifts into elevated register incongruent with a salvage diver's lexicon: "benthic gloom," "dihedral angles," "exponentially," "somber hymn," "veils no compass can chart." Dialogue ("the aliens' horizons beckon, but without starlight navigation, we're anchored in ignorance") reads scripted rather than spoken under pressure. Elara and Kai share uniform syntax and tone; no perceptual signature distinguishes the focalizer's noticing habits from the instructor's.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "wondrous in its vast implications, yet tinged with melancholy" / "somber marvel" / "promise and peril intertwined" all restate the same tonal claim without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs: "She neither rushed… nor shunned, but probed…" Stock metaphors cluster: "living constellations," "veils," "petals." The final paragraph contains a visible scaffold artifact: "[Actually, ending here, but count adjusts.] Wait, precise:…" Filter-verb stacks flatten immediacy ("see here," "leaned in," "eyes widened"). Synonym churn: "horizons" / "veils" / "rifts" cycle without adding density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Benthic alien contact premise and holographic training session are functional genre furniture without fresh angle. The chain-link-as-teaching-tool device is mildly specific but swappable (any geometric artifact would serve). "Edge geometry" as navigation method is named but not transformed through lived consequence or non-obvious moral calculus. Tone and vocabulary ("somber marvel," "balanced curiosity") echo prompt labels rather than emerging organically. No turn or final image offers hindsight inevitability; the piece reads as competent world-building sketch without ingenuity in character choice or thematic synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara is present in setup (introduced early), development (explains method mid-scene), and closure (final shadow-gaze). However, her choices do not create turns; she delivers instruction without obstacle, refusal, or competing pressure. The "balanced curiosity" manifests as narrator summary, not decision under cost. Score: ornamental presence across beats without causal agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Chain link appears in setup (Kai clutches it entering), development (Elara projects hologram from it, demonstrates edge geometry), and closure (Kai departs "chain in hand"). Two distinct beats of handling. However, it functions identically in both: visual teaching aid. No reweighted meaning or causal pressure; swappable with any geometric relic. Mid-band for presence and recurrence without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Unfolded horizons" frames expectation (aliens parted veils to starlit realms) and returns in closure image (rift portal shimmers). However, the concept remains thematic backdrop; it does not constrain a single on-page choice or alter Kai's tactics. The instruction proceeds identically whether horizons are "unfolded" or simply "distant." Functional setup and reprise without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Balancedly curious" appears once as narrator assertion about Elara's approach ("embodied a balanced curiosity that tempered her awe with caution") without enabling or constraining any action. No trade-off, friction, or visible cost tied to this attribute on the page. Label-only mention; no beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Expand" is signaled early (unfolded horizons), executed in development (Elara manipulates hologram edges, "rings unfurling," model "began to expand"), and echoed at closure (rift portal, "expanding worlds"). The action drives the instructional beat. However, it could be replaced with "calculate," "align," or "project" without altering story logic—method matters more than this verb. One key turn shaped; replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Edge geometry" is signaled in development ("edge geometry expands boundaries by mapping the precise angles where forms connect"), demonstrated via hologram (tracing jagged edges, dihedral angles, exponential extension), and referenced at closure ("geometry pulls you through veils"). The method shapes the instructional beat and enables the navigation concept. However, mechanics remain abstract; specificity of "dihedral angles" and "edges" is asserted without altering a choice under friction. Functional across two beats; not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Benthic city anchors setting from the opening and returns at closure ("benthic city's lights dimmed"). Vaulted chamber, pressure seals, bioluminescent detail provide atmosphere. However, depth does not constrain choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—instruction could occur in any lab. Postcard presence without tactical pressure; functional setup and closure mention.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After discovering aliens" is declared in setup but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. The discovery is backstory framing; no live clock, competing deadline, or escalating consequence tied to the timeframe. Time remains vague throughout the instructional scene. Present but not tracked or pressuring.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kai's motivation ("to learn navigation by starlight") is signaled in setup ("motivation burned singularly"), drives the instructional exchange (middle beat), and is reaffirmed at closure ("motivation forged anew"). Desire shapes one key turn (entering the academy, receiving instruction). However, no friction between want and cost appears; he arrives seeking knowledge and receives it without sacrifice or competing impulse. Essential to one beat; not dramatized under conflicting pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Somber marvel" is asserted throughout ("somber marvel," "quiet thrill," "shadow," "peril intertwined") but remains static label rather than modulating with pressure. The tone does not shift as instruction proceeds; melancholy is declared in setup and reasserted at closure without transformation. Present across beats as atmospheric claim; does not charge the final image through progression or reversal.</comment>
