<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's core motivation is clear and embodied through methodical action, and the tape fragment triggers authentic sense memory that deepens his resolve. However, the woman remains thinly sketched—her genealogy obsession is told rather than shown affecting her choices, and her final embrace feels unearned by prior interaction. The wife's deathbed whisper "Become visible to those who need you" skirts therapy-speak but gains grounding through the concrete tape artifact and Elias's years-long pattern of hidden care.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story anchors orientation early (library, dawn, outage) and follows a clean causal chain: sob heard → cache prepared → tape discovered → woman finds cache → Elias reveals himself. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias steps from shadow into her beam, fulfilling his vow with visible cost (years of hiding now foreclosed). The tape's emergence feels coincidental rather than causally earned, introducing mild convenience, but the final image reweights his isolation with undeniable pressure and the accumulative lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The library's hidden veins, pipe chases, and rusted flanges are vivid and purposeful, grounding Elias's subterranean existence. The sapphire light motif recurs at key beats, and the dusty insulation, compass needle quiver, and blue chalk trail create tactile specificity. The cache nook's moisture-warped metal directly enables the tape discovery, charging the closure when dawn's sapphire strengthens as he emerges—environment constrains and illuminates the final turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias's drive to become visible—is signaled early and tightens when the woman's sob pulls him from hiding. His decision to include the tape fragment (a personal relic) raises emotional cost, and stepping into her flashlight beam forecloses his years of anonymity with visible price. The woman's acceptance lacks a counter-beat or complication, softening escalation slightly, but the turn is protagonist-driven and meaningful under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of chosen visibility versus protective isolation emerges organically through Elias's cache-building ritual and the tape fragment's double function as memoir and invitation. "Become visible to those who need you" avoids moralizing by grounding in his wife's dying voice and his years-long enactment. The final image—silhouette resolving in her beam, weaving him into her story—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the cost of connection without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias's perceptual signature is consistent—"kindly methodical," ferric tang, phantom spins—and the limited third holds steady. The woman's single line of dialogue ("You") and Elias's rumble ("For those who need") carry subtext and goal pursuit. However, "Become visible..." as both the wife's whisper and the tape's warble risks thematic echo, and some diction ("reverent silence," "sapphire-deep") elevates slightly past a crawl-space dweller's interior lexicon under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates well between methodical cache-building and the compressed emotional turn. "Kindly methodical" recurs three times, bordering on template cadence, and "sapphire hush" appears in the opening and twice more without evolving function. The phrase "sense memory crashed over him then, unbidden and sapphire-deep" stacks modifiers and leans purple at a pivotal beat. Phrasing like "grief entombed him" and "eternal hush" add minor register drift, collectively applying −0.6 to −0.8 in this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of crawl-space caretaker, ferromagnetic reel as memoir token, and hidden-helper mythos offers a specific synthesis that avoids stock mysticism. The tape's magnetic pull on the compass needle is a fresh inflection. However, the "helper who emerges for the broken" premise echoes widespread angel-adjacent tropes, and the woman's instant acceptance at closure smooths conflict into predictable uplift, reducing boldness and complexity at the final beat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias decides to gather the cache (beat 1), chooses to include the tape fragment after uncovering it (beat 2), and steps forward to reveal himself (beat 3/closure). Each choice narrows options and the final one forecloses years of hiding with visible cost. Early signal, three beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tape fragment is uncovered mid-story, triggers sense memory (beat 1), is polished and placed in the cache with a note (beat 2), and played by the woman to reveal Elias's wife's voice, enabling the final recognition (closure beat). Specific properties (ferromagnetic oxide, gritty texture, voice warble) matter; the element drives two beats and charges the ending. Slightly lower than top band because its discovery is coincidental rather than causally seeded earlier.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sense memory shapes Elias's resolve when "the ferric tang invaded his nostrils" and "fingers tingled with phantom spins," driving his decision to include the tape and step forward. It appears in one sustained middle beat and implicitly underwrites the closure, reweighting his isolation. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability; one beat short of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" is applied as a label three times and shapes his cache-building actions, but no visible trade-off or cost is dramatized on the page. The attribute colors his approach without constraining a high-stakes choice or producing friction. Functional but not essential; swappable with "patient" or "careful" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The act of caching drives the plot: preparation (beat 1), inclusion of the tape (beat 2), and the woman's discovery enabling the final turn (closure). Removing the cache collapses the causal spine. Early signal, three beats, closure linkage, and high irreplaceability present. Just shy of indispensable because the cache itself could theoretically be another form of contact with minor rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Uncovering in pipe chases is signaled early ("labyrinth of hidden veins," "narrow warrens where heating ducts snaked") and the mechanics matter: peeling insulation reveals the tape fragment, which transforms the cache and enables closure. The method appears in two beats (preparation, discovery) and its specificity (rusted flanges, moisture-warped metal) is irreplaceable. Strong integration, though not quite indispensable since the tape could be found elsewhere with rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The shadowed library supplies the hidden infrastructure (pipe chases, carrels) that enables Elias's life and the cache nook; dawn's sapphire light through arched windows charges the opening and closure beats. The setting pressures the woman's nightly refuge and Elias's choice to emerge. Micro-setting (the nook, the beam) alters tactics. Early signal, two beats, closure linkage, and specificity all strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The outage amplifies the woman's sob and motivates the flickering beam at closure, but the timeframe itself does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Dawn arrives as scheduled without urgency. The flicker is more atmospheric than causal; easily swappable with any night setting. Present in setup and closure but does not constrain middle choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation is dramatized early ("a vow etched in his heart"), tested when the sob pulls him from hiding, and friction arises when including the tape risks exposing his own grief. The final step into her beam forecloses years of safety with visible cost. Early signal, two choice beats, closure linkage, and irreplaceability all present; strong causal pressure and felt price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Sapphire hush" appears in the opening, recurs twice during the cache sequence, and strengthens at closure ("Dawn's sapphire light strengthened"). Tone is coherent and modulates subtly with pressure, shifting from suspended breath to crackling tension to dawn warmth. The phrase itself borders on ornamental repetition without evolving function; closure participation is present but the charge is atmospheric rather than causally essential.</comment>
