<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elarion's motivation to reawaken beauty is declared but remains abstract; his assembly sequence shows actions without internal contradiction or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final moment—holding the flawed bird while vowing to nurture it—lands as acceptance, but the prince's emotional arc reads as linear devotion rather than contradictory drives under pressure. Interiority relies on repeated label-only constructions ("hypothesizing," "quaking") without embodied particulars that reveal character-specific perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Elarion is, where the palace floats, and when this occurs emerge slowly across the first third, triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The closure unit—bird emerges flawed, palace quakes, Elarion vows to nurture—reads as Charged Poise (options crystallized, cost felt in the palace's violent shudder and the creature's imperfection), but the cost remains atmospheric rather than a visible forfeiture that alters Elarion's next move. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (density of imagery, cadence of "hypothesizing" and "quaking"), yet the ending does not decisively reweight the stake; it restates the premise in image form.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The suspended palace and bioluminescent fungi anchor space vividly, and the mechanical world below supplies consistent sensory texture. The egg's opalescent shell and the chick's patchy feathers are specific, but neither the palace nor the cradle constrains Elarion's assembly choice; the setting frames rather than pressures the action. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the stalactites' groan at closure charges the final image, lifting the score within the mid-band despite the orientation delay cap at 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reawaken beauty—is signaled early and sustained, but pressure remains flat: Elarion assembles components without opposition, and the chick's emergence introduces no new dilemma that narrows his options. The palace's violent shudder and mechanical fury below suggest external threat, yet Elarion's final vow feels like restatement rather than a choice that forecloses a path. One meaningful tightening (the chick's flaw and the world's jealous response) is present, but the cost is implied rather than dramatized in a tactical shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of flawed genesis emerges organically through the egg's cracked crown, the chick's stunted wing, and Elarion's repeated hypothesis that beauty was "botched from the first spark." The final image—beauty "achingly alive" yet imperfect—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the word "hypothesis" and its variants recur as explicit thematic markers rather than allowing the particulars to carry meaning, and the phrase "bittersweet" appears nine times, turning motif into label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, but diction fluctuates between archaic register ("bedraggled tatters," "colossal stalactites") and modern abstraction ("hypothesis," "nexus"), undercutting voice consistency. Key words—"quaking," "hypothesized," "reverie," "bittersweet"—recur in template patterns (e.g., "The air quaked," "Elarion's heart quaked," "palace quaked on") across a dozen lines, creating mechanical cadence. Filter verbs ("sensed," "felt," "whispered") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice motivation, reducing immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "What if birds were the flawed genesis" / "such origins explained the world's mechanical pall" / "the flawed genesis made flesh" restate the same concept without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate ("He hypothesized… He whispered… He nestled… He activated…"), and the word "quaking" appears in fourteen lines, often as synonym churn for "trembling" or "shuddering." Stock metaphors ("beauty's return," "genesis forever flawed") and the repeated stem "What if…?" flatten propulsion. If closure-beat artifacts were present, the penalty would escalate; here they pervade supporting beats, triggering −1.4 and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of steampunk palace, extinct-bird resurrection, and flawed-creation myth is purposeful, and the chick's physical imperfection (stunted wing, milky eye) particularizes the premise. Yet the emotional arc—lonely prince seeks beauty, finds it marred—follows a familiar template without transformation through unexpected moral calculus or lived detail. The "flawed genesis" frame is announced rather than discovered, and Elarion's final vow restates his opening goal without a fresh inflection earned in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elarion's choice to assemble the cradle and activate the device drives two beats (assembly, activation), and his final vow to nurture the chick closes the arc. However, these are linear executions of a stated plan rather than reversals; removing "prince" and substituting "inventor" would leave the logic intact, signaling replaceable specificity. Present across all three gates (setup, middle assembly, closure vow) but without contradiction or tactical shift under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The egg is introduced early ("cycles ago"), handled in assembly, activated with steam pistons, and hatches at closure; its cracked crown and opalescent surface recur with reweighted meaning (promise → flaw). Three distinct beats (retrieval/description, nesting in cradle, hatching) and closure linkage lift the score. However, the egg itself does not constrain Elarion's choice—he never considers abandoning it or using it differently—so causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Flawed genesis" is named early, repeated in hypotheses throughout, and literalized in the chick's stunted wing and milky eye at closure. It reweights the ending image (beauty marred from inception) and shapes Elarion's acceptance. Yet it functions more as thematic claim than on-page constraint: Elarion's tactics do not shift when he confronts the flaw, and the concept is told ("the world's genesis was flawed") rather than discovered through dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Bitterly sweet" appears nine times, describing the chick's chirp, Elarion's tears, and the final epiphany. It charges the ending's emotional register and anchors the tone, but it remains a label for affect rather than a constraint that forces a choice. The trait is asserted rather than enacted: we are told the sound is "bitterly sweet" without on-page demonstration of simultaneous pleasure and pain that alters Elarion's action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Assembly is the spine: Elarion gathers fragments, weaves wires, clicks pistons, nests the egg, and activates the cradle. Four distinct beats, and the action enables the hatching that produces the closure. Swapping "assemble" for "repair" or "awaken" would require only minor edits, so irreplaceability is moderate, but the action is causally indispensable to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Hypothesizing" is named early and recurs across a dozen lines ("hypothesized each piece's genesis," "hypothesizing wildly," "hypothesizing endless futures"). It signals Elarion's method and supports tone, but the mechanics never matter: no hypothesis is tested, revised, or proven wrong on the page. The method is descriptive label rather than process that shapes attempts or narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The suspended palace and stalactites anchor setting early, supply bioluminescent light for the assembly chamber, and groan/crack at closure when the chick emerges, adding atmospheric charge. However, the palace does not constrain Elarion's choices—he could perform the same assembly in any workshop—and the stalactites' threat is implied rather than forcing a tactical shift. Present in setup, ambient in middle, and charged at closure, earning three-gate credit and mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Tonight" and "through the discovery" frame the timeframe, and "cycles ago" locates the egg's prior finding. The assembly unfolds in a single session, but no clock pressure tightens Elarion's moves; he proceeds methodically without interruption or deadline. The element is present but ornamental, shaping narrative boundary rather than altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elarion's desire "to reawaken beauty" is declared early, visualized in the assembly sequence, and tested at closure when beauty returns flawed. The motivation drives his actions across all beats and the ending confronts the cost (imperfect bird, jealous mechanical world). However, the want is never complicated by fear or competing need; Elarion pursues a single goal without internal friction, so the motivation shapes structure but not contradictory choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Quaking" appears fourteen times, "reverie" six times, establishing tone early and sustaining it through to the final image ("quaking wonder," "suspended in reverie"). The tone modulates slightly—trembling anticipation becomes trembling awe—and charges the palace's shudder at closure. Yet the repetition becomes mechanical template rather than purposeful cadence shift, and the tone remains a static wash rather than a pressure that transforms under escalation.</comment>
