<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The line walker's motivation ("preserve the echo of wisdom") is declared but never tested by competing impulses or visible cost. Interiority relies on label-only phrases ("strangely honest heart," "peripheral mastery") rather than embodied contradiction. The prophet and seekers remain functionally inert, offering atmospheric approval but no pressure. No on-page choice forecloses a path or reveals hierarchy of values under duress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: who, where, and when remain vague past ~120 words; "whisperfield calm," "murmuring pavilion," and the prophet's prior arrival are atmospheric labels without spatial or temporal anchors (−0.4 in Q2; Q3 capped at 7.0). The consecration unfolds as a sequence of decorative gestures—three clearings conjured, chanted over, dissolved—with no reversal, complication, or cost that narrows options. The parapet "shudders once, then steadies"; success arrives without friction. No legible Drive Lens emerges: beats do not link causally, accumulate pressure via pattern break, or crystallize a situational stance. Closure reads as completion of a to-do list, not a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Capped at 7.0 per Orientation Test. "Whisperfield calm," "murmuring pavilion," and "kinetic parapet" are evocative labels but remain abstract; no concrete sensory anchors (temperature, scale, light source, proximity) ground the reader. The parapet's "golden veins and tremors" appear late and are observed, not used. Dunes and drapes recur as mood markers without constraining movement or choice. Micro-setting allowance not met: no tool, body constraint, or object alters a tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>One stated stake ("preserve the echo") faces no opposition, resource limit, or competing desire. The rite proceeds in three identical gestures (clearing, whisper, dissolve) without escalation or complication. The parapet "resists all but sidelong truth," yet this constraint never creates friction—the line walker performs the method without error or trade-off. No tightening narrows options; no deepening changes knowledge. No cost is legible: the task succeeds exactly as planned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("preservation through edges, not centers") is stated three times without earned discovery. "Peripheral awareness," "sidelong gazes," and "strangely honest" recur as labels rather than emerging from concrete struggle. The final image ("wisdom endured, no longer fleeting") arrives as declaration, not resonant reconfiguration. No competing interpretation; no conceptual cost or ambiguity charges the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elevated diction ("auras through the clearing," "consecration flowed," "existence's frayed thread") clashes with the absence of a grounded POV lexicon or perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal and formulaic ("You have bound it," "through edges, not centers"). The prophet and seekers speak identically. No psychic distance control or interior rhythm under pressure. Register drift is pervasive but does not obscure clause-level clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "echoes of wisdom" appears six times with near-synonyms ("echo of wisdom," "wisdom's echo," "echoes preserved"); "murmuring" and "whisper" recur decoratively across adjacent lines. Template cadence: "He [verb], [noun] [verb]" structures dominate mid-passage ("He chanted low, words…"; "He turned, conjured clearings…"). Stock metaphors ("threads of ancient truths," "fragile lines tighter") and filter-verb stacks ("he sensed," "he saw," "he knew") dull immediacy in the consecration beat. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("wisdom endured," "echoes preserved"), triggering −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally. Spatial choreography remains vague (distance from pavilion to parapet, position of seekers).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise (ritualized preservation via indirect perception) reads as a template mystical-rite plot without lived specificity. "Peripheral awareness" and "conjured clearings" function as interchangeable magic-system labels. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: the structure (lone mystic performs ceremony to bind artifact with onlookers) closely matches workshop templates and offers no transformation through detail, moral calculus, or risk (−1.0 in Q8). No fresh synthesis or bold structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Present throughout; the line walker executes the rite. Missing middle development gate: no choice in the middle that tests commitment or alters tactics (cap 3.4). However, the character's declared motive frames the opening and he performs the final act, satisfying setup and payoff gates—raise to low-functional band. Swappability high: any ritualist archetype could perform identical moves. Late penalty avoided (present early). Ornamental friction −0.6; swappability −0.5; summary-only use (told intent, shown gestures) −0.4. Band guidance suggests ~4.0; round down to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup gate met (introduced early via "beneath them lay the kinetic parapet"). Development gate met: the parapet's resistance ("all but sidelong truth") is stated and observed peripherally in the middle. Payoff gate met: consecration anchors wisdom to the parapet; it "shuddered once, then steadied." Early signal +0.5; two beats (resistance observed, then consecration) +0.9; closure linkage (final state noted: "kinetic parapet humming beneath") +0.7. Frictions: swappability moderate (any magical container could replace it with minor edits) −0.6; ornamental in closure paragraph (mentioned but not causally active) −0.3. Net ~6.0; specific mechanics vague; round to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Setup gate met ("conjured clearings" introduced early). Development gate weak: three clearings appear but do not constrain or enable differentiated tactics; each functions identically. Payoff gate met: clearings dissolve at the end, framing the rite's completion. Early signal +0.5; three beats (first, second, third clearing) +1.4; swappability high (any "zone" or "circle" could replace) −0.7; ornamental use (description without choice pressure) −0.8; summary-only (creation recounted, not dramatized with cost) −0.5. Net ~4.2; round to 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Setup gate met: "strangely honest" introduced early and repeated. Development gate missing: the trait does not constrain or enable a middle choice (cap 3.4). Payoff gate weak: trait mentioned in final third but does not shape the ending image. Label-only mentions (no visible trade-off or cost tied to honesty) −0.8; ornamental −0.6; late closure cameo without causal work −0.3. Net ~2.5; round to 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup gate met: "consecrate" signaled early as the motive. Development gate met: the parapet consecration occupies the middle beats. Payoff gate met: "Consecration complete" and "consecrated bond" anchor the ending. Early signal +0.6; three beats (preparation, execution, completion) +1.4; closure linkage (named in final third) +0.9; causal pressure weak (no narrowing of options or visible cost) +0.2; swappability moderate (any binding ritual could replace) −0.6; specificity low (mechanics generic) −0.4. Net ~6.5; cost connection absent −0.3; round to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setup gate met: "peripheral awareness" and "sidelong" introduced early. Development gate met: the method is applied to observe the parapet without "alarming it." Payoff gate met: "peripheral awareness catching the pavilion's pulse" in the final beats. Early signal +0.6; two beats (mid-rite use, closure mention) +0.9; causal pressure weak (stated constraint never creates friction or failure) +0.3; specificity moderate (distinct from direct sight) +0.4; swappability moderate −0.5; no visible cost tied to the method −0.4. Net ~5.3; round to 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Setup gate met: "murmuring pavilion" introduced in opening line. Development gate weak: the pavilion hosts the rite but does not constrain movement or tactics. Payoff gate met: "murmuring pavilion stood sentinel" in closing. Early signal +0.7; two beats (opening frame, closing frame) +0.9; causal pressure absent (postcard description) +0.1; closure linkage (mentioned in final frame) +0.5; ornamental −0.7; swappability high −0.6. Net ~5.0; round to 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Setup gate met: "after the prophet arrives" in opening paragraph. Development gate missing: no middle tightening or clock pressure tied to the timeframe (cap 3.4). Payoff gate met: "after the prophet's arrival, forever changed" in closing. Early signal +0.5; two beats (opening, closing) +0.9; causal pressure absent (no urgency or deadline) +0.1; closure linkage weak (thematic reprise, not causal) +0.3; ornamental −0.7; swappability high (any "after event X" could replace) −0.6. Net ~3.9; round to 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Setup gate met: motive declared early ("preserve the echo of wisdom"). Development gate met: motive drives the consecration sequence. Payoff gate met: "preservation above all" and "wisdom endured" close the piece. Early signal +0.7; three beats (declaration, execution, confirmation) +1.4; causal pressure weak (told motivation, no competing desire or friction) +0.3; closure linkage +0.8; told-only friction (no dramatized internal conflict between wants and costs) −0.9; swappability moderate −0.5. Net ~5.8; round to 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setup gate met: "whisperfield calm" in opening line. Development gate weak: tone remains static ("murmurs," "whispers," "calm") without modulation under pressure. Payoff gate met: "whisperfield calm enveloped all" in closing. Early signal +0.7; three beats (opening, mid-rite, closing) +1.4; coherence through turns weak (single static mood) +0.3; closure charge moderate (final image reprises tone) +0.6; static mood friction −0.9; swappability moderate (any serene-setting adjective) −0.5. Net ~5.6; round to 5.4.</comment>
