<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to discover purpose in the pauses") is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "steadily adaptive" trait functions as a label applied repeatedly without visible trade-offs or genuine struggle; she succeeds at every turn without foreclosing options or paying embodied costs. Internal experience remains abstract—"her will reshaping like cooling glass"—and emotional states are summarized rather than shown through contradictory action. The survival choice at the end feels inevitable rather than earned by prior vulnerability or error.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story signals who/where/when by the opening lines. A Decisive Change occurs (Elara transforms the ledger into art and becomes "canyon's guardian"), but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page; no prior path is visibly foreclosed. The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pauses, frost patterns, luminous motifs recur), yet the closure lacks a cadence shift or density break that reweights the dominant stake with undeniable pressure. The ledger's secondary discovery and the confrontation occur off-stage or in summary, weakening causal linkage at the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The canyon setting and frost mechanics are vividly rendered and integrated into Elara's investigation. The luminous glass shards function as a micro-setting element that constrains tactics (blinding the smugglers). However, spatial choreography during the final confrontation is vague—"they fled or fell"—and the kiln's transformation into an "installation" lacks concrete detail that would charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is present but the canyon itself does not evolve causally with prior events.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (exposing the smuggler network / finding purpose) is signaled early but never tightens into a forced trade-off. Elara encounters no live obstacles after the opening attack; the ledger's secrets unfold without resistance, and the final confrontation is resolved in a single summary sentence with no visible cost or tactical adaptation. Coincidence (frost patterns align "eerily" with ledger gaps) enables discovery rather than protagonist agency under pressure. No persistent constraint shapes her choices or the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme of "purpose in pauses" is stated explicitly multiple times rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes: "Purpose in pauses: not emptiness, but the space where light adapts and endures." The ledger-into-glass transformation is visually apt but the conceptual link to the canyon's "fragile equilibrium" and Elara's art remains abstract. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into a tidy arc where all elements harmonize without friction or genuine ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited. Voice carries a lyric register ("drifting resonance," "frosting the canyon floor with delicate veils") that is consistent but edges into elevated diction not always grounded in Elara's embodied urgency. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present but generic—filtered through her glass-artist lens without idiosyncratic biases. Psychic distance is controlled, yet the prose occasionally slips into expository summary ("she saw her own life reflected") that tells rather than dramatizes insight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The prose suffers from pervasive template cadence and phrase recycling: "steadily adaptive" (3×), "drifting resonance" (4×), "scorched testament" (3×), and synonym loops around "pauses" and "luminous." Stock metaphors recur without reweighting ("cooling glass," "frosting... with delicate veils"). Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff, and several beats paraphrase adjacent content (e.g., paragraphs on frost patterns repeat the alignment mechanic). Filter-verb stacks ("she would retrace," "she saw," "she traced") dull immediacy in key discovery beats. These artifacts touch the closure sequence, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The core premise—glass artist uses ledger and frost to track smugglers—offers a fresh synthesis of elements, but execution leans on familiar beats: lone artist survives attack, discovers hidden network, becomes guardian. The "pauses in the ledger" conceit is conceptually interesting yet remains abstractly stated rather than transformed through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The transformation of peril into art at the end is symbolically tidy without a risky or unexpected inflection. Specificity in frost mechanics elevates slightly, but the arc follows a median template without bold structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her decisions (shatter orb, trace frost, melt ledger) create narrative turns. However, many key beats are summarized rather than shown on the page, and her "steadily adaptive" trait functions as a label rather than a constraining force with visible trade-offs. She drives the arc but without the friction or cost that would make her choices indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ledger strip appears in the opening third (salvaged "weeks ago"), drives the middle investigation (alignment with frost gaps), and returns at closure (melted into glass). It is handled across three distinct beats and its evolving use—from fire kindling to evidentiary map to art material—reweights meaning. However, its role in the climax is passive (Elara already knows the network details), capping impact.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Scorched testament" is used as a recurring label for the ledger strip but does not shape stakes or tactics in a way distinct from "ledger" alone. The concept echoes thematically (survival, transformation) without creating unique constraints or enabling moves that wouldn't exist with a generic "evidence." Present and consistent but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Steadily adaptive" is mentioned four times as a trait descriptor but never constrains a choice or incurs visible cost. Elara's adaptations (evading a blade, retracing paths, weaponizing light) succeed without friction, and the trait could be replaced with "resourceful" or "resilient" with no structural change. Label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Retrace" is signaled early, drives the middle investigation (following frost-whorled lines matching ledger entries), and frames the closure pivot ("She retraced no more paths that day"). The action shapes at least two beats and participates in the ending. However, the mechanical retracing itself is summarized rather than dramatized in tactile detail, and the shift from physical retracing to metaphorical cessation is asserted rather than earned through specific cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Patterns in morning frost" are introduced in the first third ("method that had first revealed their camp"), drive the middle discovery (alignment with ledger gaps), and are present at closure (frost melts but "memory held their resonance"). The method enables key tactics and is signaled early. However, its mechanics remain abstractly described—how gaps in frost reveal bootprints or hidden divergences is told rather than shown—and the climactic use is passive observation rather than active problem-solving under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "quiet canyon under stars" is established immediately and recurs throughout. It supplies the frost resource, amplifies sound ("drifting resonance of stone and starlight"), and the stars "nod approval" at closure. However, the canyon functions more as atmospheric backdrop than as a dynamic constraint that alters tactics. The final installation "canyon-spanning" is stated without concrete detail that would charge the image. Lyric resonance is present but the setting does not pressure a key choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"After surviving the attempt" anchors the opening and creates a recovery premise. However, elapsed time is vague ("hours before," "dawn crept in," "that day") and no ticking clock tightens decisions. The timeframe marks a before/after but does not impose tactical urgency or shape the pacing of investigation and confrontation. Functional framing but replaceable with "after the attack" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To discover purpose in the pauses" is stated explicitly in the first third and recurs at closure ("Purpose in pauses"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between wants and costs. Elara's actions (investigate, confront, create art) align seamlessly with this goal without visible struggle or trade-off. The "pauses" themselves are abstract and do not force a tactical dilemma on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Drifting resonance" recurs as a phrase (four times) and the tone maintains a lyric, meditative register throughout. However, the tone does not modulate meaningfully with pressure—the confrontation beat carries the same elevated diction as the opening reflection—and the phrase itself becomes ornamental rather than charging the final image with reweighted meaning. Coherent but static.</comment>
