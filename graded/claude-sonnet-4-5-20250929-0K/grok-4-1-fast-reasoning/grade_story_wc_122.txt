<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "pierce her numbness" is established, but the interiority remains abstract—"emotional numbness" and "hollow repetition" are label-only rather than embodied contradiction. The mending of the needle and orchestration of the rite show goal-driven action, yet the final shift ("numbness fled, defeated") asserts change without dramatizing the micro-choice or internal friction that earns it. Thorne and the students function as recipients rather than sources of sustained pressure on Elara's core conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece signals a dominant stake (defeating numbness) and reaches a closure moment (Elara's numbness flees through the act of enthralling others), but the cost is implied rather than visible on the page—no line shows what Elara forfeits or what path is now foreclosed. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (filament of hush, backward songs, mirrored silence), yet the final paragraph summarizes the outcome ("numbness fled, defeated") instead of charging the closure image with a felt price. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph (cavern, Elara, present tense of teaching).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cavern is anchored early with sensory specificity ("shadows pooled," "vibrations humming through stone," "autumn-kissed hills") and recurs across beats (floor quivers, phonograph in a niche, resonant halls). The phonograph base and drum skins provide tactile, constraint-relevant detail that Elara uses to transmit vibration. The setting does not constrain a pivotal choice or visibly alter the outcome, holding it below the 9-band gate, but it charges atmosphere and grounds the action throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (defeat numbness) is signaled early, and pressure accumulates through the discovery, mending, and ritual orchestration. However, the escalation remains additive rather than narrowing options—each step succeeds without complication or trade-off visible on the page. The climax ("numbness fled, defeated by the power she'd unleashed") tells the resolution instead of dramatizing a choice or visible price, and the phrase "the act of enthralling others reigniting her core" offers psychological explanation rather than scene pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme (silence as conduit to feeling, music's truest note as hush) emerges from the backward-songs mechanic and the "filament of hush" concept. The final line ("music's truest note proved a filament of hush, mirrored and eternal") states the thesis rather than letting the image resonate without a moral. Earlier beats earn emotional texture—Thorne's tears, the youth's trembling, the elder's ancestral whispers—but the close shifts into summary and abstraction ("mirrored and eternal") instead of anchoring in a concrete final action or perception.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; perceptual signature is present in the vibration-focused filtering ("vibrations humming," "palms pressed to the base"). Diction drifts into elevated literary register ("enthralling," "filament of hush," "mirrored hush," "petrified shout") that sits at the edge of the focalizer's plausible idiom but remains legible. The phrase "motivation burned quietly" and the summary mode in the final third loosen immediacy. Dialogue (signing) is minimal and functional; no voice convergence issues arise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose carries figurative density ("shadows pooled like forgotten echoes," "horn flared like a petrified shout," "slender thread of perfect silence") that accumulates without always advancing pressure; several images feel ornamental. Paraphrase loops appear: "audibly muted" recurs three times in similar constructions, and "filament of hush" is repeated with synonym variants ("mirrored hush," "living hush") across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence is visible in sentence openings ("Elara's students," "Elara's motivation," "Elara froze"). The final paragraph summarizes rather than showing the decisive moment, flattening momentum at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The backward-recorded songs and filament-of-hush concept offer a fresh angle on music-as-healing, and the deaf teacher as protagonist inverts expectation. However, the emotional arc (numb → discovers artifact → feels again) follows a familiar redemption template, and the resolution—Elara's numbness "defeated by the power she'd unleashed"—arrives through assertion rather than an earned, non-obvious turn. The combination of elements (phonograph, cavern, vibration-teaching) is specific, yet the closure does not transform the premise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout and makes key decisions (mending the needle, selecting the record, orchestrating the rite), shaping two beats. Her deafness filters perception and grounds the vibration mechanic. However, the final turn ("numbness fled") is told rather than dramatized as a choice, and her agency in the closure moment is passive—reflection rather than action. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is weak (summary). Two beats + causal enablement + early signal = base ~5.8; closure summary and lack of visible cost in final choice = −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken needle is discovered mid-story (~40% mark), mended crudely, and used twice (first play, repeat for Thorne). Its "shattered yet glinting" state and makeshift repair with cavern wire provide specificity. The needle enables the backward-song revelation and charges the ritual beats. Setup is late (−0.3); development and closure participation are clear. Two distinct beats + causal pressure + closure linkage + specificity = base ~7.4; late first mention = −0.3; swappability (any stylus could work) = −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "filament of hush" is named at the discovery beat and recurs in description ("mirrored hush," "living hush," "filament thrummed in her bones," final line). It frames the mechanic but does not constrain a choice—Elara plays the record without friction, and the filament's properties are asserted rather than tested. Setup ~33%, development ornamental, closure present but as theme claim. One beat involvement + closure mention without causal pressure + moderate specificity = base ~4.2; lyric reprise in final line with thematic reweighting = +0.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Audibly muted" appears three times as descriptor ("audibly muted pulse," "sounds—audibly muted scratches," "audibly muted warps") but does not constrain action or create visible cost. It colors atmosphere without altering tactics. Setup early, development label-only, closure absent. One-beat ornamental presence = base ~2.8; decorative repetition = −0.3; label-only trait = −0.3; thematic echo without pressure cost rounds to floor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Enthrall" is Elara's stated goal ("to enthrall herself first"), enacted when she plays the phonograph and later when she orchestrates the group rite. The action shapes two beats and drives the resolution ("the act of enthralling others reigniting her core"). Setup early, development present, closure active. Two beats + causal role + closure = base ~6.4; the resolution is summarized rather than shown, and "enthrall" could swap for "move" or "captivate" with minor edits = −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Backward recorded songs are introduced at the discovery beat (~50%), their mechanic explained (etched in reverse, spun against the grain), and used twice (Elara's play, repeat for Thorne). The method enables the filament revelation and charges the ritual. Setup mid-story (−0.2), development clear, closure present. Two beats + causal enablement + closure = base ~6.8; late first mention = −0.2; the mechanic is explained rather than discovered through trial = −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The cavern is anchored early, provides tactile resources (stone for vibration transmission, phonograph in a niche, drum skins), and recurs across beats. It grounds atmosphere and enables the vibration teaching. Setup early, development functional (floor quivers used for instruction), closure present (resonant halls, night's hush). Two beats + causal enablement + setup = base ~6.2; the cavern does not constrain a key choice or alter outcome—action could relocate with minor edits = −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Faint rustle of turning seasons" appears in the opening, midpoint ("filtered through cracks"), and final line as atmospheric frame. It does not tighten decisions or create time pressure; the narrative clock is loose (lessons blur, "one crisp afternoon," "that evening," "by night's hush"). Setup poetic, development absent, closure as bookend. Lyric reprise without causal pressure = base ~2.7; no middle involvement = −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara's desire to defeat numbness is stated early, shapes her goal-directed actions (mending, playing, orchestrating), and resolves in the final paragraph. The motivation is told ("emotional numbness had settled," "yearned to defeat") rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. Setup early, development present across beats, closure active. Two beats + causal role + closure = base ~6.7; label-only interiority without friction = −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" is named at the revelation beat, recurs in the ritual section, and closes the story ("filament of hush, mirrored and eternal"). The tone is lyric-meditative throughout, modulating slightly when Thorne weeps and students gather. Setup mid-story, development present, closure charged. Pattern coherence + closure reprise = base ~5.8; tone is asserted in summary ("mirrored hush") rather than built through sentence rhythm and image pressure = −0.5.</comment>
