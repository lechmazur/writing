<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to "learn the sound of approaching endings" is established early but remains abstract; her choices—joining the trawl, leaning in to listen—feel observational rather than pressure-driven. The "loose grip on reality" attribute is repeatedly labeled ("She gripped reality loosely now," "her loose grip on reality making her fearless") but never dramatizes a concrete trade-off or mistake that alters her tactics. The parasol tip functions as a talisman but its loss at the breaking point lacks earned causality tied to a prior choice under pressure. Tomas is sketched with black lung and years of waiting, but his presence supplies atmosphere more than immediate relational friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece signals accumulative/textural design with repeated motifs (windborne solace, trawl, the sound) and moves toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Liora shifts from tourist to witness, anchored by Tomas's crumple-sigh. Orientation is provided by ~line 10 (drift-ice marina, emergency tent, post-fall). However, the closure moment ("No more trawling needed; the endings sang clear now") arrives via summary declaration rather than an on-page image that makes the cost undeniable; the parasol tip's loss is stated to "mark her transformation" but the mechanism remains told. The escalation—listening at bedsides, then at the trawl, then beside Tomas—accumulates density, but the final turn lacks a decisive on-page moment where the cost is felt rather than explained.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail: "ships locked in floes that clinked like fragile chimes," "ice-rimed docks," "pressure ridges," "aurora veils." The parasol tip appears in multiple beats (grounding her, then snapping free), and its brass finial and frayed lace threads concretely anchor her internal state. The setting pressures choices—thin ice, treacherous bays, the trawl net—and the final image places her at the dock's end with the "ice symphony" as lullaby, charging the closure with environmental texture. Spatial choreography is clear throughout: tent → marina → skiff → dock's end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning "the sound of approaching endings"—is signaled early and pursued across three escalating attempts: Swiss/Oregon clinics, the trawl woman's near-death, and Tomas's stories. The woman's breath produces "a fold in patience, a soft crumpling sigh," a concrete intensification, but she stabilizes before Liora can fully capture it; the subsequent frustration is noted but does not narrow her options on the page. Tomas's final crumple-sigh delivers the sound, yet Liora's shift from tourist to witness is recounted ("she'd learned it all") rather than dramatized as a choice that forecloses a prior path. The escalation is legible under an accumulative lens, but the cost at closure—what she gives up or loses to "find home"—remains implicit rather than visible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring images—windborne solace, the crumple-sigh, the parasol tip's loss—and the central question (what does an ending sound like?) is pursued in concrete beats rather than abstraction. The final image ("the endings sang clear now," "quiet cathedral") reweights Liora's journey from tourist to witness, and the "fold in patience" recurs with shifted meaning. However, the closing lines veer toward thematic summary: "No more trawling needed; the endings sang clear now. In that hush, she found home." This edges into explaining the resonance rather than letting the final image—Tomas leaning back, the marina's ice symphony—carry it. The piece resists a tidy moral but the last paragraph's declarations reduce the earned ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Liora; perceptual signature is present in her focus on sounds and the parasol tip as talisman. Diction is generally controlled, but certain passages edge into elevated register ("euthanasia tourist," "windborne solace," "fold in patience") that feels more thematic than character-rooted given her stated "loose grip on reality." Dialogue is minimal (Mira's line, Tomas's two utterances) but functional and distinct. Free indirect style is clean, though some interiority ("her motivation burned steady," "patience folded within Liora") abstracts rather than embodies. Rhythmic control is present, modulating from the opening's languid haze to the closing's meditative calm, but certain template stems ("She gripped," "She fingered," "She slipped") recur across beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("clinked like fragile chimes," "silk tearing slowly") is vivid when deployed. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "She gripped reality loosely now" in paragraph 3 and "her loose grip on reality" in paragraph 13; "windborne solace" recurs five times without evolving pressure; "the sound of approaching endings" is repeated across multiple paragraphs in near-identical phrasing. Template cadence is present in adjacent beats: "She fingered…She gripped…She slipped…She smiled." The final paragraph stacks summary declarations ("No more trawling needed; the endings sang clear now. In that hush, she found home") that dull the closure image's immediacy. These artifacts accumulate but do not obscure causality; routing penalty here per guidance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept of a "euthanasia tourist" seeking the sound of death in a disaster zone offers a fresh angle, and the drift-ice marina is a specific, non-generic setting. The parasol tip as heirloom talisman and the "fold in patience" phrasing show ingenuity. However, the arc—outsider observes death, experiences transformation, finds peace—follows a recognizable contemplative template, and the final image (witness at peace in "quiet cathedral") resolves into a familiar epiphany shape. The "loose grip on reality" and "waking changed" remain label-level without demonstrating the trait's unique cost or enabling a non-obvious choice. The synthesis is coherent but not inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout and her role as euthanasia tourist shapes the motivation and setting choice. She makes on-page decisions—joining the trawl, leaning in to the dying woman, staying beside Tomas—but these are observational moves rather than turns that alter her tactics or foreclose options under pressure. Her transformation from tourist to witness is declared at closure but not dramatized as a choice with visible cost. The character is functional and drives the accumulative structure, yet easily swappable with a grief counselor or hospice volunteer without major rewrites. Present in setup, middle, and ending; shapes one key beat (the trawl woman) but does not drive a second distinct turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The parasol tip appears in three beats: first as grounding talisman (paragraph 8), then fingered in the tent (paragraph 15), finally snapping free and drifting away (paragraph 26). Its brass finial and frayed lace threads are concrete, and the loss is explicitly tied to her breaking point and readiness to "chase the sound unmoored." The object constrains her grip on reality early and its absence charges the transformation. However, the parasol tip does not enable a tactical choice or narrow options; it marks the shift rather than causing it. The mechanics of the loss (she twists it until the lace snaps) feel slightly staged for symbolic convenience rather than arising from scene pressure. Setup, development, and closure participation are present; causal pressure is middling.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"A fold in patience" is introduced in paragraph 20 to describe the dying woman's sigh ("not a rattle, but a fold in patience") and recurs in paragraph 25 ("patience folded within Liora") and paragraph 31 ("a fold in patience yielding to peace"). The phrasing is memorable and concretely anchors the sound she seeks, reweighting the abstract "sound of approaching endings" with a tactile metaphor. However, the concept does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page; it remains a thematic descriptor rather than a stake-shaping force. The reprise at closure elevates its resonance, but the concept is swappable with "a moment of release" or similar without breaking the arc. Setup in the second half, lyric reprise at ending; no middle choice constrained by it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is labeled in paragraph 3 ("She gripped reality loosely now"), paragraph 13 ("her loose grip on reality making her fearless"), paragraph 25 ("Her loose grip on reality tightened briefly"), and paragraph 30 ("her reality loose yet anchored"). The attribute is invoked to explain her fearlessness when joining volunteers, but no on-page scene demonstrates a mistake, hallucination, or perceptual slip that alters her tactics or imposes a cost. The "tightened briefly" moment in paragraph 25 is immediately followed by the parasol tip snapping, but the causal link is asserted rather than shown. The trait is present in setup and mentioned at closure but remains ornamental—removing it would require only minor phrasing edits. No middle beat where the attribute constrains or enables a choice with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Trawl" is signaled early (paragraph 12: "Trawl nets: that's how they searched"), drives the middle beat where the dying woman surfaces (paragraph 19), and recurs at closure ("No more trawling needed"). The action is mechanically specific (long lines dragged across bays, hauling up debris and bodies) and provides the encounter that delivers the "fold in patience" sound. Liora's insistence on joining the trawl (paragraph 13) is motivated by her loose grip making her fearless, and the trawl's outcome—finding the woman—shapes her escalating frustration and final learning beside Tomas. The action is indispensable to the plot's middle turn and closure image. However, the final shift away from trawling is told rather than shown as a tactical choice under pressure. Setup, middle causal beat, closure reprise; the trawl is essential but the ending summarizes rather than dramatizes the turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is introduced in paragraph 4 ("she'd come here through disaster relief volunteering, trawling the frozen waters for survivors") and recurs in paragraphs 13 ("insisted on joining the volunteers"), 17 ("methodically volunteering to pay for her passage"), and 28 ("Volunteering had led her here"). The method explains her access to the trawl and the post-disaster setting, and it frames her presence as both altruistic and transactional. However, the mechanics of volunteering do not constrain a choice or impose a cost; she could have arrived as crew, researcher, or stowaway with minor edits. The method is functional setup and mentioned at closure but does not drive a turn or reweight the ending. Setup present, mentioned in middle and ending; causal role is thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is anchored in paragraph 2 and rendered across the piece with vivid, pressure-driven detail: thin ice that Liora fell through (paragraph 1), floes clinking like chimes (paragraph 2), treacherous bays (paragraph 12), ice-rimed docks and groaning hulls (paragraph 14), pressure ridges (paragraph 14), ice fields glowing under aurora (paragraph 27), and the dock's end where Tomas and Liora sit (paragraph 29). The setting supplies the trawl infrastructure, shapes the disaster-relief context, and provides the acoustic and visual texture ("ice symphony") that charges the closure. The marina's physical constraints—thin ice, cold, wind—affect tactics (joining the trawl, slipping out at night) and the final image is inseparable from the location. Setup, middle beats, and closure are all grounded in the setting; it is essential to tone and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After waking up changed" is invoked in paragraphs 1 ("Liora woke up changed") and 14 ("Today, after waking changed, she rose on unsteady legs"), and the parasol tip's loss is said to mark "after waking changed, she'd learned it all" (paragraph 32). The timeframe frames the story as post-transformation reflection, and the physical aftereffects (aching body, unsteady legs) are noted. However, the passage of time within the piece is vague—"hours blurred," "that night"—and no urgency or deadline tightens her choices. The "changed" state is declared but not dramatized; we do not see a before/after contrast in her actions or perception on the page. The timeframe is present in setup and invoked at closure but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure. Setup mention, weak middle development, summary closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's desire "to learn the sound of approaching endings" is signaled in paragraph 5, explained via her euthanasia-tourist backstory (paragraph 6), and pursued across three escalating attempts: Swiss/Oregon clinics (paragraph 6), the trawl woman's sigh (paragraph 20), and Tomas's stories (paragraph 30). The motivation is concrete and specific, driving her choice to join the trawl and lean in during the resuscitation. Frustration when the woman stabilizes (paragraph 21) adds friction, and the final fulfillment—hearing Tomas's crumple-sigh and becoming "witness" rather than "tourist"—reweights the stake. However, the motivation is pursued through observation rather than a choice that risks something; the cost (loss of detachment, the parasol tip) is tied to the arc but not dramatized as a trade-off she must decide. Setup, middle pursuit, closure satisfaction; the desire shapes beats but lacks on-page conflict between wanting and refusing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Windborne solace" recurs five times: paragraph 2 (the Arctic wind), paragraph 7 (hoped the wind would deliver it pure), paragraph 16 (wrapped her as she stepped out), paragraph 27 (she felt it deepen), and paragraph 33 (carrying her forward into whatever ending awaited). The tone—melancholy, meditative, wind-carried—is coherent throughout and modulates from hazy painkillers (paragraph 3) to frustration (paragraph 21) to final peace (paragraph 30). The wind as carrier of solace and sound is purposefully interwoven with the ice marina's acoustic texture and charges the closure image ("windborne solace, carrying her forward"). The repetition is pattern-taught rather than ornamental, and the tone supports the accumulative design. However, the exact phrase "windborne solace" becomes a refrain rather than evolving with pressure; slight over-reliance on the label. Setup, middle pressure, closure charge; tone is essential and coheres under the inferred lens.</comment>
