<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and sustained—photographing the last grain drives his summit climb and outlast strategy. His "purposefully curious" nature is shown through concrete actions (climbing beyond protocol, deploying timed signals). However, interiority leans heavily on label-based reflection ("dawnlit melancholy," "space age's twilight") rather than embodied contradictions acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to photograph the grain feels inevitable rather than earned through internal conflict with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening lines and maintains causal coherence: oxygen depletion → timed chemical signals → rescue arrival. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias outlasts and captures the image), but the cost is primarily circumstantial (low oxygen, waiting for rescue) rather than a decisive trade-off that forecloses a path. The discovered micro-etchings at base feel like an add-on rather than reweighting prior material. Drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture; it holds but doesn't deepen meaningfully at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The moonlit summit is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (regolith, shadows, thermal stress) that anchors the isolation. The camera rig, reaction chamber, and grain on black velvet pad are handled concretely and affect action. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting pressures Elias's choices (no rover access, no radio repeater, solar recharge dependency) and the grain's micro-setting on the velvet pad charges the photographic moment, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—photographing the relic before mining operations erase it—is signaled early and sustained. Oxygen depletion provides a tightening constraint that forces the timed-message strategy. However, the escalation is logistical rather than driven by protagonist agency: Elias waits for dawn and rescue rather than making a choice that narrows options with felt cost. The resolution (rescue arrives, photo succeeds) lacks a visible trade-off; no live option is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between preservation and progress, embodied in the grain's endurance versus corporate encroachment. The grain as "last untouched relic" and the nightwatch's "chemical-poetic farewell" avoid overt moralizing. However, phrases like "dawnlit melancholy," "space age's twilight," and "exploratory purity" veer toward abstract poeticism rather than resonant particulars. The ending's micro-etchings offer a thematic grace note but don't reweight the central question with undeniable pressure—it reads as ornamental rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present (technical focus on equipment, chemical reactions, photo angles). However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak beats ("temporal defiance," "contrails in vacuum," "cosmic pause") that feels authorial rather than character-specific for a 1972 crater inspector. The single line of recorded dialogue ("This grain...outlasting us all") reads naturalistic. Filter verbs and introspective summary dominate emotional beats, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied sentence structure and good information density in the chemical-reaction passages. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "outlasted missions, probes, and the relentless vacuum" echoes "outlast" three times in adjacent paragraphs; "dawnlit melancholy" and "dawning hush" recur as labels without evolution. Stock metaphors ("frozen tear," "shadows that clawed") and elevated diction in high-pressure beats ("temporal defiance," "fractured the night") reduce immediacy. Template cadence in the timed-message sequence (vial one, vial two, vial three) reads mechanical. Deduct −0.6 for loops and stock phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of 1970s space-age exploration with timed chemical signaling and the nightwatch hourglass grain offers a specific angle. The "last grain" concept and manual chemistry for SOS messages show research and particularity. However, the emotional arc—lone scientist risking all to preserve a relic—follows a familiar template without meaningful transformation. The melancholic tone and preservationist stakes echo well-worn territory. The micro-etchings revelation at the end adds a twist but doesn't fundamentally alter the logic established on the summit.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elias as crater inspector frames his expertise and motivates the climb beyond protocol. His decisions—ascending the peak, deploying chemical signals, positioning the grain for the photo—drive all major beats and the closure (capturing the image). He appears in setup, middle, and ending. However, the decisions are largely logistical (mix reagents, wait for rescue) rather than forcing a meaningful trade-off with visible cost. Functional and essential but lacks the causal pressure or irreplaceable specificity for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The grain is introduced early (end of first third), handled physically in two beats (discovery with sampler probe, positioning on velvet pad), and the final photograph centers on it. The grain's symbolic weight (last survivor of the nightwatch, outlasting humanity's gaze) reweights the closure image. The discovered micro-etchings add a final charge. The element is essential to the photo stake and the thematic resonance. It drives the summit climb and appears in the ending with added meaning, meeting all three gates and showing strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" as concept is mentioned in two passages as atmospheric label ("that profound lunar silence before sunrise," "Dawning hush deepened") but does not constrain Elias's choices or alter tactics. It functions as tonal texture rather than a pressure that changes options. Present by middle and at closure as mood but swappable with "lunar silence" or "pre-dawn stillness" without structural impact. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious" is labeled early ("his purposefully curious nature had driven him here beyond protocol") and shown through the summit climb and grain examination. It recurs late ("purposefully curious like him"). However, the attribute enables the plot rather than constraining it with visible cost—curiosity leads to discovery and success without a trade-off. Present in setup and closure but lacks the causal friction or forfeiture required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Outlast" is signaled early (oxygen gauge warning, "needed to outlast until dawn") and structures the middle action (deploying timed chemical signals to survive until solar recharge enables rescue). The verb recurs at closure ("he had outlasted"). It defines the central tactical problem and the resolution, appearing in at least three beats. Removing "outlast" would require rewriting the oxygen crisis and rescue structure. Essential across beats and ending, though the final success feels assured rather than costly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timed chemical messaging is introduced early ("timed messaging kit," exothermic reactions for Morse code) and used in three distinct beats (nitric acid/zinc flare, potassium permanganate/glycerol pulses, hydrogen peroxide/manganese dioxide confirmation). The method enables the rescue and demonstrates space-age ingenuity under the oxygen constraint. It is irreplaceable—no radio repeater reaches the summit—and the mechanics matter to the plot. Present in setup, middle, and ending with causal pressure. Strong integration but the resolution (rescue arrives) lacks felt cost beyond the wait.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The moonlit summit is present from the title and opening, pressures Elias's choices throughout (no rover access, no radio, oxygen depletion, thermal extremes), and supplies the stage for the closure photograph. The setting's remoteness creates the outlast problem and the need for chemical signals. Environmental details (regolith, crater rim, boulder for shelter) alter tactics. The summit's inaccessibility is irreplaceable to the plot. Present in setup, middle, and ending with strong causal linkage and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Space age in 1972" is anchored early (second sentence) and evoked through props (Hasselblad camera, unmanned probes, solar panels, corporate mining claims). The timeframe informs the thematic tension (exploratory purity fading) and the technology available. However, it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock beyond the oxygen gauge. Present in setup and thematically at closure but functions as context rather than constraint. Solid presence without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation to photograph "the last of something precious" is stated early and sustained across all beats (climbing beyond protocol, preparing the camera, positioning the grain, triggering the shutter). It drives the summit climb and the closure action. However, the desire is told more than dramatized—there is no on-page friction between wanting the photo and a competing cost or fear. The motivation shapes the plot but lacks the internal conflict or visible trade-off required for higher bands. Present in setup, middle, and ending with clear goal pursuit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Dawnlit melancholy" is labeled in two passages and reflected in Elias's reflections on the space age's fading triumphs. The tone coheres across the piece and charges the final image of the grain aglow in sunrise. However, the tone is static rather than modulating with pressure—melancholy persists from start to finish without deepening or breaking. It functions as atmosphere rather than a dynamic force that shapes the ending's emotional weight. Present and coherent but lacks the cadence shift required for high bands.</comment>
