<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Finn's motivation to reclaim visibility is declared but never tested through competing desires or internal contradiction. Elara remains a cipher—her "quietly charismatic" presence is asserted repeatedly without embodied action that reveals cost or conflict. The crowd's instant tearful conversion reads as emotional ventriloquism; no individual resists or misunderstands. The finale grants Finn remembrance "by the bittersweet song" without showing what he risks or loses to achieve it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words, so no penalty applies. The piece attempts a causal arc—Elara recruits Finn, they perform, the crowd transforms—but the climactic "disruption" unfolds through assertion: guitars halt mid-strum, revelers freeze, tears glisten, all without dramatized resistance or choice. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Finn moves from invisible to recognized), but the cost is told rather than shown; the final line claims he is "remembered…by the bittersweet song" without pointing to an on-page forfeiture or altered option. Drive lens reads as Causal with aspirations toward Accumulative texture, but the lens wavers because the ending relies on summary rather than image or decisive act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The luminous harbor establishes mood and anchors the opening effectively. The vintage camera frames silence in several beats, functioning as a micro-setting prop that guides Elara's attention. However, the festival edge and moored boats remain postcard details; spatial choreography during the climax (stepping into the festival's heart, camera raised) is vague, and no environmental constraint shapes the outcome. The moonlight recurs but does not evolve or charge the final image with new meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Finn's desire to be remembered—is signaled early but never tightened by a live obstacle or forced trade-off. Elara proposes disruption, they perform, and the crowd converts instantly; no reversal, no tactical cost, no adaptation when initial methods fail. The claimed "joyful sorrow" and tears are told outcomes, not pressures that narrow options. Agency is absent: the protagonists act, but nothing on the page resists or costs them a visible price before the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of silence-as-music emerges through repeated imagery (pauses, voids, mapped contours) and the vintage camera's empty film. However, the final paragraph moralizes directly: "Silence mapped is music eternal" states the thesis rather than earning it through image. The crowd's epiphany—"memories surfaced, forgotten loved ones recalled"—summarizes emotional payoff instead of dramatizing a non-literal answer. The joyful-sorrow oxymoron is declared but not embodied in contradictory actions or perceptions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds to Finn without head-hopping. Diction oscillates between lyric registers ("feather-light murmur," "liquid moonlight") and template cadence ("her eyes narrowed with purpose," "her hands beginning the mapping"). Elara's whisper-and-sign dialogue is mechanically described rather than rendered with distinct rhythm or subtext. The prose asserts "quietly charismatic" and "joyful sorrow" rather than letting gesture and silence create those impressions. Distance remains stable, but voice lacks a perceptual signature specific to Finn under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "timeframe when no one remembered him" echoes "now a shadow among tourists"; "disrupt" is declared, then restated as "disrupting this cacophony," then "They disrupted boldly." Stock metaphors cluster—"siren's subtle call," "feather-light murmur," "liquid moonlight"—without fresh synthesis. Synonym churn flattens momentum: "whispered," "murmured," "whispered-signed," "whisper the crescendo." Template cadence runs through Elara's actions: "She was… / She signed… / She lifted… / She explained…" The climax summarizes rather than dramatizes: "Feel the silence's melody" is told as command, not shown through reaction. Scaffold and loops touch the closure beat, triggering the artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—mapping silence into music via sign language—offers conceptual novelty, but execution defaults to template moves: the forgotten artist, the mysterious advisor, the crowd conversion. The vintage camera with no film is a striking image, yet its mechanics (framing voids, no physical capture) are asserted rather than explored through cost or constraint. The festival disruption could occur with generic street performance; sign language and silence-mapping do not uniquely enable the turn. Risk is present in the lyric ambition, but clarity and specificity are sacrificed, landing the piece in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara (whispering advisor) appears early, recruits Finn, explains the method, initiates the disruption, and whispers the climactic line. She drives two beats (recruitment, performance) and shapes the ending. However, her choices are directive rather than conflicted; she never faces a trade-off or cost that tests her motivation. Swappable with a generic mentor figure with minor edits. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, but no visible cost and high swappability −0.8, ornamental charisma label −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The vintage camera with no film is introduced early, handled in two beats (Elara peers through it, Finn holds it and frames the harbor), and returns at the climax ("camera framing their stunned faces"). Setup and development gates pass, but closure participation is cameo—it does not causally shape the outcome or return with reweighted meaning. The "no film" property is declared but never constrains a choice or dramatizes loss. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, specificity +0.4, but swappable with any framing device −0.6, ornamental use in climax −0.5, no cost −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sign language is seeded early ("core concept of sign language"), used throughout the performance ("hands weaving," "Sign language flowed…charting silence's contours"), and appears in the final image ("Finn…signed the finale"). It enables the method (mapping silence) and differentiates the disruption from speech-based performance. However, the mechanics are told—"curved fingers for elongated pauses"—rather than shown constraining a choice or creating friction. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables method) +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, but summary-only in key beats −0.6, mechanics never tested −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Quietly charismatic" is assigned to Elara in paragraph 4 and repeated as "quiet charisma" in paragraphs 9 and 24. The trait is asserted via labels and narrative summary ("her presence drawing Finn's gaze," "her quiet charisma pulled him") rather than demonstrated through a specific gesture, choice, or visible cost. No on-page action shows how the trait constrains or enables with consequence; Finn simply "nodded, mesmerized." Early mention +0.3, but label-only −0.7, no dramatized cost −0.6, swappable with generic magnetism −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Disrupt" is stated as Elara's plan early ("Tonight, we disrupt"), executed in the climax ("They disrupted boldly: stepping into the festival's heart"), and the outcome (festival dissolves into quiet) hinges on this action. It shapes two beats (declaration, execution) and appears in the closure frame. However, the action itself—stepping forward and signing—could be any street intervention; "disrupt" as a verb does not uniquely define the tactic or cost. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, but swappable with "perform," "interrupt," or "intervene" −0.7, mechanics generic −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"By mapping silence" is introduced at the midpoint ("her hands mapping the method: by mapping silence"), elaborated in the performance ("Sign language flowed…charting silence's contours—curved fingers for elongated pauses"), and the mapped voids become "hummed notes." The method enables the climactic translation and is present in the ending ("Silence mapped is music eternal"). However, the mapping mechanics are told rather than dramatized; no beat shows the process failing, requiring adjustment, or costing effort. Setup +0.4 (midpoint is late), two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, but summary-only execution −0.8, no cost −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "luminous harbor by moonlight" anchors the opening and closing images, provides the setting for the entire action, and supplies atmospheric details (waves, moored boats, festival onshore). Moonlight recurs in the ending. However, the harbor functions as backdrop; no geographic feature constrains movement, no tidal or spatial element pressures a choice. The festival edge is described but not used tactically. Early anchor +0.7, closure reprise +0.8, but postcard description without constraint −1.0, swappable with generic waterfront −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"When no one remembers you" is introduced in paragraph 2 ("shrouded in the timeframe when no one remembered him") and resolved in the final line ("Finn remembered not by name, but by the bittersweet song"). The timeframe bookends the story and defines Finn's stake. However, it imposes no visible pressure during the middle beats; no clock ticks, no moment tests whether recognition is slipping further, no cost accrues from the passage of unremembered time. Setup +0.6, closure linkage +0.9, but no middle development −0.8 (fails gate, cap 3.4 does not apply because closure participation is strong), static rather than live pressure −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To translate silence into music" is Elara's stated motivation (paragraph 10), echoed when she and Finn hum notes from mapped voids, and restated in the closing aphorism. The desire drives two beats (recruitment, performance) and informs the ending. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice; Elara never sacrifices an alternative path or pays a visible cost to pursue this translation. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but told-only without friction −0.8, no cost −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Joyful sorrow" is introduced as Elara's emotional signature ("eyes sparkling with joyful sorrow"), assigned to the crowd's reaction ("Joyful sorrow washed over the crowd"), and implied in the "bittersweet song" of the ending. The tone recurs across three beats and colors the closure image. However, the oxymoron is asserted via label rather than embodied in contradictory gesture or choice; no moment shows a character laughing through tears or celebrating a loss. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure charge +0.9, but label-only execution −0.7, no dramatized contradiction −0.5.</comment>
