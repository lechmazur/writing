<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—reimagining the Aetherians to legitimize a new uprising—is clearly stated and drives his heist. However, his interiority relies heavily on poetic abstractions ("burnished sorrow," "half-forged stanza") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final act (hurling the shard) serves his goal but reads more as symbolic gesture than a decision forged from competing impulses acting simultaneously. Internal conflict remains conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Elias devises a plan, executes it during the storm, and destroys the shard to seed interpretive chaos. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The closure—shard shattered, scholars forced to rebuild narrative—constitutes a Conceptual Repricing where Elias's revolutionary vision is seeded through destruction, with the cost (no possession, only provocation) legible on the page. However, the storm's mechanics and the scholars' pursuit feel underdeveloped; the turn from theft to destruction lacks a dramatized pressure point that would tighten options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vividly rendered with specific images (gilded spires, rococo vaults, visible time strands). The mirror gallery and temporal storm provide spatial and atmospheric constraints that enable Elias's plan. The mirrors function as both tool and micro-setting, constrained by the covering method. While sensory detail is rich, it occasionally overstays its purpose; the ending returns to setting imagery ("baroque witness") that charges the final frame, lifting integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias reclaiming revolutionary purpose via the shard—is signaled early and pursued through the heist. One meaningful pressure point occurs when he enters the vault and lifts the shard, but the escalation from theft to destruction happens off-pressure; no on-page reversal forces the pivot. The scholars' pursuit ("burst in") arrives too late to test Elias's commitment in real time. Cost is legible (shard destroyed, narrative dispersed) but the tightening lacks a live choice under competing goods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—revolutions die but their echoes refract eternal—emerges organically from Elias's act and the shard's fragmentation. The closing image of shards in glass offers a non-literal answer to the question of how failed ideals persist. However, Elias's final whisper ("revolutions die, but their echoes, like shards in glass, refract eternal") edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image alone carry meaning. The piece invites reflection but the last-beat articulation dilutes resonance slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent baroque register ("burnished sorrow," "iambic schemes," "perpetual melancholy") that suits the setting and Elias's poetic inclination. However, the elevated diction never modulates under peak pressure; even during the storm-swept climax, syntax remains ornate and uniform. Psychic distance stays stable, but the voice lacks perceptual signature—Elias's way of noticing doesn't shift between planning and action. The line "forcing scholars to rebuild the narrative from fragments alone" tells rather than shows the outcome.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("frozen screams," "rivers frothing into emerald whirlpools," "revolutionary ghosts"), often occupying most sentences in high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff—triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "shard's allure pierce his sorrow" / "visions flooding" / "shard clutched like a broken heart" restate emotional charge without added pressure. Template cadence in the planning passage ("procuring… timing… draping… slipping") flattens propulsion. Several stock metaphors ("like a specter," "like a broken heart") and filter verbs ("felt the shard's allure pierce") dull immediacy at key moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The premise—visible time, baroque asteroid archaeology, defunct revolutionary rewriting history via artifact destruction—synthesizes familiar SF and heist tropes into a specific configuration. The covering-mirrors folklore and the choice to destroy rather than steal offer fresh inflections. However, the emotional template (melancholy revolutionary seeking redemption through symbolic act) and the ornate-future aesthetic echo established genre patterns without fully transforming them through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The piece commits to its vision but the arc remains recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias appears throughout, his status as defunct revolutionary frames his motivation and drives the heist. His choices (devise plan, cloak mirrors, seize shard, destroy it) create key turns. However, much of his arc is recounted in summary ("wandered these burnished corridors," "spent nights devising") rather than dramatized in scene. The destruction choice lacks an on-page pressure point forcing the pivot from theft to shattering.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crystal vase shard is signaled early (archaeological dispute), handled at the vault (lifted, visions flooding), and destroyed in the climax (hurled into mirror, shattered into dust). It appears in three distinct beats and its destruction shapes the closure—forcing interpretive fragmentation. The shard's holographic runes and its role as proof for competing theories charge its meaning across the arc. Slightly swappable (another artifact could serve similarly) but specificity and reprise lift integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute between Lira and Kane is introduced early and frames Elias's motivation—he wants to seize the shard to rewrite the Aetherian narrative. However, the dispute itself remains background; scholars "clash in heated symposiums" off-page and "burst in" at the climax without altering Elias's tactics. The concept provides context but does not constrain on-page choices or escalate pressure. It shapes motivation more than it drives action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Elias's poetic inclination is mentioned early ("poetically inclined soul," verses etched on walls, plan inscribed in verse, "iambic schemes") and colors his voice. However, the trait functions as descriptive texture rather than constraint; no on-page choice demonstrates a cost or trade-off arising from his poetry. The verse on his palm is ornamental; the plan itself (timing diversions, covering mirrors) does not require or leverage poetic thinking. Label-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Devise" appears early ("He would devise a gambit") and structures the middle sequence: Elias devises his plan over nights, procuring silks and timing diversions. The execution (covering mirrors, entering vault, destroying shard) flows from this action. However, "devise" could be replaced by "plan" or "prepare" without structural impact. The specificity of devising—intellectual craft—is less visible than generic scheming. Two beats (planning, execution) but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Covering mirrors during storms is seeded early as "old asteroid lore," motivates Elias's chosen method ("mirror gallery would be his covert ingress"), and executes on-page ("draping mirrors in rippling black folds"). The method enables safe passage through the temporal storm and shapes the climax imagery (veiled mirror depths). Three gates met (setup, development, payoff) and the mechanics matter—without covering, the plan fails. Specificity and causal pressure elevate integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is present from the opening and provides vivid setting detail (gilded spires, rococo vaults, mirror gallery). The dig site vault and storm-swept gallery constrain Elias's approach and supply the tool (mirrors) for his ingress. However, much of the setting functions as atmospheric description; only the mirror gallery and vault directly alter tactics. The asteroid's baroque quality colors tone but does not force on-page trade-offs. Functional across beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Visible time is introduced in the opening ("time had become visible") and the temporal storm provides the window for Elias's heist. Time's appearance as strands and whirlpools enriches atmosphere and enables the mirror-covering method. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; the storm simply arrives at dusk-cycle and ebbs at closure without countdown pressure. The concept is present and functional but does not constrain moment-to-moment choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The desire to reimagine the Aetherians is stated early ("recasting them as proto-revolutionaries… legitimizing a new uprising") and drives Elias's choices: eavesdropping on scholars, seizing the shard, and ultimately destroying it to force reinterpretation. The motivation is dramatized through action (heist, visions, destruction) and charges the closure (scholars must rebuild narrative). However, internal friction between this want and competing costs is told more than shown; the moment of destruction lacks visible hesitation or trade-off, lowering felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Burnished sorrow" appears as a phrase early ("motivation burned with burnished sorrow") and colors the prose throughout (melancholy, lament, quiet victory). The tone modulates slightly from planning to action but remains elegiac and ornate even under pressure. The final image ("burnished sorrow, he whispered") reprises the phrase and charges the closure. Coherent across turns but the tone's uniformity—no cadence break at peak stress—limits dynamic range. Lyric reprise lifts integration modestly.</comment>
