<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to honor overlooked histories") is stated but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The piece tells us she "yearns to preserve" and "realizes" rather than showing her wrestle with competing desires or costs on the page. Interior life consists of label-stacked phrases ("elusively tangible," "chaotic intuitions," "eternal instant") rather than embodied emotion or character-particular perception. The final "fulfillment" arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path, reading as declared success rather than earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The Orientation Test fails: by ~120 words we have "market strung high above city," "between-worlds translator," "lighthouse lens fragment" phasing between states, but no grounded who/where/when anchor—Elara's immediate situation, the market's spatial layout, and the present trigger remain vague. The drive lens is ambiguous throughout: causal links are asserted ("The method had come to her in a hunch") rather than earned, yet the piece gestures toward accumulative texture without teaching a pattern by the first quarter. Closure claims "histories once overlooked now eternal anchors" but offers no on-page cost or foreclosed option—alchemists bow, visions cascade, the city "pulsed unknowingly"—all summary, no felt price. Applying Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and lens ambiguity at closure (−0.4), plus caps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The high-strung market offers vivid images ("vaporous lanterns," "jars of writhing shadows," "canvases dangling like tapestries of dreamstuff") but remains postcard description—sensory details do not constrain choice or alter tactics. Spatial choreography is vague (Elara "moved stall to stall" without tracking distance, obstacles, or lived-in interaction). The lens fragment interacts with paintings in the climax, providing micro-setting function, but the body and environment do not pressure decisions earlier. Economy is poor: many ornamental details (brass astrolabes, captured dawns) appear once without return or consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unfastening the lens to preserve histories—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or cost. Elara "approached," "scanned," "whispered," and "unfastened" in a sequence of unopposed actions; no reversal, no tightening choice, no visible trade-off. The "eternal instant" framing implies suspended time, yet this also flattens escalation: nothing narrows options or raises stakes because the outcome is preordained from the opening. Pressure is asserted ("her heart raced") rather than built through agency under constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme ("honoring overlooked histories") is stated repeatedly ("overlooked histories," "silenced tales," "forgotten lore") rather than emerging from action and image. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "histories once overlooked now eternal anchors for all," replacing scene pressure with thesis. Subtext is absent—gesture, silence, and implication yield to direct assertion ("her motivation realized"). The lighthouse motif recurs but does not shift meaning; it remains a static symbol rather than a resonant image charged by cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>POV distance is inconsistent: "eternal instant" implies lyric suspension, yet the narrator also provides linear backstory and omniscient summary ("the city below pulsed unknowingly"). Diction drifts into elevated register unmotivated by Elara's interior voice ("infinitesimal maps of vanished routes," "holographic annals onto the market's mist"). Perceptual signature is generic—no character-particular way of noticing. Purposeful compression is attempted ("between childhood and now") but not taught as a pattern; the piece alternates between summary and present scene without clear anchoring cues, creating orientation debt rather than lyric effect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "elusively tangible" appears three times; "overlooked histories" / "silenced tales" / "forgotten lore" cycle without added pressure. Template cadence dominates peak beats: "She traded… She felt… The fragment became… Years blurred… She aided…" Filter-verb stacks dull immediacy ("she clutched," "she yearned," "she sensed"). Stock metaphors appear without fresh angle ("jeweled spiderwebs," "tapestries of dreamstuff"). Figurative density in the climax ("visions cascaded," "power unbound," "tales etching into every onlooker's soul") abstracts rather than grounds. Applying patterned-artifact penalty (−1.2) for loops, template cadence, and stock strings; artifacts touch closure, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Core premise (translator uses magical lens to unlock hidden paintings) follows a template: quest object + mystical market + epiphany climax. Execution does not transform: Elara faces no opposition, the lens works as expected, and resolution is tidy satisfaction without cost. "Between-worlds translator" and "alchemist's market" read as stock fantasy furniture. The "eternal instant" timeframe gestures at originality but remains ornamental—time suspension does not create fresh stakes or a non-obvious moral calculus. No bold risk; middle-ground choices throughout.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara's role as translator is labeled and summarized ("aided specters," "mending rifts") but she makes no on-page translation decision that alters tactics or creates cost. Her whisper "Release the overlooked" is declarative summary, not a choice under pressure. Present throughout but swappable with any mystical-guide archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lens fragment appears in setup (childhood acquisition), middle (held to eye at paintings), and closure (unfastened). It enables the painting-examination beats and is causally active in the ending, but its "elusively tangible" property does not constrain a choice—Elara uses it without friction or cost. Functional across beats but the specific object could be replaced by any magical magnifying tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Anchors of intuition" is a thematic label repeated ("anchor of intuition," "anchored her intuition," "eternal anchors") without shaping on-page stakes or tactics. The concept does not create a dilemma or enable a specific action; it decorates the narrator's claims. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Elusively tangible" is described three times ("phasing between solid weight and ethereal shimmer," "no longer elusively tangible but firmly hers") but never constrains or enables an action. Elara handles the lens without difficulty; the attribute is aesthetic label, not functional constraint. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Unfasten" appears in setup framing ("returned to unfasten its deepest bind") and closure ("unfastened the lens's heart-clasp"). The act is the climactic goal, but it occurs without opposition or cost—Elara completes it in one beat. The action frames the arc but does not create a turn or redefine options; success is linear and unopposed. Functional but swappable with "unlock" or "release."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Method ("through hidden details in paintings") is signaled early ("hidden details in paintings unlocked bindings") and used in the middle climax beats (rune in foam, inscription in tower, clasp in cloak). It shapes the examination sequence but mechanics are vague—Elara looks, sees, whispers—no resistance or cost. Present in two beats plus closure setup; functional but the method's specificity does not create unique constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The market provides vivid postcard detail (lanterns, walkways, stalls) and frames all action, but it does not constrain choice or supply resources that affect outcome. Elara moves freely without spatial friction. The high-above-rooftops location is atmospheric but swappable with any fantasy bazaar. Functional frame, not pressure-source.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Between childhood and now" is stated and a childhood flashback is summarized, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions—"eternal instant" suspends clock pressure rather than creating it. The childhood acquisition and present quest are causally linked in summary but do not create urgency or alter tactics on the page. Ornamental temporal framing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Motivation ("to honor overlooked histories") is declared repeatedly and frames the quest goal, but it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. Elara pursues it without friction or sacrifice. The desire is told, not tested. Present as premise but not enacted with pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Eternal instant" is labeled throughout ("transfixed in an eternal instant," "the eternal instant stretching," "in that suspended forever") but tone does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image—it remains a static poetic claim. The piece gestures at timeless suspension without using it to heighten stakes or reweight the ending. Decorative tonal label.</comment>
