<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "discover the texture of time" is articulated early but remains abstract throughout; his gestures with the halo fragment and photographs never translate into micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority leans heavily on decorative reverie ("quaking," "trembling") rather than embodied contradiction or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final liberation reads as declared rather than earned—no prior constraint meaningfully narrows his options on the page, and the cost of freedom (loss of wife's image, fragment destruction) arrives without prior struggle over that specific tradeoff. Backstory loops (wife, first mazes) anchor in present stimuli but do not tilt present stance via on-page micro-choices; they function as atmospheric color rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, but causality fractures: Elias "knows instinctively" the fragment holds the key without prior setup, and the method—tracing hyperbolic paths with the fragment—appears suddenly as both discovery and solution without intermediate failure or narrowing. The retrocognitive trap is declared ("ensnared by visions") but never dramatizes a choice it prevents; his final action (rotating the fragment through pseudospherical helices) lacks motivated escalation—he simply performs the climactic gesture without an on-page turn that forces or costs him this attempt. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (freedom from trap), yet the "chains snapped" moment lacks visible cost: the photographs crumble, but we never see Elias wrestle with losing them or choose between trap and wife's memory. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (density of metaphor and concept), but the final image does not reweight prior material through cadence shift or pattern break—it declares release without charging the price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The living bridge garden supplies vivid, hyperbolic-geometry-specific detail (saddle-curved paths, heptagonal vine blooms, swaying spans over chasms) and the halo fragment embedded in a pillar at the nexus functions as a spatial anchor that charges the climax. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's designer lens (mossy railings, sap pulses, crushed petals and ozone), and the garden's quaking in sympathy with his reverie integrates setting into emotional state. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Elias navigates it freely without access friction or a tool/boundary that alters his tactics. The micro-setting (body, fragment, vine pillar) appears in the closure beat but does not demonstrably limit or enable the final action; he could perform the same gesture elsewhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escape the retrocognitive trap—is signaled early, but pressure remains static: visions "assault him unbidden" and "the trap held firm" are declarations without on-page escalation or narrowing. No reversal or complication tests Elias's commitment; he stumbles upon the halo fragment and immediately "knows instinctively" it will solve the problem, then enacts the solution without failure or trade-off. The cost (fragment disintegration, photograph dissolution) is visible at closure, but Elias never chooses between competing goods or unavoidable harms—the cost simply happens as byproduct of success. Agency reads as performance rather than decision under pressure; coincidence (finding the fragment) enables resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—time's tactile texture versus abstract theory—emerges through specific images (bark, dew, "gritty quivering lattice") and the hyperbolic geometry motif. The final revelation ("not smooth continuum but a gritty, quivering lattice") delivers a concrete answer without moralizing, and the closing line ("time's texture ripple through his skin like wind through leaves") reweights the opening desire with sensory proof. However, the thematic question never intersects a moral calculus or dilemma; Elias's arc is discovery without sacrifice or renunciation that complicates the answer. The retrocognitive trap and fading photographs could force a choice between past and present knowledge, but the piece lets both dissolve painlessly. Subtext operates in the hedge-maze-as-time metaphor, yet the resolution feels like a lecture illustration rather than an earned, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited with consistent access to Elias's perception, and diction reflects his designer idiom ("hyperbolic geometries," "pseudospherical helices"). However, register frequently drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats ("quaking reverie," "retrocognitively trapped," "exponential flares") that clashes with embodied urgency; the prose reads more like academic exposition than lived crisis. Perceptual signature is present (he notices sap veins, saddle curves) but does not modulate under stress—syntactic rhythm and lexicon remain uniform whether he is trembling in opening or gasping free at closure. No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is clean, but the voice lacks a distinct rhythmic signature that would distinguish crisis from calm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose carries high figurative density without pattern-teaching or payoff: nearly every sentence in the climax stacks metaphor ("pseudospherical helices," "fractal spirals," "luminous motes"), and mixed vehicles blur clarity—vines "pulse with sap like veins of forgotten epochs" conflates biological and temporal scales without coherent logic. Template cadence pervades: "trembled in quaking reverie," "quaking deeper into reverie," "garden quaked in sympathy" recycles the root across three beats without added pressure. Paraphrase loops appear ("retrocognitive trap," "retrocognitively trapped," "retrocognitive chains") and synonym churn inflates texture ("quaking," "trembling," "quivering") without advancing sense. Filter-verb stacks in the climax ("began to disintegrate," "feeling time's texture ripple") dull immediacy. Stock metaphors ("shadows of yesterday clung to every leaf," "memories dissolving in rain") reduce specificity. Information density is low—many lines restate concept without scene action. Applying patterned-artifact penalty: baseline −0.8 for template cadence and metaphor stacks, escalated to −1.2 because artifacts pervade the closure beat ("warping into fractal spirals," "flaking into luminous motes").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of hedge-maze design, hyperbolic geometry, and retrocognitive photography offers a specific, non-obvious premise, and the "texture of time" angle transforms familiar time-travel motifs into tactile discovery. However, the emotional and plot arc (trapped designer finds mystical key, performs ritual, gains freedom) follows a stock template, and the climax—rotating a fragment through geometric incantation—reads as generic fantasy resolution rather than a turn rooted in Elias's prior choices or flaws. The fading photographs and lost wife could ground originality in grief and renunciation, but the piece treats them as atmospheric props rather than forcing a transformation test. Hyperbolic geometry remains ornamental jargon; swapping it for any other esoteric method would not alter the story's stakes or outcome. No bold risk heightens pressure—tone, structure, and resolution all hew to safe middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his designer background colors perception (he planted the seeds, sculpted hyperbolic paths), but his choices do not create key turns. He stumbles upon the fragment, "knows instinctively" its use, and performs the final gesture without on-page decision that alters tactics or costs him a competing goal. His role is observer and performer rather than agent under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears at midpoint embedded in a pillar, is handled in two beats (pressing it to photograph, tracing it along hyperbolic paths), and disintegrates at closure to break the trap. It enables the climax and its destruction carries cost (luminous motes disperse, freeing Elias). However, it does not constrain a choice or create friction—Elias uses it immediately upon discovery without complication. Swapping it for any mystical object would not fundamentally alter story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Fading photographs are introduced early as the "core concept" and "portals" that trap Elias in retrocognition, and they crumble at closure as the trap breaks. However, they do not shape on-page tactics—Elias never chooses whether to preserve or destroy them, and their dissolution is byproduct rather than decision. The concept remains thematic claim rather than dramatized stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is declared early ("his mind ensnared by visions") and the trap "tightened" at midpoint, but the attribute does not constrain a visible on-page action with cost. Visions "assaulted him unbidden" yet never prevent a move or force a tradeoff; they function as atmospheric condition rather than mechanical limit.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Disintegrate" drives the major turn at closure: the halo fragment's disintegration into "luminous motes" breaks the retrocognitive chains and scatters the photographs' hold. The action is specific (flaking, dispersing along hyperbolic bridges) and redefines Elias's state from trapped to free. It would be difficult to swap for another verb without altering the ending's logic. However, the disintegration is not chosen by Elias—it happens as consequence of his ritual without on-page cost or hesitation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is mentioned early (saddle-curved paths, exponential flares, heptagonal blooms) and invoked at climax ("rotating the fragment through pseudospherical helices"), but its mechanics do not matter—Elias does not fail, adjust, or learn the method on the page. The method appears as incantation rather than means that shapes attempts or tactics. Swapping it for any esoteric technique would not alter the story.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is established early with vivid hyperbolic detail (swaying spans, vine-wrought pillar at nexus, saddle shapes) and the garden "quaked in sympathy" at climax, supplying the halo fragment's location. It provides atmosphere and one resource (the pillar) but does not pressure choices—Elias navigates freely without access friction or environmental cost. The setting charges the final image (vines whispering approval) but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is stated early and revisited ("texture revealed itself: not smooth continuum but gritty, quivering lattice"), but the desire is never dramatized in conflicting choices. Elias pursues it without friction between want and cost—his wife's loss and the retrocognitive trap are declared obstacles, yet he never chooses between preserving her memory and achieving his goal. The motivation remains told rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" is coherent throughout: trembling, quivering, swaying, suspended dreamscape, and the garden's sympathetic quake all reinforce the tone. It modulates slightly (desperation at climax, approval at end) and charges the final image ("time's texture ripple...forever quaking"). However, the tone remains a single static layer—elevated, abstract lyricism—without contrast or rupture that would heighten pressure at the turn.</comment>
