<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The oracle's "mild obsession" to map endless night is stated but never tested; we see no contradictory impulse or struggle when Elara's need interrupts his work. Elara's desperation is asserted ("eyes wide with desperation") rather than shown through embodied perception or micro-choices under pressure. The oracle's action—teaching Elara to read silence—proceeds without friction or cost to his own goal. No decision forecloses a path with visible consequence; both characters end in alignment without sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (taught by the repeated "ambered hush" and marbled metaphors, held through closure). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraphs. The map-drawing sequence accumulates sensory fragments (gusts, stone settling) but the closure—Elara "clutches the map fragment, renewed"—delivers no visible or felt cost; renewal is declared, not dramatized. The final "pact against the night" remains abstract; the piece does not show what Elara or the oracle forfeit or risk to achieve it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The storm and fort are vivid early ("weathered ramparts," "arrow-slit windows"); the spatial choreography (central chamber, alcove) is clear. The flaking booklet and the pauses between gusts serve as micro-setting elements that enable the oracle's lesson. However, the fort's storm-tossed state does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains backdrop. The final image does not tie the setting details to the closure effect, leaving them decorative rather than essential.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—navigating endless night—is signaled early. The oracle's method (reading silences) is explained and demonstrated in two beats, but no reversal or tightening occurs; Elara absorbs the lesson without resistance or trade-off. The map emerges through passive observation, not protagonist choice. The ending declares "renewed" and "pact" but shows no on-page price or foreclosed option; the pressure remains static rather than escalating to a decisive moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of erasure retold through silence is coherent and emerges through image (gusts, stones settling) rather than statement. The oracle's line "summarizing silence" offers a fresh angle. However, the ending ("ambered silence sealed their pact") abstracts the theme into a tidy moral rather than leaving tension; the final image does not reweight prior material with cost. The thematic resonance is present but not sharpened by a non-literal closure question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on the oracle, with brief Elara interiority in her entrance beat. Psychic distance is controlled. The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("marbled hush," "ambered") that fits the mythic tone, though at times it drifts toward ornament ("veined with regret") without grounding in concrete action. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the oracle's "Speak your need" and "By summarizing silence" feel natural to the voice. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense ("ambered hush," "marbled," "flaking gold leaf") and often clusters without pattern-teaching: "ambered hush" appears in opening, middle, and close but functions as label rather than reweighting image. Paraphrase loops: "The ambered hush deepened" followed by "storms outside a distant roar" restates stillness without adding pressure. Template cadence: "He nodded… He rose… He opened… He pointed… He sketched" stacks identical stems across five sentences mid-story. Clarity remains high; no causality breaks. Applying −0.6 for template cadence and −0.3 for paraphrase loop (total −0.9) and noting the meta-commentary in the final bracket disrupts momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—mapping endless night by reading silence—offers a fresh synthesis of oracle/cartography motifs. The "pebble-shore" detail and "flaking gold leaf booklet" are specific and memorable. However, the emotional arc (stranger seeks wisdom, receives it) follows a familiar template without transformation; Elara's journey from desperation to renewal lacks friction or surprise. The execution is competent but the story does not take a bold risk or subvert expectation; the ending's "pact" resolves too neatly for higher originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The oracle is present throughout and delivers the map-reading lesson, participating in the closure beat. However, his choices are pedagogical rather than conflicted; he teaches without internal struggle or cost. The "mild obsession" does not constrain a decision. He is essential to the premise but not to a turn; his role is functional-expert rather than agent under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The booklet appears in paragraph 2 (setup), is consulted again mid-story ("opened… again"), and its "flaking leaf flecks" gild the final map fragment (closure participation). It is handled twice and its physical decay (flaking) metaphorically mirrors erasure. However, it does not constrain or enable a choice; it remains a prop. The early seed and final reprise qualify for lyric allowance, placing it in the 5.5–6.3 range, but lack of causal pressure caps it at 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Ambered hush" is named in the opening, repeated mid-story ("The ambered hush deepened"), and returns in the final line ("ambered silence sealed their pact"). It establishes tone and recurs at closure, satisfying setup and payoff. However, it does not shape a choice or narrow options; it functions as atmospheric label rather than tactical constraint. Lyric reprise without causal work places it in the 4.5–5.0 band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Mildly obsessed" is stated twice ("mildly obsessed with a singular pursuit," "mild obsession threading his words") but does not constrain an on-page action. The oracle interrupts his project to teach Elara without visible reluctance or trade-off; the trait remains label-only. It is present and logically consistent but replaceable; a generic "dedicated" would function identically.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Retell" is the method by which the oracle maps the night; it is introduced early ("by retelling what was lost"), demonstrated in the middle silence-reading beats, and appears in the closure paragraph ("You retell erasure itself"). It drives the central teaching sequence and defines the map's creation. However, Elara's final choice (clutching the map) does not hinge on her own act of retelling; the action remains the oracle's tool rather than a shared turn. Present in all three gates with causal work in two beats, but not indispensable to the protagonist's agency.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"By summarizing silence" is named explicitly mid-story, demonstrated in two beats (the stuttered void, the settling stones), and implicit in the closure ("ambered silence sealed their pact"). It is the method that enables map-drawing and shapes the oracle's teaching. However, it does not force a choice or create a trade-off; it is a technique explained rather than tested. Appears in setup, development, and payoff with moderate causal work, placing it near 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "storm-tossed ridge fort" is established in the opening and provides spatial anchors (central chamber, alcove, arrow-slits). The storm creates urgency (Elara flees tempest) and the fort shelters the lesson. However, the fort does not constrain the oracle's or Elara's choices; the map-drawing could occur in any sheltered space. The setting frames the encounter but does not alter tactics. Setup and mild development present; no closure linkage beyond backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Only one star remaining" is mentioned twice (opening and midpoint: "The oracle smiled faintly, one star winking out beyond the ridge") and the "dimming sky" bookends the piece. It signals apocalyptic urgency but does not tighten a decision or alter tactics on the page; the lesson proceeds at the same pace regardless of the star's fate. Time pressure is declared but not dramatized through choice. Setup and atmospheric payoff without development caps it below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to draw a map of an endless night" is stated early and drives the oracle's presence in the fort. The map fragment appears at closure. However, the desire is never tested; no competing want creates friction, and the oracle assists Elara without cost to his own goal. The motivation explains the premise but does not generate a conflicted choice. Setup and closure participation without on-page friction places it in the functional-but-not-essential band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Marbled hush" appears in the opening ("marbled hush of muted grays"), recurs mid-story ("marbled suspense," "marbled hush of betrayal"), and closes with "ambered silence." The tone is coherent, elevated, and sustained through turns. It modulates slightly (from suspension to betrayal to sealing pact) and charges the final image with stillness. The pervasive metaphorical register supports the mythic frame. Strong setup, development through varied contexts, and closure linkage with moderate charge place it in the upper-mid band.</comment>
