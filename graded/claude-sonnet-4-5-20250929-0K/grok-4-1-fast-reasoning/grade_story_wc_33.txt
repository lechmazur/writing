<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation (mending broken promises via drone network) is established but his choices feel more procedural than driven by lived contradiction. The backstory of the lost bride surfaces but remains ornamental rather than pressuring present action with embodied cost. Internal conflict is asserted ("heart heavier with ghosts") rather than dramatized through simultaneous contradictory impulses. The final letter from her hand arrives conveniently without prior on-page friction that would earn the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of absences, drone launches, vial depletion). Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~80 words (acceptable). The closure—receiving coordinates to the Expanse—lands on the page but lacks visible cost: Elias pedals away with a new destination, yet no option is foreclosed, no price paid. The bottle's fury and the arcade's witness gesture toward resonance but do not reconfigure stakes with felt consequence. Causality is intact but the ending image does not crystallize a before/after with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade at twilight supplies vivid sensory anchors (neon haze, blue pulse, pinball ghosts) filtered through Elias's lens. The vial's glow and the booth's vent enable drone launches, grounding the method in spatial detail. However, the arcade functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint meaningfully narrows a choice at closure. The bottle charges earlier beats but does not reweight the final image, capping micro-setting credit below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: foster escape routes for families sundered by the border. Pressure coheres across sorting, drone deployment, and patrol encounter, but escalation is modest—each step proceeds as planned without a reversal that narrows options. The patrol check passes without friction, and the final letter arrives as windfall rather than earned turn. One meaningful tightening (vial half-drained, "promise of more runs") signals future cost but does not alter present tactics or foreclose a path on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of mending broken promises through clandestine networks emerges from particulars (empty mailbox slots, drone payloads, vial's rage). The arcade as neutral zone and absences as map are specific. Yet the ending delivers coordinates without thematic friction—Elias's hope is validated rather than tested. The line "borders broke flesh, but drones mended oaths" edges toward thesis statement. No counter-reading pressure or ambiguity charges the final image; the piece leans toward affirmation without cost-driven complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias with consistent narrative distance. Perceptual signature is present (respectful nods, tactical sorting) but diction drifts into elevated register ("brittle hush," "unmet eyes," "thunderstorm in a bottle") that clashes with a working mailman's lexicon under operational stress. Dialogue with the guard is functional but generic. The prose texture is more lyric-atmospheric than character-particular, and the final paragraphs shift into authorial summary ("His motivation burned clear") that tells rather than trusts dramatization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "veins under bruised skin," "gaping like unmet eyes," "thunderstorm's breath," "cobalt ghosts approving." Mixed metaphors accumulate (the bottle births micro-storms yet also has "rage" and "fury"). Paraphrase loops appear ("absences linked," "by linking absences," "absences chained"). Template cadence in the final third ("He'd crossed once... drones were surer now"; "Respectfully rebellious, he played...") flattens propulsion. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("promises stirring beyond," "bottled vow unbound"), triggering elevated penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The smuggling-mailman-at-border premise offers a fresh angle on divided-territory fiction, and the method of mapping absences to foster escapes is specific. However, the emotional arc (lost love rediscovered via network) and the ending's coordinates-from-her-hand beat echo reunion-quest templates without transformation. The vial as power source and the arcade as neutral zone are vivid but not irreplaceable. The piece commits to its premise but resolves it with validation rather than a non-obvious moral calculus or synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias appears throughout and launches drones, but his choices feel procedural rather than stakes-altering. Sorting mail and activating devices advance the method without forcing a trade-off or narrowing options. Setup and development gates met; closure participation is cameo (he reads the letter, pedals away). Causal pressure is modest; swappable with "border courier" or similar role without major edits. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, swappability −0.6, ornamental closure −0.4, summary-only use −0.4 → base ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The vial appears early, fuels two drone launches on the page, and is noted "half-drained" to signal cost. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. However, it does not constrain a choice—drones launch as planned—and the closure beat mentions it ("thunderstorm humming soft rebellion") without reweighting prior stakes. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, cost connection +0.3, closure cameo (not causally active) −0.5, swappability (any power source) −0.5 → ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Smuggling drones across the border frames the entire operation: Elias's satchel carries contraband, drones ferry families, signals are masked. Setup immediate, development across multiple beats (three drone launches), and the final image ("drones mended oaths") ties closure to the concept. Causal pressure is present (vial depletion, patrol proximity) but modest—no reversal forces tactical shift. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, swappability (any smuggling method) −0.6, no on-page trade-off −0.5 → ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Respectfully rebellious" is stated ("his rebellion veiled in courtesy," "Respectfully rebellious, he played") and shown in the polite patrol exchange, but it does not constrain a choice with cost. The guard waves him through without friction; respect earns leeway but no on-page trade-off is dramatized. Setup gate met, development and payoff weak. Label-only −0.5, no visible cost −0.6, swappability (any cautious smuggler) −0.5, early signal +0.4 → ~3.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Foster" is central to Elias's mission (fostering flights, exodus) and recurs throughout. However, it functions as thematic umbrella rather than distinct action that turns the plot. The on-page actions are "launch drone," "sort mail," "activate console"—foster is the intent behind them, not a separate beat. Setup and thematic payoff present, but no single choice pivots on "foster" versus another verb. Thematic integration +0.8, swappability (assist, enable, guide) −0.7, summary-only use −0.4 → ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"By linking absences" is signaled early ("By linking absences, Elias mapped the fractures") and recurs. The method shapes Elias's tactic (he examines empty slots to identify escapees) and the final image ("absences linked"). However, the mechanics are told rather than dramatized—no on-page beat shows him choosing one link over another with cost. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, thematic payoff +0.4, summary-only −0.6, swappability (tracking gaps, noting patterns) −0.5 → ~4.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade at twilight anchors every beat: neon haze, drop booth, pinball ghosts, patrols pacing outside. Setup immediate, sensory texture consistent, and the final line ("The arcade watched, silent witness") charges the ending. The setting enables the mission (neutral zone, booth vent for launches) and its twilight timing cloaks operations. However, no environmental constraint forces a tactical shift. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +0.6, no choice constraint −0.6 → ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"At the day's lone mail drop" is stated early and recurs in the final paragraph. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Elias proceeds methodically without a ticking clock altering moves. Twilight provides cover but is atmospheric rather than tactical. Setup gate met, development and closure participation weak. Ornamental use −0.7, no causal pressure −0.6, early signal +0.4 → ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elias's desire to find where broken promises heal is stated ("His own scar drove it—a bride's pledge evaporated") and shapes the mission's stakes. The final letter offers coordinates to the Expanse core where "promises knit whole." Setup, development (sorting absences linked to healing), and payoff present. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—no on-page friction between healing others and his own yearning with visible cost. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, summary-only −0.6, no friction cost −0.6 → ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Brittle hush" opens and closes the piece, modulates with patrol tension ("siren bit the hush") and drone hums, and charges the final image ("Hush swallowed him"). Tone is coherent across turns, intensifies under pressure, and the closing line reweights the opening atmosphere with cost-laden quiet. Setup immediate, consistent development, strong closure linkage. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure recharge +1.2, causal pressure (tone shifts with action) +0.7, slight register drift −0.4 → ~6.2.</comment>
