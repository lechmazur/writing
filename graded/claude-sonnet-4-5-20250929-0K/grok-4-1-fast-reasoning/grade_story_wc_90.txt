<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's "steadfast pacifist guardian" motivation is declared but never tested by a competing impulse on the page. The shadow-integration premise—confronting rage, guilt, envy—is told through summary interiority ("the first shadow emerged—a snarling echo") rather than embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice (piercing the dimensional lock via tapestry) feels unmotivated by prior agency; she completes a ritual sequence without visible internal cost or foreclosed path. Therapy-speak labels ("shadow work," "integration," "alchemical") replace specific emotional perception throughout peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The closure beat—"she pressed the tapestry…with a final stitch pierced the dimensional lock"—is a mechanical completion without visible cost; the "barrier yielded to her pacifist alchemy" is assertion, not dramatized consequence. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph, so no penalty there. The inferred lens wobbles between Accumulative (tapestry-building) and Causal (final breach), but neither yields a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt price. The ending spills "golden mist…echoes of laughter" as reward without sacrifice, and "her shadows forever woven into wholeness" tells resolution rather than showing a before/after with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship is signaled early ("patched from melted-down battlecruisers," "faded photographs scavenged from derelict stations") and provides atmosphere, but it never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The heart-chamber and rift-console are postcard backdrops for ritual action. The photographs function as thematic props—shimmer activates the portal, tear-shimmers provide "spectral ink"—yet remain static description; no spatial choreography shifts under pressure, and the ship's corridors and panels do not shape outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to push open the locked dimension"—is declared in exposition and pursued through a single ritual sequence (confront shadows, stitch tapestry, breach portal) without escalation or reversal. No tightening narrows options; each step (shadow emerges, Elara invites it, stitches a fragment) proceeds in and-then fashion. The climactic "final stitch pierced the dimensional lock" is coincidental success with no visible cost or trade-off. The attribute "gravitationally lighter when happy" appears once as reward, not as a constraint that forces a difficult choice earlier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme (integration of shadow, pacifist alchemy, mercy toward inner darkness) is stated overtly ("shadow work," "pacifist creed demanding integration over expulsion") rather than emerging from concrete action. The ending moralizes: "peace stitched the stars anew" and "her shadows forever woven into wholeness" are abstract summaries that replace earned resonance. Kwan Yin's tear is a symbolic convenience—legend whispered, glow urging mercy—without a non-literal charge that reweights prior material. The piece reads as prompt elements assembled to illustrate a thesis rather than particulars that invite reflection beyond the plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable, but diction drifts into elevated academic register ("alchemical integration," "spectral fireflies," "nascent light") that jars against the ghostly-hologram focalizer. Interiority is told via therapy labels ("guilt for surviving them, envy of their fleeting passions") rather than perceptual signature. The line "her tone remained ghostly resolve—unyielding, otherworldly determination" is meta-narration that explains voice instead of embodying it. Elara's one line of dialogue—"I will not fight you"—is declaration without subtext or goal-driven friction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: "The shadow lunged…She extended…She began the action of stitch…Suddenly, a pivotal shift" mirrors outline phrasing. Paraphrase loops cluster in the closure third—"the tapestry grew, a quilt of integrated darkness pulsing with nascent light" restates "Each stitch bound a fragment: rage into resolve, guilt into grace" without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("like dandelion seed in zero-g," "reality quivered as the barrier yielded") and filter-verb stacks ("felt the weight," "felt a tremor," "felt…lighter") dull immediacy in peak beats. Pen-ultimate paragraph: "Her motivation crystallized" is scaffold exposition mid-climax. Per the penalty pack, template cadence + loops + filter stacks in closure third yield −1.4 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—hologram pacifist performs Jungian shadow work to unlock a dimension—closely matches New Age self-help and posthuman-AI template hybrids without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "steadfast pacifist" and "integration of dark aspects" are stock roles; the recycled-spaceship-after-humanity premise is familiar from countless post-apocalypse meditations. The stitching action and tear-shimmer method are decorative variations on ritual-as-plot-key. No turn or reweighting feels inevitable in hindsight; the ending grants symmetric satisfaction (peace restored, shadows integrated, dimension opened) without risk or ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "steadfast pacifist" trait is declared in the opening and invoked when Elara whispers "I will not fight you" to the shadow, but no on-page choice tests or trades off this stance. The pacifism is label-only; removing it would not break the ritual sequence or closure. Late penalty (−0.5), ornamental use (−0.8), swappability (−0.6), summary-only (−0.5). Floor near 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's tear is signaled early (legend, "pulsing in her grasp"), used in two beats (warming in her palm during shadow confrontation, blazing brighter when she grows lighter), and "at its heart" in the final stitch that pierces the lock. However, it is a passive prop—glow urging mercy—whose unique properties do not narrow options or impose cost. Swappable with any "artifact of compassion." Gates: setup ✓, middle ✓, closure ✓. +0.8 early, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure presence, −0.6 swappability, −0.5 ornamental. ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Shadow work is named and described ("confronting the rage," "integration over expulsion") but occurs through told summary rather than on-page choice pressure. The shadows are apparitions Elara stitches without visible friction or cost. The concept does not alter tactics; it is a thematic frame. Gates: setup ✓ (declared early), middle ✓ (shadows arise), closure ✓ (tapestry complete). +0.8 early, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure, −0.8 ornamental/summary-only, −0.4 swappability. ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The attribute appears once in the final third: "she grew gravitationally lighter…her form ascending effortlessly." It is reward, not constraint or cost. No earlier beat tests or trades off happiness; the levity is declared after integration is complete. Late intro (−1.0), ornamental (−1.0), no causal pressure (−0.8), no cost (−0.6). Floor near 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stitching is signaled ("her holographic fingers threading luminous filaments") and drives the middle sequence (binding shadows into tapestry) and the climax ("with a final stitch pierced the dimensional lock"). It shapes two distinct beats and the ending. However, the mechanics are abstract; removing "stitch" and replacing with "weave" or "bind" would not change story logic. Gates: setup ✓, middle ✓, closure ✓. +0.8 early, +1.4 three beats, +1.2 closure causal, −0.6 swappability. ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The method—"via the faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded photographs"—is named when Elara "activated the shadow work portal" and provides "spectral ink for her needle's path." It appears in two beats (activation, stitching) but remains decorative description; the shimmer's mechanics do not constrain attempts or shape failure/success. Gates: setup ✓ (intro), middle ✓ (ink), closure ✓ (amplified). +0.8 early, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure, −0.7 ornamental, −0.5 swappability. ~3.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship is signaled early (hull description, life-support hum) and houses the ritual, but it never pressures choice or alters outcome. The heart-chamber and rift-console are backdrops. The ship "veered toward the breach" in the final line—a passive vehicle, not a resource Elara must manage. Gates: setup ✓, middle (present but inert), closure (cameo). +0.8 early, +0.4 one beat, −0.8 ornamental, −0.6 swappability. ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The timeframe—"after the last human is born" (past birth) / "millennia had passed since that final birth"—sets mood but does not tighten decisions. No clock or urgency narrows Elara's tactics; "hours blurred into starlit cycles" shows elapsed time without cost. The frame is world-building, not pressure. Gates: setup ✓ (opening), middle (no role), closure (no role). +0.8 early, −0.8 ornamental, −1.0 no causal pressure. ~2.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation—"to push open the locked dimension"—is declared early ("her deepest motivation") and shapes the goal across beats (shadow work to generate force, stitching to breach the lock). It drives two beats and the ending action. However, it is never conflicted; no friction between the want and a cost or competing desire appears on the page. Gates: setup ✓, middle ✓, closure ✓. +0.8 early, +1.4 three beats, +1.2 closure, −0.8 no friction/cost, −0.6 told-only. ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The tone—"ghostly resolve"—is named and maintained ("her voice a resolute chime," "her tone remained ghostly resolve," "ghostly resolve cresting into triumph") through turns. It is coherent and modulates (hardening under pressure, cresting at triumph). The phrase "ghostly resolve—unyielding, otherworldly determination" is meta-description, but the tone charges the final image ("still lighter than joy itself, stepped forward"). Gates: setup ✓, middle ✓, closure ✓. +0.8 early, +1.4 sustained, +1.2 closure charge, −0.8 static mood label, −0.3 meta-intrusion. ~5.7.</comment>
