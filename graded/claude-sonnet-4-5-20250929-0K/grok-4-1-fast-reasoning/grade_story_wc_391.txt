<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "sculpt patience from impatience" is present but largely told through abstractions and mentor wisdom rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The botched scout backstory provides history but doesn't create on-page friction; her climb is technically competent without genuine struggle or degraded perception under stress. Internal conflict reads as alternating summary ("wildness longed to charge… yet Kai's words rooted her") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice feels predetermined by the setup rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are present but delayed—WHO (Elara, horizon mapper) and WHERE (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake) arrive early, but WHEN remains vague until "months ago" retrospective. The piece follows a causal lens: ice enables crossing, moon-path tracking times the field weakness, cable severing frees the lowlands. However, the decisive change occurs entirely through Elara's technical success without on-page resistance or cost that alters her options—the viaduct shudders, yokes fall silent, she descends. Closure reads as mission accomplished rather than a reconfiguration with felt price; "impatience sculpted into patience" is asserted in reflection, not demonstrated through a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly rendered with purposeful detail (rain-slicked coils, whale-oil lamps, ice firm enough to cross). Spatial choreography across the lake and up the pylon remains clear. The moon's alignment and the viaduct's post-rain vulnerability function as environmental constraints that enable Elara's timing, charging the final sequence. The setting presses tactics and supplies the closure image, meeting the 9+ quick test in function if not in full irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing the lowlands from neural yokes—is signaled early and drives the action. One meaningful tightening occurs when the moon hits alignment and fields waver, narrowing the window. However, escalation lacks on-page resistance: no guards, no technical failure, no price paid in the climb or severance. The viaduct yields to Elara's vigilance without forcing a trade-off; her success reads as the execution of a plan rather than agency under pressure that forecloses options with visible cost. Coincidence (perfect weather, unguarded access) enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—patience as revolutionary discipline—emerges through Kai's aphorism and Elara's internal monologue but relies heavily on direct statement ("sculpt patience from impatience," "not a blaze, but a patient revolution"). The final image of roots delving deep offers symbolic closure, yet the piece tells its thematic answer rather than letting the ending action reweight it. The prompt-phrase "patient revolution" and "softly purposeful" recur as labels without dramatized friction or cost that would make the insight feel earned rather than declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance; Elara's perceptual filter (flint-sharp eyes, horizon-mapper focus) is established early. Diction occasionally lifts into elevated register ("jagged stars," "oiled veins," "restrained wildness breathed free") that edges toward lyric omniscience but stays within voice-motivated bounds. No head-hopping. Kai's brief dialogue is functional. The piece modulates with pressure in the climb sequence. However, runs of template cadence ("her eyes… scanned," "her fingers itched," "her hands… worked") flatten rhythmic variety in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("moon paths," "restrained wildness," "basalt embrace," "storm restrained," "wheel turning," "magma under basalt," "blade of patience") without pattern-teaching or relief, triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "wildness in her longed to charge" / "wild impulse leashed to precision" and "softly purposeful steps" / "hands, softly purposeful." Template stems recur: "The wildness in her longed… Yet Kai's words rooted… Now, in the sanctuary's core…" Stock metaphors (hearts as storms, patience as blades, roots delving) stack without fresh embodiment. These artifacts appear in peak beats (the climb, the severance) and touch the closure image, warranting the heavier penalty range and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The premise—patient revolutionary uses lunar cycles to disable a control device—synthesizes familiar resistance-narrative elements (oppressive regime, neural control, symbolic liberation) without a non-obvious angle. Elara's horizon-mapping and moon-path tracking offer specificity, but the emotional arc (learning patience) and plot (successful sabotage) follow predictable beats. The magnetic viaduct and basalt sanctuary provide vivid setting detail, yet the transformation test fails: swap names and tech terms, and the core structure (mentor wisdom → cautious infiltration → flawless victory → thematic affirmation) remains template-legible. No bold risk-taking that heightens stakes beyond the expected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's vigilance frames the story (scanning the expanse, timing the moon, scaling the viaduct) and her decision to cross the ice and sever the cables creates the key turn. However, observation dominates early beats; the decisive act arrives only at the climax. Present in setup (first paragraph), middle (sanctuary pacing, chart consultation), and payoff (the climb and severance), satisfying all three gates. Causal pressure is moderate—her mapping constrains timing but does not force visible trade-offs. The final descent and Kai's nod close her arc, but the cost is asserted ("impatience sculpted into patience") rather than demonstrated. Two beats (sanctuary, viaduct), early signal, closure linkage, but swappability is moderate (another careful planner could execute similarly).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The viaduct appears early (first third), is described post-rain with gleaming girders, and returns as the physical site of the climax where Elara scales it and severs cables. Handled across two beats: observation from sanctuary, direct interaction during the climb. Its rain-slicked, frozen state and magnetic hum provide tactile specificity, and the coils' groaning under lunar disruption charges the final action. However, it functions primarily as obstacle and target rather than evolving with reweighted meaning. Present in setup, middle reconnaissance, and payoff, with closure linkage and some irreplaceability (magnetic properties matter), but lacks charged reprise that transforms its symbolic weight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept "patient revolution" is stated explicitly multiple times ("patient revolution," "brew slow like magma," "not a reckless blaze") and structures Elara's internal conflict and Kai's mentorship. It shapes stakes (the need to time the strike rather than rush) and tactics (waiting for moon alignment). Present in setup (Kai's teaching), middle (Elara's restraint), and payoff (the roots delving deep image). However, it is told more than dramatized—Elara's patience is asserted rather than tested through on-page friction or a choice that costs her something immediate. The revolution's outcome (yokes falling silent, minds awakening) happens off-page in the lowlands, not through visible on-page consequence. Functional across beats but replaceable with another virtue (precision, timing) without structural collapse.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Softly purposeful" appears as descriptor for Elara's steps, the rebels' tone, Kai's instruction, and her hands at the climax. It colors her manner but does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost—Elara's soft precision succeeds without friction. The trait is label-only in most mentions ("softly purposeful steps," "hands, softly purposeful") and does not create a visible trade-off (e.g., slowness that risks discovery, gentleness that prevents force). Present in setup and payoff, weak middle development, and no clear cost tied to the attribute itself. Ornamental reprise rather than causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Unyoke" is the climactic action: Elara severs the viaduct's core cables, shattering the magnetic grip and freeing the lowlands. It is prepared by Kai's instruction ("Unyoke them softly purposeful") and executed on-page with physical detail (prying the panel, working latches, severing cables in blue sparks). The action is irreplaceable—this exact verb and physical act define the resolution. Present in setup (Kai's charge), payoff (the severance), but minimal middle development (the climb leads to it but does not rehearse or complicate it). Two beats, early signal, strong closure linkage, high specificity, and the story's title stakes depend on it. Lacks visible cost during the act itself (it succeeds cleanly), preventing top-band score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"By tracking moon paths" is introduced early (Kai's teaching, Elara's charts) and its mechanics matter: she etches arcs on frost-rimed charts, times the viaduct strike to lunar zenith when fields weaken, and confirms alignment from the pylon. The method shapes her preparation and enables the climax. Present in setup (teaching), middle (chart work), and payoff (confirming the moon's crest). However, the mechanics are told more than shown—we do not see her误判 a path or adjust tactics when the method fails. The moon's arrival at true alignment is convenient (no miscalculation, no cloud cover). Functional across beats with early signal and closure participation, but lacks on-page friction or cost tied to the tracking itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary provides shelter, a vantage to observe the viaduct, whale-oil lamps for chart work, and emotional resonance (absorbing sound, fostering "restrained wildness"). The frozen lake supplies the crossing route, its firmness after the freeze enabling the mission's timing. Both setting elements constrain choices (waiting for the freeze, crossing only when ice is solid) and supply resources (sanctuary as base, ice as path). Present in setup (first paragraphs), middle (pacing the sanctuary, preparing charts), and payoff (crossing the ice, returning to Kai). Spatial choreography is clear. The setting presses tactics and charges the final image (basalt embrace, ice-lit vista), meeting the 9+ quick test for environment shaping outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After the lake freezes over" anchors the inciting condition and tightens the window: Elara cannot cross until the ice is firm, and the freeze follows the rain that slicked the viaduct. The timeframe is signaled early and shapes the decision to act ("Now, after the lake's lockdown, the path was clear"). However, time within the night of action is vague—no live clock tracking minutes or patrol schedules that would alter moves. The moon's zenith provides a deadline but arrives without complication. Present in setup and payoff, weak middle tracking, and no visible consequence for mistiming. Functional but not high-pressure; "after" is a gate condition rather than an evolving constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to sculpt patience from impatience" is stated explicitly and drives Elara's internal monologue, Kai's teaching, and the revolution's philosophy. It structures her conflict (wildness versus restraint) and the final affirmation ("impatience sculpted into patience"). Present in setup (Kai's lesson, her pacing), middle (resisting the urge to charge), and payoff (the realization). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through on-page friction—Elara's patience succeeds without visible cost (no moment where wildness would have saved her, no price paid for slowness). The motivation shapes theme more than tactics. Functional across beats but replaceable with another virtue without altering action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Restrained wildness" is established early as the sanctuary's tone and Elara's internal state, recurs in descriptions of wind and her heart, and lands in the final line ("restrained wildness breathed free"). The tone modulates with pressure: calm in the sanctuary, taut during the climb ("wild drum held in check"), released at closure. However, the modulation is asserted more than embodied—sentences remain elevated and figurative throughout without rhythmic contrast that would let wildness break restraint on the page. Present in setup, middle, and payoff with clear reprise, but the tone charges the final image more through label than through sentence-level enactment. Coherent and purposeful, but not indispensable to the action.</comment>
