<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is defined by "cool-headed" repetition rather than contradictory impulses in scene. His motivation is declared (ancient compulsion, fisher's blood) but the choice at closure—securing the echo—feels inevitable without visible internal conflict or foreclosed alternative. The "voiced silence" paradox is intriguing but his interior remains abstract; embodied emotion is sparse. No meaningful cost or path foreclosure is dramatized beyond acquiring the prize.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive early enough. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (sound waves, patterns, imagery). Closure issue: Elias captures the echo and pockets it; the final lines promise future hunts ("The end? No—only the next cast"), which undercuts a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration. No visible cost alters his stance on the page; he simply wins and moves on. The Cost proof test fails—no sentence shows a felt price or foreclosed option at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly rendered with transliterating petals, sonic thorns, and convulsing vines. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The rail spike functions as a tool across beats (forge, piercing waves, hauling). However, setting operates primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain a key choice or charge the final image in a way that would elevate the score into the 9-band. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catch the goddess's echo) is signaled early. The constellations' disruption provides a tightening moment when the echo surges forth. However, escalation lacks protagonist-driven trade-offs; the echo "darted" and Elias "tracked" with "fisher's instinct," then succeeds by voicing silence. No on-page cost or foreclosed option accompanies the capture. The story tells us he "hauled gently" and secured the prize without visible sacrifice or friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of creation, breaking/rebirth, and the fisher's eternal quest emerges from imagery and action. The final vision ("breaking birthed new songs") and promise of "gods unborn" gesture toward complexity. Yet the ending shifts into summary and promise ("one goddess's voice was but the hook's first bite") rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. No non-literal answer or undeniable cost charges the closure; the protagonist simply adds another verse to his legend.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains stable distance and Elias's perceptual filter (fisher's instinct, cool-headed pulse). Diction is elevated and lyric-patterned ("feral lullaby," "transliterating emotions"), which fits the tone but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("voicing silence," "hummed void"). No head-hopping. The prose rhythm is consistent, though the final staccato fragments ("The end? No—only the next cast") feel like conscious stylization rather than voice pressure. Dialogue is absent; no test applies there.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence deploys figurative language ("translucent scrolls transliterating emotions," "thorny echoes that snagged on sonic thorns," "silvery thread...zigzagging wildly"). Density penalty (−0.5) and register drift into elevated abstraction in peak beats (−0.4). Paraphrase loops appear: "The garden hushed, waves settling into reformed patterns, constellations resuming their dreamy prowl" mirrors earlier pattern-language without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the closing lines ("Feral lullaby claimed another verse. / Elias smiled faintly...") stacks short declarative stems (−0.4). Total artifact load: −1.5, and the final-third placement disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and transliterating emotions offer a fresh synthesis; the rail spike and voicing silence are specific, non-obvious choices. However, the fisher-seeks-divine-remnant frame is familiar myth material, and the story does not transform it through unexpected moral calculus or closure irony. The protagonist succeeds without complication, the echo is secured, and the final promise of future hunts resets rather than deepens. Risk-taking in imagery is present but does not heighten stakes or coherence at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his cool-headed trait is repeatedly mentioned. His decision to use voiced silence drives the capture, but the choice feels like application of prior knowledge rather than a turn under pressure. No alternative is weighed on the page; he simply executes. Present in setup, middle beat (tracking), and ending (securing), but swappable with any skilled fisher archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rail spike appears in three beats: salvaged/forged origin, piercing waves without shattering lattices, and trembling/hauling the echo. It is handled and its blunt-hooked shape is specific. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development shows its use. However, it could be replaced by another specialized tool (net, hook, line) with minor edits; its iron properties do not uniquely enable the closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Sleepwalking constellations appear in the middle disruption (Orion's belt twisted, Cassiopeia melted) and are mentioned again at the end ("constellations resuming their dreamy prowl"). They complicate the scene by causing the echo to surge, but their mechanics are ornamental; any cosmic disturbance could serve the same function. No setup in the first third; they arrive after the 40% mark, capping at 4.6, and their role is primarily atmospheric.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Transliteration is described early (joy into golden ripples, sorrow into thorny echoes) and mentioned again when the garden transliterates Elias's resolve into stabilizing azure bands. Setup and closure participation are present. However, the trait is passive world-flavor; it does not constrain Elias's choices or impose a cost. Swappable with "reflects" or "manifests" without altering story logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Zigzag describes the echo's movement in the middle ("zigzagging wildly," "zigzag tightening into hesitant loops") and is reprised in the ending reflection ("dreaming of zigzags yet to chase"). The action is specific to the prey and shapes Elias's tracking. Setup is thin; the term appears first in the goddess's lullaby description, then becomes mechanically important. One key beat (tracking/capture) and a thematic reprise; functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voicing silence is introduced conceptually ("by voicing silence") then dramatized in the capture beat: Elias draws breath and births "not sound but its profound absence—a hummed void, deep as the space between stars." This method is signaled, its paradoxical mechanics matter, and it directly enables the capture. Setup in the first half, decisive middle use, and mentioned again at the end ("voicing silence into the frayed night"). Essential to the capture; removing it breaks the closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sound wave garden is introduced immediately, described with vivid detail (vibrating petals, sonic thorns, convulsing vines), and the garden's reaction to Elias's calm emotion ("transliterating his resolve into stabilizing azure bands") assists the capture. Setup, middle pressure, and closure participation are all present. However, the garden is reactive backdrop; Elias does not navigate constraints or use resources in a way that alters his tactics. Strong atmospheric presence, functional causal role, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Timeframe ("when patterns break themselves") is named at the story's midpoint and triggers the constellations' disruption and the echo's surge. It creates the window for the hunt but does not tighten decisions or impose a ticking clock; Elias completes his task without visible time pressure. The phrase is reprised in the closing meditation ("Patterns would break again"). Functional trigger, lyric reprise, but not a live constraint that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to catch the goddess's echo is declared early ("driven by the ancient compulsion") and remains the dominant stake throughout. The capture is dramatized on the page. However, the motivation is told rather than conflicted; no friction between want and cost appears, and success does not foreclose a path or impose visible sacrifice. Setup, middle pursuit, and ending achievement are clear, but the motivation operates as a quest label rather than a source of internal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Feral lullaby is introduced early (the goddess's voice as "feral lullaby, wild as a beast's throat-rumble yet soothing as a mother's hush") and recurs in the ending ("In the feral lullaby's embrace, he slumbered" / "Feral lullaby claimed another verse"). Tone is coherent—lyric, elevated, paradoxical—but static; it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image with cost. Purposeful reprise without reweighting; lyric label rather than tonal driver.</comment>
