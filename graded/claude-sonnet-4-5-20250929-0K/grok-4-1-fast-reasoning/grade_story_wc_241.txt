<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to honor her father's genius without succumbing to his demons is clear, but her interior life relies heavily on abstract labels ("theoretically rebellious," "lucid contradictions") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final manuscript discovery feels more like an intellectual realization than a choice with visible cost—she decides to "publish it, responsibly," but no on-page action forecloses a path or dramatizes the weight of that commitment. Emotional progression is mostly smooth and rational, lacking the messier ambivalence or self-deception that would give her arc genuine texture under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Elena, library, post-heart-attack) arrive early and remain stable. The subway traversal provides a sequence of moves, but causality is thin: each scrawl directs her to the next location without narrowing options or raising cost, reading more as a treasure hunt than escalating pressure. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (she reframes her father's legacy and commits to teaching), but the cost is asserted rather than shown—no visible trade-off, forfeited path, or felt price on the page. The drive lens wavers between Causal (the scrawls guide her) and Accumulative (clover-melancholy motifs recur), settling into a Hybrid that never quite tightens at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rainwashed library, midsummer clover scent, and subway tunnels are vividly established and return at key moments, charging the final image with sensory continuity. The candle lantern's mica pane is handled across multiple beats, and the "clover-melancholy" air bookends the piece, reweighting the opening mood. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or force a tactical shift—Elena's decisions would unfold the same way in a different setting. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the micro-setting (lantern, scrawls) adds texture, but the world remains more atmospheric than instrumental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elena seeking to understand and responsibly honor her father's legacy—is signaled early and sustained. The subway traversal provides forward motion, but each scrawl simply points to the next step without complicating her path or forcing a trade-off. The climactic discovery of the manuscript does not narrow options or test her commitment; she decides to publish it "responsibly" without dramatizing what she gives up or risks. The escalation reads as a linear reveal rather than a tightening under pressure, and the cost at closure is told rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of lucid contradictions—gambling with probability, rebelling theoretically, widening perspectives responsibly—emerges from the father's character and Elena's reflection. The final image reframes his legacy as "a lucid contradiction made whole," and the clover-melancholy tone charges the ending with bittersweet resonance. However, the theme is often stated directly ("theoretically rebellious," "lucid contradictions," "perspectives widened, responsibly earned") rather than embodied through concrete choices or images. The manuscript discovery invites reflection, but the closing lines veer toward thematic summary ("quiet, clover-melancholy victory") rather than letting the image speak for itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Single third-person POV remains stable, and the narration carries a distinct lyric texture ("clover melancholy," "rainwashed gleam," "mica pane diffusing a warm, flickering glow"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Elena filters the world through probability and her father's shadow—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("embodying lucid contradictions," "quantum superpositions") that feels more authorial than character-particular. The patterned recurrence of prompt phrases ("theoretically rebellious," "lucid contradictions," "traverse," "midsummer," "clover melancholy") creates a slight template cadence that flattens voice under pressure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but the piece carries pervasive text-pattern artifacts: synonym loops ("traverse," "traversal," "traversed" five times), prompt-label repetition ("theoretically rebellious," "lucid contradictions," "clover melancholy," "midsummer" recur mechanically), and template cadence (many sentences open with subject + past-tense verb in a drumbeat pattern). The final third escalates these loops ("Theoretically rebellious no more in isolation," "clover-melancholy victory"), dulling the closure image. Figurative language is dense but occasionally strained ("odds tilt toward hope," "perspectives widened, responsibly earned"). Applying patterned-artifact penalties: baseline −0.8 in Q7 for spread across beats, escalated to −1.2 for touching closure; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the tightened Q7 rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—daughter of a gambler-professor retracing his cryptic scrawls—offers some freshness, and the candle lantern's mica pane is a specific, memorable object. However, the "secret archive reveals father's hidden manuscript" resolution is a familiar template, and the emotional arc (grief → understanding → commitment to honor his legacy) follows a predictable path. The cryptic scrawls function as riddles without stakes, and the final manuscript discovery lands as convenient rather than earned by Elena's prior choices. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −0.7 for template closure not transformed by specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The character (compulsive gambler's probability professor daughter) is present and frames Elena's motivation, but she makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her decision to "publish it, responsibly" at the end is asserted, not dramatized with visible cost. The element shapes thematic context but does not drive key turns. Setup: present. Development: motivation only, no choice. Payoff: thematic presence without causal action. Two gates met, causal pressure weak, closure participation ornamental. Base 5.0 (one turn shaped), −0.8 (swappable motivation could be any bereaved scholar's daughter), round down 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The candle lantern with mica pane appears in at least four beats: Elena pockets it, lights it on the subway, uses it to read scrawls, extinguishes it in the archive, and it returns in the final image ("pocketed the lantern, ready to teach"). The mica pane's "golden filigree" and "warm, flickering glow" charge sensory continuity. However, the lantern does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure—it illuminates but does not alter what Elena discovers or decides. Setup: early. Development: recurring tool. Payoff: charged reprise. All three gates; base 6.0 + 0.9 (two beats) + 0.5 (closure linkage, weak) − 0.6 (ornamental use, no causal pressure) = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The core concept (lucid contradictions) is named repeatedly and frames the father's character and Elena's reflection. It shapes thematic resonance and is woven into the final image ("a lucid contradiction made whole"). However, it does not constrain on-page choices or alter tactics—Elena interprets the concept intellectually but never faces a live contradiction that forces a trade-off. Setup: present thematically. Development: label-only. Payoff: thematic claim in ending. Two gates (setup, payoff); no causal pressure. Base 5.0 (shapes theme) + 0.3 (closure linkage, thematic only) − 0.3 (label-only, no friction) = 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The attribute (theoretically rebellious) is mentioned three times as a label ("Her motivation burned quietly: to widen perspectives responsibly… theoretically rebellious nature stirring," "Theoretically rebellious, she smiled faintly," "Theoretically rebellious no more in isolation"). It characterizes Elena's self-concept but does not constrain or enable a visible on-page action with cost. Setup: present as label. Development: repetition without friction. Payoff: thematic mention. Cap at 3.8 for swappable label that could be edited to "intellectually defiant" or similar without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The action (traverse) is threaded throughout: Elena traverses the city's underbelly, the concourse, the sprawl, and the forgotten stairwell, and the final image emphasizes "perspectives widened, responsibly earned through shadowed seats and flickering mica light." The traversal structures the entire middle and links to closure. However, each segment is a simple next-step rather than a narrowing choice, so causal pressure is moderate. Setup: early signal. Development: two distinct beats (subway, stairwell). Payoff: closure image. All three gates; base 6.0 + 0.9 (two beats) + 0.8 (closure linkage) − 0.4 (linear sequence, low friction) = 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The method (interpreting cryptic scrawls on subway seats) is signaled early and drives the middle sequence. Elena reads at least four scrawls, each one directing her to the next location and layering thematic meaning. The scrawls enable the traversal but do not constrain her choices—she never misinterprets one or faces a cost for following them. Setup: early. Development: shapes two beats (subway, concourse). Payoff: method leads to the archive. All three gates; base 6.0 + 0.9 (two beats) + 0.3 (enables tactics without friction) − 0.7 (no cost or reversal tied to method) = 6.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The rainwashed library at midsummer bookends the piece, and the "clover scent" and "midsummer dusk" charge the opening and closing images. The library's "hidden wing" provides the space for the manuscript discovery. However, the setting does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome—Elena's decisions would unfold identically in any archive. Setup: early, vivid. Development: static backdrop. Payoff: spatial return with sensory reprise. Two gates (setup, payoff); lyric resonance present. Base 5.5 (reprise reweights mood) + 0.8 (closure linkage, sensory) − 0.4 (ornamental, no tactical constraint) = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe (after the heart attack) is established in the opening ("three weeks prior") and frames Elena's grief and motivation. However, time does not tighten decisions or create urgency—the piece spans an unspecified duration (subway journey, archive discovery) without a clock that alters moves. Setup: present. Development: static context. Payoff: no time pressure at closure. One gate (setup); cap at 4.6 for missing development and payoff. Adjust: +0.2 for thematic framing of grief = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation (to widen perspectives responsibly) is stated early ("her motivation burned quietly") and returns at closure ("perspectives widened, responsibly earned"). It frames Elena's stance and final commitment to publish the manuscript. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no on-page moment shows her weighing responsibility against risk or impulse. Setup: early signal. Development: framing only, no friction. Payoff: thematic closure claim. Two gates (setup, payoff); base 5.5 − 0.3 (told motivation without scene friction) + 0.4 (closure thematic linkage) = 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tone (clover melancholy) is established early ("faint, melancholy scent of crushed clover") and recurs in the middle ("Clover melancholy settled deeper") and ending ("clover-melancholy glow," "quiet, clover-melancholy victory," "clover scent rising pure"). The tone modulates with pressure and charges the final image with bittersweet resonance. It is coherent through turns and not static. Setup: early. Development: recurs with mood shift. Payoff: final-image charge. All three gates; base 6.0 + 0.4 (one beat) + 0.8 (closure linkage) − 0.5 (label repetition mechanical in final third) = 6.7.</comment>
