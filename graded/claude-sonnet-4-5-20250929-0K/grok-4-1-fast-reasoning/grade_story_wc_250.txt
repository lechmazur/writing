<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated but rarely tested through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her "silent empathy" and "spiralingly calm" read as fixed labels rather than embodied traits that constrain action. Umbra remains abstract—hollow eyes, inky folds—without internal contradiction or a visible cost that forecloses a path. The weaving sequence proceeds without error or trade-off, flattening the sense of earned transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: patterns build through the shutter weave and mirror-reflected starlight. Orientation anchors arrive late (who/where clear by ~150 words; "when" remains vague throughout). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Umbra "softened, edges blurring into twilight harmony"—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized; no on-page choice or forfeiture makes the transformation legible with felt consequence. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and cost-proof failure (−0.6) apply.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, boathouse shutters, dental mirror, and canal surface are consistently present and sensory detail is vivid. However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices or alter tactics; the shutters and mirror function as tools for spectacle rather than as pressure points. Spatial choreography remains clear. The micro-setting (shutters, mirror) charges the final image but does not force a trade-off, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching darkness the value of stars—is signaled early but remains abstract and declarative. Umbra's presence poses no active opposition or escalating cost; the weaving proceeds without setback, error, or tactical adjustment. The ending asserts transformation ("Umbra's form softened") without an on-page reversal or choice that narrows options. Agency and felt price are absent, failing the escalation test under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme—balance between darkness and light, the necessity of contrast—emerges through the shutter patterns and mirror work. Yet the final image ("Umbra lingered, no longer devourer but guardian") states the lesson rather than earning it through earned friction or trade-off. "To teach darkness the value of stars" functions as a prompt label, not a dramatized question with a non-literal answer. Subtext in gesture is present but the closure moralizes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV anchors to Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout—"spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "celestial fire"—creating a stable, purposeful voice. However, register remains uniformly ornate even in high-pressure beats, flattening emotional modulation. Elara's perceptual signature (silent guardian, water-sworn) is consistent but does not degrade or sharpen under stress. Filter verbs ("sensing," "conveyed") appear frequently without voice-motivated necessity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is extreme: nearly every sentence in the weaving sequence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("vortex of tranquility," "spiralingly calm intensifying into a hypnotic core," "tendrils of darkness recoiling"). Mixed metaphors appear ("spiralingly calm" as vortex, "stillwater tension coiling tighter"). Template cadence and paraphrase loops proliferate: "Elara met... sensing... understanding bloomed... Elara gestured... began the action... lifted the dental mirror... tilting it precisely." Penalty pack (−1.2): density without taught pattern, mixed vehicles, template stems across multiple beats. Artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The silent-guardian-teaches-shadow frame follows a familiar teaching/redemption template. Elara's weaving with shutters and a dental mirror offers specific detail, yet the action—light-patterns transforming darkness—echoes common metaphor without a non-obvious inflection. The ending ("Umbra... forever altered") delivers predictable resolution. Umbra's abstraction and the declarative motivation prevent the synthesis from feeling inevitable in hindsight. No bold risk elevates stakes or complicates the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and performs the weaving action, but her choices do not create turns; she executes a plan without error, adaptation, or cost. Observation and execution dominate; no on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. Missing middle development and closure participation as decision-maker. Late penalties and swappability reduce the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dental mirror appears in setup (lifted from pocket ~midpoint), is used to reflect starlight into the shutter patterns (one beat), and slips back at the end. Two touches across beats, with causal role in amplifying the weave. However, it does not return with reweighted meaning or constrain a choice; another reflective surface could substitute with minor edits. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Silent empathy" is named early ("Elara met Umbra's hollow eyes with silent empathy") and echoed in the final paragraph, but it does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. It functions as thematic label rather than a pressure that changes options. Umbra's transformation is asserted, not earned through empathic friction or cost. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Spiralingly calm" is mentioned three times as a label ("her presence spiralingly calm," "her spiralingly calm intensifying") but never constrains or enables an action with visible cost. No trade-off or vulnerability surfaces; Elara's state remains static and decorative. Label-only use; missing all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Weaving is signaled early, occupies the central sequence, and drives the teaching action. The shutter patterns and their progression (single stars → constellations → spiral galaxy) structure the middle beats and the ending references the completed weave. However, the action proceeds without setback or adaptation; swapping "weave" for "compose" or "project" would require only minor edits. Essential across beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Creating patterns with shutters" is signaled in setup, detailed across multiple beats ("opening and closing them in rhythmic sequence," "shutters snapping like whispers"), and present at closure ("shutters falling still"). The mechanics matter: shutter configurations catch lantern glow and create shadows. However, the method does not constrain Elara or impose a cost; another pattern-making tool could serve the same role. Two gates met, functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The cobalt dock is anchored early, described across beats (planks, puddles, boathouse, canal surface), and referenced at closure ("cobalt dock after rain"). Atmosphere is vivid. However, the setting does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome; it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. Present in all three gates but lacks causal pressure on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Within the edge of a half-spoken secret" appears twice as atmospheric phrase but does not function as a tightening clock or timeframe that alters decisions. No sense of urgency, deadline, or tracked duration. The weaving unfolds at narrative convenience. Ornamental; missing all functional gates.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To teach darkness the value of stars" is stated in setup and drives Elara's action throughout. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or visible friction. No cost or trade-off tests her desire; the weaving succeeds without setback. Present in beats but lacks on-page dramatization of want versus obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Stillwater tension" is named three times and modulates slightly ("coiling tighter," "resolving into profound peace"). Tone remains lyrically elevated and calm throughout, with minor intensification during the weaving. Coherent but static; no sharp cadence shift or tonal friction that charges the final image beyond the established mood. One mood sustained rather than dynamically modulated.</comment>
