<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper remains a static observer whose "loose grip on reality" functions as descriptive label rather than a trait that constrains choice under pressure. His descent and arrival at the refuge unfold without internal conflict or competing impulses; the resolution merely fulfills a declared vow rather than emerging from dramatized struggle. The spectral figure never makes a difficult choice that forecloses a path with visible cost—he follows the swan's method unopposed, and the ending grants him "eternity's truest ledger" without sacrifice or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers motifs (swan, folds, silence, crumbling peace) toward a final tableau. Orientation anchors appear late: the keeper's identity, the library's nature, and his purpose emerge gradually across the first third without spatial grounding. The closure offers Conceptual Repricing—the obsidian refuge reweights "crumbling peace" as regenerative rather than decay—but the cost remains abstract; no on-page forfeiture or constraint charges the final image. Escalation is elided: the "drift of untold days" compresses the burrowing into summary, and the refuge simply "parts" without resistance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and layered (bioluminescent fungi, vine-choked tomes, obsidian refuge absorbing light), and the overgrown library supplies texture throughout. The underground river and obsidian refuge anchor the final third spatially. However, the environment never constrains a choice: the ground "yields unnaturally" and the stone "parts" without threshold, eliminating friction. The micro-setting (the swan, the alcove, the ledge) is descriptive rather than tactical, preventing entry to the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to witness change without judgment"—remains declared rather than tested. No antagonist, obstacle, or internal conflict opposes the keeper's journey; the earth and refuge cooperate, and the swan's method succeeds without reversal. The piece lacks a meaningful tightening or turn that narrows options: the keeper begins with his vow and concludes with its fulfillment, unchanged. Cost is implied thematically (endless solitude) but never lands as a visible forfeiture or trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—observing entropy without judgment, finding peace in decay—emerges from recurring images (crumbling shelves, regenerative silence, the swan's folds) rather than overt statement. The obsidian refuge's "regenerative silence" offers a non-literal answer to the keeper's quest, and the final line's "overgrown and profound" reweights the opening's decay motif. However, the resolution is frictionless: no ambiguity, counter-reading, or cost complicates the thematic payoff, and the keeper's "eternity's truest ledger" risks sounding like a declared moral rather than an earned image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and an elevated, lyric register ("spectral figure," "verdant decay," "obedient pages"). Perceptual signature is present but generic: the keeper notices vines, scrolls, and stone with high-frequency diction that reads as narrator ornament rather than character-specific texture. Purposeful compression and patterned syntax (parallelism, clause stacks) establish a deliberate rhythm, yet the voice lacks idiosyncratic coloring—diction could belong to any ethereal archivist. No dialogue appears; internal thought is sparse and abstract ("recognized its call immediately").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout (pages as "obedient," soil "parting like obedient pages," refuge "gleaming like congealed night"), creating coherent texture but risking overwriting in non-peak beats. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "He gathered no tools… he followed… he began… he chanted" runs four consecutive subject-verb openers without variation. Minor paraphrase loop: "crumbling peace" recurs six times with minimal reweighting until the ending. Information density is moderate; several lines (e.g., "Here, the chronicle keeper dwelled…") summarize rather than propel. Clarity remains high; no causality breaks or spatial confusion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The premise—mystical librarian seeks transcendent silence via origami cipher—synthesizes familiar portal-quest and hermit-ascetic tropes without a non-obvious twist. The swan's "cryptic folds" method is invoked but not meaningfully constrained or subverted; the keeper's "loose grip on reality" enables rather than complicates passage. Sensory particulars (bioluminescent fungi, petrified scrolls, obsidian absorbing light) elevate texture, and the lyric commitment is consistent. The ending's reconfiguration of decay as regeneration is thematically coherent but emotionally predictable; no risk or surprise charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper is present throughout and frames the journey, but his choices are passive: he "unearthed," "recognized," "resolved," "followed," and "entered" without opposition or reversal. His vow drives the plot as declared intent rather than dramatized conflict. No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost; the swan's method succeeds unopposed, and the refuge grants him his goal. Swappable with any seeker archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The obsidian refuge appears in the swan's vision (midpoint), anchors the underground arrival, and houses the final tableau. It supplies the story's closure image (regenerative silence, self-healing pages, vines that cradle) and participates in three distinct beats: vision, emergence, and habitation. The refuge's properties (absorbing light, parting for the seeker, mending frayed nerves) are specific and irreplaceable. However, it does not constrain choice—it cooperates fully—so cost linkage is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Regenerative silence" is named in the vision, realized in the refuge, and mentioned in the final paragraph. It shapes the keeper's motivation and reweights "crumbling peace" at closure, supplying thematic coherence. However, it functions as a thematic claim rather than a mechanical stake: the silence does not constrain or enable a choice under pressure, and the keeper simply receives it without friction. Present across setup, middle, and payoff, but integration is conceptual rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is stated twice (opening and midpoint) as a label that justifies the keeper's receptivity to the swan and his ability to burrow "without tools." The trait is told rather than shown through contradictory action or tradeoff; no scene demonstrates what the loose grip costs or enables under pressure. It does not constrain a choice or recur with reweighted meaning at closure. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Burrow" is signaled in the swan's vision, executed on-page across multiple beats (pressing palms, delving through strata, emerging at the river), and directly enables the keeper's arrival at the refuge. The action is specific (geometry-guided descent through catacomb layers) and drives two major turns: commitment and breakthrough. However, the burrowing succeeds without reversal or cost; the ground yields "unnaturally," and the keeper emerges "renewed" rather than depleted. The action is central but not irreplaceable—any descent method could serve with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The origami swan appears early (first third), its "cryptic folds" provide the burrowing method (geometry chanted "under his breath"), and the refolded swan rests on the ledge in the final paragraph, awaiting "another seeker." The method shapes three beats: discovery, descent choreography, and closure reprise. However, the folds' mechanics are abstract—no fold-pattern constrains or complicates the keeper's descent—so the swan functions more as symbolic key than tactical pressure. Lyric resonance (first → last) lifts the score within the 5–6 band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The overgrown library anchors the opening, supplies the alcove where the swan is found, and frames the keeper's prior existence. Its vine-choked shelves and "crumbling peace" motif recur in the refuge's cradle-vines, creating thematic continuity. The library is present in setup and revisited at closure ("catacombs held their secret"), and its decay drives the keeper's quest for regenerative silence. However, the library does not constrain a mid-journey choice or alter tactics; it functions as framing setting rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Across the drift of untold seasons" appears in the opening motivation and the final habitation ("Seasons drifted—fungi blooming unseen"). The timeframe establishes the keeper's patience and the refuge's timelessness, thematically resonant with "crumbling peace." However, time does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the keeper's journey unfolds without clock pressure, and the ending's "seasons unending" dissolves rather than crystallizes stakes. Present in setup and payoff but passive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To witness change without judgment" is stated early as the keeper's "solemn motivation," drives his resolution to seek the refuge, and recurs in the ending ("he witnessed without judgment"). The motivation frames the quest and participates in all three gates. However, it is told rather than tested: no scene forces the keeper to choose between judgment and neutrality, and no conflicting desire complicates his vow. The motivation functions as thematic anchor rather than dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Crumbling peace" is named in the opening ("The tone of his existence"), recurs in the refuge ("crumbling peace amplified"), and charges the final line ("crumbling peace eternal"). The tone is coherent across beats: shelves sagging, pages yellowing, vines cradling, silence mending. It modulates subtly from decay-as-loss (library) to decay-as-renewal (refuge), supporting the Conceptual Repricing at closure. The tone does not tension or break under pressure—consistent serenity throughout—but its thematic reweighting at the end demonstrates purposeful integration.</comment>
