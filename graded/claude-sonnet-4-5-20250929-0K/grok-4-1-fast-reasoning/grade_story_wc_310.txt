<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is asserted repeatedly ("wavelength align with purpose," "quietly enthusiastic") but rarely embodied through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. The coins serve as a decision mechanism, yet the stakes of each cast feel ornamental rather than genuinely constraining—no visible cost attaches to choosing one burst over another. Internal conflict is absent; she proceeds methodically without doubt testing her commitment until the final broadcast, which reads more as fulfillment than earned transformation. Embodied emotion is thin: "quiet enthusiasm blooming inwardly" labels rather than dramatizes her state under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is severely delayed: who Elara is, where precisely she sits in the cosmology, and what immediate danger she faces remain vague past the 120-word mark, incurring the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0. The drive lens is ambiguous—elements of accumulative texture (amber motifs, static bursts) compete with causal claims (coins "guide," bursts "distill"), yet no clear dominant lens emerges by midpoint or at closure. The ending offers a micro turn (beacon ignites, universe stirs) but the cost is conceptual and oblique; the image of "newborn purpose" does not reweigh prior material with felt sacrifice or foreclosed path. No on-page decisive change or visible cost anchors the closure under any single lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck is vividly rendered with selective detail (brass orrery, amber resin, frozen light) and recurs across beats, creating a coherent micro-setting. The amber material constrains Elara's recording method (she etches onto shards), meeting the 9+ test's requirement that setting shape a choice. However, the spatial choreography remains static—Elara sits, casts coins, listens—without movement or environmental evolution that would charge the final image. Sensory selection leans heavily visual; the contracted universe's tactile or auditory pressure on her body is mostly asserted rather than shown.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—wavelength alignment to avoid dissolution—is signaled early but never tested by a choice that forecloses a live option. Elara's coin casts select which burst to prioritize, yet no wrong choice appears plausible; the coins are "infallible arbiters," draining agency. Stellar doubt is declared as external threat but does not manifest as internal pressure forcing a trade-off. The final broadcast reverses the tide, but this resolution arrives without visible cost: no stamina drained, no rival path abandoned, no price paid on the page. One deepening occurs (core burst reveals doubt as catalyst), meeting minimal escalation for this length, but the cost remains conceptual and unanchored.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme—purpose versus doubt, reversal as survival—emerges from the backwards prophecy conceit and recurs in image (stellar doubt, rebirth arcs). The ending avoids overt moralizing, yet it also stops short of a resonant non-literal answer: the beacon "stirs" the universe and Elara smiles, a tidy satisfaction that does not reweigh prior ambiguity. The prophecy's inverted structure is asserted more than dramatized; we are told it promises alignment but never see the cost of misalignment tested in a concrete choice. Subtext is thin; gesture and silence yield to direct statement ("her purpose to broadcast the distilled reversal").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but perceptual signature is generic: Elara notices what the plot requires (coins, bursts, visions) without character-specific bias or idiosyncratic filter. Diction drifts into elevated register ("cast lots decision maker," "wavelength align") that reads more like prompt echo than lived interior voice. No dialogue is present to test subtext or voice distinction. Psychic distance remains uniform; no modulation under pressure. The prose often tells internal state ("quietly enthusiastic," "stellar doubt clawed at her") rather than showing embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Prompt-label phrases ("cast lots decision maker," "quietly enthusiastic," "wavelength align with purpose," "understanding static bursts") recur verbatim across multiple beats, creating paraphrase loops and register drift that dull immediacy. Template cadence is visible: "She [verb], [modifier]" stems repeat without variation. Figurative density is high ("ambered observatory," "stellar doubt," "backwards prophecy") but metaphors often collide (amber as preservation, stellar doubt as gravitational hesitation) without coherent vehicle. Filter verbs stack ("she saw," "she listened," "she murmured") in high-pressure moments. Information density is moderate; many lines restate the prophecy's backward arc without advancing new detail. The artifacts touch the closure beat ("her wavelengths synced at last"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core premise—backwards prophecy decoded via coin-casting in a post-contraction universe—is conceptually ambitious but executed through familiar mystical-seer tropes without fresh transformation. The coins, static bursts, and orrery function as generic divination props; their specific properties do not drive unexpected turns. Elara's method and stakes could transfer to any "lone oracle deciphers cosmic truth" frame with minor edits. Emotional specificity is absent: her enthusiasm and purpose are labeled, not particularized. The ending offers cosmic hope without the friction of a non-obvious moral calculus or lived cost that would anchor the reversal in human stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Cast lots decision maker: Present throughout; Elara casts coins three times to choose burst sequences. However, the decisions are guided by "infallible" coins, draining protagonist agency—each cast is described as decreeing the correct choice rather than forcing Elara into a dilemma. The method shapes tactics (which burst to prioritize) but does not create a visible cost or alter the ending's outcome in a way that feels earned by her judgment. Setup gate met, development gate met (coin casts in middle section), payoff gate weak (final broadcast is decided by her, but the coins' role in that climactic choice is summary-only). Swappable with "oracle consults runes" or similar with minor edits. Band: functional but replaceable, one-beat causal work, capped by low agency and weak payoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Collection of foreign coins: Setup gate met (introduced early, "fingers tracing"), development gate met (cast three times across middle beats to select bursts), payoff gate met (final cast confirms her as fulcrum before beacon ignition). The coins constrain her decision method and recur with reweighted meaning (from memory tokens to divinatory arbiters). However, their specific properties—Andromedan, Sirius, Pleiades origins—are ornamental; any set of lots would function identically. The ending links them to her purpose, but the cost is conceptual rather than tied to the coins' unique irreplaceability. Band: shapes two beats and contributes to closure, but swappability and lack of charged specificity limit score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Backwards prophecy: Setup gate met (introduced early, haunts her visions), development gate strong (she distills bursts in reverse temporal order, working backward from rebirth to contraction), payoff gate met (the full prophecy is revealed and broadcast at closure). The concept shapes her tactics (which burst to decode, how to reverse flow) and alters the universe's fate. Causal pressure is moderate: the backward method constrains her sequence but does not force a trade-off or visible cost on the page. The prophecy's mechanics are asserted more than dramatized—how reversal works remains abstract. Band: essential across beats and ending, with solid causal work but limited irreplaceability (could be "forward incantation" with edits).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Quietly enthusiastic: Label-only. The trait is asserted five times ("quietly enthusiastic amid the hush," "her quiet enthusiasm a steady pulse," "Quietly enthusiastic, Elara spilled," "quiet enthusiasm blooming inwardly," "With quiet enthusiasm cresting") but never embodied in a micro-choice or action that incurs cost. It does not constrain behavior—Elara proceeds methodically without the trait shaping a dilemma or tactic. Setup gate met (present early), development and payoff gates failed (ornamental mentions without pressure). Band: present but decorative, no causal work, no cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Distill: Setup gate met (introduced early as her method of capturing prophecy essence), development gate strong (she distills multiple bursts across middle beats, each distillation a discrete action), payoff gate met (final distillation reveals full prophecy and enables the broadcast). The action drives two major beats and is causally active at closure. However, the distillation process is vague—alchemical ink on amber shard is mentioned but the mechanics are summary-only, and the cost (time, effort, risk of misinterpretation) is told rather than shown. Band: essential across beats and ending, solid beat involvement and closure linkage, but weak specificity and summary-only execution limit high-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Understanding static bursts: Setup gate met (receiver activated early, bursts described as remnants of primordial radiation), development gate met (Elara listens and interprets bursts across middle section), payoff gate weak (final core burst is key, but "understanding" as method is asserted—"she discerned patterns"—not dramatized with visible struggle or cost). The method shapes her attempts but is swappable with "decoding transmissions" or similar. No unique mechanics: we are told she has the method but not shown its constraints or how it could fail. Band: functional, one-beat causal work, capped by late full payoff and lack of irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ambered observatory deck: Setup gate met (vivid description early, walls glow eternal amber, telescopes encased), development gate met (deck is the physical anchor where all action occurs; she spills coins on it, activates orrery, writes on amber shard), payoff gate strong (deck pulses with newborn purpose in final image, recharging prior material). The setting constrains her recording method (amber shard) and supplies the orrery. Spatial choreography is static but coherent; the amber recurs with reweighted meaning at closure. Band: essential across beats and ending, with environment shaping tactics and closure linkage, but limited causal pressure (she could perform the ritual anywhere with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>After the universe contracts: Setup gate met (timeframe anchored early, universe compressed to flickering ember). Development and payoff gates weak: the contraction is backdrop, not a ticking clock. No urgency visible—Elara works methodically without time pressure, and the "contraction's cusp" is retrospective rather than immediate. The timeframe supplies thematic context (reversal from final rebirth) but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Band: present and logically consistent, but replaceable with "edge of collapse" or similar; no live clock that constrains choices on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>To wavelength align with purpose: Setup gate met (motivation stated early, "her motivation burned deep"), development gate met (she pursues alignment through coin casts and distillation), payoff gate met (final line: "wavelengths synced at last"). The desire drives the plot arc. However, it is told-only—no friction between this want and a competing fear or cost is dramatized. The stakes of misalignment (dissolution) are asserted but never tested in a choice. "Purpose" remains abstract; no visible sacrifice or trade-off anchors her final alignment. Band: shapes the arc and closure, but lack of embodied conflict and conceptual abstraction limit score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Stellar doubt: Setup gate met (introduced early as pervasive threat, claimed bold first), development gate moderate (referenced as external antagonist and internal specter), payoff gate weak (doubt "trembles" at the ending but is not modulated or charged by Elara's action in the final image; it simply recedes). Tone is static cosmic melancholy throughout, without modulation under pressure—Elara's enthusiasm does not tension the doubt. The element reads as thematic flavor rather than a constraint on her choices. Band: functional across beats but ornamental, no causal work at closure, tone does not charge the final image.</comment>
