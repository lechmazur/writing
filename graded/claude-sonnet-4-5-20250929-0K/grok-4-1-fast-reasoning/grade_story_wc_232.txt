<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias remains a label rather than a lived character; his interiority consists of exposition ("his life was a solitary archive") and abstraction ("quiet despair") without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final transformation—"loneliness ebbed"—is asserted in summary rather than earned through on-page choice with visible cost. Embodied emotion is nearly absent; no moment shows his body or perception degrading under the cavern's pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The Doorway moment lacks on-page cost: Elias sees visions and emerges "transformed" but no choice, renunciation, or endurance forecloses a live path with felt consequence. The causality is linear (chip→cavern→doorway) but the closure unit is a montage summary ("lingering promise dissolved," "loneliness ebbed") rather than a dramatized decisive change. The lens reads Causal in the approach but the ending shifts to thematic summary without demonstrating what Elias sacrifices or changes to "find home."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The blooming cavern is vividly rendered with bioluminescent moss and nectar-scented blooms; sensory detail is selective and tied to midsummer's heat. However, the environment remains largely decorative—Elias moves through it without spatial constraints altering his choices until the rising creek, which appears and recedes without meaningful pressure on his final decision. The matrix chip's warming and glimmering charge the final image, elevating micro-setting function.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring his father's promise—is signaled early but never tested by a live on-page trade-off. The rising creek provides urgency in the cavern sequence, yet Elias never sacrifices, risks, or loses anything concrete to reach the Doorway; the ants' trail is followed without error or cost. The closure asserts fulfillment ("promise dissolved") without showing what path was foreclosed or what price was paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of solitary obsession versus connection emerges, but the ending articulates it directly: "Doorway had opened not outward, but inward," "ants' trail a metaphor for persistent seeking," and "found home not in stone, but in connection's bloom." These are thesis statements rather than images that reweight prior material. The final paragraph moralizes instead of trusting the cavern moment to resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited focalization through Elias without head-hopping. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register ("cartographic ghosts," "empirically intuitive clarity," "rhythmic underscore to renewal") that sits uneasily with a lonely map dealer's plausible lexicon. Perceptual signature is weak—his "mapmaker's cipher" eye is told more than shown in selective noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Pervasive overwriting and scaffold bloat flatten momentum: "testament to paths untaken, fueling his isolation"; "the creek's rise now a rhythmic underscore to renewal"; "its secrets spent." Paraphrase loops recur ("loneliness ebbed; maps now shared stories, not just sold solitude" restates the prior transformation claim). Figurative density peaks in high-pressure beats ("living compass," "hymn to decisions embraced") without pattern-teaching, violating the overwriting check. Template cadence appears in the final section with repetitive conceptual closures across four consecutive summary sentences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core premise—following ants to a mystical threshold—echoes quest-for-insight templates without fresh synthesis. The "empirically intuitive" trait and the chip's alignment with the atlas read as convenient rather than inevitable; Elias's transformation lacks a non-obvious moral calculus or lived specificity that would ground the familiar arc. The ants as guides and the blooming cavern are vivid details but their combination does not constitute a transformative angle on the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elias as lonely map dealer frames his isolation and shop context early and returns at closure when he opens the shop to villagers. However, his dealer expertise shapes only the initial chip analysis; the cavern journey and Doorway encounter do not rely on his map knowledge in ways that alter tactics or outcome. Present in setup and payoff with weak middle development.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The matrix chip appears early, drives the middle journey (its spiral matches the atlas, guides him to the cavern, warms and glimmers as a living compass), and is present at closure ("dimming in his pocket, its secrets spent"). It touches three beats and provides causal pressure, but its swappability is moderate—any mystical artifact with a matching pattern could serve the same function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The father's lingering promise is seeded in the opening and explicitly resolved at closure ("lingering promise dissolved in fulfillment"). It motivates the journey and stakes, but on the page it functions more as thematic anchor than lived friction—Elias never wavers or pays a visible cost tied to honoring versus abandoning the vow. Present in all three gates but causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Empirically intuitive" is labeled early ("intuition, backed by such evidence, had rarely steered him wrong") and invoked again when the chip warms and ants appear. Yet it never constrains or costs him—he simply follows the trail without error or tradeoff. The trait remains a descriptor rather than a choice-shaping force; removing it would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Glimmer" drives the climax: the chip begins to glimmer, illuminates the ants' trail, intensifies, and reveals the Doorway's radiant seam. It appears in setup (chip design) and payoff (Doorway discovery) with middle function (guiding through the fissure). The glimmer is specific to the chip and cavern interaction, though a similar luminous cue could substitute with moderate rewriting.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Following ants home is named as Elias's chosen method midway and executed across the fissure sequence; the ants lead him to the hidden seam. It appears in middle development and payoff, shaping the final approach. However, the method is introduced late (past the 40% mark) and feels convenient—ants could be replaced by another trail marker (glowing fungi, water seepage) without deep structural change.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The blooming cavern at midsummer is established early, provides the arena for the entire second half, and its seasonal blooms and rising water pressure Elias's moves ("forcing him to move swiftly before flood claimed the chamber"). The midsummer heat amplifies the flora, and the environment's beauty charges the final Doorway image. Essential across setup, development, and payoff with clear causal contribution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The rising creek is seeded early ("creek beyond the village began to swell") and recurs as urgency in the cavern ("waters lapping at ledge edges"). It pressures Elias to move quickly, but the deadline never bites—he completes his search and emerges without losing ground or altering his plan. Present in setup and development but closure participation is summary-only ("creek's echo a distant hymn").</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The motivation to find the Doorway is explicit from paragraph three and drives the entire journey. However, it is never conflicted—Elias does not weigh this vow against another live desire or cost on the page. At closure the promise is simply "dissolved in fulfillment" without friction. Present across all three gates but lacks on-page tension between want and price.</comment>
