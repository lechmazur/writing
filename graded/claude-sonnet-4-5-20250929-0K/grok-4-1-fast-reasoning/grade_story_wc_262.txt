<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find where "unused love is stored" ties to her fiancé's death, but the connection feels thin—her choices in the booth (touching the film, prying the panel) read more as passive reception than decisions under pressure. The psychometry visions are vivid but largely delivered to her rather than wrestled from conflicting impulses. Interiority leans on label-speak ("unused love," "incubating") without embodied contradiction; her final descent with "unused love now incubating within her" asserts change rather than earning it through a visible renunciation or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—layers of ghostly lyrics, film-strip memories, and spatial reconstruction build density toward the final projection moment. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara rewinds the film, projects the reunited couple, and smiles into the beam, reweighting her understanding of "unused love" as spatially stored. Cost is largely conceptual (she keeps the knowledge, returns the letters), felt rather than physical, but the final image does reconfigure prior material. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the escalation is mild—discovery rather than decision-narrowing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The projection booth is textured with brass gears, cobwebs, dust, stained-glass marquee, and a hidden panel—enough to ground the micro-setting. Spatial detail ("ducts twisting like veins," "tin box wedged in the panel") serves Elara's spatially imaginative trait and enables the discovery. The booth's architecture is explicitly framed as a vessel for emotions, which charges the final projection image. Thunder and velvet seats below add atmosphere. The booth constrains her search and provides the hidden compartment, meeting the micro-setting standard for this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and shapes Elara's climb and contact with the film. Pressure accumulates through sensory layering (lyrics searching, thunder syncing, visions blooming) but there is no visible tightening or choice that forecloses an option. She finds the box unopposed; the discovery itself is the event. The "unused love" migrates into her without cost or struggle, and the final projection is resolution without trade-off. One deepening (discovery of Eliza's letters and their spatial echo) is present, but escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency or narrowing options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—love stored not in objects but in spatial architecture and projection—emerges from the booth's design, the film strip, and Elara's visions, cohering at the final projection. The core concept (goodbye letters, unused love) integrates with her fiancé's half-spoken vow and the theater's collective longing. Subtext operates in the lyrics' search for tune and the booth's "eternal creak." The ending offers a resonant image (light spilling, couple reunited on celluloid, "goodbye letters transformed to hello") that reweights prior material without moralizing. Minor thematic echo: "unused love now incubating within her" verges on stating the thesis but stays within metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric ("spatially imaginative," "emulsions yielded Eliza's script," "midwifed revelation") but registers as authorial ornament rather than Elara's thought texture under pressure. Perceptual signature is present (spatial mapping, crystal gazer's vision) yet the prose does not shift rhythm or vocabulary when stakes rise. The opening lines anchor voice, and the final image ("smiled into the beam") closes cleanly. Filter verbs ("visualized," "touching them triggered cascade") are acceptable but stack without urgency. Distance is controlled, but voice lacks character-specific idiom that would distinguish this narrator from a generic lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "brass gears whispered like conspirators," "celluloid brittle as autumn leaves," "ducts twisting like veins," "emotions spatially imaginative minds could reclaim." In peak beats (film contact, panel prying, final projection) metaphor and elevated register ("gestate," "incubating," "midwifed") persist without modulation, triggering overwriting penalty (−0.5). Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "She" or "The" in the middle section ("She closed," "She needed," "She visualized," "She pried," "She'd return," "She smiled"). Paraphrase loop: "unused love" recurs four times across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Information density is moderate; some lines advance action, but several ("ethereal strands weaving through velvet seats below, humming incompleteness") ornament without plot work. No major causality breaks, but momentum drags under decorative weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—psychometry + crystal gazing + spatial imagination + vintage projection booth + ghostly lyrics—is fresh in combination and specific to this setting. The goodbye letters and film-strip memories avoid cliché through the "unused love stored in spatial architecture" angle. Risk-taking in lyric register and non-linear vision structure heightens atmosphere without obscuring the core discovery. However, the emotional arc (Elara finds closure for her fiancé's loss via others' letters) follows a familiar template: grieving protagonist discovers past lovers' story and gains insight. Transformation is partial; the booth and psychometry are particular, but the insight ("love stored spatially") leans abstract. Within-band adjustment for risk (+0.2) offsets derivative-premise friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara (crystal gazer) is present throughout and her psychometry triggers the visions. She makes two modest choices: climbing the ladder (setup), prying the panel (middle), and rewinding the film (ending). Setup and payoff gates are met; middle gate is weak (prying is discovery, not decision under pressure). Her role is more receiver than decider—visions "bloomed," memories "flooded," the box "gleamed." Causal pressure is low; her actions enable discovery but do not narrow options or face trade-offs. Closure linkage is present (she rewinds and projects the film), but the agency is passive. Score: setup +0.4, payoff +0.7, two beats +0.9, but passivity and swappability (any sensitive could do this) cap the result. Late middle-development weakness and lack of visible cost when she decides to keep knowledge vs. return letters: ornamental closure participation without stakes. Final: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The film strip is handled in three beats: snagged in projector (setup), pressed to crystal pendant for psychometry (middle), rewound and looped to project (ending). All three gates met. The strip's celluloid "brittle as autumn leaves" and its emulsions "yielding Eliza's script" are specific properties. It enables the psychometry reading and the final projection, both plot-critical. Causal pressure: without the strip, no visions and no reunion image. Closure linkage is strong—"Light spilled, revealing the couple reunited on celluloid fantasy." Irreplaceability is high; a generic relic would not carry the lovers' image. Score: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6 = 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Goodbye letters (core concept) appear in setup (visions of 1942 couple writing them), middle (Eliza's "love unspent, sealed in envelopes never mailed"), and ending ("she'd return the letters," "goodbye letters transformed to hello"). All three gates met. The letters shape the stake (finding unused love) and the thematic payoff. However, they do not constrain Elara's choices—she finds them unopposed and decides to return them off-page. Causal role is moderate; they are the object of the search but do not narrow options. Closure linkage: the final line's "goodbye letters transformed to hello" reweights the concept lyrically. Score: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, lyric reprise +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, but no visible cost tied to the letters and swappability (any stored love tokens could serve) −0.6 = 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Spatially imaginative" is introduced in paragraph 4 and appears three times. Setup gate met. Middle: Elara "visualized the spatial vault" and "reconstructed the booth's innards" (development gate met). Ending: "her visions spatially mapped" (payoff gate met). The trait enables the discovery of the hidden panel, a causal beat. However, the mechanics are told rather than dramatized—"mapping every alcove and echo until spaces unfolded in her mind like living blueprints" is summary. No visible cost or trade-off tied to this trait; she simply sees the vault and acts. Irreplaceability is moderate; heightened perception could substitute. Score: three gates +1.2, two beats +0.9, causal enable +0.8, but label-only execution and swappability −0.8 = 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Incubate" (action) recurs seven times: "incubating the contact" (setup, paragraph 9), Eliza's script "our love incubates eternal" (middle), "Eliza's daily visits, incubating hope" (middle), "unused love now incubating within her, ready to hatch" (ending). All three gates met. The term frames the psychometry method (holding the strip warm, "letting its history gestate") and the thematic resolution (unused love hatching). However, "incubate" is largely metaphorical—Elara does not literally incubate anything; she holds and waits. The action does not create a turn; it describes a process. Causal role is thin; discovery would work without this verb. Closure linkage is present but ornamental. Score: three gates +1.2, thematic recurrence +0.8, closure presence +0.7, but metaphor-only and swappability (gestate, nurture, hold) −0.8, summary-only −0.5 = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Psychometry reading (method) is signaled in paragraph 8 ("psychometry tugged at her palms, urging a reading") and executed in paragraphs 9–11 (closing eyes, holding the strip, visions flooding). Setup and middle gates met. The method enables the visions of 1942 and discovery of the letters. Ending: "psychometry merged with scrying" and Elara "pocketed a letter fragment, her crystal aglow" (payoff gate met). Mechanics matter: the contact is held warm, the pendant merges the reading. Irreplaceability is high; no other method was available. Causal pressure: without psychometry, no plot. Closure: the method charges the final revelation. Score: three gates +1.2, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.8, early signal +0.6 = 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vintage movie palace projection booth (setting) is introduced in the opening line and detailed across the story: brass gears, cobwebs, groaning ladder, ancient projector, hidden panel. Setup gate met. Middle: the booth's architecture ("ducts twisting like veins," "forgotten compartment behind the take-up reel") guides Elara's spatial search (development gate met). Ending: "The Orpheum sighed content" and the projection occurs in the booth (payoff gate met). The setting supplies the hidden panel (resource) and the projector (tool), both plot-critical. Micro-setting qualifier: the booth's angles and shadows are framed as storing emotions, charging the final image. Irreplaceability: high; no other setting offers this convergence. Score: three gates +1.2, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.8, early signal +0.7 = 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "while forgotten lyrics search for tune" is present in the opening paragraph ("the night when forgotten lyrics...searched for their elusive tunes") and recurs: "lyrics' search amplified," "lyrics' frantic quest below," "lyrics found tune in a swell of strings, harmonizing at last" (ending). Setup and payoff gates met. However, the lyrics are atmospheric backdrop; they do not tighten Elara's decisions or create a clock. No middle-development gate—her search is not paced by the lyrics. The timeframe is ornamental; removing it would not alter her actions. Closure linkage is present (lyrics harmonize when she finds the box) but coincidental, not causal. Score: setup +0.4, payoff +0.7, lyric reprise +0.4, but no clock pressure and swappability (any ambient search motif could serve) −0.8, ornamental −0.5 = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to find where unused love is stored" is signaled in paragraph 13 ("She needed to know where such love lingered, unclaimed") and drives Elara's climb, film contact, and panel prying. Setup and middle gates met. Ending: "unused love now incubating within her" and "love stored not in boxes, but in the spatial architecture" (payoff gate met). The desire shapes the stake and the thematic answer. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—"She needed" rather than conflicted choice. No visible friction between want and cost; she finds the answer unopposed. Internalization at the end is asserted rather than shown through action. Score: three gates +1.2, two beats +0.9, causal role +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, thematic tie +0.5, but told-only execution and lack of friction −1.1 = 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" (tone) is introduced in paragraph 2 ("Hushed thunder rolled beyond the stained-glass marquee") and recurs: "thunder growled approval" (middle), "thunder hushed to reverence" (ending). All three gates met. The tone modulates from rolling to growling to hushed, tracking the discovery arc. It supports the gothic-lyric atmosphere and charges the final descent ("thunder fading to hush"). However, the tone does not constrain choice; it is decorative weather. Coherence is strong, but impact on stakes is ornamental. Score: three gates +1.2, three beats +1.4, modulation +0.6, closure linkage +0.8, but ornamental role and swappability (any ambient sound could serve) −0.8, no choice constraint −0.5 = 5.7.</comment>
