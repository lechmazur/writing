<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (trace honest origins) is signaled and pursued, but interiority relies heavily on recycled descriptors ("dappled resolve," "tranquilly perceptive") that function as labels rather than embodied contradiction. Her discovery sequence shows logical method-testing, yet the final vault choice carries minimal felt cost—she "sat amid the reclaimed stillness" without dramatized trade-off or foreclosed path. Embodied emotion is thin; no sweat, tremor, or visceral hesitation under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early and follows a causal chain: stamp discovery → phosphorescent ink test → vault coordinates → scrolls. Closure lands on-page (truth revealed, insight reborn), but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than felt—"dappled resolve fulfilled" tells satisfaction without showing what Elara surrenders or loses. The blackout constraint shapes the ink-test beat but does not reappear to tighten the vault sequence. Lens reads Causal with an Accumulative texture; closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing but the price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sunken library is vividly rendered (sodden shelves, moss-slick floor, phosphorescent ink), and the blackout removes sight to force touch-based problem-solving in the stamp beat. Spatial choreography is clear through narrow corridors to the vault. However, the environment becomes static postcard after mid-story; water's "distant murmur" and "reclaimed stillness" repeat without altering tactics in the vault sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (trace honest origins) is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when darkness forces the alternative-hypothesis ink test, narrowing Elara's method. The vault door's hidden latches provide a micro-reversal, but the final revelation (hubris, not gods) arrives without on-page cost—no social price, no forfeited belief, no tactical sacrifice shown. The blackout's pressure dissipates after the ink-test beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (truth vs. myth, human folly) emerges through concrete discovery, but the final paragraph moralizes: "No cataclysm of myth, but human folly—profound in its quiet banality" and "light was reborn—not of lanterns, but insight" state the theme rather than letting the vault scrolls speak. The phosphorescent ink and "Veritas Primordia" glyph are apt motifs, yet "reclaimed stillness" is invoked repeatedly without evolving pressure or meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited, but narrative diction drifts into elevated register ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve") that clashes with on-page problem-solving. Sentence stems repeat: "Dappled resolve [verb]," "Tranquilly perceptive [noun]," "She [verb], [gerund phrase]" across a dozen lines. No dialogue present to judge. Elara's perceptual signature (logical indexer) is told more than shown; her interior voice lacks idiosyncrasy under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "tranquilly perceptive" appears four times, "dappled resolve" five times, "reclaimed stillness" three times, "honest origins" four times—synonym churn without added pressure. Adjacent lines restate: "This quiet…now enveloped her like a balm" followed by "She considered her method: abandon strict logic…" is a pivot, but "Elara's logical mind raced, indexing implications" then "Yet in reclaiming this stillness, truth settled" loops the concept. Mixed metaphor: "shadows clung…like forgotten regrets" then "water's distant murmur was the only pulse" switches vehicles. Closure beat ("light was reborn—not of lanterns, but insight") abstracts rather than images. Artifacts touch the ending; accumulation exceeds −1.4 and disallows 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The sunken-library premise and alchemical ink offer specific texture, but the truth-seeker-in-archive plot is a familiar template. The phosphorescent ink's darkness-reveal is a fresh tactical wrinkle. However, the final revelation (engineers cracked bedrock) is delivered via exposition dump rather than a non-obvious synthesis that reweights prior beats. Risk-averse closure: Elara emerges unscathed, "the library's peace hers to safeguard."</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara's logical indexing frames her method early and drives the alternative-hypothesis test mid-story. Her choice to test the stamp in darkness is causal, and her decision to enter the vault advances the plot. However, the climactic vault moment is observational ("sat amid," "secrets stirring") rather than a choice with visible cost. Present in setup, middle, and ending; two beats involve decisions, but the final beat is passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stamp appears in three beats: discovery/catch, ink test (constrains method by requiring darkness), vault-door latches (enables entry). "Veritas Primordia" glyph seeds expectation early. The stamp becomes "her compass" and shapes the ending image ("stamp in hand"). Causal across setup, development, and payoff; closure credit is cameo rather than reweighted meaning, but beat involvement and causal pressure are strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" is invoked five times as atmosphere and theme but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. It functions as mood label and thematic echo. The blackout creates stillness, and Elara "reclaims" it conceptually at the vault, but no on-page cost or decision hinges on stillness versus noise. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" appears four times as a label. It describes Elara's noticing (stamp weight, faint hiss, vault inscriptions) but does not enable or constrain an action with tradeoff. The trait could be swapped for "observant" or "careful" without altering plot. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Readjust" appears in three beats: kneeling to examine the stamp, readjusting the stamp pad for the ink test, and readjusting after the phosphorescent reveal to check the map. The ink-test readjustment is causal (enables discovery). Present in setup, middle, and ending; the action enables a key turn but is swappable with "reposition" or "shift" without loss. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Alternative hypothesis" is named once mid-story ("abandon strict logic for an alternative hypothesis") and enacted in the phosphorescent-ink test. The method shapes the key middle beat and enables vault access. Signaled and dramatized, but introduced at the pivot rather than early; the test's success feels convenient (no failed alternative shown). Two gates (middle, ending); causal but late.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The sunken library supplies the stamp, map wall, and vault; the blackout forces touch-navigation and the darkness-reveal tactic. The setting is present in setup, middle, and ending, and constrains Elara's method twice (darkness → touch, flooded corridors → creeping). Spatial choreography is clear. Essential across beats but the vault interior (final third) becomes static description.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The blackout is named in the setup and shapes the ink-test beat by removing light. After that, the timeframe becomes ambient; no ticking clock tightens the vault sequence, and Elara's emergence suggests the blackout persists but does not pressure her. Present in setup and middle; weak closure linkage. One causal beat, then static.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Trace honest origins" is stated early and pursued through cataloging, stamp discovery, and vault entry. The vault scrolls deliver the answer, fulfilling the motivation on-page. However, the motivation is declared rather than dramatized in conflict—no scene shows Elara torn between safety and truth, or risking a relationship for discovery. Present across all beats; causal but friction-free.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears five times as a label for Elara's determination-with-doubt but does not modulate with pressure. The tone remains static (solemn, earnest) from setup through vault revelation. "Dappled" (a mosaic of steadfast and doubt) is told in the setup and reasserted but never shown as competing impulses in a choice. The final image ("light was reborn") shifts to declarative triumph, breaking the established texture. Label-only; no tonal arc.</comment>
