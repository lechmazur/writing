<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (freeing trapped creativity) is clear, but her choices under pressure feel abstract and ritualized rather than psychologically urgent. The internal conflict between fear of idleness and the auroras' demand for rest is stated but never embodied in a contradictory micro-choice that costs her something tangible. The ending declares creativity "freed" without showing a lived decision that forecloses a path; the transformation reads told rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story establishes a situational frame (artist's block, mystical ritual) but the escalation is purely iterative—Elara traces meteors across an "unwritten calendar" without clear causal progression or a tightening that narrows options. The closure unit (creativity freed upon waking) arrives as summary rather than a decisive change with visible cost; no on-page action or renunciation forecloses a path. Orientation is delayed: "who" and "what she seeks" emerge gradually, but spatial grounding (threshold, pedestal of ice) appears late and the timeline remains vague, triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway and astrolabe are vividly rendered with sensory detail (ethereal greens, brass humming, frost-kissed threshold). The archway functions as a threshold and the astrolabe is handled across multiple beats, but neither constrains a choice that alters tactics—Elara's actions (kneeling, adjusting dials) are ritualized rather than problem-solving. The body under stress (aching, exhaustion) is noted but does not reshape her approach, and the final image does not charge these details with new meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (freeing trapped creativity) is signaled early, but pressure remains static: Elara traces falling stars repeatedly without a reversal or tightening that narrows her options. The resolution (creativity surges upon waking) is declared rather than earned by a choice with visible cost; rest is prescribed by the auroras rather than chosen against competing needs. No trade-off or forfeiture appears on the page, and the iterative structure (meteor after meteor) lacks escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of cosmic origins and creative renewal emerges through the "remembered stardust" conceit, and the piece avoids overt moralizing. However, the final insight ("stardust awoke, remembered, unbound") is asserted rather than embodied in a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The unspoken words function as direct thematic statements ("You are remembered stardust") rather than subtext, and the ending resolves into a tidy before/after without lingering complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent lyric register with elevated diction ("shadowed rapture," "spectral embrace"), but the prose lacks perceptual signature—Elara's noticing is generic rather than character-specific. Key phrases ("unspoken words," "shadowed rapture") recur without shifting meaning, and the narrative distance is uniform across emotional peaks, missing modulation under stress. Free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("She learned," "she knew") flatten immediacy in pivotal beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often abstract: "silent symphonies of longing," "thoughts like radio waves," "stardust imprisoned by forgotten origins" stack without concrete grounding, particularly in the inciting beat. Template cadence appears in repeated "unspoken words" constructs and "She [verb]" stems. Paraphrase loops occur ("trapped creativity was no mere block; it was stardust imprisoned," "ideas erupting like novas" / "creativity freed"). The closure beat is dulled by summary ("visions cascaded," "stardust awoke") rather than clean action, triggering −1.2 for artifacts touching closure and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise (artist's block cured by mystical star-tracing) follows a familiar template (creative discovers cosmic truth via ritual), and the emotional arc (frustration → mystical instruction → resolution) is predictable. The "remembered stardust" conceit offers a lyric angle, but the execution relies on stock mystical imagery (auroras, falling stars, ancient instruments) without transforming the trope through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The piece does not take structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her actions (kneeling, adjusting the astrolabe, tracing meteors) drive the sequence, but these choices are ritualized rather than decision points that alter tactics or foreclose options. She follows the auroras' prescription without internal conflict that changes her approach; the "moonstruck dreamer" label is functional but does not create a turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The astrolabe appears early, is handled in multiple beats (adjusting dials, locking on meteors, cradled in lap), and is present at closure. It enables the ritual but does not constrain a choice or shift in meaning—its use is consistent and functional rather than transformative. Strong setup and beat involvement, but lacks causal pressure or closure reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "remembered stardust" concept is introduced mid-story as thematic explanation ("every artist's spark originated from cosmic debris") and reappears at closure ("stardust awoke, remembered, unbound"). It is told rather than enacted through a choice or tactic, and its mechanics (how remembering frees creativity) remain abstract. Functional theme layer but does not shape on-page options or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara "hears unspoken words" from the auroras across multiple beats, and this trait enables the ritual instructions. However, the trait does not impose a visible trade-off or constrain her actions—it functions as a conduit for exposition rather than a double-edged ability with cost. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Rest is prescribed by the unspoken words and achieved at the climax ("exhaustion claimed her; she rested fully"), enabling the creative breakthrough. The act is signaled and executed, but Elara does not choose rest against a competing need or cost—it is depicted as surrender rather than an active decision that alters stakes. Functional but replaceable with another prescribed action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tracing the path of falling stars is introduced early as the method ("align the astrolabe's rings to meteor trails") and executed across multiple beats (first meteor, another flare, a final trace in her mind's eye). The method is specific and repeated, but the mechanics do not constrain or complicate her choices—each trace is successful without friction. Strong setup and development, moderate closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway is the story's primary location, introduced early and present at closure ("the archway pulsed brighter"). It provides atmosphere and a threshold, but does not constrain Elara's choices or supply a resource that alters tactics—she kneels, traces, and rests without the archway's features shaping her approach. Strong presence, modest causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The "unwritten calendar" is mentioned repeatedly ("across an unwritten calendar," "what felt like hours stretched," "the unwritten calendar had etched eternity into moments") as a descriptor of vague duration, but time does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than tactical; no clock pressures her choices or alters the sequence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Freeing trapped creativity is Elara's clear goal, signaled early ("her creativity trapped within, a stifled storm") and resolved at closure ("creativity freed"). The motivation drives her journey to the archway and her persistence in the ritual, but it is not dramatized through conflicting wants or a trade-off with visible cost—she follows the auroras' instructions without internal friction between desire and price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Shadowed rapture" appears as a recurring phrase ("In the shadowed rapture of an endless twilight," "In shadowed rapture, her eyelids grew heavy," "a shadowed rapture internalized") and establishes a consistent tone of mystical longing. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure—it remains uniform across setup, ritual, and resolution—and does not charge the final image with new emotional weight. Present and coherent but static.</comment>
