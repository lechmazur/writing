<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "discover the weight of a withheld truth" is signaled but remains abstract through most of the piece. Her "cyclically spontaneous" nature is label-heavy; the trait appears as declaration rather than embodied contradiction that constrains choice. The mentor's confession arrives via parallel-universe exposition rather than dramatized discovery that forces Elara to act differently. The final acceptance—"weave or all unravels"—reads as capitulation to cosmic duty without a visible tradeoff between competing goods on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: "who" (sensory map maker), "where" (abandoned bay), and "when" (dream-murmur haze) coalesce slowly, triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (layered sensory maps, parallel glimpses), but the piece toggles between causal plotting (shard redirect) and lyric murmur without teaching the pattern by midpoint. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("weave eternal"), yet cost remains asserted ("weight of truth a steady hum") rather than shown as a foreclosed path or visible sacrifice. The redirect action cycles through multiple universes in summary rather than one decisive on-page turn with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay anchors atmosphere (rusted hulks, dust motes, emergency lights) and the green shard is handled across beats. Spatial choreography remains legible. However, the bay functions primarily as backdrop; it does not pressure Elara's choices or supply resources that alter outcome—she could weave from any liminal space. The "micro-setting" exception nearly applies (shard as tool), but the shard's mechanics are summarized rather than constraining tactics, capping the score below 7.0 per the gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"discover the weight of a withheld truth"—is signaled early but remains abstract. Escalation occurs through rapid parallel-universe hops, yet each glimpse is recounted in summary rather than dramatized as a choice that narrows options. The mentor's two revelations (cosmic balance, then engineered guardian) offer reversals, but Elara does not face a trade-off between them; she simply "chooses to embrace the weave." Under an Accumulative lens, the piece needed one deepening that reweights cost on the page; instead, the ending asserts "weave or all unravels" without showing what path she forecloses or what she loses by accepting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—identity, creation, and cosmic responsibility—emerges through the "born of the weave" mystery and the parallel-universe method. The final image ("weaver eternal") attempts resonance but leans on prompt-like phrasing ("spontaneous yet purposeful") rather than a concrete particular that reweights prior material. The mentor's echo states the thesis directly: "weave or all unravels," a thematic summary that replaces earned insight. No micro-choice or recurring image charges the ending with non-literal meaning; the piece tells its theme rather than showing it through pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Single-POV baseline holds with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("velvet hush," "acrid smoke," "verdant fire"), but perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—Elara's sensory mapping reads generically poetic rather than reflecting her particular hierarchy of attention. Filter verbs ("felt," "glimpsed," "understood") cluster in the final third, dulling immediacy at closure. The mentor's echo speaks in thesis-voice ("Your birth wove two worlds") rather than idiomatic dialogue. Free indirect style is clean, yet the prose lacks rhythmic control under pressure; key beats adopt the same lyric cadence without modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "cyclically spontaneous" recurs as label across four paragraphs without adding pressure; "the weight of truth" is synonym-churned ("truth's weight," "truth's heft," "weight of a withheld truth"). Template cadence is evident in repeated "She [verb]" openers and "In the [noun], [subject] [verb]" constructions. Figurative density is high ("nocturnal flowers," "worn fabric," "verdant fire") but much of it ornaments rather than advances; mixed metaphor in "truth's weight...crushing" then "a steady hum, not a chain" blurs sense. Baseline −1.0 penalty for loops and template stems in Q7; artifacts touch closure ("weaver eternal"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Core premise—sensory map maker weaving parallel universes to uncover engineered origins—combines familiar elements (multiverse, chosen-one creation myth) without a fresh inflection. The "cyclically spontaneous" trait and green shard are ornamental rather than driving a non-obvious choice. The mentor's two revelations (balance, then experiment) offer reversals, yet Elara's final acceptance reads as template resolution: discover secret origin, accept cosmic duty. Emotional specificity is thin; the piece prioritizes lyric texture over particular, lived detail that would transform the premise. Proximity check flags "weave" and "spontaneous" as prompt echoes rather than organic character idiom.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her identity as sensory map maker frames the narration (weaving sensory tapestries, parsing oil and ozone). However, her map-making ability functions primarily as narrative texture rather than constraining or enabling key choices. The redirect action and final acceptance arise from the shard and mentor's revelations, not from a decision only a map maker could make. She is present in all three gates (setup, development, closure) but her occupation remains ornamental. Band guidance: functional but replaceable role, no unique causal pressure tied to this exact character trait. Two gates + lyric reprise allows ~6.0 ceiling; swappability and ornamental use lower to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The green glass shard appears early (setup gate), is handled in multiple beats (gripped, twisted, fused to hand), and is present at closure ("verdant fire"). It enables the redirect action across parallel universes and its physical state evolves (biting edges, pulsing rhythm, fusing). However, its mechanics are summarized rather than dramatically constraining a choice under pressure; Elara does not face a cost tied to using the shard versus another method. All three gates are met; causal pressure is present but moderate; specificity is high (green, glass, fragment of multiversal gate). Band guidance: essential across beats but not fully indispensable; removing it would require rewrite but the emotional arc could survive with another tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Weaving between worlds" is signaled early as Elara's profession and becomes the method of discovery. The concept shapes the redirect action and is present at closure ("weaver eternal"). However, it functions more as setting logic than a stake or tactic that narrows options—Elara weaves through parallels in summary montage rather than facing a choice only this concept enables. All three gates are met; causal role is present but the concept could be swapped for another multiverse-navigation method (e.g., technology, telepathy) without breaking the emotional arc. Band guidance: shapes one key turn (redirect) and is present at closure, eligible for mid-6s; swappability and lack of unique constraint hold it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Cyclically spontaneous" is mentioned five times but remains label-only. The trait is described (erupts every twenty-eight days, peaked at redirect) but does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost on the page. Elara never faces a tradeoff where acting spontaneously forecloses a planning-based option, nor does she struggle against the cycle. Setup and closure gates are present (mentioned early and at end), but development gate is missing—the attribute does not enable or block a middle beat. Band guidance: present but ornamental, no causal pressure; cap at 3.8 per swappability and label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Redirect" is the named action Elara performs twice (first toward mentor's final words, then toward core divergence). It drives two beats and enables the discovery of both revelations (cosmic balance, engineered origin). However, the redirect mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized as a choice with visible tradeoff—Elara "twisted the shard" and universes "snapped into alignment" without cost or obstacle. All three gates are met; causal involvement is clear but the action could be renamed "shift" or "navigate" with minor edits, suggesting moderate swappability. Band guidance: shapes two beats and contributes to closure, eligible for mid-6s; lack of unique cost and summary execution prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Through parallel universes" is the means by which Elara redirects. The method is signaled early (weaving between worlds, sensory maps of parallels) and structures the middle sequence (glimpses of queen/beggar/ghost, two mentor revelations). It is present at closure (nexus universe, "worlds whispered thanks"). All three gates are met. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown—parallels appear as montage descriptions without unique properties that constrain tactics. Band guidance: shapes attempts and is present at ending, eligible for 6+ under gate model; lack of unique mechanical pressure and late-arriving specificity (nexus universe concept introduced near end) cap below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is described vividly in the opening (rusted hulks, emergency lights, debris) and returns at closure ("bay solidified"). Setup and closure gates are met. However, the bay does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome—Elara's weaving could occur in any liminal space. Development gate is missing; the setting does not pressure a middle beat. Band guidance: present at start and end with lyric reprise, eligible for ~6.0 under two-gate allowance, but ornamental use and swappability lower to mid-4s. Missing middle development gate applies cap at 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"In the murmur of half-remembered dreams" is the timeframe, invoked in the opening and closing lines and three times mid-story. The dreamlike frame is described but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—Elara's redirect sequence occurs in summary montage without a clock or urgency. Setup and closure gates are present; development gate is missing (no middle choice shaped by dream-time). The frame could be removed or replaced with "liminal meditation" without breaking the plot. Band guidance: present but ornamental, no causal pressure; cap at 3.4 per missing development gate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To discover the weight of a withheld truth" is Elara's stated motivation, signaled early ("Tonight...her motivation crystallized") and resolved at closure (mentor's revelations, acceptance of weave). Setup and closure gates are met. However, the desire is told more than dramatized—Elara does not face friction between this want and a competing cost on the page; the redirect sequence advances her goal without sacrifice. Development gate is weak; the middle beats show discovery attempts but no moment where pursuing truth forces her to give up something else. Band guidance: shapes the arc and is present at closure, eligible for mid-5s to low-6s under two-gate allowance; lack of visible tradeoff and summary execution prevent higher score.</comment>
