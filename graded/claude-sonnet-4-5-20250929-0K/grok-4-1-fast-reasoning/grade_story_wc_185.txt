<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Mapkeeper's motivation (protecting the caves' harmony) is clear and consistent throughout, with embodied resolve shown through measured steps and steady breath. However, interiority remains abstract—"hammered repose" and similar phrases are repeated as labels rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The final choice (positioning the stone, channeling will) feels more ritual than psychologically earned conflict; we never see her wrestle with competing goods or face a moment where her method might fail her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: the Mapkeeper reads patterns, positions the stone, and the bloom unfolds outward in layered imagery. Orientation anchors quickly (harmonic caves, after invasion, Mapkeeper descending). The closure—bloom enveloping the chamber, energy beings withdrawing—lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "the quiet that endures, forged in the hammer of invasion"), and the cost is legible (her eternal vigil, the fragile truce). One meaningful deepening occurs when cracks reveal the spiral node. The lens holds without contradiction, though the accretive quality leans heavily on repetition of key phrases rather than tightening pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are vividly rendered with frost-veined chambers, ice fractured by invasion, and luminous pulses; sensory detail (visual glow, tactile cracks, auditory roar vs. hush) grounds the setting throughout. The ice sheet and its crack patterns constrain the Mapkeeper's method and charge the final image (cracks into luminous mandalas). However, spatial choreography beyond "deepest chamber" remains vague—no sense of tunnels, distances, or how energy beings' physical presence shapes navigation. The micro-setting (ice + stone) does the heavy lifting, meeting the gate for choice-constraint and closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaim harmony before the energy beings unravel the world's fragile hush—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: discovering the spiral node where vibrations converge narrows her target and intensifies the conjuring attempt. The Mapkeeper's agency (positioning stone, channeling will through mapped paths) drives the bloom's emergence; coincidence does not resolve. The cost is legible (eternal vigil, wary energy beings, fragile truce), though the beings' withdrawal feels passive rather than forced by a hard choice. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift rather than causal narrowing, which is acceptable, but the lack of a moment where her method visibly risks failure keeps this from the high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—stillness as active defense, the quiet that endures within storm—emerges from imagery (bloom of hush, ripple-marks, hammered repose) rather than statement. The final image (bloom dissolving, leaving purity, her carrying quiet within) reweights prior material without overt moral. However, the conceptual vocabulary ("bloom of hush," "hammered repose," "gently luminous") is repeated so often it edges toward thematic echo; the story tells us the concepts rather than fully dramatizing their cost and friction. The question of how to preserve harmony is explored through action, but the answer feels preordained—no counter-pressure tests whether silence can truly endure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on the Mapkeeper; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (reading cracks, tracing patterns) is consistent and profession-specific. However, the prose often drifts into elevated register ("petals of void to smother invading noise," "bloom of hush") that feels authorial rather than the Mapkeeper's lived idiom, especially under pressure. Diction remains steady but somewhat generic; the internal voice lacks strong rhythmic or syntactic particularity. No dialogue present, so those bullets do not apply. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she knew") appear but are not excessive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, but suffers from significant pattern debt. "Hammered repose" appears four times, "gently luminous" three times, "bloom of hush" recurs throughout—repetition that reads as scaffolding rather than taught motif. Adjacent sentences paraphrase: "The stone's gentle luminosity intensified, bathing the ice in ethereal blue. Cracks pulsed in sympathy, ripple-marks awakening as if tides returned"—both describe the same visual escalation. Template cadence: multiple "She [verb]" stems in the climax without variation. These artifacts cluster in the closure section, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty pack (−1.0 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally; cap high-band at 8.8). Figurative language ("petals of hush unfurling like frost flowers") is dense but mostly coherent. Information density is moderate; some beats advance multiple jobs (stone + cracks + bloom), but the final third loops through the same image set.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—mapkeeper reading fracture patterns to conjure stillness against energy invaders—offers a fresh synthesis of fantasy tropes. Specific details (ripple-marks, frost-veined ice, echo chamber stone amplifying whispers) ground the concept. However, the emotional arc is linear and predictable: problem identified → method applied → harmony restored. The energy beings remain abstract threats with no counter-moves; the Mapkeeper's success feels predetermined. The "bloom of hush" as living quietude is an intriguing image, but its mechanics are asserted rather than discovered through struggle. The transformation test flags moderate concern: swap "Mapkeeper" for "Healer" and "cracks" for "wounds," and much of the emotional structure holds unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ripple-mark Mapkeeper is present throughout; her choices (descending, examining cracks, positioning stone, channeling will) create the key turn (bloom emergence). Setup clear in opening lines; middle development shows her reading the spiral node; closure beat has her witnessing the bloom and rising with the quiet within. However, her decisions feel more procedural than conflicted—she follows her established method without visible risk or competing option. Causal pressure is moderate; cost (eternal vigil) is acknowledged but not sharply dramatized in the climax. Three beats, closure linkage present, but swappability concern (another guardian using another method) and limited internal friction keep this mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Echo chamber stone appears in beat one (descends with it), beat two (examines its properties, "amplified whispers into symphonies"), and beat three (positions it, channels through it, it thrums and stills). Setup by first third; development shows its dual power (clamor vs. stillness); closure beat has it amplifying her intent to unfurl the bloom. Specificity high (quarried from caves' heart, swirling captured silences, gentle ember at end). Cost tied to it (she must master its power, final thrumming marks permanent change). Irreplaceable: the stone's unique amplification property is load-bearing. Minor deduction for late climax focus—much of the middle is crack-reading, stone becomes decisive only in final third—but three-gate presence and causal necessity justify high score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Bloom of hush is seeded early ("promising a path to the quiet"), explained mid-story ("flowering of absolute calm"), and realized at closure ("silence bloomed outward, petals of hush unfurling"). It shapes her goal and the final image. However, its mechanics remain abstract—"unfurling petals of void" is poetic but not tactically specific. The concept does not narrow her options or create visible friction; it is the desired outcome, not a constraint on method. It charges the ending image strongly (bloom dissolving, leaving purity) but does not drive middle choices. Setup + payoff present; middle development weak. Lyric resonance lifts it above pure ornament, but swappability concern (substitute "zone of silence" or "calm field") and lack of mid-scene constraint cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Gently luminous appears five times, applied to energy pulses, the echo chamber stone, the ice transformation, and the stone's final ember glow. Setup early; recurs across beats; appears in closure image ("gently luminous veils draping the ice"). However, the attribute is descriptive, not constraining—it signals magic/specialness but does not enable or block any action. The stone would function identically if described as "dark" or "warm." No visible cost or tradeoff tied to luminosity itself. Closure presence and recurrence earn mid-band, but pure ornamentation and high swappability prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Conjure is the climactic action: "Now came the action: to conjure. She pressed the stone firm, channeling her will through the cracks' mapped paths." It drives the major turn (bloom emergence) and is foreshadowed ("to pierce the chaos and reclaim...harmony"). Setup present (motivation established); development (examining cracks prepares the conjuring); payoff (bloom unfolds, energy beings withdraw). The action is specific to her role and irreplaceable—no passive reception or coincidence. Cost visible (her will channeled, repose deepened, eternal vigil required). Minor deduction: the conjuring itself is summarized in a few lines ("Whispers escaped her lips, ancient incantations") rather than dramatized with granular struggle or risk of failure, keeping it shy of indispensable band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Examining crack patterns in ice is signaled early ("tracing maps in the ripple-marks"), executed in the middle climax ("began examining crack patterns in the ice. Each fissure mimicked ripple-marks...Her fingers...traced the delicate webs"), and pays off (patterns become conduits for the bloom). The method is profession-specific and shapes her approach—without reading the spiral node, she cannot target the conjuring. Three beats: introduction of method, detailed execution, payoff in conjuring. Irreplaceability high; cost present (years of such readings, callused fingers). Minor deduction: the ice-reading and stone-positioning feel like separate moves rather than tightly integrated; the cracks reveal the target but do not mechanically enable the bloom's spread—stone does that work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Harmonic caves frame the entire story; setup immediate ("In the harmonic caves"), middle beat (descends to "deepest frost-veined chamber"), closure (caves breathe easier, balance held). The setting provides the central problem (invasion disrupts harmony) and the resource (caves' defense mechanism, bloom of hush). Environment constrains her approach (must go deep, use ice patterns) and charges the final image (walls whisper gratitude, song reborn). However, beyond "frost-veined chamber" and "ice sheet," spatial specificity is thin—no sense of scale, tunnel navigation, or how the beings' presence physically limits her movement. The caves' "harmonic lattice" is conceptual rather than tactile. Closure linkage strong, but missing micro-constraint in middle beats and moderate swappability (another magical refuge) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the energy beings arrived" is established in the opening line and sustained (beings' pulses, their arrival warped the lattice, they withdraw at end). However, the temporal pressure is static—no ticking clock, no escalation of invasion during her descent. The conjuring happens in one continuous sequence without time constraint testing her speed or endurance. "After the arrival" sets context but does not tighten decisions or tactics within the scene. Setup clear; closure notes the shift (beings withdraw, for now), but middle development lacks temporal friction. Present and coherent, but replaceable with "during the invasion" with minimal edits. Two gates (setup, payoff); middle gate weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation "to find the quiet in the storm" is stated early ("Her motivation burned steady: to pierce the chaos and reclaim...harmony"), pursued throughout (examining cracks, positioning stone, conjuring), and achieved at closure ("She had found it: the quiet that endures"). Setup strong; development shows her acting on the desire; payoff explicit. However, the desire is never conflicted—no competing want (safety, rest, doubt in her method) tests her commitment. The motivation shapes her actions but does not create internal friction or visible cost in choice moments. It is consistent and drives plot, but lacks dramatized tension between want and fear or want and price. Three gates met, causal role clear, but absence of friction and monolithic certainty keep it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Hammered repose appears four times as descriptor of her state ("moved with hammered repose," "breath steadied into hammered repose," "repose deepened," "settled over her like a mantle"). It signals tone (calm forged under pressure) and modulates slightly—initial repose, deepening under conjuring, final settling. The tone is coherent and charges the final image (quiet held, balance restored). However, the phrase is repeated identically rather than shown through varied syntax or rhythm; the prose does not enact the tone at sentence level—much of the final third maintains the same elevated, steady cadence without acceleration or breath that mirrors the "hammering." Closure participation clear, but execution is label-reliant rather than rhythmically embodied, and the single static mood (serene resolve) lacks meaningful tonal shift under pressure.</comment>
