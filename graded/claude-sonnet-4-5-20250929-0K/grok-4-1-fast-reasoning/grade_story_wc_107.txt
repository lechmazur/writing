<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to create "safe zones" is declared but never tested by competing desires or realistic friction. His transformation from nomadic isolation to communal yearning is told rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The interiority relies on abstract labels ("thoughtfully spirited," "weighty lightness") rather than embodied emotion, and key moments like his vow to "abandon the wild" lack visible cost that forecloses a path. No on-page choice forces a trade-off between solitude and sanctuary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story provides orientation (who, where, when) within the opening lines. However, no meaningful escalation occurs under any identifiable lens—Elias arrives, lights a furnace, blows glass spheres, and declares success without obstacle, reversal, or narrowing of options. The ending presents completion rather than closure with cost: five spheres gleam and Elias laughs, but no prior stake was tested or path foreclosed. The drive lens remains ambiguous throughout; the piece reads as a static tableau rather than a causal or accumulative arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The control room setting is vividly anchored (cracked observation ports, rusted consoles, meltwater) and the furnace, blowpipe, and marver are handled on the page. However, the environment never constrains a choice or complicates Elias's work—ice melts conveniently, materials are scavenged without friction, and the space enables rather than pressures. Spatial choreography is coherent but the setting functions as backdrop rather than crucible, missing the constraint required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—crafting sanctuaries for inquiry—is signaled early but never tested by opposition, scarcity, or doubt. Elias completes five spheres in sequence without reversal, failed attempt, or tactical adjustment. No on-page tightening narrows his options; no cost is paid. The conflict is declared ("behold!" narration) but not dramatized through pressure that forces a trade-off or alters his stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "thawing heart" metaphor is stated repeatedly but remains abstract; it does not emerge from concrete action or image. The bookmark is handled twice but its guidance is told rather than shown to reshape a choice. The ending offers completion rather than a resonant reconfiguration—Elias's vow and laughter assert thematic closure without a non-literal image that reweights prior material. Theme is imposed through narration ("thawed resolve," "weighty lightness") rather than earned through specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-person limited, but the voice is contaminated by grandiose declarations ("Lo, the heart of earth yields its molten soul") that read as performative rather than character-specific perception. The dramatic narration element forces diction shifts into elevated register ("primordial blaze," "dreams uncrushed") that clash with the contemplative baseline and flatten under repetition. No dialogue is present to judge. The perceptual signature lacks selectivity; every beat receives the same theatrical overlay.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Severe overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: stacked metaphors ("molten soul," "liquid fire," "inflate the void"), synonym churn ("thoughtfully spirited" appears three times with no new meaning), and template cadence ("He hefted… he marveled… he proclaimed"). Figurative density in nearly every sentence of the glassblowing sequence without pattern-teaching triggers −0.7. Paraphrase loops ("thawing" recurs six times across adjacent paragraphs) and grandiose diction ("epochal," "primordial," "tyranny") break momentum. The prose obscures rather than propels.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The glassblower-as-sanctuary-maker premise is earnest but generic; the dramatic narration gimmick is declared rather than woven into tactical choices or stakes. The ice-melt timeframe and post-apocalyptic control room are stock post-crisis elements without fresh synthesis. No turn or final image grows inevitably from prior particulars—Elias's transformation is asserted, not discovered. The piece hedges by literalizing metaphor ("thawing heart") and explaining its own theme, avoiding risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout but makes no choice that alters tactics or narrows options. He observes, lights the furnace, and blows glass without obstacle. His decision to "abandon" nomadic life is declared in narration rather than tested on the page. The character enables the plot but does not drive key turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The bookmark appears in three beats (found outside, laid on console, tucked in pocket at closure) and is credited with guiding Elias to the control room. However, its function is told rather than shown—it marked a page about "safe zones" but never constrains a present choice or returns with reweighted meaning. It remains a static talisman rather than a causally active object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"The thawing heart" is named six times as metaphor and theme but never shapes an on-page stake or tactic. Elias's emotional shift from isolation to community is asserted ("his heart… began to thaw," "fully thawed") without friction, cost, or a choice that tests the concept. It exists as decoration rather than dramatic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully spirited" is applied to Elias three times as a label but never constrains or enables an action with visible cost. The phrase describes his gaze and narration style without creating a trade-off or complicating a choice. It remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Abandon" appears in three beats: abandoning inquiry when ice claimed the world (backstory), Elias abandoning nomadic solitude for roots (midpoint vow), and abandoning the wild's peril for the haven (closure vow). The action frames his motivation and reappears at the ending, but no prior path is dramatized as foreclosed with cost—he simply declares the shift. The concept is present and recurring but not causally tested.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dramatically narrating mundane tasks is signaled early ("Behold!" declaration) and sustained across multiple beats (furnace-lighting, glass-gathering, marvering, annealing). The method is Elias's signature mode and shapes the voice throughout. However, it never affects a choice or creates friction—no listener challenges him, and the narration does not complicate his work. The mechanics are present but do not pressure the outcome, capping the score despite strong beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The abandoned control room is established early, provides concrete resources (consoles as display surfaces, vents for meltwater), and is named in the final line as "no longer abandoned but alive." It anchors the spatial frame and recurs at closure, but never constrains a choice—Elias works unimpeded. The setting enables rather than pressures, placing it in mid-band despite setup and closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Ice melting frames the opening ("epochal ice-melting") and recurs as sensory detail (drips, meltwater pooling). By dusk, five spheres are complete, suggesting elapsed time. However, the timeframe never tightens a decision or alters tactics—melting ice facilitates rather than pressures. The element is present across beats but passive, trending mid-low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to craft safe zones for inquiry is declared early, linked to the bookmark discovery, and drives Elias's choice to root in the control room. Each glass sphere is framed as a sanctuary. The desire reappears at closure ("yearned for arrivals"). However, no on-page friction tests the motivation—no scarcity, doubt, or competing want complicates the goal. The element shapes the action but lacks dramatized conflict, placing it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Weighty lightness" is named once and exemplified in the dramatic narration ("booming with weighty lightness," "laughed" at closure). The tone mixes grandiosity with mundane task, creating a consistent texture. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure—every beat receives the same theatrical overlay—and the final image ("laughed, bookmark tucked") asserts lightness rather than charging prior weight with cost. The element is present but static.</comment>
