<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's methodical curiosity and perceptive nature are repeatedly labeled ("methodically curious," "perceptive map framer," "shielded openness") rather than dramatized through choices under pressure. His grief over his father's "vanishing words" is told, not shown to constrain any on-page decision. The descent and keystone moment feel unmotivated—no internal conflict or embodied hesitation appears when he crosses into forbidden ground or reopens the seal. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("tears blurring his vision—not rain, but release") and therapy-speak ("empathizing with the silence") that flatten the emotional texture at pivotal beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes who/where/when early and follows a causal chain from map tear to archive research to site visit to discovery. However, the closure—Elias frames the map anew and smiles at the frescoes—lands as summary rather than on-page decisive change; the cost (risk, social exposure, emotional reckoning) is asserted ("his methodically curious heart sated yet guarded") but not dramatically visible in the final image. The keystone reopening and compartment discovery feel like a sequence of reveals rather than a tightening that forecloses options. Under a Causal lens, the because/therefore linkage holds through the middle but the ending reconfigures meaning only through summary statement ("Now, known embraced unknown"), not image or action with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault anchors the opening with vivid sensory detail ("faded saints whose eyes seemed to follow"), and the henge site is grounded with gorse bushes and stone steps. The vault's atmosphere mirrors the chapel's acoustics in a purposeful echo. However, many descriptors are ornamental ("monolithic sentinel sketched with unnerving precision") and do not constrain Elias's choices; the chapel's "dome-vaulted sanctum" and "acoustics designed to amplify breaths" appear only after discovery, too late to shape tactics or complicate access.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rediscovering the whispered chapel—is signaled early and drives the archive search, road trip, and excavation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the map tears and reveals the hidden icon, narrowing Elias's focus. However, no on-page obstacle or secondary pressure tests his commitment; the descent and keystone opening proceed without resistance, coincidence, or visible cost (no injury, no professional risk dramatized, no social friction). The closure treats the discovery as complete success without a trade-off or foreclosed path, reducing the felt price to zero on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of interpreting silence with empathy is stated repeatedly ("to interpret silence with empathy," "empathizing with the silence," "silence interpreted with empathy's gentle touch") rather than emerging from concrete action. The whispered chapel and fresco pilgrims offer symbolic potential, but the ending moralizes ("Now, known embraced unknown") instead of letting the final image carry resonance. The letters from priests are mentioned as "empathetic pleas against silencing dissent," a prompt-like summary that replaces scene pressure with thematic assertion in the final third.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the perceptual signature ("methodically curious," vault details filtered through a framer's eye) is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register at emotional peaks ("tears blurring his vision—not rain, but release"; "sacred voids"; "shielded openness cracked slightly") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Elias's internal voice relies on recycled stems ("methodically," "perceptively," "empathetically") and therapy-speak ("shielded openness," "profound empathy") that flatten his texture under pressure. The single line of dialogue ("This isn't erosion, it's an invitation") advances theme but reads more like thesis than spoken thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the text: "methodically curious" appears three times, "shielded openness" four times, "empathy/empathetic" six times, often in adjacent or near-adjacent lines without added pressure. Synonym churn is visible in the vault's description ("rain-scoured fresco vault," "the vault's indifferent frescoes," "the vault's shadowed alcoves," "back in the vault that evening") and the chapel's acoustics ("whispers," "murmurs," "hush," "silence"). Figurative density at key beats—"rain lashed the windscreen, mirroring the vault's scourge"; "the henge above thrummed with wind, as if the chapel exhaled long-held breath"—muddles clarity with mixed metaphors. The closure paragraph stacks summary assertions ("Now, known embraced unknown, silence interpreted with empathy's gentle touch") instead of propelling through image, triggering artifact penalties and disallowing 9+ globally per the filter-verb and template-cadence rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The map-framer protagonist and hidden-chapel premise offer a specific synthesis, but the emotional arc (lonely expert finds forgotten place, releases grief) follows a familiar template without transformation. The dual-video comparison method is sketched but not used on the page to solve a problem or constrain a choice; it becomes setup without payoff. The "whispered chapel where voices dissolved" and "silence that unraveled minds" invoke stock Gothic folklore without fresh inflection. The keystone mechanism and priest letters appear late as convenient solutions rather than complications that test Elias's values or risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias's perceptive map-framer identity is present in the opening (loupe, cartographic framing) and at closure (frames the map anew), bracketing the story. His perception drives two beats: noticing the map tear and discerning the archway misalignment in the video comparison. However, these observations lead to discovery without forcing a choice that forecloses an option or incurs visible cost; his decisions (email a colleague, drive to the site, clear debris, press the keystone) advance plot but do not dramatize constraint or trade-off tied to his perceptive skill.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ancient henge dominates the 1920s map center, appears in both video reels, and frames the physical site visit where Elias paces the northeast flank. It anchors three distinct beats (map study, video comparison, on-site excavation) and its spatial layout (northeast flank, archway misalignment) enables the discovery. However, the henge itself is not handled or reweighted; it remains a static landmark rather than an object whose properties constrain choice or charge the final image. The closure returns to the vault and the framed map, not the henge, reducing its participation in the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The whispered chapel is named on the torn map, drives the archive search and road trip, and is the literal destination. It appears in three beats (map reveal, lore summary, physical descent) and shapes the dominant stake. However, its core concept—voices dissolving into "profound, empathetic hush," acoustics that "amplify breaths into sacred voids"—is described rather than experienced; Elias does not speak, listen, or test the silence on the page, so the concept remains thematic assertion rather than on-page constraint or sensory pressure. The chapel's role in closure is summary ("silence interpreted with empathy's gentle touch") not dramatized action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Methodically curious" is labeled three times across the text and attributed to Elias's archival cross-referencing and frame-by-frame video comparison. It enables the discovery by motivating the research, but no on-page scene shows the trait creating a cost (e.g., obsessive focus that alienates a colleague, time pressure that forces a choice between thoroughness and safety). The trait is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reopen" is the story's climactic action: Elias presses the keystone, the chapel exhales, hidden compartments spill parchments, and the letters redefine the site's history. The action appears late (final third) but transforms prior setup (the seal's flaw captured on video, the chapel's lore) and is causally earned by Elias's comparison work. It drives the discovery beat and charges the ending image (framing the map anew, the chapel's symbol whole). However, the action is convenient—no physical cost, no risk of collapse, no ethical hesitation—reducing its felt price and capping it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method—comparing silent 1962 and 2023 drone footage—is signaled early (archive search), occupies a full beat (laptop sync, frame-by-frame analysis), and yields the key clue (shadow pooling, archway misalignment, seismic shifts). It enables the discovery and is specific to Elias's perceptive skill. However, the mechanics are summarized ("he synced them on his laptop, muting all sound") rather than dramatized with tactical friction (e.g., file corruption, ambiguous data that forces a guess). The method does not constrain a choice or impose cost; it functions as a clean puzzle solution, capping it mid-band despite setup and development presence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault anchors the opening and closing brackets, its "faded saints whose eyes seemed to follow" and "shadowed alcoves" housing the archives that enable Elias's research. The vault's sensory atmosphere (damp chill, thunder, crumbling sublevel) mirrors the chapel's rain-scoured frescoes in a purposeful echo. However, the vault does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it remains a vivid backdrop rather than a micro-setting that pressures decisions. The lyric reprise at closure ("he smiled faintly at the fresco saints") reweights the opening image with Elias's "shielded openness," qualifying the setting for mid-band credit under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe—"at the spot where a map tears, dividing known from unknown"—is the story's conceptual hinge and spatial metaphor. The tear occurs early (map-framing beat) and the coordinates guide the site visit, so the spot shapes the middle and ending geographically. However, "timeframe" is misapplied here; the element reads as spatial threshold rather than temporal pressure. No clock or deadline tightens decisions; Elias's research, drive, and descent proceed without time constraint. The prompt element is present but functionally ornamental as a timeframe, reducing its integration score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To interpret silence with empathy" is stated as Elias's motivation, rooted in grief over his father's "vanishing words," and repeated across the text ("empathizing with the silence," "interpreted the chapel's silence with profound empathy," "silence interpreted with empathy's gentle touch"). It frames the archive search and shapes the thematic lens. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; no on-page beat shows Elias torn between empathy and another want (e.g., professional credit, speed, self-protection). The descent and discovery proceed without friction tied to this desire, capping it below mid-band despite setup and thematic presence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Shielded openness" is labeled four times and defined as Elias's stance ("he shared discoveries sparingly, guarding vulnerabilities like fragile vellum"). The tone appears in the opening (solitary work, saints' eyes watching), modulates slightly when he emails a colleague ("his shielded openness cracked slightly"), and returns at closure ("reflecting his shielded openness"). It brackets the story and aligns with the vault's enclosed-yet-expansive atmosphere. However, the tone is asserted through repeated label rather than embodied in diction, rhythm, or choice architecture; the prose remains consistently elevated and figurative regardless of pressure, reducing tonal modulation. The lyric reprise qualifies for mid-band credit under the resonance allowance, but lack of tactical constraint or closure charge prevents higher scores.</comment>
