<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (honor ancestor, reverse exile) is clear and drives the archive search, but her "nervously confident" trait reads as label-only repetition without embodied contradiction—she trembles yet speaks in "ringing declarations" without cost to either impulse. Internal conflict is declared rather than enacted in micro-choices under pressure. The crew and Dr. Hale appear late as convenience figures; Hale's confession arrives without prior resistance, flattening what could have been a crucible moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with some Accumulative layering (fog, dread motifs). Orientation anchors arrive early (station, Elara, fog shroud), satisfying the test. The closure—transmission of evidence reversing the exile—lands on the page as a Decisive Change, but the cost is vague: "spongey dread lingered" and "greater exiles ahead" gesture at consequence without specifying what Elara forfeited or what path closed. The nail-unlocks-logs sequence provides one meaningful tightening, but Hale's instant confession and the guild's "cascade of affirmations" feel convenience-driven rather than earned through prior escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The weather station's fog, buckled dome, and weeping walls establish a vivid, oppressive atmosphere filtered through Elara's librarian lens (charts, archives). "Spongey dread" recurs as both sensory and thematic texture. The copper nail's verdigris glyphs and the crate's false bottom offer tactile micro-setting that charges two beats (discovery, vault unlock), meeting the 9+ gate criterion of constraining choice. However, spatial choreography between archive and command vault is thin, and the "roiling sea below" appears once without integrating into action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reversing family exile—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara cross-references the nail's glyphs to unlock Thorne's suppressed logs, narrowing her tactical path. However, escalation is undercut by convenience: Hale's confession arrives without resistance, the guild affirms instantly via "stuttering arrays," and no live choice forces Elara to trade competing goods. The cost of success (lingering dread, future exiles) is atmospheric rather than a visible forfeit that alters her stance or options on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—honor versus institutional suppression, the cost of vindication—emerges from Elara's archive work and the ancestor's overlooked bravery. The copper nail and coded stanzas function as concrete particulars that avoid overt moralizing. Yet the final lines veer toward thematic summary: "spongey dread endured… maps could only chart so far before the unknown nailed them shut" restates rather than reweights. The reversal of exile lands as resolution but does not pose a resonant question or non-literal answer that deepens prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable. Elara's perceptual signature—map-librarian diction, chart metaphors—is consistent, and the opening establishes narrative distance. However, "nervously confident" recurs as a label across multiple beats without syntactic variation, flattening voice under pressure. Dr. Hale's brief dialogue ("your logs hid it to claim credit!") lands on-page but carries little subtext or goal-driven indirection. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or tense slips mar the lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: "spongey dread" appears eight times, often in adjacent sentences ("spongey dread permeated… spongey portent… Spongey dread thickened… spongey dread lingered… Yet spongey dread endured"). Mixed metaphors muddle peak beats: fog "absorbing resolve like a vast, insidious sponge," then dread is "spongey," then the nail "pulsing with spongey portent"—the vehicle collapses under repetition. Template cadence runs through multiple "nervously confident" insertions and synonym loops ("declared stakes," "ringing declarations," "steady despite quivering knees"). Paraphrase loops recur: "reversible exile haunted her dreams; one decoded truth could reinstate their name" is re-stated in "The guild exiled him reversibly… pending proof like this." Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("jet stream's cataclysmic shift," "insidious sponge") that clashes with librarian particularity. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: loops and template cadence across multiple beats, touching the closure paragraph ("spongey dread endured") → baseline −1.0 in Q7, escalated to −1.4 for touching closure, plus disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The experimental weather station and jet-stream premise offer a fresh framing, and the copper coffin nail as cartographic key is a specific, non-obvious choice. However, the "suppressed genius ancestor vindicated by hidden evidence" structure is a widely used template, and the story does not transform it through moral calculus or lived cost—Elara's success arrives without genuine obstacle or renunciation. The coded stanzas ("The nail that binds the storm's own heart") read as ornamental rather than puzzle mechanics that shape attempts. Transformation is partial; the nail's specificity earns partial credit, but the arc remains familiar.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her archival work (opening crate, cross-referencing glyphs, confronting Hale) drives the sequence. However, her key decision—to transmit the evidence—occurs late (final third) without a visible trade-off or competing pressure that her idealism must overcome. The librarian trait colors perception (charts, journals) but does not constrain a pivotal on-page choice with cost. Setup clear, development functional, closure participation present but passive (evidence "transmitted… via stuttering arrays"). Two gates met; causal pressure moderate; swappable with "determined archivist" without major edits. Band: functional, one beat involvement, late closure action → ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The copper nail appears in three distinct beats: discovery in crate's false bottom (embodied: "fingers… traced its length"), alignment with journal margins to unlock hidden flaps, and slotting into map-case lock to spring open Thorne's final chart. Setup early (~30% mark), development (unlocking), payoff (final chart reveal). Causal pressure: the nail's glyphs enable the unlock, narrowing Elara's tactical path. However, the nail does not appear in or shape the closure image—transmission and guild affirmation proceed without it. Specificity high (verdigris, cartographic glyphs, coffin provenance); cost connection indirect (unlocks proof, but Elara's stance unchanged). Three gates + two beats + causal pressure + specificity, minus no closure linkage → ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Reversible exile" is named early, frames Elara's goal ("one decoded truth could reinstate their name"), and the reversal lands on-page ("reversing the exile in a cascade of guild affirmations"). Setup clear, payoff explicit. However, the concept does not constrain middle tactics—Elara's archive work proceeds identically whether exile is reversible or permanent. The final paragraph's "reversible only by bolder hands" gestures at future stakes but does not reweight the present closure with cost. Two gates (setup, payoff), no middle constraint, closure participation declarative rather than charged → ~5.7.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Nervously confident" is repeated across five beats ("adjusted… with trembling fingers yet spoke in ringing declarations," "nervously confident, she cross-referenced," "nervously confident, she aligned," "Question this, she demanded nervously confident," "smiled nervously confident"). Label recurs but does not constrain a choice with visible cost—Elara's actions (opening crate, confronting Hale, transmitting evidence) proceed without the trait altering outcome or forcing a trade-off between nerve and confidence. Setup early, beats numerous, but integration ornamental: a swappable descriptor without causal pressure. Present across beats, zero cost connection, late closure mention decorative → ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Question" drives two beats: Elara questions the station's archives (leading to vault confrontation) and demands Hale "Question this" while presenting evidence. Setup implicit (idealistic librarian challenging authority), development (confrontation), payoff (Hale's confession). The action enables the turn but is swappable with "investigate," "challenge," or "confront" without altering structure. Causal pressure moderate; cost indirect (Hale recoils, confesses, but no visible price for Elara's interrogation). Two gates, one major beat, moderate pressure, high swappability → ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Coded stanzas appear in three beats: faded ink reveals them (~40% mark), Elara cross-references rhythms against family lore, and "stanzas intensified" to unlock hidden flaps. Setup mid-story (late for high scores), development (cross-reference, unlock), payoff (decoded overlays project Thorne's maps). Causal: the stanzas' mechanics (rhythm patterns, glyphs alignment) enable the unlock. However, the method is announced rather than taught—reader does not see Elara attempt, fail, adapt. Specificity high (poetic veils over coordinates), cost connection indirect. Three gates (late setup), two beats, causal enable, no false-bottom reveal → ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The experimental weather station is named early, its fog and buckled dome establish atmosphere, and the command vault supplies the confrontation space. The setting provides resources (archive, crate, console, arrays) but does not constrain Elara's choices—she could transmit evidence from any location with similar tools. Micro-setting (nail, journals) does more causal work than the station itself. Setup strong, development atmospheric, closure participation minimal (arrays mentioned but not pressured by station's state). One beat (vault scene), low constraint, postcard function dominant → ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the jet stream shifts" frames the premise (station marooned in fog, pre-shift maps suppressed) and recurs thematically ("the shifted jet stream whispered of greater exiles ahead"). Setup clear, thematic payoff present. However, the timeframe does not tighten Elara's decisions—no clock pressure, no urgency driven by "after" versus "during." The shift is backstory context rather than a live constraint. Two gates (setup, thematic closure), zero tactical pressure, swappable with "following the climate disaster" → ~4.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to honor Thorne and reverse exile is declared early ("deepest motivation burned beneath"), dramatized through archive work (salvaging journals, decoding stanzas, confronting Hale), and resolved on-page (transmission, guild affirmation, "Thorne's name etched into history"). Setup early, development (salvage, decode, confront), payoff explicit. However, the motivation does not face a competing cost—Elara never weighs honoring Thorne against another want or fear. Friction minimal: guild affirmation arrives without resistance. Three gates, one major beat (confrontation), cost indirect → ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Spongey dread" is named early, recurs across eight beats (permeated, thickened, spongey portent, lingered, endured), and charges the final image ("spongey dread endured… nailed them shut"). Tone coherent through turns, modulates with escalation (thickens during confrontation). However, overuse flattens rather than deepens—repetition without variation dulls the charge. The tone constrains mood but not choice; Elara's actions proceed identically regardless of dread's intensity. Setup early, pervasive presence, closure linkage strong, but integration ornamental and loop-heavy. Three gates, high recurrence, zero cost connection, line-level debt → ~5.4.</comment>
