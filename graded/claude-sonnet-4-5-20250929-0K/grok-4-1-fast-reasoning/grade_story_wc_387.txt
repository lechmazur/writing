<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kai's interiority is present but abstract ("appreciate the hidden effort," "philosophy unfurled") rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. The final mending choice feels thematically declared rather than earned by prior pressure—no visible cost or foreclosed path. Emotions are asserted ("demure audacity," "scintillatingly somber") via external labels instead of dramatized in gesture or micro-choice. No secondary character exerts on-page pressure to test Kai's stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors are present early (Kai, parapet, lagoon). The ending attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via charged imagery ("patterns eternal, effort forever honored"), but the cost remains abstract—no on-page action or forfeiture makes the before/after legible with felt price. The net-mending sequence provides one tightening but does not narrow live options or force a trade-off. Causality is loose: fireflies "respond" to whistling without clear motivation or stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting details (parapet, mossy balustrade, lagoon, moon paths) are vivid and purposeful. The bamboo whisk functions as a micro-setting tool in two beats (tea-whisking, net-teasing), constraining one choice. Sensory selection is rich but occasionally drifts toward catalog ("glistening mist," "humid air," "rain-scented"). Spatial choreography is clean across the descent and return. The moon path guides movement but does not impose a hard constraint or charge the final image with irreversible stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to appreciate hidden effort"—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or a hard choice. The net-mending provides one functional beat but no reversal or cost: Kai simply completes the task. Fireflies and moon paths complicate atmosphere but do not force tactical trade-offs. No visible price is paid; the ending declares triumph ("quiet triumph," "demure audacity reigned") without a dramatized forfeiture or consequence that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme (hidden effort, invisible labor) emerges clearly from net-mending and tea-whisking particulars. However, the ending resorts to direct statement ("This is the audacity," "effort forever honored") and near-moralizing ("philosophy: demure in daily mending, audacious in nocturnal revelation"). The final image does not reweight prior material non-literally; instead it summarizes the thesis. Motifs (whisk, fireflies, moon paths) recur but do not constrain choice or accumulate pressure that charges closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (Kai's focus on nets, patterns, webs) but diction drifts into elevated register ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity," "gossamer webs") that feels authorial rather than focalizer-specific. Interiority relies on filter verbs ("sought to appreciate," "contemplated") and abstract philosophy. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the mending sequence. No dialogue to assess. Rhythm is controlled but occasionally formulaic (repeated "Kai [verb]" openings).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Density of figurative language is high across most paragraphs ("veil of glistening mist," "demure audacity," "scintillatingly somber," "gossamer webs," "moonpaths") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Template cadence appears in runs: "Kai [verb]" opens multiple sentences. Several paraphrase loops: "appreciate the hidden effort" recurs in three near-identical phrasings; "patterns" is repeated without added pressure. Register drifts into corporate/academic ("unyielding rhythm," "audacious in its claim," "reweights") outside the net-mender's plausible lexicon. Pronoun references and grammar are clean. Combined artifacts penalize −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The net-mender philosopher frame offers mild freshness, but the emotional arc (solitary contemplation → insight → affirmation) follows a familiar template without transformation. Core tropes (tea ceremony as meditation, fireflies as ephemeral beauty, moon paths as spiritual guide) are executed competently but not reinvented. The ending's "demure audacity" and "scintillatingly somber" feel like aesthetic gestures rather than earned synthesis. No bold structural risk; the piece walks a safe middle path with elevated diction masking conventional movement.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kai is present throughout and performs the net-mending choice, but the choice does not create a key turn—no prior opposition or cost. His observation dominates; the decision to mend is functional rather than transformative. Setup clear, middle and closure participation present, but causal pressure is minimal. Swappable with "solitary craftsman" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The bamboo whisk appears in two distinct beats: tea-whisking (paragraph 8–9) and net-teasing (paragraph 28). Setup is early, middle development uses it functionally, and it is mentioned again near closure ("bowl and whisk in hand," "whisked fresh tea"). However, its return does not reweight meaning or constrain the final choice—it remains a static tool. Functional across beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Hidden patterns" is signaled early ("patterns emerge in the swirling foam," "hidden patterns beneath the surface") and shapes Kai's motivation. It appears in the net-mending beat ("Hidden patterns unveiled themselves") and the ending ("patterns eternal"). However, it functions more as theme than stake-altering tactic; discovering patterns does not narrow options or impose cost. Present across beats but does not drive a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Scintillatingly somber" is applied twice to fireflies as descriptive label without constraining action or enabling a choice. It appears mid-story (paragraph 12, 30) but does not shape tactics or carry visible cost. Ornamental use that could be replaced with "melancholy" or "ephemeral" without structural change. Late signal, no development, no closure link.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Whistling appears in three beats: initial melody (paragraph 20), fireflies "responding" (paragraph 22), and a final note of thanks (paragraph 31). Setup is clear, middle development shows fireflies aligning ("Responding, the fireflies swirled tighter"), and it recurs near closure. However, the whistling does not create a major turn or redefine options—it facilitates atmosphere rather than altering stakes. Functional but swappable with "humming" or "singing."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"By following moon paths" is signaled in paragraph 16 ("true wisdom lay... in following moon paths"), executed in the descent (paragraph 23–24), and mentioned at closure ("By following moon paths, he had traced not just light"). Setup and closure participation are present. However, the mechanics are vague—moon paths guide movement but do not impose constraint or cost. One functional beat (descent) without causal pressure. Replaceable with "following the shoreline" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The whispering parapet after rain is anchored early (paragraph 1–3) and returns at closure (paragraph 32–36). It provides spatial grounding and atmospheric charge ("parapet where the wind whispered secrets," "parapet's returning whispers"). The setting enables the net-mending choice by offering vantage and descent path. However, it does not impose a hard constraint—Kai could mend elsewhere. Setup, middle use (descent steps), and closure reprise all present. Essential for spatial logic but not irreplaceable for stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Firefly season is signaled in the opening (paragraph 2, "Firefly season painted the twilight") and recurs ("fireflies dimmed one by one, their season's brevity," "In firefly season's embrace"). It provides temporal color and thematic resonance but does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline. Time is untracked; no urgency or cost derives from the season itself. Present across beats as atmosphere, not as causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To appreciate hidden effort" is stated explicitly (paragraph 5) and drives Kai's reflection and net-mending choice. Setup is early, the mending beat dramatizes the motivation (paragraph 28–29), and closure echoes it ("effort forever honored"). However, the desire is never conflicted—no friction between cost and want. Told more than shown through contradictory micro-choices. Functional motivation without dramatized tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Demure audacity" is declared three times (paragraph 11, 33, 36) as label rather than enacted through tone modulation. The prose alternates between elevated ("scintillatingly somber") and contemplative register but does not dramatize bold/modest tension in diction or rhythm under pressure. Static mood persists; no tonal shift that charges the final image. Present as theme claim, not as coherent tonal design.</comment>
