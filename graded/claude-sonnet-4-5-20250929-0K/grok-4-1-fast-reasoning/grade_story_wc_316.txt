<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kai's motivation (defeating numbness through clone merging) is stated but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The protagonist remains passive—seizing the jar and invoking a rite without visible internal friction or cost that forecloses a live path. Elara functions as a cardboard obstacle whose "true fear" is exposed by the Blade rather than revealed through dramatized pressure. No embodied emotion or mistake-driven escalation; the numbness that should complicate his choices is merely label-speak ("numbness fueling resolve").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: by ~120 words we have "floating rock dojo" and "clone custody battle," but the Blade of Verity decree, the jar's mechanics, and the vivification rite arrive as plot furniture rather than causally motivated turns. The custody trial nominally frames the scene, yet Kai's victory hinges on invoking an altar ritual never foreshadowed—resolving a problem the element did not help create. No meaningful tightening under pressure; the "complementary opposites" method is announced at the climax rather than shaping prior attempts. Closure unit: the brain vivifies and they touch palms, but the cost (numbness shattered, feelings flood) is asserted rather than paid on the page through forfeited options or visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo, temporal vortices, and central altar are vividly named and carry genre atmosphere. The jar appears in multiple beats (clutched, seized, placed on altar) and the Blade slices illusions, giving tactile presence. However, spatial choreography during the clash remains abstract—no clear distances or body positions—and the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The setting decorates rather than pressures; micro-setting exception not met because the jar and Blade function as plot keys, not lived constraints.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vivify the duplicate to cure numbness) is signaled early but remains abstract. The custody "battle" consists of Kai lunging once, slicing projected illusions, and summoning drones that evaporate—no adaptive counterpressure from Elara, no visible trade-off or foreclosed option. The dojo wards repel her at the climax, externalizing the win. Escalation is nominal; the rite succeeds because it is invoked, not because Kai surrenders something or navigates a meaningful reversal. Coincidence (altar mechanics, wards) resolves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme of ego death and complementary wholeness is stated explicitly ("dissolution" vs. "individuation," "opposites harmonized") rather than emerging from concrete choices. The jar's "duplicate" label is invoked as symbolic recurrence but never reweights a prior decision. The ending declares "no more void; only vibrant now" in moralizing summary rather than offering a resonant image that reframes the question. Subtext is absent; every thematic claim is voiced on the surface.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction often inflates to elevated register ("pristine echo arguing," "sigils that bound opposites") that clashes with present-tense crisis urgency. Dialogue from Elara and the clone is serviceable but generic; no perceptual signature distinguishes Kai's noticing—he observes temporal rewrites and his own emotional void in equally detached syntax. Purposeful compression is not taught; the prose remains expository throughout, summarizing rather than inhabiting pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Heavy scaffold and paraphrase loops: "complementary opposites" is restated three times within four lines at the climax; "pretense" recurs mechanically across beats without evolving pressure. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "Kai—no longer survivor alone, but dyad," "Custody battle etched," "No more void; only vibrant now," "The end." Stock metaphors ("ink in water," "clouds parting") and filter-verb stacks ("felt the rock's pulse") dull immediacy. Figurative language saturates high-pressure beats without coherent vehicles—mixed metaphors like "sigils that bound opposites" and "tendrils extruding, reforming." Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Core premise (psychedelic ego death survivor + clone custody + floating dojo + rewriting timelines) stacks high-concept elements without grounding any in lived specificity or credible world logic. The "Blade of Verity" that "slices through pretense" is allegorical convenience. Vivification via "complementary opposites" on a "yin-yang fractal altar" reads as mystical shorthand rather than a transformation of familiar tropes. Emotional stakes (numbness vs. wholeness) echo therapy-speak templates. No risk-taking that heightens coherence; the synthesis feels ornamental rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Kai is present throughout but makes no key decision that alters tactics—he lunges, invokes the rite, and the environment (wards, altar) completes the work. Ego death is label-only backstory; his survivor status does not constrain a choice or generate visible friction on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The jar appears in setup (Elara clutches it), is seized mid-clash, and placed on the altar at the climax—three beats with evolving function. Its label "duplicate" is mentioned early and reprised at the end ("relic of division overcome"), reweighting slightly. However, the jar itself does not constrain a choice; it is a required prop whose properties (nutrient fluid, pulsing brain) are static. Causal pressure is modest; Kai's blood mingles with the fluid, but the mechanics are asserted rather than dramatized as a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Clone custody battle frames the scene and provides the nominal stake. The "trial by the Blade of Verity" is decreed, and Kai "wins custody" when the dojo wards affirm his truth. However, the legal/guardianship dimension is ornamental—no procedural constraint, no adaptive argument from Elara, no tactical choice shaped by custody rules. The concept appears early and at closure but does not narrow options or force a meaningful trade-off in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The Blade "slices through pretense" in three beats: Elara's illusions, false histories, and Kai's own "lingering pretense of self-sufficiency." The trait enables action but never imposes a visible cost or trade-off. Removing "slices through pretense" and replacing it with "cuts through deception" would not alter story logic—swappable metaphor, no unique constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Vivify is introduced at the climax, drives the final beat (brain convulses, neurons fire, humanoid form emerges), and delivers the closure image (palms touch, numbness shatters). The action is signaled by the jar's presence and Kai's stated goal early, and it redefines his emotional state at the end. However, vivification mechanics are announced rather than tested across beats—no failed attempt, no middle constraint. Causal linkage is modest; the act itself is consequence-free ceremony rather than a choice with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Complementary opposites" is named as "ancient dojo lore" in the middle and invoked at the altar: Kai channels "ego-death void" while the duplicate offers "ego-rebirth." The method appears in two beats but is described rather than dramatized—no tactical constraint, no failure when imbalance occurs. Easily swappable with "merge through sacrifice" or similar mystical frame. Missing setup; first mentioned past the midpoint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo is anchored early with vivid detail (obsidian slab, temporal vortices, shimmering barriers, central altar). It supplies the altar for the rite and wards that repel Elara at the climax—two functional beats. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or force a tactical adaptation; Kai does not navigate spatial limits or resource scarcity. The levitation and vortices are postcard atmosphere; the altar could exist in any mystical chamber with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"History rewrites itself" is present throughout (empires rise/crumble, faces morph, wars end, survival morphs to fatality) and the dojo "trembles as anchors strain" during the climax. Time pressure is asserted but never tightens a decision—no countdown, no tactical trade-off between speed and precision. The rewrites function as spectacle rather than constraint. Removing the timeframe would not break the custody trial or vivification logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Defeating emotional numbness is stated as Kai's motivation in the opening and paid off when "numbness shattered as feelings flooded" at the end. The desire shapes the dominant stake and the final image reweights it. However, the numbness is never dramatized as a friction that complicates his choices—he "feels nothing" yet pursues the duplicate with unwavering resolve. No contradictory want or visible cost in middle beats; the motivation is told rather than tested under pressure.</comment>
