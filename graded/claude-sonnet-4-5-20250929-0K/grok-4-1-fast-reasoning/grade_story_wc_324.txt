<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated clearly ("to protect vulnerable voices") but her choices feel mechanical rather than embodied. The hearing-aid device triggers action through exposition ("she'd traced such links before") rather than dramatized struggle. Clara's suicidal crisis is told in a single line ("Clara had come to end it all") without prior behavioral cues, making the stakes feel imported rather than earned. Internal contradiction is absent; Elara moves through beats as a facilitator without competing impulses under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The orientation test fails: who Elara is, what "contact tracer for hearts" means operationally, and where the atrium sits in the sanatorium remain unclear past 120 words, triggering −0.4. The closure unit—Clara choosing to live—arrives via Evelyn's voice and the photograph, but the causal chain is thin: Elara's curiosity leads to the aid, which delivers a message that changes Clara's mind in two beats with no visible cost to Elara herself. The lens reads Situational (coincidence complicates), but the hearing aid's mechanics are never constrained or tested, so pressure does not crystallize through stance. Closure occurs on the page but cost is displaced onto Clara's tears rather than Elara's agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is signaled early and recurs as a tonal anchor, but it does not constrain choice or supply tactical friction. The hearing aid (an object) and the photograph function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image when Clara takes the photo home. Spatial choreography is loose: Elara "moved quietly" to Clara at the balustrade, but distance and blocking remain vague. The setting supports atmosphere but does not narrow options under pressure, capping high-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing Clara's suicide—is signaled midway ("Clara had come to end it all"). One tightening occurs when Elara hears Evelyn's message and approaches Clara, but the escalation is thin: no reversal tests Elara's commitment, and Clara's shift from despair to hope happens in a single exchange without visible cost to Elara. The hearing aid's "pulses spent" suggests a constraint, but it is not dramatized as a tactical limit during the peak beat. Agency resides more in coincidence (finding the aid) than in a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the "vulnerable voices" motif and the notion of incidental heroism, but the final paragraph states it overtly: "Incidental, yes, but heroism bloomed in the quiet acts of listening." The hearing aid and photograph recur with shifted meaning (Clara hangs the photo at home), providing some resonance. However, the ending includes direct moralizing ("She assured the living, bridged by the dead's faint song") rather than letting the image speak. The thematic question—whether curiosity can bridge the living and dead—is answered but not reweighted with ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("Elara's breath caught in the reeling hush") but voice suffers from repeated template cadence: "Elara [verb], [object]" stems dominate, and the prose leans toward elevated register ("ethereal links," "borrowed words") without clear character-specific idiom. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Clara's "For the first time in years, I feel her heartbeat" reads slightly expository. Free indirect style is clean, but the narrative certainty ("she'd traced such links before") asserts expertise without dramatized proof.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "mist-clad atrium" recurs in the opening and closing without evolution, and "vulnerable voices" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence is pervasive: "Elara [verb]" stems run through at least five sentences in the peak beat. Stock metaphors cluster in the atrium scenes ("shadows pooling like forgotten sighs," "mist swirling around her like ghosts"). Filter verbs ("she felt," "she'd traced") stack in high-pressure moments, dulling immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure third, triggering −1.7 and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is moderate; some lines advance multiple jobs, but scaffold sentences ("Her motivation burned deep") summarize rather than show.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—a contact tracer for hearts using a hearing aid to relay messages from the dead—is imaginative but executed through familiar beats: protagonist finds object, object delivers message, message saves suicidal character. The atrium and twilight setting read generic ("mist-clad," "twilight draped") without specific architectural or temporal anchors that would make the world irreplaceable. Emotional specificity is limited; Clara's crisis and resolution follow a template arc. The hearing aid's mechanics (why it hums, how pulses encode voices) remain unexplained, reducing the fresh angle to a label. No bold structural or perspectival risks are taken.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role ("contact tracer for hearts") frames the story, but her choices do not create key turns. She finds the aid (coincidence), uses it (curiosity), and relays the message (facilitation). The decision to approach Clara is not shown as a dilemma with cost. Her occupation is stated but not dramatized through specific tracing work. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but swappable with a generic empath or medium without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The photograph appears in beat one (setup), is handed to Clara in the peak beat (middle), and is hung in Clara's home at closure (payoff). It shifts from lost object to talisman, reweighting meaning across the arc. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose cost; Clara's shift is driven by the hearing-aid message, not the photo itself. The photo's content (mother and daughter) is described but not used tactically. Two gates plus closure presence, but causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Incidental heroism" is stated explicitly in the text ("Incidental heroism unfolded then, unplanned as the mist's curl") and again in the final third, but it does not shape on-page tactics or choices. Elara's curiosity is framed as incidental, yet the narrative treats her intervention as purposeful. The concept functions as a thematic label rather than a constraint that alters options under pressure. Present as theme claim, not as stake architecture.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Persistently curious" is stated twice ("Persistently curious by nature," "Persistently curious, Elara wondered") and motivates Elara's choice to use the hearing aid despite caution. This creates one on-page action with implied cost ("she shouldn't tamper, but her persistent curiosity overrode caution"). However, no visible consequence follows the override; the aid delivers the message without complication. Present in setup and middle, with one beat involvement, but no felt cost limits eligibility.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Assure" appears in Evelyn's message relayed through the aid ("Assure her... tell her the fight was love's fear, not hate") and is enacted when Elara tells Clara ("Elara pressed on... 'She wants me to assure you'"). The action is central to Clara's shift and returns in the phone call ("Elara assured her again"). However, the assurance itself does not require a tactical choice or cost from Elara; she channels the message rather than risking her own stance. Two beats plus closure linkage, but swappable with "tell" or "convince" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The hearing aid is introduced in beat one, used to hear Evelyn's voice in beat two, and goes silent ("pulses spent") in beat three, shaping the peak turn. Its mechanics—tracking faint pulses—are stated but not tested or constrained; it works when needed and stops when convenient. The method is signaled early and drives two beats, but its operation reads as authorial convenience rather than a puzzle Elara must solve. Setup, middle, and closure presence, but no visible friction or cost tied to the method itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is established in the opening and recurs as a tonal frame ("twilight deepened, mist veiling the arches once more"). It provides atmosphere but does not constrain choice or supply tactical resources; Elara and Clara's exchange could occur in any private space. The balustrade is mentioned once as Clara's location but does not function as a precipice in dramatized action. Present throughout, but ornamental rather than causal. Setup and closure presence, but no middle development.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"When the dead call" is described as "the hour when the dead called, faint echoes stirring through the veil at dusk's edge" and returns in the closing ("When the dead called at twilight, she'd be there"). The timeframe is atmospheric but does not tighten decisions; no clock or deadline pressures Elara's choices. Twilight is a setting detail, not a constraint. Present as setup and thematic closure echo, but no middle tactical use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"To protect vulnerable voices" is stated as Elara's motivation ("Her motivation burned deep: to protect vulnerable voices") and returns in the closing ("Vulnerable voices found protection in her relentless pursuit"). It frames her reason for staying late and using the aid, but it is not conflicted or tested by a competing desire. The motivation enables one choice (approaching Clara) but does not impose visible cost or force a trade-off. Present in setup, middle decision, and thematic close, but told rather than dramatized through friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Reeling hush" appears in the opening ("shadows pooling like forgotten sighs") and at the peak beat ("Elara's breath caught in the reeling hush"). The tone is coherent across turns, modulating from curiosity to urgency to quiet resolve. However, the repeated use of "hush," "mist," and "twilight" creates a static mood rather than a dynamic modulation that charges the final image. Tone supports atmosphere but does not escalate or deepen under pressure. Present throughout with consistent texture, but does not transform at closure.</comment>
