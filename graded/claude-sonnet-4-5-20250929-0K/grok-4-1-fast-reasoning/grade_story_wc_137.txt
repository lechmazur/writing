<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior skepticism-to-openness arc is signaled but not dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The fisherman and other visitors remain one-note conduits for grief without applying pressure that forces Elara into a micro-choice with visible cost. The final "courageously kind" stance is asserted through label-speak ("sympathy stirred," "courageously kind in her vulnerability") rather than shown through embodied contradiction. Mother's presence is entirely retrospective, weakening present-tense agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (tower, cliffs, whale migration) promptly and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: memories unlock, transcription accumulates, visitors arrive. However, the closure lacks a decisive reweighting with visible cost—Elara moves from skeptic to believer off-page between paragraphs ("Elara's skepticism cracked"), and the final image ("gratitude, release, wonder") summarizes emotional states rather than landing a charged moment. The tile's unlocking of memories reads as convenient coincidence that resolves rather than complicates, and no persistent constraint shapes the final transcription choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tower, cliffs, and whale migration establish vivid spatial and temporal anchors. The magic square tile is handled across multiple beats (fisherman deposits it, Elara examines it, aligns it with star charts, places it at platform's heart), and the tile's grid properties constrain the transcription method. However, the tower itself does not force a tactical choice at closure; it remains backdrop rather than active constraint. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (salt air, lantern light, roiling sea).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to investigate the tile and honor the fisherman's grief—is signaled early but never genuinely tested. Elara's vow to transcribe is made alone without opposition or trade-off, and the tile warms and "unlocks" memories through plot convenience rather than protagonist struggle. The fisherman's return with tears provides an emotional beat but no escalation; visitors arrive and receive pages without friction. One tightening (skepticism cracks) occurs, but the cost is told rather than shown in a constrained choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of skepticism softened by entangled grief emerges from the tile's mechanics and the tower's function as reflective space. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "her courageously kind transcription wove a new constellation of shared solace, skepticism softened by the pull of entangled hearts" reads as a thesis statement rather than an earned, non-literal answer. The unheard symphony motif recurs but functions as atmospheric decoration rather than a pattern that constrains or reweights the ending choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature (skeptic filtering myth through doubt, then wonder) is present but undercut by label-heavy interiority: "sympathetic skeptic," "courageously kind," "sympathy stirred." The prose maintains a consistent lyric register, though diction occasionally drifts into abstract elevation ("quanta of experience linked across time") without grounding in Elara's idiom. Dialogue from the fisherman ("Cursed thing, it whispers of the drowned") carries subtext, but his single appearance limits judgment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs appear: "sympathetic skeptic… courageously kind… sculpting space" recurs verbatim across paragraphs without evolution; "courageously kind" appears four times as unearned shorthand. Stock phrases cluster in peak beats ("skepticism cracked," "symphony swelled unheard"). Figurative density in the closure paragraphs (constellation, symphony, entangled hearts) stacks without pattern-teaching. Information density is uneven—key causal beats (memories unlock, transcription happens) are summarized in single lines while atmospheric detail receives extended treatment. The read-aloud test reveals repetitive openings ("Elara," "As") and a drumbeat of declarative syntax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise (magic square unlocks entangled memories during whale migration) stitches multiple prompt elements but feels assembled rather than synthesized. The emotional arc—skeptic becomes believer through artifact contact—follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived detail or moral calculus. The tile's mechanics (numbers as keys, grid symmetry mirroring migration paths) gesture at fresh world logic but remain under-explained and convenient. No bold risk elevates the execution; the tower as communal grief-space offers a thoughtful angle but the closure retreats to safe, affirming resolution without ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism is declared early and transitions to belief mid-story, but the pivot occurs off-page ("Elara's skepticism cracked") without an on-page choice that narrows options. Her vow to transcribe is made alone, facing no opposition. The "sympathetic skeptic" label recurs but does not constrain a tactical decision with visible cost. Present in setup and ending, weak middle development, and the final stance is summarized rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The magic square tile appears in four beats: fisherman deposits it, Elara examines and aligns it with star charts, it warms and unlocks memories, she places it at the platform's heart in the ending. Its grid properties enable the transcription method (numbers as keys, symmetries mirroring migration paths). However, the tile's mechanics are told rather than shown in use, and its late placement in the final image is decorative rather than causally active. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but swappability (any artifact could unlock memories) and summary-only use lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Entangled memories (mother's and Elara's, later the fisherman's brother's) unlock via the tile and drive the transcription act. The concept shapes the dominant stake (whether to honor the grief by transcribing) and provides the story's central revelation. However, the mechanics are abstract ("quanta of experience linked across time") and the memories arrive through plot convenience rather than protagonist effort. Present in setup (implied by tile's reputation), development (memories flash), and ending (fisherman reads his brother's words). Causal pressure is moderate; the concept enables rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Courageously kind" appears as a label four times but is never dramatized in an on-page choice with visible trade-off. Elara presses tea into the fisherman's hands and shares transcribed pages, but these acts face no opposition or cost. The trait is asserted ("courageously kind hospitality," "courageously kind in her vulnerability") rather than embodied through a decision that forecloses a path. Present across beats as a descriptor, but ornamental; easily swappable with "compassionate" or "generous" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Transcription drives the middle and ending: Elara vows to transcribe, spends a night transcribing memories by aligning the tile with migration routes, and shares the pages with visitors by midday. The act shapes two major beats and provides the mechanism for closure (fisherman reads his brother's words, visitors murmur gratitude). However, the transcription itself is summarized ("quill scratching parchment in frantic rhythm," "line by line, the unheard symphony clarified") rather than shown in specific choices or obstacles. Essential to plot structure but the mechanics lack on-page specificity and cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Forgotten patterns" refers to the magic square's ancient mathematical grid (each row/column/diagonal yielding thirty-four) and Elara's method of aligning it with star charts and migration routes. The method is signaled early (tile's grid described) and shapes the middle attempt (alignment with charts, numbers as keys). However, the mechanics are told rather than dramatized—we do not see Elara working through the pattern's difficulty or discovering its logic through trial. Present in setup, development, and implied at closure, but the method could be replaced with "ancient symbols" or "star alignment" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tower frames the story spatially (open walls, spiral stairs, windswept platform) and provides the communal function (offering telescopes, cushions, lanterns to wanderers). Elara arranges the space to "cradle the broken-hearted," and visitors climb the stairs to receive transcribed pages. The tower supplies the platform where the tile is finally placed as an invitation. However, the tower does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it remains a static venue rather than an active pressure. Present in setup, development, and ending; essential to tone and function but not to plot causality.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Whale migration establishes the timeframe ("annual whale migration") and provides atmospheric texture (silhouettes breach, cetacean chorus, whales crest in synchronized glory). The migration's symmetries mirror the tile's grid, thematically linking elements. However, the migration does not tighten decisions or create urgency—events unfold across "one stormy evening" to "by dawn" to "midday" without the migration imposing a deadline. Present in setup and ending, but the time window does not alter tactics or escalate pressure. Functional background rather than active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elara's desire to "sculpt space for reflection" is declared early (offering corners to wanderers, arranging cushions and lanterns) and motivates her vow to transcribe after the fisherman's visit. The motivation drives the middle transcription sequence and culminates in sharing pages with visitors and placing the tile as an open invitation. However, the motivation is told rather than tested through conflicting wants or costs—Elara faces no friction between this goal and another stake. Present in setup, development, and ending; shapes action but lacks dramatized conflict or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" recurs as a tonal motif (whale calls "no human ear could fully grasp," "rising from the deep," "perpetual, unheard symphony" joined by "human murmurs") and establishes a lyric, elegiac register. The tone modulates subtly from skeptical observation to wonder as Elara's stance shifts. However, the tone remains static through peak beats—no tonal break or cadence shift marks the moment of transformation. The final image repeats the motif without reweighting it. Present across beats and coherent, but does not charge the closure with a decisive tonal turn.</comment>
