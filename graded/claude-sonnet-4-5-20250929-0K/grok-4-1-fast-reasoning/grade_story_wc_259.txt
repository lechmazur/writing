<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to pierce the veil of history's lies") is declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The transformation at the end—"no longer bound by history's tyranny"—arrives via summary and metaphor ("memories fracturing into steadily unpredictable sparks") without on-page micro-choices that reveal cost or foreclosure. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("anguished joy," "heart pounding") and label-only emotion throughout. The final "dance through collapsing halls" reads as convenient competence rather than struggle shaped by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: Who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words; "lost civilization archive" and "saffron-veil historian" function as labels without spatial or temporal grounding (−0.4). The closure unit—Elara shattering her veil and emerging "transformed"—is told rather than shown; the cost ("dissolving personal patterns forever") is asserted in summary, not dramatized with a legible before/after choice. Drive lens appears accumulative/textural but the final image does not reweight prior material through concrete action or perception, only through declaration ("bearer of truths that burned"). The pagoda's mechanics (refracting "atoms of nostalgia") remain abstract metaphor without causal linkage to her transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Capping Q3 at 7.0 per the Orientation Test. The archive is described with vivid fragments ("fractured obelisks," "bioluminescent fungi") but these details do not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics. The pagoda's physical properties (bronze, multifaceted, twilight) are ornamental; its "iridescent fire" repels her early attempts without clear spatial or material logic. Sensory selection remains generic tourist-catalog description ("dust motes danced like fleeting regrets") rather than filtered through professional or personal bias. No tool, body state, or environmental feature charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to pierce the veil of history's lies"—is declared early but remains abstract throughout. Elara's "early attempts failed miserably" and then she "adapted" by "shunning routine," but these moves are summarized in a single paragraph without on-page reversals that narrow options or raise cost. The pagoda's repulsion and later acceptance occur off-stage between summary beats. The final choice to "scatter her own nostalgia's atoms" is told rather than tested; no prior complication or trade-off makes this decision feel constrained. Escalation reads as tell-only intensifiers ("anguish clawed her," "torrent of atoms") without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme—nostalgia as "addictive chains masquerading as balm"—is stated outright in the penultimate paragraph rather than emerging from events. The saffron veil functions as a token motif (symbol of "fleeting joy amid sorrow") mentioned at open and close without constraining a choice or accumulating pressure in between. "Atoms of nostalgia" remains a metaphor with no on-page particulars; the vision of "children laughing" and "sages like her" is generic abstraction. The ending offers a moral thesis ("nostalgia's atoms were the true forbidden knowledge") instead of a resonant image that reweights prior material without stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable but voice is generic high-fantasy register ("shadowed vaults," "fleeting regrets," "fractured obelisks") without character-specific perceptual signature. Diction drifts into elevated metaphor at every turn ("frozen scream of light," "quantum dance," "whirlwind of chaotic insight") with no variation under pressure. Free indirect access to Elara's thoughts remains surfacy ("heart pounding in anguished joy") and relies on label-only emotion. The phrase "anguished joy" recurs five times as a stock descriptor rather than evolving through embodied perception. No dialogue appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Patterned-artifact penalty (−1.0): Heavy figurative density in every line ("dust motes danced like fleeting regrets," "skies heavy with unspoken doom," "soul's fragile weave," "frozen scream of light") without pattern-teaching or payoff; mixed metaphors ("atoms of nostalgia," "quantum dance"); stock metaphor strings ("veil of history's lies," "paradise lost") in peak beats. Paraphrase loops across adjacent sentences: "To pursue the forbidden truth… one must purify the mind" followed by "Purify by avoiding patterns… commanded." Template cadence: "She cataloged… she began to shun… she placed her palm… she saw… she emerged" runs across six paragraphs without syntactic variation. Information density is low; most sentences restate "anguished joy" or "steadily unpredictable" without advancing situation or knowledge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—a historian seeks forbidden knowledge that transforms her—follows a widely used template without fresh synthesis. "Atoms of nostalgia" and "steadily unpredictable" read as prompt-derived labels rather than lived-in world logic or character-specific costs. The saffron veil, bronze prism pagoda, and bioluminescent fungi are vivid but ornamental; none alter Elara's tactics or reveal character through use. The final transformation ("no longer bound by history's tyranny") echoes genre conventions without a non-obvious angle or earned insight that grows from prior particulars. No bold structural or perspectival risk-taking; the linear arc and summary beats favor safety over specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her choices are summarized ("she adapted," "she began to shun routine," "she shattered her veil") rather than dramatized in discrete beats. No single on-page decision creates a key turn; the transformation is declared in the final paragraphs without prior micro-choices that alter tactics. Late first appearance of agency (final third); ornamental use elsewhere (−0.8 combined).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The bronze prism pagoda appears in the second third, is described vividly, repels Elara once, then accepts her touch in the climax. It shapes one beat (the climax) but does not recur with reweighted meaning or constrain earlier choices. The pagoda's mechanics (refracting "atoms of nostalgia") remain metaphor without on-page demonstration of how the bronze or prism properties matter. Late first appearance (−0.4); swappable with "ancient artifact" (−0.6); one beat involvement (+0.4); closure linkage (+0.9); but ornamental in setup and middle (−0.7).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Atoms of nostalgia" is introduced in the middle third as abstract metaphor, recurs in the climax vision, and is named as the "true forbidden knowledge" in the resolution. It does not shape Elara's tactics on the page; her "purification" involves "avoiding patterns" (a separate method) rather than manipulating or resisting nostalgia's atoms. The concept is told rather than enacted; no visible cost tied to it. Late arrival (−0.4); theme-only use (−0.7); summary-only (−0.6); one beat (+0.4); closure mention but not causal (+0.3).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Steadily unpredictable" is introduced in the middle third as a repeated label ("bioluminescent fungi that defied rhythm, pulsing now frantic, now languid"; "Purify by avoiding patterns… only the steadily unpredictable soul"). Elara's adaptation—"devouring scrolls in random sequence, sleeping in erratic bursts"—is summarized in one paragraph without on-page cost or tradeoff. The trait does not constrain a specific action; it functions as thematic echo. Late arrival (−0.5); label-only (−0.8); summary-only (−0.6); one beat (+0.4).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Purify" is signaled early ("one must purify the mind") and recurs across the middle ("early attempts failed," "she adapted," "The pagoda thrummed, purifying her essence") and the ending ("She had purified herself across the end of innocence"). It does not drive major turns; Elara's transformation is declared rather than enacted through discrete purification steps with visible cost. The action could be replaced with "attune" or "transform" with minor edits. Early signal (+0.5); three beats (+1.4); swappable (−0.6); summary-only (−0.6); closure mention (+0.5).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"By avoiding patterns" appears in the middle third ("Purify by avoiding patterns") and is enacted in one summarized paragraph ("devouring scrolls in random sequence, sleeping in erratic bursts, whispering incantations backward"). The method does not shape earlier attempts (her "historian's training demanded order" is told, not tested) or later beats (the final shattering of the veil is metaphor, not pattern-avoidance). Late arrival (−0.4); one beat (+0.4); summary-only (−0.6); swappable with "embrace chaos" (−0.5); closure echo but not causal (+0.3).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "lost civilization archive" is named in the opening and described with vivid fragments ("fractured obelisks," "whispering codices," "bioluminescent fungi"). It does not constrain Elara's choices; she moves freely through it without spatial obstacles or resource scarcity. The collapsing halls in the ending ("archive quaked," "she danced through collapsing halls") add urgency but do not alter her tactics. Early signal (+0.6); two beats (description, collapse) (+0.9); ornamental use (−0.7); no causal pressure (−0.5); closure mention (+0.5).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Across the end of innocence" is named in the title and opening ("crossed the threshold across the end of innocence") and recurs in the final line ("She had purified herself across the end of innocence"). The timeframe remains abstract; no on-page clock or deadline tightens Elara's decisions. "Nights that blurred" and "distant explosions" are mentioned but do not alter her tactics or pace. Early signal (+0.5); lyric reprise (+0.6); ornamental use (−0.8); no causal pressure (−0.7); closure echo (+0.3).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To pursue forbidden knowledge" is signaled early ("Elara sought forbidden knowledge") and recurs across beats ("the kind that unraveled the soul's fragile weave," "forbidden truth hidden within," "forbidden knowledge unleashed by sages like her," "nostalgia's atoms were the true forbidden knowledge"). The motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; Elara never weighs the cost against a competing desire on the page. Early signal (+0.6); three beats (+1.4); no friction or tradeoff (−0.7); summary-only (−0.6); closure linkage (+0.7).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Anguished joy" is introduced early ("heart pounding in anguished joy") and recurs five times as a label across beats ("Anguish clawed her—joy at glimpsing spectral visions," "Anguished joy surged through her," "cry of rapture and grief," "truths that burned with anguished joy"). The tone is static rather than modulating with pressure; it functions as a repeated descriptor without embodied shift. The final image recycles the phrase but does not charge it with new meaning. Early signal (+0.6); four beats (+1.4); label-only (−0.8); static mood (−0.6); closure echo but not reweighted (+0.3).</comment>
