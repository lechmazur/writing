<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elowen's watchful nature is established early and her dye-master training informs perception ("eyes sharp," tracking light shifts), but her interior remains largely observational rather than conflicted. The donor heart's legacy is told more than dramatized through micro-choices; she accepts the magnetism without visible struggle or cost until the climax. The final stance ("listened, no longer puzzled, but enriched") reads as smooth resolution without the contradictory impulses or forfeiture that would make the change feel earned under pressure. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("question quietly explosive") rather than embodied, character-particular thought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the single-scene structure and accumulative lens are clear. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elowen's realization that the donor's gift carries both allure and danger, and her decision to "wield it watchfully" and "illuminate them wisely" crystallizes a stance. However, the cost is conceptual and asserted ("lest the magnet's force crush the bearer") rather than felt on the page through a concrete forfeiture or visible tradeoff in the final beats. The revelation emerges from the wing's pattern rather than from Elowen's active choice under pressure, which softens causal drive even under an accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house, valley-mist, sun trails, and blue morpho wing are vivid and purposeful. The wing constrains Elowen's activity (she must position and rotate it to catch the light) and the sun's path structures the scene's temporal progression, grounding action in environment. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her dye-master's eye ("hue shifts," "iridescent," "scales"), though some phrasing ("valley-mist wonder," "whispering winds") trends ornamental. The setting charges the final image by sustaining the atmosphere through closure, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment constraining choice and charging the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why stories now magnetize to her—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the sun's progression and the wing's changing illumination, tightening via Elowen's tracking and the patrons' approach. However, escalation is primarily situational (the light intensifies, the pattern reveals) rather than driven by Elowen's agency; she observes and rotates the wing but does not face a trade-off or make a difficult choice that narrows options. The final realization and decision to "wield it watchfully" arrive without visible cost or a live option foreclosed on the page, reading as acceptance rather than transformation with price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the wing's iridescent caution—beauty masking peril, magnetism risking overwhelm—and the donor's fate as cautionary echo. The final image ("stories would come... but she would illuminate them wisely") offers a non-literal answer grounded in the wing's lesson. Yet the answer feels stated rather than embodied; "balance wonder and warning" and "wove fates from light and lore" drift toward thematic summary. The piece resists overt moralizing but does not fully trust image alone to carry resonance, and the donor's backstory is told rather than discovered through scene friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature filters through Elowen's dye-master lens ("precise world of vats and pigments," "discerning subtle hue shifts"). Diction is elevated and consistent, with purposeful compression ("question quietly explosive," "voracity," "indelibly"). However, register occasionally spikes into prompt-echo phrasing ("iridescent caution," "valley-mist wonder," "quietly explosive") that reads as imposed rather than emerging from Elowen's interior voice. Syntax is rhythmic but leans toward uniform lyricism; under peak stress (the wing's revelation) the voice does not compress or shift, missing an opportunity for modulation that reflects pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyric and rhythmically controlled, but overwriting and template cadence accumulate. Runs of figurative language in adjacent sentences ("dew on spider silk," "moths to lantern glow," "fermenting toward burst," "prisms," "velvet blue") without causal linkage trigger density penalty. Repeated noun-phrase structures ("the donor, a legendary tale-weaver"; "the gift, quietly explosive"; "the caution sang clearer") and recycled prompt phrases ("quietly explosive," "iridescent caution," "valley-mist wonder") create template feel. Paraphrase loops appear: "stories clung to her" / "tales... drawing her" / "stories magnetized to her" / "narratives... orbiting" across early paragraphs. Filter-verb stacks ("noted how," "tracked," "traced") are voice-consistent but dull immediacy in peak beats. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("heartbeats syncing with the tales yet to unfold"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—donor heart carrying a tale-weaver's magnetism—is fresh, and the floating tea house + sun-trail method offer specific texture. However, the core emotional arc (receiving a mysterious gift, fearing its cost, deciding to wield it wisely) follows a familiar template without transforming it through lived complexity or moral calculus. The wing's revelation and Elowen's realization feel staged for thematic delivery rather than inevitable from prior character pressure. Transformation test: swap "dye master" for another craft and "wing" for another object, and the arc holds unchanged. No bold risk elevates the execution beyond competent synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elowen is present throughout and her watchful trait shapes perception, but her choices (sipping tea, positioning the wing, listening to the storyteller) are observational rather than decisive. She does not face a dilemma or make a turn; the climax is a realization delivered by the wing's pattern, not her agency. Her final decision to "wield it watchfully" is stated, not dramatized through a cost or tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The blue morpho wing appears in the opening third, is handled across multiple beats (positioned, rotated, its scales ignite at midday, folded tenderly at the end), and its hidden pattern delivers the climax revelation. It participates in closure ("its lesson etched indelibly," "talisman") and accumulates pressure. However, the wing is a passive revealer rather than an object Elowen uses to solve or confront a problem she helped create; it could be swapped for another symbolic artifact with minor edits. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, and closure linkage lift it into mid-range, but swappability and lack of unique mechanical necessity cap it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Iridescent caution is seeded early ("core of iridescent caution, a shimmering warning") and returns at the climax ("Iridescent caution flared") to deliver the thematic lesson. It shapes the final stance ("her dye master's vigilance now guarded this narrative allure"). However, it functions primarily as theme rather than a constraint that alters tactics or narrows options on the page. The concept is told and echoed but does not force Elowen into a difficult choice with visible cost, keeping it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" is mentioned twice ("question quietly explosive," "gift, quietly explosive in its voracity") as a label for the donor heart's allure. It does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with a cost; Elowen does not struggle against the explosive pull or pay a price for it within the scene. The trait remains metaphorical description rather than a dramatized force that shapes her tactics, and it is introduced relatively late (past the first third), capping it below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Illuminate" is present early ("illuminate her heart's enigma," "sun trails... could illuminate") and recurs at closure ("illuminate them wisely," "tracking each sun trail"). It frames the action (Elowen tracks the sun's path to reveal the wing's pattern) and anchors the thematic answer. However, the actual mechanism of illumination—rotating the wing in sunlight—could be replaced by another revelatory method without major structural change. Early–final reprise reweights the stake, earning lyric-resonance credit, but swappability and lack of unique necessity keep it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Tracking sun trails is seeded in the first third ("test if the sun trails... could illuminate"), executed across multiple beats (Elowen "noted," "tracked meticulously," "rotating the wing as the light migrated westward," "traced the final sun trail"), and shapes the revelation at midday. The method is specific and its mechanics matter. However, it is passive observation rather than a high-stakes tactic; she could achieve a similar result by waiting for the right light or using another timing device. Multi-beat involvement and causal role lift it into mid-range, but lack of unique necessity and agency caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house is anchored early and sustained throughout, providing vivid atmosphere ("valley-mist," "rock... hovered serenely," "mist curling like approving spirits"). It supplies resources (the ethereal light, the gathering patrons) that enable the revelation. However, it does not pressure Elowen's choices or constrain her options; she could perform the same action in another evocative setting with minor edits. The setting charges the final image but functions more as backdrop than active crucible, keeping it below 7.0 despite strong setup and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after receiving the donor heart" is mentioned early ("just weeks after the transplant," "Since receiving the stranger's heart") and motivates Elowen's visit to the tea house. However, it does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page; the story's present action unfolds over a single dawn-to-dusk span without urgency tied to the transplant timeline. The "weeks after" detail is backstory setup rather than a live clock that alters her moves, and it could be replaced with "recently" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to learn why some people magnetize stories" is stated early ("to comprehend this pull, for it disrupted her precise world") and sustained ("Why her? Why now?"). It drives Elowen to the tea house and frames her tracking of the sun trails. However, the desire is told more than dramatized through conflicted choices; she does not face friction between the pull and a competing want or cost. The motivation shapes the premise but does not force a difficult on-page decision with visible tradeoff, keeping it in the functional band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Valley-mist wonder" is seeded early ("valley-mist shrouded realm," "perpetual haze") and recurs at closure ("valley-mist deepened," "eternal, softly explosive hush"). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly (from "shrouded" to "approving spirits" to "deepened"), supporting the accumulative design. However, the phrase "valley-mist wonder" itself reads as a label imposed rather than emerging from scene texture, and the tone does not shift dramatically under pressure (the climax revelation is described with the same lyric register as the opening). Coherence and closure linkage lift it into mid-range, but static mood and prompt-echo phrasing cap it below 7.0.</comment>
