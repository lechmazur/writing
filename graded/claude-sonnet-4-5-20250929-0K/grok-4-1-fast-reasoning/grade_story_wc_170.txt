<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation (to change mirrors) is stated rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. Her interior life reads as label-only: "perceptively calm," "elusive," "grace" appear as qualities asserted by the narrator rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The borrowed-heartbeat mechanism is told in exposition ("she must renew it") without showing her weighing cost against desire or experiencing embodied fear. No meaningful change or credible endurance with felt cost is earned; she completes her ritual and dissolves as before, a static arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens defaults to Accumulative/Textural (dusky harmony, prismatic imagery, coded lullabies), but no meaningful deepening or cadence shift alters stakes. Orientation Test: who/where/when are anchored early, waiving penalty. Closure form is ambiguous: Elowen renews her heartbeat and dissolves "as every spring," suggesting repetition without decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with on-page cost. The ritual succeeds without friction, and the final image ("borrowed heartbeat echoing forever") offers no visible forfeiture or reweighted meaning. Cost proof test fails: no on-page sentence shows what she loses or what option is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The echoing terrace, prism parapet, and spring setting are vividly described with purposeful sensory detail (rain-slick crystals, refracted rainbows, scent of rain-kissed stone). However, the environment does not constrain Elowen's choices or supply resources that alter her tactics; it serves as backdrop for a ritual that proceeds without spatial friction. Micro-setting test: the parapet's prismatic edge is handled in two beats (tracing, painting) but does not impose cost or change her approach. No 9+ gate satisfied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sustaining Elowen's form via borrowed heartbeats—is signaled early, but no on-page tightening narrows her options or forces a trade-off. She sings, children's dreams respond, she absorbs heartbeats, and mirrors shift: a linear sequence without reversal, escalation, or visible price. The lullabies succeed without resistance; no credible loss (time, stamina, ethical cost) alters her tactics. Agency is absent: she performs a ritual as scripted, not a decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme (possibility versus rigid truth, mirrors as metaphor) is legible and emerges from imagery rather than stated moralizing. The beloved's despair and Elowen's vow provide thematic grounding. However, the ending offers no non-literal answer or reweighted insight: mirrors are persuaded, the city awakens to new reflections, and Elowen promises return—a thematic assertion without earned wisdom or resonant ambiguity. The borrowed-heartbeat cost is described but not dramatized with ethical friction or consequence, leaving theme underexplored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic: Elowen notices "every quiver," "faintly," "shimmering," without character-specific bias or selectivity. Diction converges into elevated register ("dusky harmony," "elusive," "grace," "perceptively calm") repeated as template modifiers rather than modulated voice. No dialogue present to evaluate. Purposeful compression is not taught; the repeated adjectives read as decorative rather than pattern-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting penalty applies: "dusky harmony" appears five times, "perceptively calm" three times, "elusive" and "grace" recur as modifiers across most beats without varying function or reweighting meaning—template cadence and synonym churn trigger −0.8. Mixed metaphor: "steps rippled puddles without disturbance" contradicts itself (−0.4). Register drift into elevated diction ("transcendent grace," "borrowed heartbeat echoing forever") clashes with the lack of embodied interiority (−0.3). Paraphrase loop: paragraphs describing mirrors softening and reflecting possibilities restate without added pressure (−0.2). Total deduction ~−1.7 from a mid-5 anchor; artifacts pervade and touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The mirage-painter premise and borrowed-heartbeat mechanism offer surface novelty, but the execution defaults to template lyricism: a magical ritual succeeds without friction, mirrors are transformed, the protagonist dissolves to return next spring. The beloved's despair backstory and Elowen's vow read as exposition rather than lived detail. Transformation test fails: swap "mirrors" for "paintings" or "dreams" and the arc remains unchanged. No bold risk heightens stakes; the story hedges into safe abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elowen is present throughout but makes no decisions that alter tactics or create key turns. She performs a scripted ritual (sing, absorb, paint, dissolve) without agency or cost. Late appearance of choice-constraint is absent; she observes and executes without friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prism parapet appears in setup (paragraph 5), is handled in two beats (kneeling/tracing, painting above it), and returns in the final paragraph ("prism parapet's lingering glow"). However, its prismatic properties do not constrain her tactics or impose cost; it supplies visual metaphor but remains swappable with any reflective surface. Setup + development + payoff gates are met, but causal pressure and irreplaceability are low.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The borrowed heartbeat is signaled early (paragraph 7), drives the ritual's middle beats (absorbing children's heartbeats), and appears in the closure image ("borrowed heartbeat echoing forever"). It shapes the narrative stakes (Elowen's survival depends on it) and the method (lullabies extract heartbeats). All three gates met; however, no on-page cost or ethical friction tied to the borrowing is dramatized, limiting causal pressure. Closure linkage is present but thematic rather than causally active.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" is label-only, repeated three times without constraining action or showing a visible tradeoff. It functions as decorative diction rather than a trait that enables or limits choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Grace" is signaled early and repeated across five beats ("silent grace," "effortless grace," "Grace defined her," "transcendent grace," "lives graced"). However, it does not create a major turn or redefine options; it describes Elowen's manner without altering causality. Swappable with "elegance" or "poise" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Coded lullabies are signaled early (paragraph 18), their mechanics detailed (hidden cadences, melodies bent to borrow), and they drive two middle beats (singing "Twinkle, twinkle" and "Hush little baby"). They shape the method of heartbeat extraction and appear in the final sealing beat. Setup + development + payoff gates met; specificity (children's songs as vessels) is high. However, no resistance or cost tied to the method itself is shown, limiting causal pressure to ~mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The echoing terrace is signaled in the opening, provides spatial anchoring throughout, and its echoes amplify Elowen's work in the middle beats. It returns in the final image ("echoing terrace, spring's breath"). However, it does not constrain her choices or supply resources that alter tactics; it functions as atmospheric setting rather than causal pressure. One purposeful early–final reprise reweights meaning slightly, lifting into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"The hush before bells ring" is signaled early and the first bell tolls at closure, bracketing the ritual. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock that alters Elowen's tactics; she completes each step without time pressure or urgency. Setup + payoff gates met (missing middle development as time constraint); time functions as mood rather than escalation driver.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation to persuade mirrors is stated in paragraph 9, grounded in backstory (beloved's despair), and the mirrors' transformation is shown in the middle and final beats. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between want and cost. No on-page moment shows Elowen weighing the ethics of borrowing heartbeats against her vow, leaving motivation as exposition rather than lived pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" appears five times (opening, paragraph 19, paragraph 32, paragraph 42, final line), establishing a lyric tone and recurring pattern. However, the tone remains static across beats without modulation under pressure; no cadence shift or tonal charge at the final image differentiates the closing "dusky harmony" from earlier instances. Early–final reprise is present but does not reweight meaning with cost, trending mid-low.</comment>
