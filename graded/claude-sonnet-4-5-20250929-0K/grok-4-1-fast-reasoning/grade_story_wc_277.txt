<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's observant nature is repeatedly labeled rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final confrontation shows some decision-making with the pen-nib demonstration, but her motivation to defend her father feels declared rather than earned through internal conflict. Thorne's confession arrives too easily without forcing Elara to pay a meaningful cost or make a difficult trade-off. Interiority relies heavily on stock metaphors ("orbits of regret," "binary stars") that abstract emotion rather than embody it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive within the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Causal with proof-by-contradiction mechanics, but the closure—Thorne's confession and Elara's vow—lacks visible cost; he simply admits guilt and she drives away with renewed purpose, foreclosing no live option. The ledger contradiction is told rather than dramatized, and the journalist's role vanishes without consequence. Escalation stalls in the middle third with repeated metaphorical orbits before the confrontation begins.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The echoing observatory provides atmospheric detail (dome glass, brass telescope, mist-shrouded roads) and the acoustic properties add sensory texture. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics; it functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The rosewood pen nib's physical implausibility ("rosewood too soft for nibs, yet...flawlessly") weakens verisimilitude. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—defending her father's legacy—is signaled early, but escalation is flat. Elara faces no meaningful opposition; Thorne's reversal is immediate once she begins her proof. The "proof by contradiction" tightens logic on the page but does not force Elara to sacrifice or trade off competing goods. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency drive the key turn—Thorne simply capitulates. Cost at closure is conceptual (redemption for the empire) but not felt in Elara's choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of hidden truths and legacy emerges from events, but "orbits of regret" is overtly restated across multiple beats rather than resonating through image. The ending offers a conceptual answer (truths hide in contradictions) that leans toward stated moral rather than earned insight. Thorne's binary-star metaphor and Elara's final vow ("intervene always, with logic's unerring nib") read as thematic echo rather than dramatic discovery. No counter-reading tension remains at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent, and psychic access stays anchored to Elara. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register inconsistent with urgent pressure ("solemn playfulness," "mocking her own circling regrets," "spent comets"). Dialogue carries goal pursuit in Thorne's accusation and Elara's rebuttal, but both speak in the same ornate idiom without distinct rhythm or subtext. Filter verbs ("seeing his regrets orbit") appear in emotional peaks without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Pervasive overwriting: "orbits of regret" appears six times, "echoing" five times, "solemn playfulness" three times, creating paraphrase loops and metaphor saturation that flatten momentum. Template cadence runs ("she [verb], [noun] [verb]") dominate the middle third. Mixed metaphors: regrets cannot simultaneously orbit, tighten, decay, and recede like comets without violating physics. Register drift into abstract philosophizing ("proof by contradiction...showing your tale devours itself") clashes with scene urgency. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("truths unveiled, ready to rewrite the stars"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The newsprint-heiress astronomer frame offers potential freshness, but execution relies on stock mystery-reversal mechanics (ledger dates, timeline contradictions). "Orbits of regret" and observatory setting risk symbolic convenience rather than organic integration. The proof-by-contradiction method is told in summary rather than demonstrated through dramatized discovery. Emotional arc (daughter defending father's honor) follows a predictable template without transformation. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and drives the confrontation by presenting the ledger contradiction. However, her key choice—wielding the pen nib to sketch the proof—feels more performance than pressure-forged decision. She faces no meaningful internal conflict or cost; Thorne capitulates immediately. Early signal (journalist call) and closure participation (driving away with renewed purpose) hit two gates, but causal pressure is weak and the heiress role could swap for "lawyer" or "investigator" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The rosewood pen nib appears in three beats: initial heirloom touch, the proof sketch, and final pocketing as talisman. However, its function is largely symbolic; Elara could use any writing tool without altering plot logic. The "rosewood too soft for nibs" contradiction is noted but not exploited as proof-by-contradiction parallel. No visible cost ties to the object, and its reappearance at closure is ornamental rather than causally reweighted.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Orbits of regret" is thematically present across multiple beats but does not constrain on-page choices. Elara's regrets about ignoring her father are told in summary ("nights she'd ignored Father's weary sighs") and do not create friction in her present tactics. Thorne's regrets are similarly labeled rather than dramatized. The concept shapes atmosphere and metaphor but not stakes or decision architecture. Swappable with "burden of legacy" or similar without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Devotedly observant" is labeled repeatedly ("devotedly observant nature," "observant eyes catching the flicker") but rarely demonstrated through specific micro-choices. Elara notices Thorne's rehearsed guilt and ledger date discrepancies, but these observations do not force trade-offs or visible costs. The trait enables the proof but does not constrain her; it functions as competence marker rather than friction-generator. Present in closure ("devotedly observant of shifting horizons") but ornamentally.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Intervene" appears in Elara's approach ("To discover hidden truths, we intervene not with fury, but proof") and her final vow ("intervene always, with logic's unerring nib"). The action shapes the middle beat—she confronts Thorne rather than investigating alone—and the resolution hinges on her active demonstration of the ledger contradiction. However, the journalist's call incites the story; "intervene" arrives as method rather than inciting action. Present in closure with thematic charge but swappable with "confront" or "challenge."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Proof by contradiction is signaled early ("proof by contradiction—showing your tale devours itself") and structures the middle confrontation: Elara assumes Thorne's story true, then exposes chronological inversion. The method shapes her tactics (sketching the timeline loop) and drives the reversal when Thorne recognizes the trap. However, the contradiction is told ("your proof inverts chronology") rather than discovered through dramatized examination of the ledger. Present in all three gates with clear causal role but execution leans expository.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The echoing observatory is established early (mist-shrouded roads, dome above clouds, brass telescope) and provides the confrontation arena. Acoustic properties ("amplifying every creak," "voice booming in the hollow space") add sensory texture, and the final dawn image charges the closure. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices or supply tactical resources; she could conduct the same proof in any private location. Lyric reprise (opening ascent to closing descent) reweights slightly but does not alter stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The journalist's call anchors the opening and motivates Elara's drive to the observatory, satisfying setup. The timeframe ("after the journalist calls," "tonight," "as dawn's light pierced") tracks coherently and the elapsed window (evening to dawn) is legible. However, no ticking clock tightens Elara's decisions; she could confront Thorne at any point without consequence. The timeframe orders events but does not escalate pressure or alter tactics. Present at closure (dawn departure) but functionally passive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to discover hidden truths is declared ("Driven to unearth those truths, she grabbed her coat") and shapes her choice to confront Thorne. The desire generates the central action (presenting the contradiction proof) and reappears at closure ("truths unveiled"). However, internal friction is minimal; Elara never doubts her father or weighs the cost of exposure. The motivation is consistent but lacks competing wants or visible sacrifice. Present across all three gates with clear causal role, but no dramatized conflict between cost and desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Solemn playfulness" is labeled three times ("solemn playfulness in her chuckle," "solemn playfulness danced in her response," "smiled solemnly, playfully") but the tonal texture does not modulate with pressure. Elara's internal voice remains uniformly ornate and detached even during the confrontation; no shift toward urgency or uncertainty. The tone is stated rather than embodied in rhythm or diction. Present at closure but static, functioning as authorial assertion rather than felt atmosphere that charges the final image.</comment>
