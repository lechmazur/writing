<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's internal state is declared rather than embodied—"mulberry ache" functions as a label, not a felt contradiction. The inciting choice (dream vs. empire) remains abstract throughout; no on-page moment shows her weighing a concrete cost (e.g., missing a performance deadline, severing a relationship). Her "accidental telepathy" trait is told but never constrains a visible choice with trade-offs. The ending grants her both outcomes ("dream triumphant, yet shared") without forfeiting either path, erasing the stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece declares a solstice deadline but never dramatizes its approach or consequences. The coffee-stain divination, ivy telepathy, and violin prophecy stack without causal linkage—each could be removed without altering the resolution. The closure states she "chose to lead the empire...as composer" but no on-page decision or renunciation occurs; the text summarizes the outcome in final-paragraph exposition. Cost is asserted ("destiny no longer perforated but laced with propagating life") rather than shown through a visible forfeiture or tactical shift. Orientation is delayed past 120 words with dense atmospheric layering before anchoring who/where/when.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The velvet observatory and ice violin are vividly described, but spatial choreography drifts—Elara moves from desk to coffee pot to ivy without clear distances or blocking. The transparent violin's "unmelting under midsummer's gaze due to enchanted provenance" is told rather than tested; its physical properties never constrain a choice. The ivy's spread in the final beats offers a visual anchor that charges the ending image, lifting the score slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (dream vs. empire) is signaled early but never tightened through on-page opposition or cost. No antagonist or constraint forces a trade-off; the ivy and plants offer only encouragement. The piece grants Elara both outcomes in the final paragraph, dissolving the either/or pressure without a visible price. No escalation occurs—her violin performance meets no resistance and the "perforations" seal without sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "perforated destiny" metaphor recurs but remains ornamental—perforations are told to seal, not shown closing through choice. The final paragraph articulates the theme directly ("choosing to lead...not as conqueror, but composer") rather than letting the image resonate. "Mulberry ache transmuted to harmony" is abstract emotional summary. The coffee-stain divination and ivy telepathy feel like prompt-element layering rather than organic thematic vehicles.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice remains consistent in register and distance; no head-hopping. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, incantatory phrasing disconnected from a researcher's lexicon ("verdant visions," "aching crescendo," "mended weave"). Interior thought is abstract and declarative ("her heart thudded with mulberry ache, purple shadows of doubt") rather than character-particular perception. The ivy's telepathic plea ("Propagate us") carries no distinct idiom from Elara's narration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Density is high but repetitive: "mulberry ache" appears four times, "perforated/perforations" six times, "propagate/propagating" nine times in 800 words—synonym churn without evolving meaning. Template cadence: "The [noun] [verbed]" opens seven sentences. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 7–8 restate that the violin can "propagate prophetic harmonies" and "reshape destiny." Mixed metaphors: "roots that bind dream to dominion" and "perforations sealing with inky vines" clash vehicle logic. Register drifts into academic ("enchanted provenance from polar fates") mid-peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise layers four prompt elements (telepathy, divination, ice violin, perforated destiny) without synthesis—each could be swapped for another magical method. The resolution (fuse dream and empire via plant-amplified music) is declared rather than discovered through constraint. "Accidentally telepathic since childhood" echoes YA chosen-one templates. The velvet observatory, midsummer setting, and coffee-stain method read as ornamental particulars that do not transform familiar beats.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics. Her "choice" is summarized in the final paragraph ("choosing to lead") without a visible renunciation or cost. She observes stains, hears ivy, and plays violin, but none of these beats show her weighing options or foreclosing a path. The researcher role is label-only; provenance work appears as backstory summary ("months" of unraveling) rather than on-page action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ice violin appears in paragraphs 3, 12, 15–20, and the ending—setup, middle use, and closure presence. It is handled on the page (lifted, bowed) and its sound "propagates" through plants, enabling the hybrid fate. However, its unique property (ice that does not melt) is told rather than tested, and it could be replaced with any magical instrument without breaking the plot. It shapes one key turn (the performance) and is present at closure, but swappability and lack of specific constraint cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Perforated destiny" is introduced early (paragraph 7) and recurs throughout, but it functions as metaphor-only—no on-page mechanics show how perforations constrain choice or how sealing them alters options. The stains "foretold" perforations, the ivy offers to "fill" them, and the ending asserts they are "laced with propagating life," but none of these beats dramatize the concept changing tactics. It is ornamental theme language, not a pressure system.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The plant telepathy is introduced at paragraph 9, used in paragraphs 10–11 and 18, and present at closure. The ivy "urges" Elara and "choruses approval," but these beats show the plants as allies offering encouragement, not a trait with cost. No moment dramatizes a trade-off (e.g., overwhelming input, forced propagation, loss of control). The trait enables the violin's effect but could be replaced with generic magic without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Propagate" is signaled early (paragraph 10), recurs in nine paragraphs, and is central to the resolution—Elara's music "propagates" through plants to "infuse the empire." The ivy's repeated plea ("Propagate us") and the ending's "propagating life" tie the action to closure. However, the mechanics remain abstract (plants "responded rapturously," visions "bloomed"), and the action could be renamed "amplify" or "spread" with minor edits. It drives two beats and shapes the ending but lacks irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Coffee-stain divination is introduced and used in paragraphs 5–8, revealing "jagged rips" and "thorned crowns encircling a fractured lyre." It reappears in paragraph 17 ("Coffee stains flared...perforations sealing"). The method shapes Elara's understanding but not her tactics—the stains predict outcomes without constraining her choices. It is present in setup and middle but absent from closure action, and the mechanics (how grounds "swirl into dark arabesques") are told rather than tested. Swappable with tarot or scrying.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The velvet observatory is anchored in paragraph 1 and recurs in nine paragraphs, providing ivy, potted ferns, jasmine, and the crimson-draped space for the violin performance. The midsummer heat is mentioned but does not constrain action. The setting enables the plant-telepathy beat and the final "new growth" image, but the specific "velvet" detail and "midsummer stars" are ornamental. It frames the action and is present at closure but does not force a tactical choice; any indoor garden space would serve.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The solstice deadline is introduced in paragraph 4 ("Tonight, urgency clawed...the solstice deadline loomed") and mentioned in paragraph 20 ("Dawn's glow crept near, the promise teetering"). However, no on-page beat shows the clock tightening her options—she brews coffee, reads stains, listens to ivy, and plays at length without time pressure altering her moves. The ending states "before the promise's glow endured eternally," but no consequence for missing the deadline is dramatized. The timeframe is declared, not tracked.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dream-vs.-empire conflict is introduced in paragraph 2 and recurs in seven paragraphs, anchoring the dominant stake. Paragraph 16 states "The empire offered legacy...but her dream sang of compositions born from silence," and the ending asserts she fused both. However, no on-page beat dramatizes the friction—no moment shows her weighing a concrete sacrifice (e.g., signing a contract, refusing a performance). The motivation is told and summarized rather than tested through contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Mulberry ache" appears in paragraphs 1, 8, 14, 23, and 26—setup and closure presence. It is used as a label for longing and doubt, and the ending transmutes it to "harmony." However, the tone remains static and declarative throughout; no modulation reflects shifting pressure. The phrase is ornamental ("purple shadows of doubt") rather than embodied in perception or rhythm. It charges the final line but does not constrain choice or alter tactics, and the emotional valence is told rather than felt.</comment>
