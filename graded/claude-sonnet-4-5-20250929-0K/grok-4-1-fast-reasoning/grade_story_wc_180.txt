<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias shows clear motivation and the final choice is earned by prior material, but interiority leans heavily on description of his actions rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Lila's "feisty" trait is asserted repeatedly through narration and dialogue tags ("endearingly feisty," "feisty spark," "feisty shove," "feisty grin") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The joint mending work at the climax does show collaboration under storm pressure, but emotional progression resolves too cleanly without lingering irrationality or cost that complicates the reunion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraphs. The closure—Lila's realization that vows are "roots that regrow" and her decision to participate in autumn vows—lands on the page with felt relational cost (her return after breach, saved Elias from beam, ribbon retied). However, the discovered bag feels convenient; it appears exactly when needed and its contents solve the problem without prior setup that the heart-tree's quartz needed these specific items. The lens reads as Causal with some Accumulative texture; the final image reweights prior material, but the ease of the repair and emotional reconciliation softens the cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard-in-rafters setting is vivid, specific, and pressures the climb (rotted beams, storm loosening stones, dangling bag). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the ascent and the heart-tree repair. The quartz eye and the cathedral's verdant canopy charge the final image, and the storm actively complicates the climactic beat when Lila shoves Elias from a falling beam. Sensory selection is purposeful, filtered through the mender's craft and the magical-realist world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—bridging generational wisdom and mending the breach—is signaled early and tightens when Lila returns declaring "quartz eyes failing across the valleys." The storm and rotted beam raise immediate danger, forcing collaboration. However, the resolution feels earned more by the bag's contents appearing at the right moment than by protagonist choice under impossible trade-off. The quartz repair succeeds on first attempt without visible failure or tactical adjustment, softening escalation. One meaningful tightening is present (Lila's return and the shared climb), but the cost at closure is relational and emotional rather than a hard-won tactical victory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the deciduous-vows concept and the orchard's wildness after breach. The final image—Lila retying the ribbon, roots that regrow—offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, Lila's line "Deciduous vows aren't chains… They're roots that regrow" edges toward stating the thesis rather than letting the image alone carry it. The accidental-wisdom tone is present in the bag spill and the visions cascading, but the ending feels slightly over-articulated for the earned subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Narrative voice is stable third-limited on Elias with brief tight-third on Lila; no head-hopping. Dialogue feels goal-driven ("You persist in this madness, Father?" pursues confrontation; the ribbon and vow exchange advances plot). However, the prose leans on filtering and summary in key beats: "felt a surge to persist," "saw her own strength mirrored," "voice softening as leaves swirled." The "feisty" label recurs in narration rather than voice-specific perception, and Lila's interiority in the climax is cleaner and more articulate than stress would allow. Psychic distance shifts are intentional but compress emotional complexity into tidy realizations.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose carries high figurative density in nearly every sentence ("shadowed husk," "deciduous vows," "quartz eye hummed to life," "roots starved of renewal"), creating a lyric texture that often obscures momentum in favor of ornament. Several paraphrase loops appear: the "feisty" quality is restated four times; "persist/persisting" recurs five times across the piece without meaningful variation in pressure. Template cadence is visible in the middle section ("Elias held out… / Lila scoffed… / Using the forgotten bag's contents…"), and the storm-repair sequence accelerates but then deflates with exposition ("not grand prophecies, but intimate truths—how her mother's wisdom…"). Clarity remains high, but information density is diluted by decorative phrasing and synonym churn on key terms.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The orchard-in-cathedral premise is fresh and the quartz-eye mender craft is specific. The deciduous-vows concept and the method of repair (ribbon/dust/seeds/locket) show ingenuity. However, the emotional arc—estranged child returns, reconciles through shared task—follows a familiar template, and the bag's contents resolve the problem without transformation of the premise's implications. The piece commits to its world logic and voice, but the closure feels emotionally convenient rather than offering a non-obvious moral calculus or a turn that reweights prior material in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's choice to persist in tending and his decision to propose mending the heart-tree drive two key beats. His discovery of the bag and his quiet offer ("To bridge what we lost") enable Lila's shift. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure; causal pressure is moderate but decision alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ribbon appears in the spilled bag, is tied experimentally by Lila to a vine, used to bind fractures at the heart-tree, and whips "like a banner in the gale" during the beam-save. Retied in her hair at closure, reweighting her identity. Present in three distinct beats; causal role in repair and final image. Specific mechanics matter.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Deciduous vows frame the breach, are declared foolish by Lila, and the orchard's wildness is attributed to "unbound vows, roots starved of renewal." The concept shapes the dominant stake and Lila's final realization. However, the vows themselves are not enacted or tested on the page; they remain thematic backdrop rather than a live tactical constraint. Present in setup and closure; causal pressure is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Endearingly feisty" is asserted in narration ("endearingly feisty even as a girl," "feisty spark undimmed," "feisty shove," "feisty grin returning") but rarely dramatized through on-page contradiction or cost. The shove that saves Elias is a single action linked to the trait. Largely label-only; the trait does not visibly constrain a choice or create a tradeoff. Present across beats but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Persist" drives Elias's daily climb, his whispered lessons to the wind, his decision to mend the heart-tree, and Lila's reluctant participation ("persisted alongside him"). The action is signaled early, recurs in three beats, and the final sentence of the story ("persisting together") anchors the closure. Major turns trace to this action; removal would collapse the arc. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The forgotten bag is discovered mid-climb, spilling ribbon/dust/seeds/locket; its contents are explicitly used as the method for repair ("ribbon to bind fractures, quartz dust to polish…"). However, the bag appears only when needed without prior setup that these items would be necessary or that the bag was hidden there. Present in middle discovery and climactic repair; functional but introduces the solution rather than being seeded. Setup gate is weak.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The orchard-in-rafters setting pressures the climb (frayed ropes, rotted beam snag, falling stones during storm), supplies the heart-tree quartz and the boughs that rustled approval, and charges the final image ("cathedral's verdant canopy"). Micro-setting details (beam, vine, ribbon whipping in gale) alter tactics and enable the beam-save. Present in setup, middle, and closure; constrains choices and provides resources. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Years after the breach" frames the temporal distance and Lila's return is said to follow "roads whisper of dying visions." The timeframe establishes backstory and loss but does not create a ticking clock or urgency that alters on-page tactics; the repair proceeds without time pressure. Present in setup and as thematic weight; does not tighten decisions. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation "to bridge generational wisdom" drives his daily climbs, his whispered lessons, and his proposal to mend the heart-tree. Lila's return friction ("roads whisper of dying visions") adds external urgency. However, the motivation is largely told ("driven by a quiet motivation") rather than dramatized through conflicting wants. Present in setup and shapes climactic choice; friction between want and cost is moderate. Causal role in two beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Accidental wisdom" is signaled through the bag spill ("forgotten memories"), the "accidental foresight" of Elias's quartz eye, and the storm-revelation structure ("In that accidental wisdom, born of storm and spill"). Tone modulates with pressure and charges the final realization. However, the ending shifts toward deliberate articulation ("Deciduous vows aren't chains…") rather than maintaining accidental discovery. Coherent through turns; closure linkage is present but the final beat tilts away from accident toward statement.</comment>
