<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Thren's motivation ("to learn to navigate without moving") is clear and his patience is embodied through decades of vigil, but his interior life remains static—no contradictory impulses act in scene, only serial repetition of the same choice across centuries. The arrowhead's "wandering pulse" is labeled rather than dramatized as a pressure that complicates his desire; his final success feels declared ("knowledge he craved") rather than earned through on-page struggle. The ending grants him his goal without visible cost or foreclosed path, reading as wish-fulfillment rather than alteration or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layered dust, centuries, harmonic resonance building toward a pattern breakthrough). The closure unit—Thren's pulse-merge and motionless navigation—lands on the page, but cost is invisible: his body stills "amid the bone towers, dust sifting eternally," yet no on-page action, relationship, or earlier setup is foreclosed. The wandering pulse's "reunion across time" reweights the arrowhead's history but does not alter Thren's options or extract a felt price; the ending reads as arrival rather than reconfiguration with cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are present by the second paragraph, so no Orientation Test penalty applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bone towers, canyon echoes, and layered dust are vivid and consistent, filtering through Thren's reverent perspective ("relics as if they were the canyon's own weathered prayers"). Spatial choreography is clear across the vigil, and the arrowhead's obsidian gleam and pulsing spirals supply tactile detail. The setting constrains Thren's method (harmonic stone skips from tower ledges) and the final image places him "amid the bone towers, dust sifting eternally," but the environment does not force a tactical choice or charge the closure with new friction—it remains backdrop to his patient waiting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (appraise the arrowhead to learn motionless navigation) is signaled early, but pressure never tightens—Thren simply waits decades, centuries, until a flock finally forms the pattern. No reversal or complication forces a trade-off; the arrowhead's pulse "syncing with his own breath" suggests accumulation, yet no on-page event narrows his options or raises cost. The climactic flock and pulse-merge are granted by time and coincidence, not by protagonist agency or a constrained choice, leaving escalation flat under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—patience, reverence, and the cost of transcendence—emerges through the canyon's layered imagery and Thren's vigil, but the ending states rather than embodies wisdom: "his mind navigated without moving—roaming canyons unseen, echoes of worlds unbound" is abstract philosophizing that replaces scene pressure. The arrowhead's spiral etchings and the flock's aerial scripture offer symbolic convergence, yet the final image does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer—it declares success without irony or residual cost, flattening thematic complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Thren; diction ("historically reverent," "weathered resolve," "pulse left wandering") is elevated and consistent, though the register occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("motionless navigation," "aerial scripture") that depersonalizes his perceptual signature. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. However, the prose treats Thren's interior as a static tableau rather than a mind under pressure—no modulation in syntax or rhythm across decades of waiting, and the final revelation is told ("granting the knowledge he craved") rather than filtered through lived perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose is ornate and rhythmically controlled, with strong sensory anchors ("dust-choked dawn," "clack-clack-clack," "bruised sky"). However, figurative density crowds nearly every sentence without acceleration: "fossilized spines of titanic beasts," "weathered prayers," "pulse left wandering," "aerial scripture," "living map," "fulfilled prophecy" stack without earned payoff, flattening momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 13–15 restate Thren's waiting across months/years/decades with synonym churn ("persisted"/"vigil"/"patience into something eternal") and template cadence ("Days blurred…" / "Months carved…" / "Years passed…" / "Decades layered…"). These artifacts dull the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—appraisal through bird-pattern divination across centuries—is unusual, but the emotional and causal arc (patient waiting rewarded with mystical success) follows a familiar template of ascetic achievement without transformation or cost. The arrowhead's "wandering pulse" and the canyon's harmonic echoes are specific details, yet Thren's vigil is interchangeable with any long-suffering seeker; removing his reverence or the bone towers would leave the plot intact. The ending grants him his wish without irony or friction, a resolution that reads as surface novelty over earned synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Thren is present throughout and his skimming action recurs across decades, but his choices do not create key turns—he repeats the same throw-and-wait cycle without tactical alteration or on-page friction. The final pulse-merge is granted by the arrowhead, not driven by Thren's agency. Setup present; middle development is repeated observation without decision; closure participation is passive reception. Caps: missing middle development (no decision alters tactics) → 3.4; swappability (any patient seeker) → 3.8. Band floor ~3.0 for functional presence; no causal pressure elevation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The arrowhead is unearthed early, handled ("cradled…in callused palms"), placed on the ledge as the object of appraisal, and at closure pressed to Thren's forehead to transfer the pulse—three distinct beats. Its "wandering pulse" is labeled repeatedly but does not constrain Thren's choices; the spirals mirror the flock pattern, a lyric reprise that reweights meaning at closure. Setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, lyric reprise +0.4 = mid-6s; capped by label-only trait (pulse is told, not shown as pressure) −0.3 and swappability (any mystical artifact) −0.4 → 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "pulse left wandering" is named in the arrowhead description, repeated as Thren's sync ("syncing with his own breath"), and at closure the pulse "surged into him." However, it remains a label that explains backstory (the shaman's severed life force) rather than shaping Thren's on-page stakes or tactics—he does not wrestle with the pulse's claims or risk losing himself to it. Setup present; no middle constraint; closure participation is transfer without cost. Gates: setup + closure but missing middle → ~5.5; label-only (not dramatized as pressure) −0.8, swappability (any mystical energy) −0.6 → 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Historically reverent" appears twice as a label ("embodied a historically reverent soul," "Historically reverent, Thren knew better") but does not constrain an on-page action with cost—it motivates his decision to appraise rather than claim rashly, a single early choice without visible price or later friction. Setup present; no middle development (reverence does not complicate his decades-long wait); absent from closure. Missing middle → cap 3.4; label-only mentions without tradeoff −0.3 → 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Appraise" is the central action: Thren's method of bird-pattern divination drives the middle vigil across decades and the climactic flock reveals the arrowhead's truth, enabling the pulse transfer. Setup (paragraph 7), middle repetition across beats, and closure participation all present. Three gates met; two beats (middle wait, climactic pattern) +0.9, causal pressure (the appraisal unlocks the arrowhead's secret) +0.8, closure linkage +1.0 = ~6.7; however, the action is summary-told across centuries without on-page dramatization of tactical shifts or costs, and easily swappable with "study" or "commune" −0.8 → 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bird-flock method is signaled early (paragraph 9), recurs across the middle vigil (stones summon flocks that "twisted like smoke"), and the climactic "colossal flock" at closure weaves the pattern that appraises the arrowhead. Three gates met; the method is specific and its mechanics (harmonic resonance, aerial scripture) shape Thren's repeated attempts. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (method enables breakthrough) +1.0, closure linkage +1.2 = ~7.3; swappability (any divination system) −0.5, summary-only in middle (decades compressed without on-page tactical shift) −0.4 → 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon are vivid throughout, providing the ledges from which Thren skips stones and the echoes that amplify harmonics. Setup early, middle presence (towers' surfaces deepen with grooves), and closure image ("his body stilled amid the bone towers") all present. Three gates met; the setting supplies resources (ledges, echoes) and the final image reprises the canyon +0.8, but the environment does not constrain a choice or alter Thren's tactics—it remains atmospheric backdrop. Causal pressure absent; postcard description penalty −0.3, swappability (any resonant landscape) −0.4 = 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The timeframe ("through centuries of layered dust") is named in the opening and measured across paragraphs ("Days…weeks…Months…Years…Decades"), but it does not tighten decisions—Thren simply waits without a deadline, cost, or tactical shift imposed by time. Setup present (opening phrase); middle repetition is summary-told without pressure; closure mentions "ages of waiting" but time does not shape the final act. Vague tracking (no specific count or consequence) and no live clock penalty −1.2; swappability (any long duration) −0.5 → 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Thren's desire "to learn to navigate without moving" is stated early (paragraph 4), recurs mid-story ("urging him toward his goal"), and at closure is fulfilled ("his mind navigated without moving"). Setup, middle reference, and closure participation present—three gates met. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs: no on-page friction between the goal and another need, no visible price for the decades of waiting. Told-only penalty −0.8, no friction between wants and costs −0.6 → 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Weathered resolve" appears as a label (paragraph 7, paragraph 12, paragraph 18) and the tone of patient endurance is coherent across the vigil, but it remains a single static mood without modulation—Thren's interior does not shift under pressure, and the final image does not reweight the tone with irony or cost. Setup present, middle presence via label repetition, closure image ("dust sifting eternally") echoes the tone. Three gates met; coherence across turns +0.6, closure charge partial (image is static, not reweighted) +0.4 = ~6.0; label-only without embodied pressure −0.3, static mood (no modulation) −0.2 = 6.1.</comment>
