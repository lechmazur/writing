<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (understanding name-weight) is declared but remains abstract; the coin-spinning and crucible-mending feel ritualistic rather than conflict-driven choices with embodied doubt. The brother's return arrives as resolution rather than complication, and no genuine mistake or miscalculation occurs on-page—she simply succeeds. Interiority leans on stock phrases ("luminous regret," "golden resolve") and the final embrace offers catharsis without visible cost or path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation (who/where/when) arrives cleanly in the opening. The lens reads hybrid—lyric accumulation toward a mystical ritual—but the coin-spin and crucible-repair lack because/therefore linkage: she mixes the elixir, spins the coin twice, and Thorne simply emerges with no on-page reversal or complication. The closure (brother freed, name redeemed) lands as Decisive Change, yet the cost is asserted ("potential forged in tension") rather than dramatized—no tactical sacrifice, forfeited option, or visible price paid in the final image. Waive the Orientation Test penalty; apply −0.6 for missing felt cost and −0.4 for outline sequencing in the ritual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rain-washed foundry anchors setting early with vivid sensory details (rusted crucibles, forge-embers, puddles reflecting moonlight). The anvil and crucible function as micro-setting that supports the ritual beats, and rain modulates from downpour to silver mist at closure. However, spatial choreography remains vague—where Thorne was, how he emerges—and the foundry's layout never constrains a tactic. The final image leans on the foundry as backdrop rather than active constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (redeem Thorne's name and free him) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the first coin-spin tilts Libra's scales downward, revealing the name's crushing weight, but Elara's response—mixing volatile opposites, tracing cracks—meets no resistance or complication. The second spin balances without cost, and Thorne's release feels granted rather than earned by a trade-off. The ritual's success arrives as resolution, not a choice that forecloses a path; no visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The kintsugi metaphor (beauty in breakage) is declared repeatedly but remains conceptual rather than embodied in a difficult choice. The final paragraph states theme overtly: "true alchemy lay in kintsugi intentions, where breaks birthed unbreakable light" and "balance was not stasis, but the art of golden repair." The coin and crucible recur, yet their reweighting is told ("luminous when mended") rather than shown through a non-literal final image. Thematic echo penalty −0.6 for the climactic explication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction ("factually mystical," "verifiable astral force," "kintsugi intentions") mixes elevated register with lexical oddities that feel ornamental rather than voice-specific. Rhythmic control is present in the opening and closing, but mid-story beats rely on template cadence: "She began by… She withdrew… Gathering resolve, she mixed…" The final dialogue ("Its weight is ours to bear, beautifully") reads more polished than earned stress would allow. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she had named") stack in expository beats without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "luminous regret," "golden resolve," "factually mystical silver," "verifiable astral force," and mixed metaphors ("stars pulling flesh into ether," "seams veining like captured lightning"). Template cadence runs through the ritual sequence (five consecutive "She [verb]" stems). Paraphrase loops appear: "the weight of names" recurs four times with near-identical phrasing, and "luminous" appears seven times. The final third carries stock phrases ("rain-washed solitude," "cathedral of their redemption") that dull the closure image. Artifacts touch the ending: apply −1.2 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise (alchemist redeems hubristic name through kintsugi-inspired ritual) combines familiar fantasy templates: mystical naming, redemptive sibling quest, and symbolic object repair. The zodiac coin and kintsugi metaphor feel assembled from prompt elements rather than organically integrated. Emotional specificity is thin—Elara's regret and resolve are declared but not lived through contradictory micro-choices. The ending offers no non-obvious synthesis; the brother is freed and the name mended exactly as framed from the start, with no genuine complication or cost to transform the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara appears in every beat (setup, middle ritual, closure) and her actions—spinning the coin, mixing the elixir, tracing cracks—drive the sequence. However, her choices feel procedural rather than pressure-tested: no on-page mistake, doubt-driven reversal, or tactical sacrifice. She succeeds on the first full attempt without complication. Present in all three gates but lacks causal pressure and visible cost tied to her decisions; cap at mid-4s per swappability and ornamental agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The zodiac coin is seeded early ("glint—the zodiac coin"), used twice (first spin reveals crushing weight, second spin shows balance), and present at closure ("pocketed now, hummed approval"). It shapes two distinct beats by revealing the name's imbalance and then its mending, and the final mention reweights it as a "tool balanced like her renewed craft." Strong beat involvement (+0.9) and closure linkage (+0.8), but the coin does not constrain a tactic under pressure—it provides information without cost—limiting causal pressure. Three gates met; round to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Kintsugi is introduced early ("mirrored her balanced alchemy: flaws became luminous veins of strength") and explicitly invoked during the crucible-repair beat ("each golden stroke a kintsugi intention"). It appears in the final image reweighting theme ("true alchemy lay in kintsugi intentions"). However, the concept functions as thematic claim rather than tactical constraint—Elara does not choose between mending and erasure under pressure, nor does embracing breakage cost her a viable alternative. Present in setup, middle label, and closure theme; lyric reprise with underdeveloped causal pressure caps near 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" appears twice as descriptor ("factually mystical silver," "factually mystical bonds") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The attribute is label-only; the story would function identically if the coin and bonds were simply "mystical." No beat involvement, no visible tradeoff. Ornamental use; cap below 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Redeem" is seeded early ("her chance to redeem the name"), explicitly pursued in the middle ("To redeem meant pushing her balanced craft to its extremes"), and achieved at closure ("she had redeemed the name"). The action shapes the dominant stake and all three gates are met. However, the redemption itself—mixing elixir, tracing cracks, spinning coin—feels procedural rather than choice-driven; no on-page cost or foreclosed path tied specifically to the act of redeeming versus another approach. Three gates + beat involvement + closure linkage push toward 6.0, but swappability (could be "restore" or "mend" with minor edits) and lack of visible cost cap near 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Exploring limits" is framed early ("explore its limits to reforge it stronger") and invoked at the ritual beat ("exploring limits by infusing it with volatile opposites—boiling it over forge-embers while chanting glacial runes"). It shapes one middle beat by describing the method (mixing opposites), and the resolution claims "she had redeemed the name by exploring its limits." However, the method itself does not constrain tactics—no on-page moment where pushing further risks loss or where pulling back would fail. Present in setup, middle, and closure but functions as thematic label rather than mechanical pressure; cap mid-4s for label-only development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rain-washed foundry is anchored in the opening and supplies concrete resources (anvil, forge-embers, puddles) used across multiple beats. Rain modulates from downpour to silver mist, and the foundry's forge-heart is the site where Thorne vanished and now returns. The setting enables the ritual and charges the final image ("the foundry faded behind, a cathedral of their redemption"). Three gates met with beat involvement and closure linkage; however, the foundry does not constrain a tactic under pressure—it provides atmosphere and props without foreclosing options. Strong closure charge lifts toward mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the search party disbands") is signaled in the opening and establishes solitude, but elapsed time during the ritual is unmarked and the element exerts no pressure on Elara's choices. The search party's failure is noted as context, yet no ticking clock or urgency tied to "after" shapes tactics. Setup present, no middle development, and the ending does not revisit the temporal frame with reweighted meaning. Missing development and closure gates; cap below 4.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation ("to understand the weight of names") is declared early and explicitly pursued ("she yearned to comprehend it fully"). The coin-spinning and ritual enact the desire, and the closure claims "understanding flooded her." However, the motivation remains told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no on-page moment where understanding costs her another goal or where impatience versus caution creates friction. Three gates met but friction between want and cost is absent; lyric reprise without embodied conflict caps mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" is seeded in the opening ("mirrors of luminous regret"), recurs at the ritual beat ("Luminous regret welled in her eyes"), and reappears at closure ("luminous regret transformed"). The tone is coherent and modulates from heavy sorrow to tentative hope, and the final image ("luminous with mended possibilities") charges the ending. However, the phrase becomes a repeated label rather than an evolving texture—appearing seven times without fresh embodiment. Three gates met with closure charge; repetition and ornamental use limit upward movement to low-6s.</comment>
