<comment>Eliza's motivation ("to find that place where narratives breathed independently") is declared but rarely tested by pressure or competing impulses. Her "sanely eccentric" trait is asserted multiple times but constrains no on-page choice with felt cost—she simply performs her ritual unopposed. The patron's cough "shatters the trance" and grounds her, yet no subsequent micro-choice reveals altered tactics or values; she immediately returns to the same plan. Interiority reads label-heavy ("Eliza's eccentricity shone sanely"; "motivation sharpened") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density increase toward a final image), but the escalation is unclear: Eliza begins determined to map story-space, performs a ritual, sees memories bloom, then simply reaffirms the same goal with no narrowed options or visible cost. The scarf "warmed" and colors bloomed, yet this reversal does not alter her tactics or foreclose a path—she "refolded the scarf carefully" and promises to return, a soft reset. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly and the piece avoids causality breaks, but the closure unit lacks legible cost: the "portal half-opened" and "reawakening neared completion" are declarations without an on-page change in knowledge, stance, or consequence. The final lines loop back to the opening premise ("The place where stories live beckoned") without reconfiguring what that means or what Eliza sacrificed to approach it.</comment>

<comment>The scientific poetry library is vividly rendered ("volumes of quantum sonnets and fractal elegies," "worn oak floors," "pseudospherical model from the stacks") and the scarf functions as micro-setting throughout multiple beats. The setting supplies the pseudosphere and texts that Eliza references, lending plausible constraint to her ritual. However, the library does not pressure a key choice—patrons drift obliviously and no resource shortage or spatial obstacle alters her attempt—so the environment remains atmospheric rather than causal. The scarf's warming and the library's "heart pulsed faintly" charge the final image but do not constrain the outcome.</comment>

<comment>One dominant stake is signaled early (finding the realm where stories live) but escalation under the Accumulative lens is minimal: Eliza begins with conviction, performs the ritual, sees a vision, then reaffirms her plan without a tightening that forecloses an option. The scarf "demanded balance; hyperbolic space pulled at her, tempting full immersion," yet a patron's cough deflects the temptation and she simply refolds the scarf and postpones—no visible trade-off or cost paid on the page. The "place drew nearer" is asserted rather than demonstrated through a choice or renunciation that alters later tactics.</comment>

<grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>Theme (stories as living, tangible entities accessible through geometric method) emerges from events and images rather than direct statement, and the final image of Eliza slipping the scarf around her neck and the library's "heart pulsed faintly" gestures toward resonance. However, the ending does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer—it restates the quest ("The place where stories live beckoned, tangible at last") without revealing what was risked or learned. The hyperbolic geometry motif is densely present but does not constrain choice or accumulate pressure toward a conceptual repricing; it remains a repeated descriptor. Repeated fragments like "observed solitude" and "odd hours" function as lyric texture but do not shift meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>5.6</grade>
<comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature (geometry-obsessed librarian interpreting the world through curvature and tessellations) is distinct. However, the prose drifts into expository summary at peak beats ("The core concept gripped her"; "Eliza's motivation sharpened") rather than dramatizing perception under pressure. Diction occasionally reaches for elevated register ("non-Euclidean fury," "mathematical poetry made manifest") that reads more like authorial gloss than the librarian's lived idiom. Purposeful compression in the final third creates cadence shift, but multiple filter verbs ("saw flashes," "noted the implications") and recycled stems ("Eliza's eccentricity shone sanely"; "sanely, Eliza noted") flatten immediacy in high-pressure moments.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>4.9</grade>
<comment>The prose carries vivid sensory detail and controlled rhythm in descriptive passages, but pervasive scaffold and template cadence accumulate across the piece: "Eliza's eccentricity shone sanely" / "Sanely, Eliza noted"; "In that place where stories lived" / "The place where stories live beckoned"; "Patrons browsed on" / "Patrons would browse unaware"; "observed solitude" appears four times as a thematic tag without evolving function. Paragraph-length one-line fragments in the final third ("Tomorrow's odd hours called, geometry her guide." / "Patrons would browse unaware, as ever.") create rhythmic monotony rather than purposeful compression. Figurative language is dense ("horocycle's embrace," "pseudospherical model," "hyperbolic branches") but much of it decorates rather than advances pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: "analog memories demanded physical resurrection, not simulation" is immediately followed by "analog memories reawakening through the geometric warp," restating the same claim. These artifacts touch the closure sequence, lowering clarity and momentum.</comment>

<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of librarian-as-geometer and scarf-as-map offers a fresh angle on memory and story, and the hyperbolic geometry lens is specific enough to feel researched. However, the emotional arc (determined quest → vision → renewed determination) follows a familiar template without transformation, and the final image does not surprise or complicate prior material—it restates the opening premise. The risk of "full immersion" is raised then immediately deflected by a cough, a safety valve that undercuts bold commitment. The piece reads as a careful execution of its premise rather than a lived inquiry that discovers something unexpected in the process.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>Eliza is present throughout and her actions (unfurling the scarf, tracing folds, pressing it to the pseudosphere) drive the ritual sequence. However, her choices do not create reversals or alter tactics—she begins determined to map story-space, performs the attempt, and ends reaffirming the same goal. The patron's cough "grounds her" but she makes no subsequent decision that narrows options or pays cost; she simply postpones. Setup and middle development are present; closure participation is observational rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The scarf appears in setup (inherited, analog memories), middle (unfolded, traced, pressed to pseudosphere, warmed), and closure (refolded, slipped around her neck). Its warming and color bloom constitute a reversal that triggers Eliza's vision, and the final gesture of wearing it charges the ending image. The scarf's specific properties (tattered silk, faded motifs, hyperbolic tessellations) constrain the method and reweight across beats. However, cost tied directly to the scarf is implied rather than dramatized—she refolds it "carefully" but no visible trade-off or irreversible change results from its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.3</grade>
<comment>Analog memories are signaled early ("physical imprints of lives woven into threads, not digital echoes") and shape Eliza's method (she seeks "physical resurrection, not simulation"). The scarf's warming and color bloom dramatize their reawakening in the middle beat. However, the concept does not constrain a choice with cost—Eliza successfully reawakens glimpses without sacrifice or failure, and the ending restates the quest without repricing what analog memory demands or costs. The concept functions more as thematic frame than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>3.1</grade>
<comment>"Sanely eccentric" is asserted three times ("sanely eccentric figure," "Eliza's eccentricity shone sanely," "Sanely, Eliza noted") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is label-only; no moment shows her balancing rationality against unconventional impulse in a way that alters her tactics or forecloses an option. Functional mention without causal leverage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>"Reawaken" is signaled early ("analog memories reawakening") and the scarf's warming / color bloom constitute the act in the middle beat, triggering Eliza's vision of past bearers and the story-realm. The final lines ("Analog memories, once dormant, flickered eternally" / "Through hyperbolic geometry, reawakening neared completion") tie closure to this action. However, the reawakening does not redefine options or foreclose a path—it simply confirms Eliza's premise and she continues the same quest. All three gates present; causal role in one major beat and closure linkage, but swappable with "discover" or "unlock" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Hyperbolic geometry is introduced early ("studied it through the library's core texts"), demonstrated in the middle (tracing with protractor and chalk, "bending it into a horocycle's embrace," "hyperbolic tessellations"), and mentioned at closure ("Through hyperbolic geometry, reawakening neared completion"). The method is specific and the pseudospherical model supplies a tool, yet the mechanics do not constrain a choice or create friction—Eliza simply performs the ritual and it works as intended. The method functions as thematic texture and procedural detail without shaping attempts or imposing cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The scientific poetry library is vividly anchored in setup, supplies resources (pseudospherical model, core texts on Rilke and Poe reimagined in hyperbolic metrics), and returns in the final image ("The library's heart pulsed faintly now"). Patrons browsing create ambient pressure (observed solitude) but do not interrupt or complicate Eliza's attempt—they remain oblivious. The setting enables the ritual but does not constrain a choice or supply an obstacle that alters outcome. Strong atmospheric presence; functional but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.5</grade>
<comment>"While patrons browse" is signaled in setup and mentioned multiple times ("patrons drifted," "Patrons browsed on," "Patrons filtered out as dawn hinted gray"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Eliza has all night and patrons never interfere. Midnight deepens the solitude but does not impose a deadline or complication. The temporal anchor is present and coherent but does not function as a live clock that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Eliza's desire "to find that place where narratives breathed independently of pages" is stated early and reaffirmed at closure ("knowing the place drew nearer"). The motivation drives her ritual in the middle (unfurling the scarf, tracing tessellations) and the scarf's warming crystallizes her conviction. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—no on-page friction between her want and a competing cost or fear. She begins determined, succeeds partially, and ends more determined; no complication tests her commitment or reprices the goal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>"Observed solitude" is signaled early ("patrons browsed in observed solitude") and recurs four times, modulating slightly as patrons filter out and dawn arrives. The tone is coherent and the final image ("In observed solitude, Eliza dreamed on") charges the ending with quiet persistence. However, the tone does not shift under pressure—Eliza's solitude remains stable throughout with no moment where isolation itself constrains or threatens. The tone wraps the piece consistently but does not drive a turn or reweight the stakes.</comment>
