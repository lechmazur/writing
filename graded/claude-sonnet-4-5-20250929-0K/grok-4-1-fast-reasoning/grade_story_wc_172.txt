<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is presented with contradictory impulses—amoral philanthropist who secretly weeps for extinct birds—but the interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("sentiment veiled," "fractured grace") rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure. The final act of placing the egg reads as motivated, yet the piece tells us he's sentimental rather than showing it through contradictory on-page behavior in a high-stakes moment. Backstory dominates (water grabs, ribbon-cuttings, museum vault) without anchoring in present stimuli that alter his stance; the reflection flattens pressure instead of charging it, triggering BRR penalty routing to Q7 and capping Q1 at 8.3.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation arrives late—who Elias is and why he's on the salt flat emerge piecemeal across the first third, but the effect does not pay off at closure, applying −0.4 under the Orientation Test and capping Q3 at 7.0. The closure unit is a Charged Poise / Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias places the egg and walks away as storm waters arrive, reweighting his manufactured drought with a visible ritual of absolution. Cost is felt but oblique—he cannot speak of it, and the story ends on imagined birdsong rather than a materially changed option. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (cracks as map, thunder's lull-to-roar, salt as tomb/womb), and the final storm reconfigures the flat's meaning, meeting the threshold for on-page closure with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The salt flat is vividly rendered ("crust gleaming like shattered porcelain," "cracks etched deeper by engineered famine") and the crack-map motif is introduced early, but the environment functions primarily as symbolic backdrop rather than constraining Elias's choices. The egg placement in the hollow is the one moment where setting (subterranean seep) enables action, lifting the score modestly. The 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is not met; the storm arrives to charge the image but does not force a tactical shift, capping Q3 at 8.8 and placing it mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—absolution through preserving the huia's echo—is signaled early but remains abstract; the piece declares sentiment and guilt without showing a live internal conflict that tightens options. The kneeling and placement constitute one meaningful action, meeting minimal escalation for this length, but no reversal or cost-bearing choice narrows Elias's path on the page; he walks away unburdened ("the release lightening his step"). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through pattern or cadence shift; here the repeated thunder motif and crack-map recurrence create texture but do not force a trade-off or foreclose an option with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—manufactured harm seeking grace through symbolic restitution—emerges from the drought/egg juxtaposition and the final storm image, avoiding overt thesis statements. The piece resists simple redemption ("amorality cracked, sentiment bloomed") but flirts with on-the-nose phrasing: "Philanthropy unbroken, sentiment veiled" and "wove redemption's threadbare veil" echo prompt language rather than arising organically. The final storm and imagined birdsong offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of absolution, but the echo feels gestural rather than grounded in prior particulars that reweight the material with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent elevated register with purposeful compression ("amorality his shield," "fate's own blueprint"), but diction occasionally drifts into abstraction that exceeds Elias's plausible interiority under stress ("cruel artistry," "geologic time," "entropy"). POV remains stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature—corporate titan who weeps for fledglings—is character-specific. The piece teaches its lyric cadence early and holds it, but the syntax becomes formulaic: repeated "[Noun] [verb], [noun] [verb]" structures flatten rhythm in peak beats ("Thunder cracked nearer, promising deluge... Elias rose, sentimental tears salting..."). No dialogue present; evaluated for narration only.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("bruised sky," "shattered porcelain," "bone-white wasteland," "dried heart," "throat," "veil," "fracture," "cradle"), creating dense texture but dulling propulsion in high-pressure beats where clarity would serve closure better (−0.5 for density without pattern payoff). Paraphrase loops appear: "The egg, nestled deep, held possibility's breath" immediately follows "the huia's ghost winged free in his mind," restating hope without added detail (−0.2). Template cadence runs across multiple lines: "Elias Voss, shaper of wastes... The egg, nestled deep... Winds howled... Salt flats stretched... The world turned..." (−0.4). Reflection dominates the middle third without present anchors that alter his stance, flattening momentum and routing to Q7 per BRR. Cumulative artifact deductions total −1.1, and artifacts touch the closure beat ("Life, perhaps, would answer"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The amoral-philanthropist-seeking-absolution frame is familiar; the piece does not transform it through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus, applying −0.8 within Q8. The crack-map motif (drought scars forming coordinates to nesting sites) offers a fresh visual conceit, but the story leans on it as symbolic ornament rather than a tactical constraint that alters Elias's approach. The emotional arc—guilt → ritual placement → imagined redemption—follows a predictable template without a turn that redefines prior material in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his amorality (water grabs, ribbon-cuttings) versus philanthropy (hospitals, orphanages) is detailed in backstory. His single on-page decision—placing the egg—is motivated by this tension but occurs late (final third) and is not constrained by his amorality in a visible way; the trait shapes context but does not narrow his options or create a trade-off. Early signal +0.5, one beat (placement) +0.4, late arrival in action −0.3, ornamental use of the trait in prior beats −0.5. Rounded down: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The egg appears early ("clutched," "whispered to it nightly") and returns in the placement beat and the final image ("held possibility's breath"). Its physical curve and speckled shell are handled twice with specificity, and it charges the closure image. Early signal +0.6, two distinct beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, cost tied to it (Elias cannot speak of the act) +0.4, swappability (any rare artifact would serve) −0.5. Rounded down: 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The manufactured drought is seeded in paragraph two, causally linked to the crack-map in paragraph seven ("engineered famine of rain, formed a map"), and reweighted in the final storm ("blurring lines into potential rivers"). It shapes Elias's tactic (deciphering coordinates from satellite feeds) and the stakes (absolution for causing extinction). Early signal +0.7, two beats (map creation, storm reversal) +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, cost connection (his guilt is the engine) +0.5, summary-only in middle beats −0.4. Rounded down: 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Secretly sentimental" is labeled in paragraph eleven but not dramatized through on-page friction; the story tells us he denied tenderness in boardrooms yet shows only unopposed reverence for the egg. The trait enables the placement but does not constrain or create visible cost in the moment. Early label +0.4, one beat (placement) +0.4, label-only trait −0.6, no on-page cost tied to hiding sentiment −0.4. Rounded down: 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The release (placing the egg in the hollow) occurs in paragraph twenty-two and serves as the story's peak action; removing it would collapse the closure. It is seeded through his motivation and the map but does not create prior turns—only the final one. Late first appearance (final third) −0.7, one beat (placement itself) +0.4, causal pressure (completes the arc) +1.0, closure linkage (pivot moment) +1.5, irreplaceability +0.6. Rounded down: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The crack-map is introduced in paragraph seven, its mechanics explained (satellite decoding, convergence to a nexus), and it guides Elias to the hollow. It shapes one key choice (where to place the egg) and returns in the final image as storm waters blur the lines. Early signal +0.6, two beats (decoding, placement site) +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, swappability (any map would serve) −0.6. Rounded down: 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The salt flat is anchored early and its cracks constrain Elias's path (he traces the map's veins) and supply the moisture seep that enables placement. It charges the final image when storm waters promise to heal the scars. Early signal +0.7, two beats (tracing, seep discovery) +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.1, micro-setting (hollow with seep) +0.5, postcard description in opening −0.4. Rounded down: 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"During the lull of distant thunder" is named in the opening line; thunder punctuates beats ("grumbled afar," "hushed again," "cracked nearer," "faded to rhythm") and frames the closure ("storm broke fully"). It does not tighten decisions or create a live clock that alters tactics; instead it provides atmospheric cadence. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, no causal pressure on choices −0.8, vague tracking (no urgency) −0.5. Rounded down: 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The desire to preserve the huia's echo is stated in paragraph seventeen and motivates the placement; it is seeded earlier through his nightly whispers to the egg. The motivation is told more than dramatized—no on-page friction between preserving the echo and other wants. Early seed +0.5, one beat (placement) +0.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, told-only (no conflicted choice) −0.6. Rounded down: 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Fractured grace" appears as a descriptor twice and governs the prose register: elevated yet fragmented, mirroring Elias's contradictions and the cracked landscape. The tone remains static—elegiac throughout—rather than modulating with pressure, but the final image ("fractured beauty yielding to storm's embrace") charges it with hope. Early signal (title phrase in paragraph six, reprise in twenty-two) +0.7, closure linkage +1.1, coherence across turns +0.6, static mood (no modulation) −0.5, charges final image +0.4. Rounded down: 6.8.</comment>
