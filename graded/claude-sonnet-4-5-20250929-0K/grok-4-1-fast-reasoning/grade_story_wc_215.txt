<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The recluse's interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("tranquilly perceptive," "mute eloquence," "astonishment") without embodied sensation or micro-choices that reveal contradictory impulses. His motivation to "safeguard that weight" is asserted rather than earned through competing desires acting simultaneously in scene. The ghost-covenant discovery unfolds as observation rather than choices under pressure; he deciphers but never faces a trade-off that forecloses a path with visible cost until the final stasis. The ending acceptance reads as Earned Stasis, but the emotional progression is smoothed rather than layered with credible irrationality or self-deception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately by the ghost appearance (~15% mark). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through ghost-dance clues, glass-box discovery, and ritual that mends the oasis, landing in Earned Stasis (perpetual vigil as guardian). The covenant untangling is conveyed through gesture and light rather than causal decision points, which fits the lens. However, cost at closure is stated ("heavier with fresh purpose," "isolation deepened, yet enriched") rather than shown in a concrete forfeiture or altered tactic on the page, weakening the closure's felt weight. One meaningful deepening is present but the cost proof test is not fully satisfied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland, withered hives, and stained glass box are vivid and purposeful. The glass box constrains the ritual (tilted to fracture sunlight, mended cracks guiding ghost dissolution) and charges the final image (placed atop the tallest hive as covenant guardian). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the recluse's perceptive calm. Spatial choreography of ghosts hovering near hives and weaving through light beams is coherent. The oasis environment enables the closure beat, satisfying the 9+ quick test for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the covenant's silence to allow oasis renewal—is signaled by midpoint. Pressure deepens when the recluse realizes the pact binds him perpetually, not just the ghosts. However, escalation is driven by ghost instruction and the box's mechanics rather than protagonist agency or a forced trade-off. The recluse never chooses between competing goods or pays a visible price that alters later tactics; he complies and accepts. The ending's "heavier with fresh purpose" is told rather than dramatized, so cost legibility is muted. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful tightening is sufficient, but agency and on-page cost clarity fall short of higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—oaths, silence as burden, covenant between human and spirit—emerges through ghost gestures, glass motifs, and the recluse's vigil. The stained glass box recurs with shifting function (relic → ritual tool → guardian totem), achieving one purposeful reprise. Yet the final paragraph moralizes directly ("silence bloomed eternal," "weight held, unspoken, unbreakable"), replacing scene pressure with thematic summary and violating the non-literal answer test. The piece invites reflection but resolves into a tidy moral rather than earned ambiguity, triggering the −0.5 to −0.8 penalty for final-paragraph theme statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent ("tranquilly perceptive," wind whispers, lightplay on dunes) but reliant on repeated stock phrases: "mute eloquence" (×3), "tranquilly perceptive/perceived" (×4), "contextual clues" (×3), "astonishment/astonished" (×3). These label-only tics flatten voice particularity and read as template cadence rather than a singular rhythm. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("nascent buzz," "veiled life") without clear motivation. No dialogue is present. The repetitive stems and stock modifiers violate the loop/scaffold screen, warranting deduction in Q7 as well, but voice convergence under pressure lowers Q6 independently.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("astonishment shattered his solitude… eyes widening in rare astonishment"; "mute eloquence… silence eloquent testament"), synonym churn on "gaze" (×8 in functional roles), and template cadence runs ("The recluse [verb]… The recluse [verb]…") accumulate across the text. Stock metaphors ("weight of unspoken words," "threads on a loom") and filter-verb stacks ("seeing ghost-veils," "gazing at stars") dull immediacy in peak beats. The closure paragraph ("silence bloomed eternal. The weight held, unspoken, unbreakable") leans on abstraction rather than concrete image. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 deduction and the global 9+ disallowance and 8.8 cap across categories per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The ghost-beekeeper covenant premise is specific and the stained-glass-ritual mechanism is fresh. However, the emotional arc—isolated hermit accepts burden—follows a familiar redemption template without a non-obvious moral calculus or risky structural choice. The ghost-dance decipherment and light-mending ritual feel purposeful but lack a turn that grows from contradictory character impulses. The ending's perpetual-vigil stasis is earned in hindsight but not transformed by lived detail or a bold perspectival risk. Transformation test passes moderately; freshness is middling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The astonished recluse is present throughout. He freezes at the ghost appearance, follows their lead to unearth the box, pieces together the covenant through observation, performs the ritual, and accepts guardianship. However, most beats are observational rather than choice-driven; he complies with ghost instruction rather than deciding between competing paths. The "astonishment evolved to serene acceptance" shift occurs off-page across years. Two beats (unearthing, ritual participation) show agency, but the swappability test suggests "perceptive hermit" would work with minor edits. Missing strong causal pressure and closure decision. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal moderate +0.7, closure linkage weak +0.4, swappability −0.6, summary span −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stained glass box appears ~20% in (unearthed), recurs at ritual (tilted to fracture light, cracks mend), and in the ending (placed atop hive as guardian totem). It constrains the ritual method (lightplay guides ghost dissolution) and charges the final image. Three distinct beats, causal role in the ending, and irreplaceability (its unique panels map the covenant) satisfy all three gates. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost connection weak +0.3, late middle entry −0.3. Strong integration but closure use is more symbolic perch than active constraint, capping just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tangled covenant frames the central stake (untangle the pact to renew the oasis) and is seeded by ghost gestures (~30% mark) then explained via contextual clues. It narrows tactics (ritual via box, silence preserved) and the ending binds the recluse to perpetual vigil, altering his existence. Three gates met. Early signal moderate +0.5, two beats (discovery, ritual) +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, cost moderate +0.4, swappability low (covenant specificity) +0.5, but the mechanics are told through summary rather than dramatized choice friction −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" is a label repeated four times ("tranquilly perceptive soul," "nature," "tranquilly perceived," "tranquilly perceptive [final line]") without embodied cost. It describes his observation method but does not constrain a visible choice or force a trade-off. The trait enables decipherment but could be replaced by "attentive" or "patient" with no structural change. Early signal +0.6, one beat (ritual observation) +0.4, causal weak +0.3, closure label-mention +0.2, ornamental/swappable −0.8, label-only −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Gaze" recurs eight times and drives key beats: freezing at ghost sight, gazing through box facets to see swirls, holding steady during ritual, gazing at stars for ghost-veils. The ritual hinges on "gaze unwavering, channeling will through eyes alone," making it mechanically necessary. Three beats, causal at closure, irreplaceable in ritual moment. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, cost weak +0.2, but the action is repeated so frequently it borders on synonym churn, and several uses are observational without decision cost −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Through contextual clues" is named three times and describes the method by which the recluse deciphers the covenant (ghost gestures, box motifs). It shapes his interpretive process at two beats (covenant discovery, ritual mechanics). However, the method is explanatory rather than dramatized as a constraint or risk; any observant character could succeed similarly. Setup +0.4, two beats +0.9, causal moderate +0.8, closure indirect +0.4, swappability −0.7, summary-only −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis is anchored early (line 1), recurs throughout (hives, channels, stump, rows), and the wasteland/oasis boundary pressure frames the stakes (scorch vs. bloom). The oasis environment supplies the ritual space and the ending's fragile renewal ("fragile bubble," "blooms tentatively unfurled"). Spatial elements (buried corner, tallest hive) guide action. Four beats, causal pressure on stakes, closure linkage strong. Early signal +0.8, four beats +1.4, causal +1.4, closure +1.6, cost +0.5, but some description is postcard-like without altering tactics −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after ghosts become visible" is signaled at the inciting incident ("one dawn, after ghosts became visible") and governs the entire narrative window. However, time is elastic (days blur, years pass in the coda) without a tightening clock that forces urgency. The ritual unfolds at dusk in one continuous sequence, but no deadline or countdown pressures choices. Setup +0.6, two beats (appearance, ritual) +0.9, causal moderate +0.7, closure span (years) +0.5, ornamental summary span −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To preserve the weight of unspoken words" is articulated ~50% in ("His motivation crystallized—to safeguard that weight") and drives the ritual and ending vigil. It constrains his choice to perform the silent ritual and accept perpetual guardianship. However, the motivation is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting wants, and no visible friction between desire and cost appears on the page. Setup mid +0.4, two beats (motivation articulation, ending acceptance) +0.9, causal +0.9, closure +1.0, told-only −0.6, cost indirect +0.3, late first mention −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Mute eloquence" is named twice and the tone of silence, gesture, and implication is coherent across the piece (ghost wordlessness, recluse's silent vigil, "no words passed"). The tone charges the closure image ("silence bloomed eternal") and modulates slightly from astonishment to serene acceptance. However, "mute eloquence" is a stock phrase and the final paragraph over-articulates the theme ("unspoken, unbreakable"), reducing tonal subtlety. Setup +0.6, modulation +0.7, closure linkage +1.0, coherence +0.7, stock label −0.4, over-articulation in ending −0.5.</comment>
