<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to discover "time's texture" is stated repeatedly but never grounded in concrete, character-particular interiority—why this obsession matters to *him* remains abstract. Internal conflict is mostly told ("passionate subtlety," "ethically playful") rather than shown through simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene. The final "choice" to integrate the rope rather than sever it feels unmotivated; no prior causality establishes why wrapping it around his wrist would solve the binary the beings posed. Embodied emotion is minimal; labels like "passionate subtlety" and "ethically playful" recur without visceral grounding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The Orientation Test is marginal: "energy beings," "terra-cotta grotto," and "Elias" anchor within ~120 words, but the connection between prison escape and time-texture quest remains hazy until mid-story. The piece reads Accumulative/Textural, yet the closure unit—Elias wrapping the rope and declaring "not sever, but integrate"—lacks visible cost; the beings simply "envelop him in light" and he emerges "transformed" without forfeiting agency, relationship, or opportunity on the page. The "impossible choice" dissolves into a conceptual loophole rather than a decision with felt consequence. A micro turn (the third layer unveiling) exists, but escalation under the Accumulative lens demands a cadence shift or cost that reweights the stake—here the final image asserts transformation without dramatizing its price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The grotto's "ruddy walls," "labyrinthine curves," and "starlight fracturing through fissures" are vivid and coherent. Spatial choreography is clean: Elias kneels, lays the rope, and the beings coalesce in the chamber's heart. The rope's tactile presence (frayed fibers, warmth from absorbed energy) functions as micro-setting. However, the grotto does not constrain Elias's choice; he could perform the same ritual anywhere the beings appear. The setting charges atmosphere but does not narrow options or supply a resource that alters the outcome, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering time's texture—is signaled early and persists. The beings' pattern-unveiling creates a sequential deepening (first layer: knotted tapestry; second: binary fork; third: integration illusion), yet no tightening *forecloses* a live option. The "impossible choice" is presented in the second layer, but Elias circumvents it via wordplay ("Not sever, but integrate") without visible trade-off; the beings approve instantly, and he emerges empowered. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation should show a cadence shift or cost that reweights the stake—here the progression feels additive rather than compressive. No persistent constraint (time, stamina, social cost) shapes his tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—impossible choices as woven texture—is stated rather than emerging from particulars. The rope recurs (prison escape → bridge → integration) but its meaning shift is told ("the choice was illusion") rather than earned by prior scene work. The final assertion that "time's texture embraced all frayed ends" reads as summary rather than resonant non-literal answer. Subtext is thin; Elias's verse ("In coils of yesterday's chain, what tomorrow unties?") gestures toward profundity without specific grounding in his history or stakes. The piece leans on the prompt's conceptual vocabulary ("ethically playful," "passionate subtlety," "texture of time") as thematic shorthand.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elias. Distance is consistent, though often elevated ("passionate subtlety," "velvet murmur," "inexorable") in ways that feel more authorial than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic—Elias notices what the plot requires (rope, beings, patterns) without idiosyncratic bias. The single line of dialogue ("In coils of yesterday's chain, what tomorrow unties?") is stylized and archaic, fitting the poetic conceit but not tested against conversational realism. Filter verbs ("felt," "recognized") appear but are spaced. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The elevated diction occasionally clashes with the POV's stated "roadside poet" vernacular (e.g., "temporal snags," "bioluminescent script").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "frayed rope / fraying further / frayed anew," "pattern / patterns / patterned," "ethically playful" appears four times, "passionate subtlety" twice, "texture of time" six times. Template cadence in the middle third: "He traced... / Now free... / The grotto's... / Their energy... / Elias's heart..." Nearly every paragraph opens with a subject-verb stem. Stacked filter constructions ("he recognized," "he felt," "he fingered") dull immediacy. Figurative language is dense but occasionally mixed: "veins of forgotten lightning" (veins pulse, lightning does not), "temporal snags" (abstract jargon). The overwriting and loop density trigger −1.2 in Q7; presence in the final third disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise—poet encounters energy beings offering metaphysical choice via riddle-patterns—follows the archetypal stranger-offers-transcendence template without transformation. The "impossible choice" that dissolves into non-choice via semantic trick is a familiar narrative escape hatch. Specific details (terra-cotta, rope from prison, roadside verses) add texture but do not synthesize into a non-obvious angle; the beats would function identically with different props and setting. The resolution—integration rather than severance—is announced rather than discovered through prior causal friction. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece executes a familiar arc in elevated diction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is named early and his roadside-poet identity frames expectation (+0.3 setup). He makes one key choice: wrapping the rope rather than severing it, which shifts the ending beat (+0.4 beat). However, the choice emerges from wordplay rather than prior character friction, reducing causal pressure. His verses prompt the beings' approval, giving him limited agency (+0.3). No visible cost attaches to his decision; he emerges "transformed" and "ready to drift once more" without foreclosing a path. Swappability is moderate—another seeker could perform similar beats. Late-mild causal work + one beat + closure linkage places the score in mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The rope appears in the opening ("uncoiled… from his satchel"), recurs in the middle choice beat ("fingered the rope"), and is active in the ending (wrapped around his wrist, ignited, "coiled a remnant"). Three distinct touches across setup, middle, closure (+1.4). Its prison-escape origin adds specificity (+0.4). It enables the final act (binding rather than severing) and is reweighted in the closure image ("frayed anew") (+0.9). However, its unique properties (frayed, hemp texture) do not constrain Elias's options in a way that another symbolic object could not; the beings accept any engagement. Swappability friction −0.5. Strong presence and closure linkage place it in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Impossible choices" is named in the second layer and frames the binary (sever vs. keep rope). Setup occurs mid-story (past first third, −0.3). The concept narrows options momentarily (binary fork presented, +0.5), but Elias resolves it via semantic reframe ("Not sever, but integrate") without on-page cost, reducing causal pressure. The beings approve instantly, so the "impossibility" does not constrain tactics. Closure linkage is weak; the final image asserts integration without demonstrating its stakes. The concept functions more as thematic echo than structural force. Mid-low integration: present, frames one turn, but swappable and cost-free.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Ethically playful" appears as a label four times ("ethically playful defiance," "ethically playful by nature," "ethically playful to the end") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. Setup occurs early (+0.3). The trait is invoked to justify Elias's verse-responses and final wordplay, but those beats would function identically if he were "curious" or "daring." No tradeoff or price is shown; the beings reward his playfulness without friction. Label-only trait with no causal pressure or beat involvement beyond decoration. Ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Pattern" is named early ("the first pattern emerged") and recurs throughout (spiral of light, unveiling layers, Elias's rhymes mirroring spirals). Setup (+0.5), two-to-three beats (beings' patterns, Elias's verse-pattern, final integration, +0.9), and closure linkage (beings' patterns "etched in his soul," +0.8). The action drives the beings' approval and the layered revelation structure. However, the mechanics are loose—what makes one pattern succeed and another fail is never clarified—and "pattern" could be replaced by "ritual," "song," or "gesture" with minor edits. Swappability −0.6. Present across beats with moderate causal work but replaceable method.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Uncovering layers" is signaled early ("patterns unveiled by uncovering layers") and structures the middle sequence (first, second, third layer). Setup (+0.5), two beats (each layer revelation, +0.6), and the method shapes Elias's verse-responses. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown—what exactly "uncovering" means in action remains abstract. The method does not impose a unique constraint; another verb ("decoding," "revealing") would serve identically. Closure linkage is weak; the final image mentions "uncovered layers" but does not hinge on the method's specifics. Present and functional but swappable, trending mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The grotto is named early ("terra-cotta grotto beneath… starlight") and described vividly (ruddy walls, labyrinthine curves, fissures admitting starlight). Setup (+0.6). The setting amplifies the beings' hum and provides atmosphere, but it does not constrain Elias's choices or supply a unique resource—the same encounter could occur in any enclosed, atmospheric space. The grotto's "embrace" is invoked at closure but does not reweight the outcome. Spatial choreography is clean, and tone is coherent, but the setting remains postcard rather than tactical. Vivid but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the energy beings arrive" is noted in the opening ("three nights prior") and frames the inciting condition. Setup (+0.4). However, elapsed time is vague—the grotto encounter's duration is untracked, and no clock tightens Elias's decisions. The timeframe does not escalate pressure or alter tactics; the beings wait passively for his response. The "after arrival" framing is functional but replaceable with "during a vision" or "at a crossroads." Ornamental timeframe with no tactical impact, trending low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is stated early and recurs (Elias "sought the texture," "chased in roadside chants," "to touch time's grit"). Setup (+0.6). The motivation drives his presence in the grotto and his engagement with the beings (+0.5 causal). However, *why* he craves this texture is never grounded in concrete need or contradiction—it reads as abstract quest. The final achievement ("he felt it then: time's texture") is told rather than embodied in a choice with visible cost. No friction between want and consequence. Present and drives premise, but lacks dramatized conflict or payoff with stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Passionate subtlety" is named twice and invoked throughout via diction ("velvet murmur," "quiet fire kindling," "subtle hum"). Setup (+0.4). Tone is consistent—elevated, restrained intensity—but does not modulate with pressure; the register remains uniformly lyrical from opening to close. The tone charges atmosphere but does not tighten at the peak choice or shift cadence to mark escalation. A single static mood rather than a dynamic arc. Coherent but lacks the pressure-driven modulation that would lift it into high bands.</comment>
