<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's internal life is asserted rather than contradictory—mourning transmutes into purpose without dramatized struggle or competing impulses acting simultaneously. Her motivation feels declared ("vowed to teach these fading stars to bloom") rather than earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure. The shift from rock bottom to purposeful action lacks visible cost or renunciation that would foreclose a path. Interiority relies on label-only emotion ("subdued ardor," "withering soul") without embodied sensory breakdown or character-particular texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation debt: who, where, and when remain vague through the opening third—"timeless observatory" is spatially unanchored, and Elara's physical traversal through mist into a supernatural space lacks clear stakes or constraint. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) never coheres: the piece cycles through vignettes of origami-making without meaningful tightening or pattern break that reweights the dominant stake. Closure is asserted ("stars bloomed eternal") but not dramatized; no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing lands on the page with felt cost. The final paragraph summarizes rather than enacting transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The observatory's brass telescopes, orreries, and obsidian domes supply vivid texture, but remain postcard detail—no tool or spatial constraint shapes a choice or alters tactics. The "curtains of intention" are conceptually interesting yet never function as physical obstacles or resources that pressure Elara's actions. The micro-setting (her hands, tools, vellum) appears but doesn't constrain a beat with cost. Sensory selection is omnidirectional catalog rather than urgency-filtered perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reviving fading stars—is declared early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Elara's method (crafting origami with coordinates) succeeds without friction, failure, or tactical adjustment; each figure works, stars respond, no reversal tightens options. The inferred lens (Accumulative) requires density increase or cadence shift that reweights cost; instead, "nights blurred" summarizes repetition without dramatized deepening. Agency is execution of a preordained solution rather than choice under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of mourning-to-renewal emerges through repeated label ("mourning transmuted into purpose") rather than earned image or dramatic irony. The origami and stencil motifs recur but do not shift meaning beat to beat—they illustrate rather than complicate the stated arc. The final image ("etching revival across the void") is a metaphor that summarizes theme rather than offering a non-literal answer. Subtext is minimal; most meaning lives in direct statement ("her mourning had illuminated the grandest truth").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Narrative voice maintains elevated register throughout ("subdued ardor," "nexuses where intention could coax life from dormancy"), but diction clashes with the focalizer's grief-state—no compression or breakdown under emotional pressure. Perceptual signature is generic poetic catalog rather than character-specific noticing shaped by jeweler's expertise or mourning. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Distance remains stable but psychic intimacy is shallow; interiority is assertion ("spark ignited") rather than sensory-specific thought texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops permeate peak beats: "withering edges greening into fervent bloom" / "stars birthing in symphonic ardor" restate revival without added pressure. Template cadence runs cluster in the middle third ("She found... She pierced... Folding with meticulous care... Each figure embodied..."). Figurative density ("curtains of intention," "tattoo of hope," "eternity's jewelry") appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating metaphor blur. Stock metaphors ("spark ignited," "transmuting into purpose") dull the closure image. Filter-verb stacks ("begin to illuminate," "watched... tears tracing") flatten immediacy in high-pressure moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise (grief-worker revives cosmic decay through craft) echoes familiar template: symbolic work as healing metaphor. The "curtains of intention" and "genuinely artificial" stencil offer surface novelty but function as ornamental labels rather than constraints that force non-obvious choices. Elara's arc—from despair to renewal—follows a predictable trajectory without moral calculus or transformation earned through specific, non-generic detail. Emotional truth is asserted ("tears tracing her cheeks") rather than lived through contradictory impulses or surprising tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara's profession (mourning jewelry maker) is mentioned in the opening line and her tools appear ("fine awls and burnishers"), but her jeweler's expertise does not create a key turn or constrain a choice—she adapts tools without dramatized difficulty or trade-off. Swappable with "craftsperson" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The tattoo stencil appears on a lectern mid-story, is described ("spiraling galaxies etched with impossible precision"), and yields patterns for the origami. It returns implicitly in "endless patterns" but is not handled in a second distinct beat with reweighted cost. Present in setup and development; absent from closure image. Functional but replaceable with any pattern-source.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Curtains of intention" are introduced early and described as obstacles requiring "deliberate ardor" to part, but Elara illuminates them without friction—no failed attempt, no tactical shift. The concept is echoed thematically ("intention could coax life from dormancy") but does not alter options on the page. Setup present; development and payoff weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Genuinely artificial" is applied to the stencil in one long sentence ("man-made in form yet pulsing with authentic cosmic vitality") and mentioned once more ("The genuinely artificial stencil never dulled"). The paradox is label-only; no on-page action demonstrates constraint or enables a tactic with visible cost. Ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Illuminate" drives multiple beats: Elara lights the ritual lantern, its glow parts a curtain, stars respond, she repeats the method across constellations. The action shapes the middle third and is present in the closure zone ("nebula pulsing with newborn vigor"). However, the mechanics never face friction or evolve under pressure; each illumination succeeds identically. Causal but not irreplaceable—"activate" or "awaken" could swap with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The origami method is signaled midpoint ("she shaped origami figures—delicate cranes and blooming lotuses") and its mechanics (coordinates inside, left on instruments) appear in two beats. The method enables the star-revival but is never tested by failure or scarcity of materials. Present in development and implicitly at closure ("final crane amid the glow"); setup late, payoff indirect. Functional but could be abstracted to "encoded messages" without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The timeless observatory frames the entire piece and supplies props (telescopes, orreries, domes). Spatial details are vivid but do not constrain movement or resource use—Elara moves freely, materials never run short. The setting's "eternal rhythm" and responsive hum are atmospheric assertions rather than pressures that alter tactics. Setup strong, development and payoff descriptive rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After hitting rock bottom" is anchored in the opening (husband's death, workshop fire) but functions as backstory label. The timeframe does not tighten decisions—"nights blurred in timelessness" explicitly removes clock pressure. No deadline or temporal scarcity alters tactics. Setup clear, development absent, payoff disconnected from temporal stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach withering to bloom again" is declared early ("she vowed to teach these fading stars to bloom") and drives Elara's repeated actions (crafting, illuminating). However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or on-page costs—no moment where she weighs abandoning the task or sacrifices another goal. Present across beats but lacks friction. Setup and development present; payoff asserted rather than felt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Subdued ardor" is signaled in the second paragraph ("The air hummed with subdued ardor") and echoed in diction ("fervent bloom," "symphonic ardor"). The tone remains static elevated-lyric throughout, with no modulation under pressure or shift that charges the final image. Coherent but one-note; does not deepen or crack at the closure beat. Setup and development present, payoff lacks charge.</comment>
