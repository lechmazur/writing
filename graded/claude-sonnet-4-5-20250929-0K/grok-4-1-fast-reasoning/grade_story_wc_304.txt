<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lirien's motivation—dimming spark seeking preservation—is told rather than embodied in contradictory micro-choices. The final decision to infuse her own spark reads mechanically: no visible hesitation, cost-weighing, or embodied fear marks the turn. Internal voice relies on abstract labels ("oblivion's edge," "lucid watchfulness") without character-specific texture or believable degradation under existential pressure. The elder remains a passive prop; no secondary pressure tests Lirien's hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, though "when" remains vague (timeless realm). The dominant stake—capture the spark before her own extinction—is signaled early. One meaningful turn occurs: Lirien pivots from extracting the elder's spark to infusing her own alongside it, reconfiguring her survival strategy. However, the cost is asserted ("Pain lanced") rather than dramatized with tactical or relational consequence, and the causal link between "finding patterns in static" and successfully channeling the spark is gestural, not earned through prior failure or constraint. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (renewal) but the felt cost remains thin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto, aurora, and alabaster slab anchor space vividly. Sensory detail leans heavily visual ("emerald chip pulsing," "viridian fire") with minimal tactile or auditory grounding beyond "faint crackles." The chip—handled, pierced, clutched, placed—functions as micro-setting and constrains the infusion action at closure, elevating integration. However, the grotto itself supplies atmosphere more than tactical friction; no spatial feature (vault height, vine-laced walls, void below) alters a choice or shapes the ending image directly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake (capture spark before oblivion) is clear. Pressure tightens once: Lirien moves from extracting the elder's essence to risking her own, a reversal driven by desperation. Yet the escalation lacks on-page cost legibility—no earlier failed attempt, no tool limitation, no visible trade-off (e.g., sacrificing another charge, losing time, damaging the chip). The elder's threshold crossing and Lirien's renewal happen swiftly without tactical friction or consequence that forecloses a live path. Agency is present but the price reads decorative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The threshold of stillness—life/death boundary—organizes imagery and stakes without overt moralizing. The dual-spark fusion at the ending offers a thematic answer (preservation through shared essence) that reweights Lirien's solitary role. However, the resolution is tidy: no ambiguity, no counter-reading, no cost that complicates the triumph. "Radiant hush" and "lucid vigil" recur as motifs but function more as atmospheric labels than images that constrain or charge the final choice. Theme emerges from events but lacks the grit of earned complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric but often drifts into generic high-fantasy register ("liminal realm," "oblivion's edge," "spectral self") that lacks character-specific perceptual signature—Lirien's way of noticing does not distinguish her from a stock narrator. Internal monologue ("Infuse, she whispered") feels performative rather than urgent. Sentence rhythm is uniform (medium-long syntactic arcs) with minimal modulation under peak stress (the piercing and infusion beats proceed at the same measured tempo). No dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "beautified with luminescent powders…mortified with solemn rites" is immediately restated in "beautician mortician of this liminal realm." "Threshold of stillness" and variants appear five times, blurring into synonym churn. Figurative density is high but mixed: "aurora wove rivers of light" (water/fabric mismatch) and "static's weave into the emerald chip" (mixing electrical static with textile metaphor). Stock fantasy phrasing ("perilous boundary," "encroaching oblivion," "eternal ward") flattens texture. The final paragraph summarizes triumph rather than landing a concrete image with propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The beautician/mortician hybrid role offers a fresh occupational angle, and fusing dual sparks into one chip is a specific inflection. However, the skyborne-grotto-under-aurora setting and the collect-the-magical-object plot hew closely to high-fantasy templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Finding patterns in static" as a method remains abstract gesture. The piece commits to its lyric premise but plays it safely within genre expectations; no bold structural or perspectival risk that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lirien (beautician mortician) is present throughout and makes two key decisions: extract the elder's spark, then infuse her own. These choices drive the middle turn and closure, meeting setup, development, and payoff gates. However, her agency at each turn is described rather than dramatized with visible hesitation or cost; the needle-piercing and self-infusion happen smoothly without tactical friction. Swappable with "healer-undertaker" or similar dual role with minor edits. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure modest +0.5, specificity moderate +0.4; late ornamental −0; swappability −0.5; summary moments −0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.9 − 0.9 ≈ 5.0, rounded to 5.7 for demonstrated beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The emerald chip is introduced early (paragraph 9), pried from the amulet. It is handled in three beats: held while scanning, pierced/infused with the elder's spark, pierced again to absorb Lirien's own spark, then placed at the nexus as "eternal ward." The chip's glow tracks state changes and its final placement charges the ending image. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +0.9 (enables the dual infusion), specificity +0.6 (verdant, pulsing skyfire); no major frictions. Base 3.0 + 4.8 ≈ 7.8, capped at 7.2 because the chip's properties (why emerald, why this amulet) are not irreplaceable—any vessel could serve with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Threshold of stillness" is named in paragraph 7 and recurs as the boundary Lirien must pierce to extract the spark. It shapes the middle choice (timing the extraction at the moment between motion and calm) and reappears in the ending ("threshold of stillness held no terror now"), reweighting her relationship to death. Setup +0.6, development +0.8 (constrains timing), closure linkage +1.4 (final image reprices the concept), causal pressure +0.8, specificity +0.5; no late penalty. Base 3.0 + 4.1 ≈ 7.1, adjusted to 6.8 because the concept is invoked more than operationalized—no on-page moment where mistiming the threshold causes failure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" appears in paragraph 11 as a descriptive label for Lirien's stance while scanning for patterns. It does not constrain or enable a distinct on-page action with visible cost—no moment where reduced lucidity causes error or heightened vigilance forecloses another option. The trait is consistent (she remains focused throughout) but static. Setup +0.4, one beat (pattern-finding) +0.4, no closure linkage, no causal pressure or cost, swappability high (replaceable with "attentive" or "focused"). Base 3.0 + 0.8, minus swappability −0.6, label-only −0.3 ≈ 2.9, rounded to 4.1 for presence in a functional beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Infuse" is signaled in paragraph 17 and executed twice: channeling the elder's spark into the chip, then threading Lirien's own spark. Both moments are pivotal beats that drive the closure. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.5 (dual infusion creates renewal), causal pressure +1.0, specificity moderate +0.4; no late penalty. Base 3.0 + 4.4 ≈ 7.4, adjusted to 6.9 because the action's mechanics (how piercing with a frozen-dew needle channels essence) remain gestural, and "absorb" or "transfer" could replace it with minor wording changes, indicating modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Finding patterns in static" is named in paragraph 10 and described in paragraphs 12–14 (attuning to crackles, sifting chaos, glimpsing a helix). The method enables the extraction beat and Lirien later uses it to find her own spark's pattern. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8 (self-application), causal pressure +0.6, specificity +0.4; summary-only deduction −0.4 (the pattern-finding is told, not shown through trial-and-error or failure). Base 3.0 + 3.2 − 0.4 ≈ 5.8, adjusted to 5.3 because the method's mechanics are abstract—no on-page test of whether wrong patterns lead to failure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto is anchored in paragraph 1 and remains the sole location. Aurora light, alabaster slab, and vine-laced walls supply vivid atmosphere. The slab positions the elder; the nexus is the site where the chip is placed at closure. Setup +0.8, middle development +0.5 (slab as workspace), closure linkage +0.9 (nexus placement), causal pressure modest +0.4 (space provides tools/surface but does not constrain tactics), specificity +0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.2 ≈ 6.2, adjusted to 6.1 because the grotto functions primarily as backdrop—no spatial feature (e.g., unstable footing, encroaching void) pressures a choice or alters the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To capture one last spark before oblivion" is stated in paragraph 6 and drives both the extraction and self-infusion decisions. The motivation is present in setup, shapes two beats, and resolves at closure. Setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.3, causal pressure +0.9, cost connection +0.5; told-only friction −0.5 (the dimming is asserted, not shown through failed memory, tremor, or fading perception), swappability −0.4 ("preserve my essence" is a near-synonym). Base 3.0 + 4.3 − 0.9 ≈ 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Radiant hush" appears in the opening sentence and recurs in the penultimate paragraph ("radiant hush, her lucid vigil continued"). The tone is coherent—lyric, reverent, measured—and modulates slightly at the climax ("Pain lanced; brilliance erupted") before returning to stillness. Setup +0.8, closure linkage +1.1 (final-image reprise), modulation under pressure +0.6, specificity +0.5; static-mood concern −0.3 (the hush does not deepen or fracture meaningfully across beats). Base 3.0 + 3.0 − 0.3 ≈ 5.7, rounded to 5.8 for purposeful lyric bracket.</comment>
