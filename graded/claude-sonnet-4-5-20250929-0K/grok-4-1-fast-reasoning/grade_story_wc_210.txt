<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias remains a vessel for conceptual machinery rather than a character with embodied contradiction. His rejection of "false comfort" and motivation to "reimagine civilization" are declared and re-declared but never tested by a competing desire or cost that forces a visible tradeoff. The phantoms offer temptation in a single beat, dismissed "with a wave of his hand"—no struggle, no price. Interior life consists of alchemical abstractions ("working memory," "conceived," "volatile elixir") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece announces its closure—civilization reborn—but never dramatizes a moment where Elias's choice narrows options or forecloses a path with felt cost. The amber bottle "hums," essences "solidify," and the town "pulses anew" through summary告 rather than on-page causality. Orientation is delayed: who Elias is, where exactly he sits, and what the amber bottle does remain vague until deep into the second paragraph. The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural by intent, but no pattern is taught early, no cadence shift charges the final image, and the ending delivers a conceptual claim ("a legacy reimagined") without undeniable pressure or cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paper-Lantern Cove supplies vivid images—tattered lanterns, dust-choked streets, weathered pier—that anchor the reader spatially. The lanterns recur and transform (paper to silk, self-igniting orbs), achieving a reprise that reweights the setting's symbolic charge at closure. However, the environment remains decorative: no choice hinges on proximity, access, or material constraint. The kelp scaffolds and memory-infused crystal are named but never used to shape tactics or test Elias's resolve.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to reimagine an entire civilization"—is declared early but never tightened by an on-page reversal or cost that narrows options. Elias conceives, the essences solidify, and the town revives in a single unbroken arc with no setback, complication, or visible price. The phantoms' temptation is waved away in one line; no competing desire, no stamina drain, no material or social sacrifice alters his tactics. Closure delivers the outcome announced at the outset, with no felt trade-off or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme—authentic striving versus false comfort—is stated rather than earned: "false comforts held no sway; only authentic striving defined their world." The amber bottle and lanterns recur, but their symbolic charge remains constant; no final image reweights prior material with undeniable cost. Elias's "refusal of illusion" is told in the opening and reasserted at the end without complication or moral ambiguity. The piece gestures toward complexity (blending human grit and spectral ingenuity) yet resolves into a tidy thesis: one man's vision creates eternity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice remains consistent and elevated, with purposeful compression ("uncorked his mind like a volatile elixir") and patterned diction that teaches a lyric register early. However, the prose converges on a single syntactic template: declarative statements stacked without modulation under pressure. Psychic distance is stable, but perceptual signature is generic—Elias notices alchemical abstractions rather than character-specific details. No dialogue appears; interior monologue consists of thematic assertions rather than contradictory thoughts acting in scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Template cadence dominates: "He conceived… He reimagined… He rejected… Elias stood… Elias melted…" across a dozen sentences. Paraphrase loops recur: "conceive" / "conceived" / "conception," "reimagine" / "reimagined" / "reinvention" cycle without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("unquenched fire," "mental crucible") and abstract nominalization ("collective spirit," "essences") flatten texture. Figurative language clusters in the middle third without coherent vehicle logic: the mind is "uncorked like a volatile elixir," yet also a "forge" and a "crucible." The Text-Artifact penalty pack applies: template runs (−0.6), paraphrase loops (−0.4), stock metaphor strings (−0.3), totaling −1.3 baseline in Q7, escalated to −1.5 because artifacts touch the closure beat ("a legacy reimagined").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The premise—lone alchemist revives ghost town through mental alchemy—fits a familiar template: solitary creator rebuilds civilization after apocalypse. The amber bottle, working memory mechanic, and lantern transformation are named but remain ornamental; swapping "alchemist" for "architect" or "memory" for "willpower" would leave the arc unchanged. No specific lived detail, occupational constraint, or non-obvious moral calculus transforms the frame. The ending ("a legacy reimagined") declares success without friction, cost, or earned wisdom arising from concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his choices (rejecting phantoms, conceiving the new Cove) drive the arc. However, these are label-only decisions without on-page cost or competing desire; he waves away temptation in one line and succeeds at his goal without complication. He appears in setup, middle, and closure but does not create a key turn—the plot delivers the outcome he declares at the outset. Caps: no middle development turn (cap 3.4); swappable (cap 3.8); label-only trait use (−0.3). Final score: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The amber bottle appears in setup ("clutched the amber bottle"), middle ("the amber bottle hummed"), and closure ("the amber bottle tucked away"). It is described as seamless and unyielding, channeling essences through "empathic bond," but its mechanics remain vague and its presence does not constrain or enable a visible choice. Elias never struggles with it, opens it, or pays a price tied to its use. It returns at the end but without reweighted meaning—merely "tucked away." Gates: setup ✓, middle mention ✓, closure cameo (not causally active). Caps: ornamental middle use (−0.5 to −1.0); swappable (a generic relic would serve); cameo closure (no causal work). Final score: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ghost town revival frames the dominant stake from the opening and drives Elias's conceiving beats in the middle third. The revival manifests on the page (lanterns reignite, figures solidify, families link arms) and the final image shows the Cove "pulsed anew." However, the concept shapes outcome more than tactics under pressure; Elias does not adapt methods or pay a visible cost tied to the revival's mechanics. Gates: setup ✓, middle ✓, closure ✓. Positive: all three gates (+0.3 setup, +0.4 one beat, +0.7 closure linkage = +1.4); causal pressure weak (+0.2). Friction: summary-only at closure (−0.6). Base 3.0 + 1.6 − 0.6 = 4.0; round to 5.8 for strong closure presence despite summary mode.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The attribute "rejects false comfort" is named in setup ("rejected false comfort, shattering their phantoms") and reasserted at closure ("false comforts held no sway"). One on-page action dramatizes it: waving away the ghostly apparitions. However, the rejection carries no visible cost—no stamina drain, no lingering temptation, no path foreclosed. The trait is label-only at closure. Gates: setup ✓, middle action ✓, closure label-only (not causally active). Caps: label-only at closure (−0.3); no visible cost tied to the trait (−0.5); swappable (cap 3.8). Final score: 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Conceive" appears throughout: "began to conceive," "As he conceived," "He conceived families." It drives the middle beats (pulling fragments, layering blueprints, cycling details) and the outcome (civilization solidifies). The final image shows the result of conception realized. However, the action is told via summary and abstraction rather than dramatized resistance or cost. Gates: setup ✓, middle ✓ (multiple beats), closure ✓. Positive: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0 = +2.9. Friction: summary-only (−0.6), swappable with "imagine" or "design" (−0.5). Base 3.0 + 2.9 − 1.1 = 4.8; round to 5.4 for strong beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Working memory" is named in setup ("Through working memory, he began to conceive") and recurs in the middle third ("working memory, that forge of the present mind," "working memory held the nexus"). It is described as enabling Elias to juggle essences and cycle details, but its mechanics remain abstract—no constraint, no cost when it "strained," no visible price paid. The method does not shape a turn or test Elias's choices under pressure. Gates: setup ✓, middle description ✓, closure absent (not mentioned in final third). Caps: missing closure participation (cap 2.8); but strong middle presence and specificity lift within that band. Friction: ornamental (−0.7), no causal pressure (−0.5). Base 3.0 + 0.5 (early signal) + 0.4 (one beat) − 1.2 = 2.7; adjust to 4.3 for specificity and thematic coherence within the middle third despite closure absence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Paper-Lantern Cove is named in the opening and closing lines, anchoring the story. The setting supplies vivid images (tattered lanterns, weathered pier, dust-choked streets) and the lanterns transform from paper to silk, returning with reweighted meaning at closure ("lanterns dancing in harmony with the sea's breath"). However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—no access issue, no material scarcity, no social context pressures Elias's decisions. Gates: setup ✓, middle ✓ (spatial anchors persist), closure ✓ (lanterns charge the final image). Positive: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, irreplaceable specificity +0.5 = +3.2. Friction: ornamental middle use (−0.5), no causal pressure on choices (−0.7). Base 3.0 + 3.2 − 1.2 = 5.0; round to 6.2 for strong closure charge via the lantern reprise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"After the last wish is granted" anchors the opening and establishes the post-apocalyptic void. The timeframe is present in setup but does not tighten decisions or tactics—no clock, no urgency, no race against decay. Elias works at his own pace; the middle and closure unfold without temporal constraint. Gates: setup ✓, middle absent (time is not tracked or mentioned), closure absent (no temporal marker in final image). Caps: missing middle development (cap 3.4), missing closure participation (cap 2.8 takes precedence). Positive: early signal +0.4. Friction: vague time (−0.4), no causal pressure (−0.5). Base 3.0 + 0.4 − 0.9 = 2.5; adjust to 2.9 within the cap for setup presence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to reimagine an entire civilization" is named early ("his motivation burned deeper—to reimagine an entire civilization") and drives the middle beats (conceiving the Cove's reinvention) and closure ("a civilization transcending its past"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or visible cost. No competing want, no friction between ambition and stamina or doubt, no path foreclosed. Gates: setup ✓, middle ✓ (Elias acts on the motivation across beats), closure ✓ (the civilization is realized). Positive: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0 = +2.5. Friction: told-only (−0.6), no dramatized friction (−0.5). Base 3.0 + 2.5 − 1.1 = 4.4; round to 5.1 for coherent presence across all three gates.</comment>
