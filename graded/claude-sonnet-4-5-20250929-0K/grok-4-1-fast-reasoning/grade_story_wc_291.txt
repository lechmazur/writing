<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's face blindness and motivation are asserted but never constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. The pivotal blood-daubing feels unmotivated—no prior dramatized struggle between empathy and detachment that this act resolves. The "dormant empathy blooms eternal" arc is told through exposition and therapeutic label-speak ("empathy bloomed eternal," "dormant hearts stirring") rather than embodied contradiction. Secondary figures (Mira's sister, Lance) are placeholder names with no pressure applied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Elara is, what she's doing at the quarry, and why she's there emerge gradually across the first ~150 words without deliberate disorientation serving closure (−0.4). The closure—Elara's blood ritual yielding a vision of Lance—arrives via sudden omniscient insight ("Mira's final dance: not fleeing opposites, but entwined with one killer...") unsupported by prior causal links on the page. The ribbon fragment and vision do not narrow options through protagonist agency; the solution is granted rather than earned. The drive lens wobbles between Causal (investigation) and Accumulative (lyric mood-building) without teaching a coherent pattern or paying off under either.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The quarry setting is vivid and specific ("mist veiled," "jagged rocks," "flooded basin"), and the ribbon fragment constrains the final beat by supplying the key evidence. Sensory detail ("Cold seeping into her bones," "velvet drinking her essence") anchors the atmosphere. The micro-setting (quarry floor grid, moss-buried ribbon) charges the ending sequence when the ribbon is matched to Lance's attic trophy, lifting the score into mid-6s despite some postcard phrasing ("furrowed hush," "mist coiling").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—solving Mira's disappearance—is signaled early, but pressure remains static. Elara's methodical search yields the ribbon with no visible cost or tactical trade-off; the blood ritual is a leap without prior escalation. The resolution (vision → sketch → confession) is granted off-page rather than forced by protagonist agency under pressure. No meaningful tightening narrows options; the case solves itself once Elara performs the symbolic act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The "unifying opposites" motif is stated repeatedly ("shadow and gleam," "peacock revelry masking owl's malice," "opposites no longer foes, but whole") without emerging from concrete choices or images. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "Opposites no longer foes, but whole. Elara turned from the pit, mist parting. Another case waited, empathy her lance" (−0.6 for overt theme summary). Empathy as theme is asserted, not dramatized through embodied contradiction or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara. Perceptual signature is present ("Face blind since birth, she painted portraits... from subtle dance of postures"), but diction drifts into elevated literary register ("dormant empathy uncoiling like mist burned by dawn") that feels imported rather than character-rooted. The vision sequence ("Mira's final dance: not fleeing opposites...") leaps to omniscient certainty without grounding in Elara's perceptual limits. Dialogue is absent; internal voice carries some specificity but inconsistently.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and prompt-word scaffolding pervade the text: "furrowed," "dormant," "lance/lancet," and "opposites" recur mechanically without tightening meaning. Template cadence: "She logged each step... she knelt... she pocketed... she paced" across adjacent beats (−0.5). Mixed metaphor: "empathy uncoiling like mist burned by dawn" (mist doesn't uncoil; dawn doesn't burn mist away in that manner). Stock phrasing: "mysteries yielded," "light unified all," "portraitist unbound" (−0.6 cumulative). The final third contains heavy artifact load, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—face-blind detective solves cold case via symbolic blood ritual—reads as a prompt assembly without transformation. The blood-on-ribbon magic solves the mystery by fiat rather than through specific lived detail or character-driven ingenuity. "Unifying opposites" is a generic thematic frame applied externally. The ending recycles familiar beats (divers recover body, suspect confesses, detective walks into dawn) without a non-obvious synthesis or earned risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Face blindness is mentioned early and frames Elara's portrait method, but it does not constrain an on-page choice with cost. Her investigation tactics (grid search, ribbon recovery, blood ritual) would function identically without this trait. The trait is ornamental setup without middle or closure integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ribbon fragment appears in three beats: discovery in moss, blood-daubing ritual, and final match to Lance's trophy. It constrains the middle choice (enabling the vision) and participates in closure by supplying the key evidence. Swappability is low; the specific dual-thread velvet matters to the "opposites" motif. Strong causal role lifts it past 5.0, but the closure linkage is functional rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Cold cases frame the premise and Elara's occupation, and the evidence-vanishing complication is signaled early. However, "cold case" functions as background rather than live stake; the investigation tactics and closure do not differ materially from a fresh case. The concept is present and functional but replaceable with "unsolved mystery" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Very methodical" is illustrated early (grid pattern, notebook logging, "three paces north, pivot, count pebbles") but does not constrain a later choice or create visible cost. Elara abandons method mid-story ("methodical no more, but driven") without consequence. The trait is setup-only and swappable with "careful" or "thorough."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Lance" appears as action (blood-pricking with the lancet, pick-wound as murder weapon) and as the killer's name. The lancet enables the blood ritual, shaping one key turn. However, the ritual could be performed with any sharp tool; the lancet is not irreplaceable. The pick-wound is summarized ("pick-wound lanced open by time") rather than dramatized. Two-gate presence (middle, closure mention) but low specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Unifying opposites" is stated as method in the blood-daubing beat ("by unifying opposites. Her blood... with the ribbon's cold relic") and recurs as theme. The mechanics are asserted ("blood welled... daubed it onto the ribbon... empathy uncoiling") without prior setup or tactical cost. The method is ornamental framing rather than a constraint that shapes attempts or alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The quarry supplies the ribbon fragment, the flooded basin for body recovery, and atmospheric pressure throughout. The mist and jagged rocks anchor sensory detail and constrain movement. The setting participates in closure by housing the physical evidence and final recovery. Micro-setting (moss, slick stone) alters tactics (careful search grid). Essential across beats but not wholly indispensable—an alternate remote location could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the evidence disappears" is signaled in the setup and motivates family urgency, but it does not tighten on-page tactics or create a live clock. Elara's search proceeds without time pressure; the investigation could occur at any point post-theft. Functional setup without middle or closure integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"To awaken dormant empathy" is stated repeatedly as motivation ("Her motivation burned quiet... empathy a dormant seed") but never dramatized through conflicted choice or visible cost. The blood ritual ostensibly awakens empathy, but the internal shift is told ("empathy flooded Elara") rather than shown through embodied contradiction or tactical friction. Label-only presence without on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" recurs as a tonal anchor ("furrowed hush settling," "the hush furrowed deeper," "In furrowed hush, mysteries yielded") and modulates with pressure, quieting at closure ("The quarry hushed once more, shadows softer"). The tone is consistent and charges the final image with stillness after revelation. However, "furrowed" is overused mechanically (six instances) and the phrase reads as imported diction rather than organic to Elara's voice, limiting integration.</comment>
