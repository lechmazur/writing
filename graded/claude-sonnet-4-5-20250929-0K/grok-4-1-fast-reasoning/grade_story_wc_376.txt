<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's trait (wilting near lies) is embodied clearly and her quest for lost conversations motivates the arc. Internal progression from "chasing phantoms" to inscribing truth feels earned by vault discovery. However, the mentor's confession arrives conveniently via vault-leaf rather than through Elara's on-page choice under pressure, softening agency at the climax. Emotional arc reads earnest but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—gilded leaves, zinc fragments, and candor accumulate pressure toward the vault revelation and final inscribed insight. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara shifts from chasing phantoms to inscribing present truths, visible cost in letting go of mentor blame. The vault reveal lands on-page with conceptual cost (mentor's lie versus archive's candor), satisfying closure requirements. Minor orientation debt in early greenhouse navigation (vines, underlevels, conduit) resolved by map convergence at vault, so waiver applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse panes, toxic sky, weeping vines, and zinc fragments constrain Elara's path and charge the final image. The map's "Vault of Echoed Candor" label guides descent, and iridescent leaves in the vault enable mentor-voice replay—micro-setting as plot enabler. Sensory detail (hissing vapor lamp, fogged panes, verdigris glow) filters through Elara's calligrapher eye with purposeful selectivity. Spatial choreography remains coherent across atelier, bazaars, underlevels, and vault.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding where lost conversations go. Map reassembly and vault descent provide one meaningful tightening that narrows options. Wilting near dishonesty creates immediate physical cost in bazaar and farm beats, forcing reliance on small truths. Final realization ("conversations lost are those unspoken true") reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Escalation is textural/accumulative (density of candor moments builds pressure), though no major protagonist decision forces the vault revelation—Elara discovers rather than chooses at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—truth's endurance versus lies' dissolution—emerges through gilded leaves' behavior, vault archive, and Elara's final inscription without overt moralizing. The ending line "Conversations lost are those unspoken true" reconfigures the quest via earned insight from mentor's vault-voice. Candor motif recurs purposefully: leaves perk near honest map, wilt near vendor/clerk lies, charge final scene. Minor slip: "small truths rooted eternally" in vault paragraph edges toward thematic echo, but the final inscription reweights it concretely.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction ("gilded-leaf calligrapher," "toxic pall," "quill's nib") sustains a lyric register consistent with Elara's artisan perspective. Purposeful compression in vault discovery and mentor-voice replay fits accumulative pacing. Dialogue (vendor's child, fellow worker) carries subtext and advances plot without filter-verb stacks. Minor register drift: "Candor in small moments, she mused" reads slightly expository mid-crisis, though brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; figurative language ("colossal crystal lung," "Braille confessions," "verity's veins") serves atmosphere without overwhelming. Some scaffold remains: "By piecing together the shredded treasure map, she would reread its secrets" repeats the map-reading beat unnecessarily; "reread the reassembled map thrice" loops the action. Template cadence in middle third ("She wilted there…But a small moment unfolded…Again she faltered") uses parallel structure without taught pattern payoff. Information density is high in vault beats, lower in bazaar transit. No critical opacity at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Core synthesis—truth-detecting art plus lost-conversation archive—feels purposeful rather than checklist. Zinc postal fragments and verdigris leaves offer specific world logic. Emotional arc (mentor's silence → vault candor → inscribed wisdom) avoids template resolution. However, the vault discovery relies on map assembly rather than a non-obvious moral calculus or risky choice, trending mid-band. Gilded-leaf behavior as lie detector is fresh but not deeply transformed; resolution reaffirms rather than complicates the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara clears workbench to assemble map (setup beat), navigates underlevels using map (middle beats), and inscribes new map at closure (payoff). Her choice to share the vault secret in bazaar alters city atmosphere ("one honest breath at a time"). All three gates present; causal pressure in two beats (assembly, sharing); closure linkage strong. Swappability moderate—another truth-seeker could fit with edits. Cost visible in renouncing phantom chase.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Zinc fragment introduced early (under floorboard), reassembled mid-story with tactile detail ("fingers tracing zinc ridges like Braille"), marks vault location precisely, and rests beside fresh works at closure—reweighted as spiritual wholeness. Beats: discovery, assembly under lamp, vault hatch confirmation, final rest. Causal pressure: map mechanics enable descent. Irreplaceability high (zinc's durability, postal-route specificity). Cost tied to journey it unlocks. Minor: could be another durable material with slight edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Candor shapes vendor/clerk beats (child's truth eases wilt, worker's plain speech straightens spine) and vault's function (archive of unvarnished exchanges). Closure inscription ("Conversations lost are those unspoken true") reprices candor as presence versus phantom. Setup via leaves' behavior; middle constrains tactics (Elara's wilting forces reliance on small truths); payoff in final breath metaphor. Swappability moderate—another virtue could fit structure. Cost visible but not unique to candor's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Wilting trait introduced early (leaves curl near lies), dramatized twice mid-story (vendor scene: "skin paling, breath shallow"; clerk scene: "knees buckling"), and implied at closure (leaves "gleamed, un-wilting"). Constrains Elara's movement and forces reliance on truthful moments. Cost on-page (physical debilitation). Gates: setup, two middle beats, closure participation. Specificity high (embodied lie-detection). Minor: attribute stated more than enacted in final third.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Reread action: assembles map ("reread its secrets"), mouths directions thrice, confirms path at vault ("reread the map one final time"), and thematic echo ("lost conversations because yours wilted in my silence"). Beats: assembly, descent decision, vault confirmation. Middle beat (descent) turns on rereading directions. Closure link present but thematic rather than mechanical. Swappability moderate—another interpretive action (decipher, trace) could substitute. Cost indirect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Method signaled early (fragments under floorboard), mechanics matter (edge-matching under lamp, "calligrapher's eye seized on precision"), and outcome (vault location) depends on assembly. Beats: discovery, assembly, vault entry. Causal pressure: no assembly, no vault. Closure: new map inscribed, echoing method. Swappability low for treasure-map mechanics, moderate for shredded-assembly gimmick. Cost visible in hours spent, though not unique to this method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse city introduced in opening line, toxic sky pressures need for candor ("vitality against the toxic pall"), panes filter light guiding descent, underlevels house vault. Beats: atelier setup, bazaar/farm navigation, weeping-vines threshold, vault discovery, final citywide breath. Micro-setting (condensate junctions, moss-hatch) alters tactics. Closure: city "breathed a fraction easier"—setting reconfigured by Elara's sharing. Irreplaceability high (greenhouse-as-lung metaphor, verdigris leaves tied to decay aesthetic). Cost conceptual (unchanged toxic sky).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Timeframe stated in opening ("five years prior") and reprised at vault ("years past"). Middle beats track "hours blurred" during assembly but no live clock tightens decisions. Closure mentions time obliquely ("no longer chasing phantoms"). Setup present; middle development weak (time as backdrop, not constraint); payoff minimal. Swappability high—another post-disaster marker could fit. No visible cost tied to five-year duration versus any other span.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation stated early ("sought the fate of lost conversations"), drives map assembly and vault descent, and reframes at closure ("Conversations lost are those unspoken true"). Beats: atelier reflection, descent choice, vault discovery, final inscription. Friction visible in wilting (want to chase versus cost of dishonesty exposure). Closure reprices desire (from chasing phantoms to inscribing present truths). Swappability moderate—another archival quest could substitute. Cost felt but shared with other elements.</comment>
