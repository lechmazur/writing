<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (discovering why paths disappear) is clear and drives her investigation, but her interior life relies heavily on poetic declaration rather than embodied contradiction. The "cheerful gloom" mood is asserted repeatedly but rarely emerges from concrete micro-choices under pressure. The final acceptance ("paths vanish to make room for wilder flights") arrives as epiphany without prior dramatized resistance or visible cost that forecloses an alternative. Her sea-foam recollectionist role remains ornamental—label-rich but without occupational constraints shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when early (Elara in the geode cave, investigating memory paths), satisfying orientation. Causality is present but thin: the bird arrives, drops seeds into the crater glass, emotions script themselves, and Elara concludes—each step follows but without narrowing options or raising cost. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing (paths as seeds requiring fertile soil) that reframes the premise, but the final image ("tucked a seed into her palm, ready to scatter") asserts future action rather than landing a felt present cost. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens the piece builds atmosphere and recurrent motifs, yet the ending reweights meaning primarily through telling ("she had uncovered the why") instead of a charged image that demonstrates cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The iridescent geode is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (facets pulsing like frozen fireworks, twilight hues) and the crater glass functions as a recurring object across multiple beats. However, the cave remains atmospheric rather than constraining—Elara paces and kneels but spatial choices do not alter tactics or outcomes. The seeds land in the glass cracks and the environment approves ("walls refracting her newfound peace"), but these details support mood more than they pressure decisions, keeping the setting in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (why paths disappear) is signaled early and maintained, and the bird's arrival introduces a reversal that shifts Elara's approach from solo conjecture to seed-pattern reading. Yet the escalation is gentle: no option is foreclosed, no visible price paid—she simply gains an answer. The "before memory fades" timeframe is invoked but never tightens decisions on the page. Under the Accumulative lens the piece deepens understanding, but lacks a moment where agency forecloses a live path with on-page cost, capping the score below strong execution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme (paths as ephemeral seeds, acceptance of loss for growth) emerges from the crater glass motif and the bird's scatter rather than overt statement, and the final image of Elara pocketing a seed offers a non-literal answer. The "missing pieces" recur purposefully and the resolution reweights prior material (her lost fork becomes understandable). However, phrases like "joyful surrender" and "wholeness bloomed from missing pieces" edge toward thematic summary, and the insight arrives without visible struggle or ambiguity, weakening resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistent—lyric, image-dense, with a fanciful register ("merry dirge," "whimsical delight tinged with sorrow")—and the oxymoronic "cheerful gloom" idiom is sustained. However, the prose relies on decorative phrasing ("sea-foam aura," "laughter's hearth, solitude's song") that crowds perception without deepening interiority. Filter verbs and label-heavy constructions ("her motivation burned bright yet bittersweet") appear in peak beats, dulling immediacy. The voice is distinct but tilts toward ornament over embodied thought, and the final paragraph's summary narration ("She had uncovered the why") loses urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically varied and sensory-rich, but multiple frictions accumulate. Paraphrase loops recur ("missing pieces" appears six times; "cheerful gloom" and its synonyms repeat in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure). Template cadence appears in the middle third ("One seed…Another cluster…She pieced it together"). Figurative language stacks densely in high-pressure beats ("sea-foam fingers tracing," "waves clapping in joy over submerged wrecks") without pattern-teaching, occasionally obscuring action. Stock metaphors ("frozen fireworks," "footprints in receding tides") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("acceptance's silver sigh") flatten peak moments. These artifacts touch closure beats, triggering the lower end of the artifact penalty range and disqualifying 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The sea-foam recollectionist in a geode cave offers a fresh fantastical frame, and the crater glass that transliterates emotions is inventively specific. The bird-as-messenger and seeds-in-glass mechanics introduce a non-obvious synthesis. However, the core emotional arc (solitary seeker finds revelation via external sign, accepts loss) follows a familiar template, and the "paths as seeds" metaphor, while prettily executed, resolves into a tidy consolation without deeper ambiguity or risk. Transformation is present but surfaces remain polished and safe.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her goal (discover why paths disappear) frames the story. She paces, traces seeds, and reaches a conclusion—three beats. However, her choices do not narrow options or impose cost; she observes the seeds' arrangement and infers meaning without renunciation or trade-off. The ending shows her ready to scatter new paths, but this future intent is declared, not dramatized with present consequence. Setup and development are clear; closure participation is weak because her final "choice" (pocketing a seed) is aspirational rather than causally active in the ending image. Gates: setup ✓, middle ✓, closure marginal. Causal pressure minimal, closure linkage weak. Base ~5.0, −0.3 late closure participation, −0.5 swappability (another seeker archetype could perform the same moves).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crater glass appears early ("most prized object"), recurs in the middle third (dim on a ledge, riddled with gaps), and participates in the climax (seeds nestle into fissures, emotions script anew, glass flares brilliant). Three distinct beats with evolving state. Setup ✓, development ✓, closure ✓. Causal pressure moderate: the glass enables the transliteration that leads to Elara's insight. Specificity high: its emotion-script property and its cracks matter. However, the glass is more receptacle than active constraint—it does not narrow options or force a trade-off. Base ~6.5 (all gates, two beats, closure linkage), +0.3 specificity, no strong causal pressure to push higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Missing pieces" is named early (gaps in the crater glass), recurs in the middle (paths with gaps, absent stars), and resolves at closure ("wholeness bloomed from missing pieces"). Setup ✓, development ✓, closure ✓. The concept shapes the central question and the final realization. However, it functions primarily as thematic motif rather than a constraint that alters tactics on the page—Elara does not wrestle with a specific missing piece that forces a choice. Base ~5.5 (all gates, thematic presence), +0.2 closure linkage as reconfiguration anchor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The attribute (crater glass transliterates emotions) is explained early, demonstrated when seeds trigger emotion-script ("choice" in verdant ink, "untaken" fading), and referenced at closure (emotions transcribed: relief, acceptance). Setup ✓, development ✓, closure ✓. Three beats. However, the transliteration is passive display, not a constraint or enabler that costs Elara something—she reads the script without trade-off. The trait is specific and central to the method, but does not force a decision. Base ~5.0 (all gates, specificity), −0.4 no visible cost tied to the trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Conjecture" is named as "her truest action" early, appears again when she reads seed patterns ("she would conjecture the truth"), and is dismissed at closure ("No more conjecture needed"). Setup ✓, development ✓, closure ✓. The action frames her investigative method across the arc. However, the conjecture itself is not dramatized with competing hypotheses or cost—it is a label for thought rather than a visible decision process. The bird's arrival makes conjecture obsolete, so the action is replaced rather than proven or paid for. Base ~5.5 (all gates, modest causal role), −0.2 summary-only in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method (scattered seeds from a migrating bird) is foreshadowed by the timeframe's urgency, enacted in the middle third (bird wheels in, drops seeds), and declared as the solution mechanism ("Via the scattered seeds…she would conjecture the truth"). The seeds' arrangement in the glass cracks scripts emotions and leads to Elara's revelation. Setup marginal (no early signal of a bird), development ✓, closure ✓. Two clear gates. Causal pressure moderate: the method enables the climax but arrives as coincidence rather than Elara's tactic. Base ~6.0 (two gates, causal role), +0.4 closure linkage as the pivot mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The iridescent geode cave is established early with vivid sensory detail, Elara paces its luminous floor, and the ending shows the cave's walls refracting her peace. Setup ✓, development ✓, closure ✓. Three beats. However, the cave provides atmosphere and backdrop without constraining choices—Elara could conduct the same investigation in any enclosed space. Spatial properties (quartz ledge, crystalline floor) are mentioned but do not alter tactics. Base ~5.0 (all gates, atmospheric presence), +0.1 modest closure participation as mood reinforcement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Before memory fades" is introduced early as urgency driver, repeated twice in the middle ("before memory fades entirely," "Before memory fades, she had uncovered"), and echoed at closure ("before all memories gently ebbed away"). Setup ✓, development ✓, closure ✓. Three beats, strong recurrence. However, the timeframe is invoked but never tightens decisions—no on-page moment shows Elara racing a clock or making a choice because time is short. The phrase functions as mood rather than constraint. Base ~5.0 (all gates, recurrence), −0.3 ornamental use, −0.4 no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The motivation (to discover why paths disappear) is stated early, drives Elara's investigation throughout, and is satisfied at closure ("she had uncovered the why"). Setup ✓, development ✓, closure ✓. Three beats with clear causal linkage. However, the desire is declared more than dramatized with conflicting impulses or visible friction—Elara never considers abandoning the search or faces a cost for pursuing it. The motivation frames the plot but is not tested by competing wants. Base ~6.0 (all gates, causal spine), −0.2 told more than shown under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Cheerful gloom" is named early ("cheerful gloom that mirrored her eternal task"), recurs in the middle ("cheerful gloom enveloping her"), and appears in the ending ("rainbows of cheerful gloom"). Setup ✓, development ✓, closure ✓. Three beats. The oxymoronic tone is consistent and distinctive, modulating slightly (melancholy cheer, whimsical delight tinged with sorrow). However, the tone is asserted via label rather than emerging from scene pressure, and it remains static across emotional turns—the final "cheerful gloom" is indistinguishable from the opening mood. Base ~5.5 (all gates, coherence), −0.1 label-reliance without pressure modulation.</comment>
