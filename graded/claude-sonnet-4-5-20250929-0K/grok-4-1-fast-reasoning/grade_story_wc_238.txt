<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to apologize is clear and drives the visit, but her interiority drowns in ornamental metaphor rather than embodied contradiction. The guilt is asserted ("clawing at her ribs like a poltergeist") but never shown complicating a live choice on the page. Theo materializes as a passive receiver; his forgiveness arrives without friction, undercutting the earned-cost requirement for closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is present—Elara delivers the apology and receives forgiveness—but the cost is atmospheric rather than felt: "his melody forever altered, trees falling" gestures at consequence without showing what path she forecloses. The drive lens reads Accumulative (perfume → currents → manifestation → forgiveness), yet the causal chain relies on convenience: the bottle happens to induce currents that summon Theo with no prior setup of failure or resistance. Orientation anchors (archive, dusk, orchard beyond) arrive early and hold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The archive is vividly rendered—"yellowed scores," "slivers of dusk," "copper veins exposed by rot"—and the orchard hush frames urgency. However, setting remains largely descriptive; the player piano hums and sparks but doesn't constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics. The perfume bottle's interaction with the archive's "dry paper fueling blue-white veins" charges the final image modestly, lifting the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (deliver apology before the trees are cut) is signaled early, but escalation is thin: Elara simply uncorks the bottle, Theo appears, she speaks, he forgives. No reversal or tightening choice narrows her options; the "imperfect miracle" flickers bulbs and scorches paper without imposing a trade-off or visible price that alters her stance. The orchard deadline never pressures her actions on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—guilt, redemption, imperfect grace—emerges through the apology and scorched-paper imagery, but the final image ("apology delivered in imperfect miracle's haze") is stated rather than embodied in a resonant non-literal answer. The perfume/currents/orchard motifs recur but remain symbolic conveniences rather than particulars that charge the closure. Elara's plan to "metaphor it all" in her next column undercuts thematic subtlety with meta-commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyric-inflected ("gossip-column exorcist," "ethereal grit," "rivers carving stone"), but the dense figurative register flattens under pressure: every beat receives metaphorical dressing ("fog to the orchard's roots," "blight in your score") that obscures rather than sharpens character perception. Dialogue feels performative—"Forgive the girl who pruned your branches for headlines"—rather than goal-driven. POV is stable, but the prose reads more like narrated performance than lived interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prose is dense with figurative language in nearly every line—"dust motes danced in slivers of dusk like lost souls," "currents bridging their palms in a jolt that tasted of ozone and overripe fruit"—creating a template cadence that dulls momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "imperfect miracles crackled" / "imperfect miracle's haze" / "miracles are like these sheets—stained, torn, yet singing." Filter-verb stacks ("murmured it held," "advised through metaphors") and elevated diction ("ethereal tendrils coiling") drift from the POV's tabloid-column grounding. No loops touch closure directly, but the accumulation across high-pressure beats triggers the artifact penalty and disallows 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The gossip-columnist-as-exorcist premise offers a fresh angle, and the perfume-as-spiritual-conductor is a specific detail. However, the apology-to-a-ghost arc follows a familiar template (guilt → supernatural encounter → forgiveness granted), and the "imperfect miracles" concept remains an asserted metaphor rather than a transformed world rule with stakes. The orchard countdown and induced-currents mechanics hint at ingenuity but are not developed into causal pressure, leaving the piece in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's decision to visit the archive and uncork the bottle advances the plot, but her choices after that point are passive: she kneels, speaks, and receives forgiveness without tactical shifts or trade-offs. Present across three beats (arrival, uncorking, apology) but replaceable—any remorseful protagonist could perform the same moves. Late-stage contribution to closure lifts it above ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The perfume bottle appears in setup (gift from youth, half-buried), mid-scene action (uncorking releases vaporous essence), and closure participation (shatters to powder). Its "currents to carry scents across chasms" property enables the summoning, and the final shattering marks cost. However, the mechanics are convenient rather than constrained—no prior failure or limitation shapes Elara's use. Three beats and closure linkage push it into the 6s; lack of causal friction caps it below 7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Imperfect miracles" is named repeatedly ("imperfect miracles crackled," "imperfect miracle's haze," "miracles are like these sheets") but functions as thematic label rather than stake-shaping concept. The flickering bulbs and scorched paper illustrate imperfection, yet no choice hinges on the miracle's flaws—Elara doesn't weigh risk, manage instability, or pay a price for the magic's imperfection. Present in setup metaphor and closure summary; swappable with "flawed magic" or "unstable ritual."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Elara "advised through metaphors always" is stated in exposition and demonstrated once in the apology speech ("fog to the orchard's roots," "blight in your score"), but the trait doesn't constrain her choices or create friction. Theo echoes the metaphor back, but it's a stylistic flourish rather than a tactic with cost. Label-only setup, one ornamental beat, no closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Reconnect" drives the entire arc: Elara seeks Theo, summons him, delivers the apology, and achieves reconnection ("echoes" bridged, "Apology's perfume lingers"). The action is specific and irreplaceable—removing it collapses the story. However, reconnection arrives without meaningful resistance; Theo grants forgiveness in a single exchange, reducing the action's causal weight. Setup through closure, two major beats (summoning, apology), but low friction caps it in the upper 6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Induced currents" is introduced mid-scene when the perfume's "charged essence sought paths of least resistance" and sparks leap from bottle to piano. The method enables the summoning and appears in the closure beat ("final current surge"). However, it's never seeded in setup—no prior mention of conductivity or electrical logic—and functions as a convenient mechanism rather than a constrained process. Two beats (summoning, dissipation), late signal, swappable with "ethereal energy" or "spiritual resonance."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sheet music archive supplies vivid anchoring ("yellowed scores," "brittle pages," "player piano… copper veins exposed by rot") and the dry paper fuels the ghostly electricity in the summoning beat. The archive's stale air and crumbling wing match the ethereal-grit tone. However, the setting doesn't constrain Elara's choices—she could perform the ritual anywhere with the bottle. Setup through closure, one functional beat (currents through paper/piano), tone integration, but no tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The orchard deadline is named in setup ("hush before the orchard's trees were cut down tomorrow hung heavy"), returns at closure ("orchard wind moaned outside, hush fracturing as engines growled awake"), and frames urgency. However, it never tightens Elara's tactics on the page—she doesn't rush, skip steps, or face a ticking-clock choice. The engines growl as Theo dissipates, but the timing is coincidental rather than causal. Lyric bracket without mid-scene pressure; charged reprise reaches low 5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The apology motivation is seeded early ("overdue apology clawing at her ribs"), drives the archive visit and perfume use, and culminates in the spoken apology beat where cost is named ("dooming his career… vanished into obscurity"). The guilt is consistent and shapes the protagonist's goal across all three phases (setup, summoning, closure). However, the motivation is more stated than dramatized—no on-page friction between competing wants or visible hesitation. Three beats, closure participation, visible cost in backstory, but low dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" is embodied throughout: "dust motes… like lost souls," "vaporous sigh… gritty with time's corrosion," "scorched paper and spent ether," "grit-glazed grace before the cut." The tone coheres across setup, summoning, and closure without static repetition—density increases as the miracle crackles and chars. The final image ("archive reeking of scorched paper") charges the tone with tactile cost. Setup through closure, modulates with pressure, charges final image; lifts into upper 6s despite high figurative density.</comment>
