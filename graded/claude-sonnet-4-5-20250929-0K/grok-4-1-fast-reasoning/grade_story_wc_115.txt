<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Jax's motivation is present and rooted (mechanic who caused thirteen deaths), but the final choice—turning the wheel—arrives through psychic-radio revelation rather than dramatic pressure forcing a hierarchy of values. The callback to "swallowed truth" and brother's death earns the weight, yet the confession mechanism (he realizes he'd dialed in anonymously) reads convenient rather than agonized. Interiority often tells ("Years ago, young and desperate") instead of showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Embodied emotion appears sporadically (pulse quickens, muscles straining) but is diluted by abstract phrases like "psychic residue" and "feather-light revelation."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by line four (tunnel beneath mill, explorer, night). The closure unit—Jax turning the wheel and releasing remorse—is on the page, but causality wobbles: the radio confession being his own anonymous call, compelled by the wheel's touch, is a retroactive patch that undermines earned escalation. The "drowsy haze" mechanism and "psychic residue" toggle between causal and metaphorical without teaching the reader which lens to hold. One meaningful turn (radio confession → wheel turn) is present, but the cost (beads snapping, truth expelled) is gestured at rather than dramatized with visible consequence that alters later options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tunnel is vividly anchored (damp gloom, corroded valve, silt, mill-dust phantoms) and the beaded wheel constrains Jax's final choice—he must physically turn it, resisting rust, to release the door. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (drips, truck rumble overhead, chilled smoothness of beads). The wheel's recurring presence (spotted, knelt to trace, gripped, turned) charges the final image and the rosaries woven into spokes supply both texture and plot constraint. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout; the tunnel's claustrophobic frame supports the pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early (find the weight of swallowed truth tied to the mill collapse). The radio-confession sequence tightens pressure once, but the peak turn—Jax realizing he'd dialed in—is more reveal than escalation driven by his agency. The wheel-turning finale forecloses a path (truth expelled, remorse released) yet the cost is abstract ("lighter," "buoyant in release") rather than a visible trade-off. Coincidence (radio callers, psychic show timing) complicates but also resolves, diluting earned escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme (guilt, confession, the weight of truth) emerges from the valve-wheel imagery and embedded rosaries, avoiding overt thesis statements until the final paragraph's "just human echoes demanding reckoning" and "heavier than chains, yet buoyant in release"—which borders on moralizing. The "factory ghost shift" reweights from literal haunting to psychic residue, a conceptual move that partially lands. The beaded fragments in pocket offer a concrete closing image, but the piece tells its insight ("the precise heft of swallowed sin") rather than letting the wheel-turn action resonate non-literally. Subtext operates in the rosaries and the chaplain's vanishing, yet the ending summarizes theme rather than trusting the reader.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Jax; no head-hopping. Diction carries purpose ("reckless abandoned-mill explorer," "beaded valve wheel"), and the perceptual signature (heavy-lidded yet scanning, drowsy alertness) is character-specific. However, register drifts into elevated phrasing under peak stress ("psychic residue," "faith-forged anchor," "buoyant in release") that sits outside a mechanic's plausible lexicon. The radio-confession mechanism is taught midpoint but the retrospective reveal (he'd dialed in) is expositional rather than dramatized through internal voice. Purposeful elision of the dial-in moment is not taught early, arriving as a surprise that reads more authorial than organic to Jax's awareness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence appear: "Drowsy alertness sharpened" echoes "drowsy alertness" three times; "The weight crashed in" / "The weight lifted" toggle without advancing pressure; "beads snapping free like absolution beads" recycles the word "beads" redundantly. Figurative language clusters densely in the closure paragraph ("feather-light revelation," "heavier than chains, yet buoyant," "mill-dust phantoms") without clear vehicle coherence. Stock metaphors ("truth expelled… yet buoyant") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("swallowed truth," "remorse," "absolution") dull immediacy in peak beats. Sentence openings vary, but information density is uneven—some lines do double work (beads as rosaries, valve as confessional) while others summarize ("No ghosts, no gods") what the prior image already conveyed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The combination of mill-tunnel setting, beaded valve as confessional mechanism, and radio-psychic framing offers a fresh angle on industrial-guilt narratives. The specific rosaries-in-valve image is memorable and grounds the metaphor in concrete action. However, the "haunted workplace where the protagonist caused the deaths" template is widely used, and the piece does not fully transform it—Jax's brother and thirteen souls remain abstract, the sabotage motive (embezzlement cover-up) is told in a radio call rather than discovered through ledgers or physical evidence, and the psychic-residue explanation hedges the ghost-shift stakes. The final turn (anonymous confession was his own) is clever but arrives late without prior hints, reading more as authorial twist than earned inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Jax is introduced as a "reckless abandoned-mill explorer" in the opening line and his decision to push deeper, kneel to trace the beads, grip the wheel, and turn it against rust drives the final beat. His agency is present in the wheel-turn closure, though the radio-confession mechanism complicates whether the turn is his choice or compelled revelation. He appears in all three gates (setup, middle investigation, closure turn) and the final action (wheel turn) alters the symbolic and emotional state. Swappability is low—mill explorer fits the setting and stakes. However, the reckless trait is more label than dramatized risk; Jax's choices read methodical rather than impulsive. The cost (truth expelled, lighter) is conceptual rather than a visible trade-off tied to his explorer identity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel is introduced early ("spotted it" ~1/3 in), handled physically in two beats (knelt to trace, gripped and turned), and the rosaries woven into spokes supply both mystery and the confessional metaphor. The wheel's turn is the closure action (beads snapping, door groaning open), and its properties (corroded, massive, embedded beads) constrain Jax's final effort. Irreplaceability is high—removing the wheel and substituting a lever or door handle would strip the rosary/confession linkage. Cost is present (muscles straining, beads snapping as absolution) and the object reweights from valve to symbolic confessional. The wheel does not create the problem it solves (Jax's guilt predates it), capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The factory ghost shift is introduced early (legends, spectral workers at phantom looms) and revisited at closure ("ghost shift manifesting in his mind's eye," "mill-dust phantoms"). However, it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop and thematic echo rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. Jax's goal is confession/truth, not engaging with or disproving ghosts; the shift's reinterpretation as "psychic residue" is conceptual rather than a choice-altering mechanism. The concept does not constrain or enable middle actions—Jax investigates the valve wheel independently of ghost lore. It is present in setup and closure but ornamental in development, trending functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Jax's religious skepticism is stated early ("scoffed at holy water tales") and revisited at closure ("Religiously skeptical no more"). The trait contrasts with the rosary/confession imagery and the piece pivots on his shift from skeptic to believer in psychic residue. However, the trait does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost—Jax never refuses a religious ritual or tool that might help, nor does skepticism prevent him from turning the wheel. The label-only nature and lack of middle-beat friction (he simply proceeds) lower the score. The trait reweights thematically at closure but does not drive a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Appraise" is signaled midpoint ("Jax appraised the wheel's mystery methodically, by interpreting… calls") and the action—listening to radio callers, tracing patterns—shapes the middle turn (recognizing the chaplain's beads, hearing the embezzlement confession). The closure (wheel turn) follows from this appraisal. However, the verb is somewhat generic; "interpret," "analyze," or "decode" could substitute with minor edits. The action is present in setup (eyes scanning shadows), middle (methodical appraisal), and indirectly at closure (appraisal leads to wheel turn). Cost is indirect—appraisal reveals guilt, which compels the turn. Specificity is moderate; appraisal fits the detective/explorer role but does not supply unique mechanical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method (interpreting frantic calls to talk-radio psychics) is introduced midpoint and used in one extended beat to decode the wheel's mystery. The radio provides clues (Father Reilly's beads, embezzlement confession) that enable the final turn. However, the mechanics wobble—Jax's realization that he'd dialed in anonymously is told retroactively rather than dramatized, and the psychic-show format is more atmospheric than mechanically necessary (police records or mill ledgers could serve similarly). The method is present in middle and closure but arrives after the 40% mark and does not shape early tactics, capping the score. Cost is indirect (revelation compels guilt) rather than tied to the act of tuning the radio.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel is introduced in the opening line and maintained as the sole location throughout. The setting constrains Jax's investigation (gravel crunch, silt-buried bulkhead, damp gloom) and the valve wheel is physically embedded in the tunnel structure. The tunnel's claustrophobia and isolation shape the drowsy, pressure-laden tone and the final image (mill-dust phantoms, tunnel air thickening). The setting is irreplaceable—moving the wheel to a factory floor or office would lose the burial/excavation metaphor and the spatial pressure. The tunnel participates in all three gates (setup, middle investigation, closure turn) and charges the final image ("tunnel's hush his eternal companion"). Cost is conceptual (Jax must physically enter and remain in the tunnel) rather than a tactical trade-off, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe ("during the hush that follows a sudden confession") is marked explicitly midpoint and governs the closure sequence (frozen radio void, wheel turn, phantoms manifesting). The hush creates a pressure beat—Jax processes the confession's weight in silence before acting. However, the timeframe does not tighten prior decisions or create a live clock that alters tactics; Jax's solo exploration unfolds at his own pace with no deadline. The hush is present in middle (confession) and closure (wheel turn, backing away) but not setup, and the frame is more atmospheric than mechanically constraining. Cost tied to the hush is felt (the silence mirrors the tunnel's void) but not visible as a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Jax's motivation ("to find the weight of a swallowed truth") is stated early and revisited at closure ("he'd found it, the precise heft of swallowed sin"). The desire drives his solo delve, investigation of the wheel, and the final turn. The motivation is dramatized through physical action (gripping flashlight, kneeling, straining against the wheel) and carries internal friction (guilt vs. skepticism, confession vs. concealment). Cost is visible in the closure image (beads snapping, truth expelled, "lighter" afterward). However, the motivation is somewhat abstract and the friction between want (truth) and fear (exposure) is more told than shown in contradictory micro-choices. The motivation appears in all three gates and shapes the ending, but the dramatization is uneven.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Drowsy alertness is introduced in the opening paragraph ("sleep deprivation lent his steps a drowsy alertness, eyes heavy-lidded yet scanning") and recurs three times ("Drowsy alertness sharpened," "drowsiness veiling fear into focus," "Drowsy alertness peaked into clarity"). The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure, tightening from hazy observation to peak clarity at closure. However, the phrase is repeated mechanically rather than embodied through shifting sentence rhythm or perceptual detail, and the tone does not constrain a choice—Jax proceeds regardless. The tone charges the final image (clarity emerging from haze) but functions more as atmospheric label than a lived constraint on tactics. It is present in setup, middle, and closure, earning lyric-resonance credit, yet the repetition reads ornamental rather than causally active.</comment>
