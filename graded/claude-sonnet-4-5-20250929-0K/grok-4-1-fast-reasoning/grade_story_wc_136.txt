<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. His choices feel dictated by the premise rather than earned through visible internal contradiction—he "knows" it's the night, descends without hesitation, and boards the train with only cosmetic trembling. The final moment claims completion ("his journey a perfect loop of analytical art") but offers no visible cost or foreclosed path; he simply returns richer, unshaken. Interiority relies heavily on stock phrasing ("trembling certainty," "quivering assurance") and the emotional arc resolves into tidy satisfaction without ambiguity or struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal initially (punch enables passage, arrows guide movement) but collapses into Accumulative decoration by the ending, where motifs recur without reweighting stakes or meaning. Orientation is late: who Elias is beyond "route mapper" and what "unspoken truths" concretely mean remain vague past the opening third. The closure unit—"he had found not just secrets, but the map to his own unspoken heart"—is a thematic assertion rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost; the return ticket and "unshaken certainty" erase any price. No meaningful tightening of options occurs; each obstacle (grate, bricks, gates) dissolves on contact without forcing trade-offs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The starlit vault, phantom train, and fortress gates are vividly rendered and constrain Elias's path through access points (spiral stair, bricked archway, colossal gates). Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric—"cracked glass dome admitting pinpricks of starlight," "fog-choked tunnel," "velvet seat that felt like memory." However, spatial choreography is loose: the vault "beneath the old rail yards" becomes a "tunnel" then a "train car" without clear transitions, and the fortress interior is summarized rather than shown. The punch and cracks serve as micro-setting elements that guide choices, lifting the score into mid-6s, but the environment does not charge the final image with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the fortress—is signaled early but never tested by genuine obstacles; every barrier (grate, bricks, gates) vanishes when Elias uses the punch, reducing escalation to a procession. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off; coincidence (the punch always works, arrows always point correctly) drives resolution. The final return ticket erases any cost, and the protagonist's agency is passive—he follows arrows and punches air. Visions of "phantom passengers confessing silenced scandals" are told rather than dramatized, and the "mysteries unraveled" remain abstract. One tightening might be the descent into deeper realms, but without visible price or altered tactics, pressure flatlines.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as "unspoken truths" and self-discovery, but the final paragraph delivers an overt thesis: "he had found not just secrets, but the map to his own unspoken heart." This moralizing replaces earned resonance, landing as a Thematic Echo (−0.6 in final paragraph). The recurring motifs—stars, mist, cracks, tickets—are mentioned frequently but do not constrain choice or reweight meaning; they function as atmospheric decoration. The "hour that divides bad habits and new starts" is asserted rather than dramatized through specific struggle, and the story's resolution into "trembling certainty" and "unshaken" return flattens moral ambiguity. A few particulars (phantom engineer's murmur, spectral train) hint at complexity but dissolve into abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Elias with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated throughout ("analytically artistic masterpieces," "spectral line that once ferried souls") but remains coherent as Elias's internal register. However, sentences share repetitive stems ("He had acquired," "He knew," "He stepped") and the prose voice does not modulate with pressure—crisis and calm moments carry identical ornate texture. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("he knew," "he felt") appear frequently but fit the contemplative tone. The perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; any route mapper might notice these details in this way. Purposeful compression is absent; every beat is spelled out in similar cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is extreme and uniform: "analytically artistic masterpieces," "midnight's regrets fracture into dawn's fragile resolutions," "map to his own unspoken heart." Mixed metaphors appear ("fog made solid," "crack-like filigree," "map to his own unspoken heart"). Template cadence runs across multiple beats: "He had acquired... He knew... He stepped... He swung... He settled." Paraphrase loops are present: "trembling certainty" recurs five times, "analytically artistic" twice, and the final two paragraphs restate the same closure idea. Stock phrases dominate interiority ("trembling certainty," "quivering assurance," "maps richer, certainty unshaken"). These artifacts pervade the closure beat ("perfect loop of analytical art"), triggering elevated penalties (−1.7 total in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per patterned-artifact penalty pack).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—phantom train accessed via ticket punch, cracks forming arrows—offers a fresh synthesis of urban exploration and spectral transit. However, the emotional arc (obsessed seeker finds truth and returns transformed) follows a well-worn template without transformation through specific lived cost or non-obvious moral calculus. Elias's "analytically artistic" trait is asserted but not demonstrated through distinct choices or worldview. The fortress revelation is generic ("halls of whispering stone, walls inscribed with every unspoken truth") rather than particular. Risk is cosmetic: the story ventures stylistic ornamentation but retreats from narrative stakes, delivering a "perfect loop" that avoids irreversible consequence. Within-band adjustment for attempted atmospheric risk (+0.2) is offset by template adherence (−0.5 derivative premise adjustment).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character present throughout; establishes the journey and returns at the end (setup, payoff). Development is weak: Elias observes and follows arrows but does not make constraining choices—each obstacle dissolves when he uses the punch. His mapper role is label-only; no on-page mapping work shapes tactics. Late-element and swappability friction apply: any seeker archetype could follow these arrows. Ornamental use (−0.5) and swappability (−0.6) lower the score; cap at 4.6 for missing middle development further constrains.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The punch appears early (setup), is used three times across beats (grate descent, brick archway, fortress gates; +0.9 beat involvement), and returns in the final "one last ticket" moment (closure linkage +0.7). However, its mechanics are entirely convenient: each use succeeds without cost, and it does not constrain choices or impose visible friction. Swappability friction applies (−0.5): a magic key or spell would serve identically. No causal pressure; it enables rather than complicates. Scores in mid-6s for multi-beat presence and closure touch, but lacks the cost or irreplaceability for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Concept present as framing motivation (setup) and mentioned at closure ("mysteries unraveled into forever"). However, it remains abstract: the "unspoken truths" are summarized ("founders' betrayals, lost loves") rather than dramatized, and Elias's tactics do not change based on solving mysteries—he follows arrows passively. No middle development where unraveling shapes a choice. Ornamental use (−0.7) and summary-only treatment (−0.6) apply. Scores low-4s for thematic presence without causal pressure or on-page puzzle-solving.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Attribute appears as description ("analytically artistic masterpieces," "his analytical eye measured," "artistically, they evoked"). Label-only across all mentions; no visible tradeoff where analytical rigor conflicts with artistic intuition to constrain a choice. Missing middle development and closure participation. Ornamental (−0.8) and label-only (−0.3) frictions apply. Scores low band; swappability cap at 3.8 further limits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dare appears implicitly throughout (descent, brick swing, boarding train) and explicitly at climax ("He dared fully"). Setup present in "dared to follow," development in multiple threshold crossings, payoff in "dared fully" at gates. However, each dare succeeds without cost or hesitation; no visible friction tests commitment. Swappability applies: "venture" or "risk" would function identically. Beat involvement (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.7), but swappability (−0.6) and lack of cost connection (no +0.3) keep it mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cracks appear early (first anomaly at 30° bearing; setup +0.5), guide two beats (grate, then archway; +0.9), and converge at the fortress gates (closure linkage +0.9). Specificity is high: the mechanic of following directional cracks is unique and irreplaceable (+0.6). However, they never constrain or mislead; each arrow points correctly, eliminating causal pressure. Missing cost connection (no visible price for relying on them). Scores mid-6s for multi-beat mechanical role and closure participation, but lacks friction or error that would elevate to 7+.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Vault framed early (setup), supplies the undercroft and train tracks (development via access), and is referenced at closure ("starlit vault above seemed distant"). Sensory detail is vivid and the vault provides spatial structure. However, it does not pressure Elias's choices—mist and starlight are atmospheric rather than tactical obstacles. Micro-setting allowance applies (train car, tools in satchel function briefly), but environment does not charge the final image beyond thematic distance claim. Setup +0.5, beat involvement +0.4, closure mention +0.3, but ornamental use in middle beats (−0.5) and lack of causal pressure keep it mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Timeframe introduced at opening ("three o'clock, when midnight's regrets fracture") and invoked at closure ("that dividing hour"). However, the three o'clock moment does not tighten decisions or create urgency; time is untracked during the journey, and the hour's symbolic division ("bad habits and new starts") is thematic rather than tactical. Missing middle development where a clock pressures choice. Ornamental (−0.7) and swappability (−0.5) apply; any threshold time would serve. Scores low-3s; lyric reprise alone insufficient without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Motivation established early ("fortress of unspoken truths—a legendary bastion"), drives the descent and journey (development), and is named at closure ("found not just secrets, but the map to his own unspoken heart"). Setup +0.6, beat involvement +0.4, closure linkage +0.5. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; no visible friction between finding truths and personal cost. Summary-only treatment (−0.6) and lack of cost connection (no on-page trade-off) apply. Scores low-5s for presence across structure but weak dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Tone signaled early ("trembling certainty," "quivering assurance") and recurs throughout ("trembling certainty" five times), including final line ("certainty unshaken"). However, the tone is static—trembling plus certainty appears identically in calm and crisis beats without modulation. The oxymoron is labeled rather than enacted through shifting perception or syntax under pressure. Closure linkage present (+0.6) but ornamental repetition (−0.6) and single static mood (mid-low per guidance) apply. Scores mid-4s; recurrence without pressure evolution limits band.</comment>
