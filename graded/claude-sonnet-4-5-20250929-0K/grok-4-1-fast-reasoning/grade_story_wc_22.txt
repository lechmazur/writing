<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Thorne's motivation is stated clearly (garden reclaiming battlefield), but his interior life remains thin—no contradictory impulses appear on the page, only a "perpetual shadow" and "stoic mask cracking with purpose." The action unfolds as mission execution rather than conflicted choice under pressure. Embodied emotion is minimal; most affect is described generically ("burned deep," "lightness") rather than felt through specific bodily perception. The final departure feels declarative rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The orientation anchors (Thorne, jetty, after reef dies) arrive early. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: layered images (blooming vines, rusted blades, seed pods) build toward the final closure image of petals drifting to sea and garden reclaiming battlefield. However, the closure itself is a reported outcome ("The garden began its reclamation") rather than a decisive on-page change with visible cost; Thorne departs unaltered, carrying "lightness" but no forfeited path or undeniable price. The conceptual repricing (death's domain → life) is asserted rather than made legible through a specific final act or image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The blooming jetty, skeletal horses, cracked roads, and battlefield debris provide vivid, purposeful detail filtered through the mission's stakes. Sensory selection is strong: "salt-crusted wood," "eerie bioluminescence," "ink-black sea." The jetty constrains Thorne's action spatially (narrow path, specific spots for scattering), and the environment charges the final image of petals drifting seaward. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; micro-setting (jetty pilings, heart-trench) guides the scattering action and closure participation lifts the score into the mid-6 band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore the concord, let garden reclaim battlefield—is signaled early and coheres. One meaningful tightening occurs when the birds' calls guide Thorne to "where blood pooled deepest," narrowing his method. However, the escalation is informational (deciphering tablet, understanding birds) rather than pressured choice; Thorne never confronts a trade-off, obstacle, or cost that alters his tactics. The resolution unfolds as ritual completion rather than protagonist agency under duress, and the visible price (departing, no return mentioned) is implied rather than dramatized with forfeited options on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of renewal through sacrifice and bridging death-to-life emerges from layered particulars: reef's death, battlefield scars, seed pods, bird-mediated concord. Subtext operates in the "narrow vastness" motif and the Eldari incantation. The final image of petals carrying promises to the depths offers resonance without stating a moral. However, the closing paragraph veers toward summary ("a coachman who had driven life back into death's domain") and near-thematic statement ("boundless healing could bloom"), diluting the earned image work. The resonance is present but softened by over-articulation in the final lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Thorne throughout. The narrative voice carries elevated, archaic diction ("scarred by forgotten wars," "desperate finger tracing infinity") that reads voice-motivated for a fantasy coachman but occasionally tips into purple register ("ink-black sea," "quiet conquest"). Perceptual signature is generic; Thorne's noticing does not reveal character-specific bias. Dialogue is absent. The phrase "narrow vastness" recurs but feels imposed rather than organically woven into perception. Minor filter-verb stacks ("gripped," "whispered," "watched") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy without breaking clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clarity and rhythm are generally clean, but multiple paraphrase loops appear: "The reef had died years ago…Now, after the reef dies" restates the same fact; "narrow vastness" is defined twice in adjacent paragraphs; "blooming" modifies jetty, boards, and edge within four paragraphs. Template cadence runs ("He withdrew…Crushing…Guided…At the indicated spots") in the scattering sequence flatten propulsion. Stock metaphors ("desperate finger tracing infinity," "garden's quiet conquest") and elevated diction in the closure paragraph ("tendrils weaving," "slaughter's legacy into life's tapestry") drift into generic lyricism. These artifacts cluster in the final third, applying the tightened artifact penalty (−0.6 to −0.8 in Q7) and disallowing 9+ globally per the cap rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—coachman restores magical pact via dead language and seed ritual—synthesizes fantasy elements but follows a familiar quest-restoration template without fresh moral calculus or structural risk. The "speaks dead languages / understands bird calls" pairing is clever but remains ornamental; the birds simply instruct rather than creating friction. The Eldari tablet and concord pact feel like convenient lore rather than constraints that complicate Thorne's choices. The transformation test fails: swap names and setting, and the emotional arc (dutiful hero completes ritual, departs fulfilled) remains a stock resolution. No bold risk or non-obvious inflection elevates the material beyond its template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Thorne (gloom-hill coachman) is present throughout and performs the scattering action, but his choices are instructed by the tablet and birds rather than creating key turns through internal conflict or decision under pressure. He functions as ritual executor. Setup gate met; middle development weak (follows instructions); payoff present but passive. Functional but replaceable role; score mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The seed pods appear in paragraph 5 (coat pocket), are handled in paragraph 29 (withdrawn), and used causally in paragraph 31 (crushed and scattered to trigger garden growth). Three distinct beats, causal pressure (enabling the concord fulfillment), and closure linkage (growth begins immediately after scattering). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. Specific properties (dried, powdery cores, latent nutrients) matter. Eligible for mid-to-high 6s; swappability concern (any fertile seed could theoretically work) and lack of on-page cost tied specifically to *these* pods caps below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The submerged concord is introduced via the tablet in paragraph 19, shapes the method (revival through incantation and scattering), and the closure image references "concord's balance restored." Setup late but present (~40% mark); development via incantation and bird-guided action; payoff asserted in final third. Two gates met, but the concept remains abstract—Thorne never confronts a trade-off or constraint *imposed by the concord itself*; it functions as lore-explanation rather than a force that narrows options. Mid-5s for functional presence without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Thorne "speaks dead languages" is introduced in paragraph 18, enables deciphering the tablet (paragraph 19), and understanding the birds' Eldari calls (paragraphs 22–24), which unlock the scattering method. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Causal pressure: without this trait, the method fails. Specificity: Eldari fluency is irreplaceable in this logic. No visible cost or trade-off tied to speaking dead languages on the page (e.g., effort, misunderstanding risk). Eligible for mid-6s; lack of cost caps below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The action "fertilize" appears as imperative in the tablet (paragraph 19), shapes the birds' instructions ("Fertilize the heart-trench," paragraph 26), and Thorne enacts it in paragraph 31 ("To fertilize…is to invite the garden's quiet conquest"), triggering the closure image of vines and flowers reclaiming the battlefield. Setup early, development via bird guidance, payoff directly shapes the ending. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, irreplaceable (no other action completes the concord). Cost connection weak (scattering is easy). Strong integration, eligible for low 7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The method "by understanding bird calls" is seeded in paragraph 21 ("ears attuned…layered meanings"), developed in paragraphs 22–26 (birds speak Eldari, guide scattering), and enables the resolution. Setup, development, payoff gates met. Causal pressure: without bird comprehension, Thorne cannot locate the correct spots. Specificity high. No cost or friction (Thorne understands instantly). Eligible for mid-to-high 6s; lack of struggle or trade-off caps below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight is introduced in paragraph 7, provides spatial constraint (narrow path) and resources (bioluminescent flowers fed by springs) in paragraphs 8–9, guides the scattering action via pilings and blooming edge (paragraph 31), and charges the final image ("petals drifted into the sea"). Setup early, development via spatial choreography and micro-setting, payoff shapes closure. Three beats, causal pressure (jetty structure and blooming guide tactics), closure linkage strong, irreplaceable (no other setting provides this convergence). Eligible for low-to-mid 7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the reef dies" is established in paragraphs 2–3 and referenced at closure ("The reef's death had been a dirge"). It sets the causal precondition (springs awaken, concord breaks) but does not tighten decisions or tactics during the on-page action. Thorne faces no clock; twilight descends but does not constrain his ritual. Setup met, development absent (no urgency), payoff thematic mention only. Two gates, functional but replaceable with any post-disaster timeframe. Mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Thorne's motivation "to let a garden reclaim a battlefield" is stated in paragraph 12, drives his journey and scattering action (paragraphs 29–31), and the closure image shows the garden beginning reclamation. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. The desire is told ("burned deep") rather than dramatized through internal friction or conflicting wants. No visible cost or renunciation tied to this specific motivation on the page (e.g., leaving Gloom Hill forever, sacrificing something personal). Functional across beats, eligible for mid-6s; lack of friction and cost caps below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The tone phrase "narrow vastness" appears in paragraphs 8, 11, 32, and 38, framing the jetty's paradox (confining span, endless horizon). It modulates with the action: initial awe, mid-ritual focus, final hopeful bridging. Setup early, development via reprise, payoff charges the last paragraph ("narrow vastness lingered…boundless healing could bloom"). Coherent and purposeful. However, the phrase is explained rather than embodied ("the jetty's confining span dwarfed by…"), and the closure articulation veers toward summary. Charged reprise qualifies for ~6.0; over-articulation and lack of causal constraint lower to high 5s.</comment>
