<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is almost entirely absent; we see him "motivated by the labyrinth of self" but never experience contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final absorption of the shadow-doppelganger lands as a declared solution rather than an earned choice with visible cost. Embodied emotion is missing throughout—no sweat, tremor, or hesitation that would ground the high-stakes confrontation. The character reads as a vehicle for the prompt elements rather than a person under genuine pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. However, causality is decorative: Elias activates runes, timelines appear, he floats through them, absorbs his shadow, and the labyrinth collapses—each beat follows "and then" rather than "because." The closure unit (absorbing the doppelganger) occurs without prior dramatized cost or a legible tradeoff; the phrase "integrated the fracture" tells the resolution instead of showing a decisive change. Under a Causal lens (inferred from the quest structure), the linkage fails; under Accumulative, no pattern-break or cadence shift reweights the stake at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The viaduct and rain-suspended droplets anchor the scene vividly early. Spatial choreography remains clear (hovering, descending, pressing tablet to archway). However, the setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint—Elias's gravity defiance removes all environmental pressure, and no physical feature of the viaduct alters his tactics or charges the final image. The glowing stones pulse and flicker but never limit or enable a choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("conquer the labyrinth of self") is signaled early but never tested by a credible on-page reversal. Elias encounters alternate timelines and shadow-selves, yet none force a difficult choice or trade-off—he simply "dodges," "phases through," and "retraces." The final confrontation with the doppelganger resolves in a single sentence without visible cost or a narrowing of options. Pressure remains static rather than escalating under the inferred Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme of self-integration emerges from the premise but resolves through assertion ("To conquer me is to end the maze") rather than earned insight. The final image—"darkening brightness now a conquered equilibrium within"—leans heavily on abstract paradox without grounding in specific action or cost. No particular from the labyrinth journey reweights the opening question; the ending explains rather than resonates. The piece avoids overt moralizing but substitutes thematic declarations that bypass dramatic payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction tilts toward elevated register ("convolutions," "foreboding halos," "genesis of his defiance") that reads more authorial than character-particular, especially under stress. The single line of dialogue ("Begin") is functional but does nothing to establish voice. Perceptual signature is generic—Elias notices glowing runes and shifting timelines but his way of seeing carries no idiosyncratic filter. Psychic distance stays consistent, which prevents slippage but also flattens interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "fractured timelines" and "splintered possibilities" restate the same concept across adjacent lines; "darkening brightness" appears three times without reweighting. Template cadence runs ("He descended… boots skimming… pressed the tablet"; "He floated through… the tablet pulsing") stack filter constructions and synonym churn. Stock metaphors ("dying star," "maze of the soul") appear without transformation. Figurative density in peak beats (the doppelganger confrontation) obscures rather than sharpens: "shadow-cloaked," "chorus of lost timelines," "procedural unraveling" pile abstraction on abstraction. Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The core premise (gravity-defying protagonist uses a relic to navigate fractured timelines and integrate his past selves) is a template quest structure drawn from video-game and multi-timeline fiction without a fresh angle. "Procedural generation" and "periodically eternal" are prompt-label concepts that remain ornamental rather than driving specific, non-obvious choices. The emotional truth of self-integration never surfaces through lived detail—no verifiable mistake, no particular regret that shapes the labyrinth's layout. Transformation test fails: swap Elias for any other name and the arc remains unchanged. The piece executes a checklist without risk or synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout but his choices are reactive and generic: activate runes, float through timelines, absorb shadow. None of these decisions narrows options or imposes a visible trade-off. Setup and development gates are met, but closure participation is ornamental—he "integrates the fracture" by declaration rather than a consequential act.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tablet is handled in three beats (floating in palm, pressed to archway, dimming at the end) and its runes drive the labyrinth's activation. Setup and payoff gates are met, and the object shapes one major turn (opening the timelines). However, the tablet's specific properties (etched algorithms, pulsing mechanics) never constrain Elias's choices or charge the final image—it could be swapped for a generic "artifact" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Fractured timelines frame the premise and generate the labyrinth's corridors. Setup and development gates are met. However, the concept functions as scenery rather than a causal driver—no timeline forces a difficult choice, and the final integration occurs off-stage ("He had retraced… and integrated"). The concept is told more than dramatized, limiting its causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" is described in exposition ("eternal yet resetting with each phase of the moon," "reset the maze every seventh heartbeat") but never constrains or enables an on-page action. Setup gate is met, but no middle development or closure participation. The attribute remains a label without visible cost or tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Retrace" appears in setup, drives the middle exploration ("retracing steps to the nexus"), and bookends the ending ("Elias had retraced"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the action is largely summarized—we are told he retraces timelines but do not see a specific retracing choice alter tactics or impose cost. One beat of causal work keeps it functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Procedural generation" is mentioned three times in exposition ("algorithms of fate weaving new paths," "the labyrinth unfolded endlessly… algorithmically") but its mechanics never matter on the page. No middle beat shows how procedural generation enables or constrains Elias's attempts. Introduced early but remains ornamental throughout; no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The viaduct is present throughout (hovering above it, pressing the tablet to its archway, landing softly at the end). Setup and payoff gates are met. However, the setting's glowing stones and rain-slick surface never pressure a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome—Elias's gravity defiance neutralizes all environmental constraint. Postcard description without tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Between the drop and the ripple" is invoked in setup and referenced at the end ("Raindrops shattered the suspension, ripples exploding outward as time resumed"). Setup and payoff gates are met. However, the timeframe never tightens decisions—suspended time grants Elias unlimited exploration without urgency. No middle development showing the clock altering tactics; the temporal constraint is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The motivation is declared early ("driven by a burning motivation to conquer the labyrinth of self") and the ending gestures toward fulfillment ("the labyrinth of self bowed before him"). Setup and payoff gates are met. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized—no on-page choice shows want conflicting with cost or fear. The motivation functions as a thesis statement rather than a lived friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Darkening brightness" appears in three beats (twilight valley glow, "brightness darkened further," "darkening brightness now a conquered equilibrium"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The tone modulates with the labyrinth's progression and charges the final image with paradox. However, the phrase leans on abstraction rather than concrete sensory shift, and its conceptual work (light bending into foreboding) is asserted more than shown through action.</comment>
