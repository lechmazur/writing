<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's interior remains abstract through most beats—"uncommonly serene," "urbane poise," "motivation crystal"—rather than embodied contradiction. The turn toward abandoning puppet shows is asserted rather than earned through dramatized struggle; we see no impulse pulling him back toward the bars' thrill even as he resolves to quit. The reflection on past shows (marionettes, patron's grief) arrives as summary without present micro-choices that tilt his stance. Backstory exceeds ~30% without interleaving sufficient on-page decisions that alter options in the dome.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (dome, alone, post-argument) by the second paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: serene reflection accumulates toward a renunciation. Closure attempts Earned Stasis (halting the shows, embracing honest campfire tales), but the cost remains told rather than felt—no on-page forfeiture of income, audience, or identity that we witness him lose. The reversal (stick read backward, villain's fall) functions as metaphor without altering tactics or knowledge in the present scene. Accumulative designs require density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; here the final beats repeat "serene," "hush," "reverse" without tightening pressure or making the sacrifice undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dome's curved walls and concrete floor anchor space; "meteor hush" and the single lantern create atmosphere. The stick is handled across multiple beats (traced, twirled, held to light, inscribed anew), meeting the micro-setting test. However, the dome does not constrain Elias's choice—he could reach the same resolution in any quiet room. The environment mirrors his serene state rather than pressuring it, keeping the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to continue subversive puppet shows—is signaled early. Pressure does not escalate; Elias begins serene and remains serene, with no on-page pull toward the bars or audience thrill that he must overcome. The puppeteer's cruelty to a patron is recounted, not dramatized, so the ethical breach feels distant. The decision to "reverse course" and halt the shows is declared but carries no visible cost in this scene: no audience waiting, no income source named and forfeited, no identity crisis embodied. Under the Accumulative lens, we need a deepening that reweights the stake with felt cost; instead we see assertion of transformation without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of ethical storytelling versus subversion emerges clearly from events and the stick's inscriptions. The half-lit/full-dawn dichotomy and the campfire versus seedy-bar contrast are explicit rather than earned through particulars. The final whisper "Half-lit no more—full dawn awaits ethical tellers" crosses into direct thematic statement, undercutting resonance. Puppets as crutches for "fear of raw truth" is an epiphany asserted rather than shown through specific struggle. The piece invites reflection but resolves into a tidy moral rather than complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic: "elegant script," "urbane," "silk scarf draped precisely." Diction remains consistent, leaning literary-poetic ("meteor hush," "ink-stained gloves"), though some phrases feel elevated beyond a calligrapher's natural idiom under stress ("subversive thrills; ethics bloomed in openness"). Purposeful compression ("Uncommonly serene, he led now toward light") supports the accumulative design. Free indirect style is clean. The voice is competent but not character-particular; lacks the specificity that would push higher.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "uncommonly serene" appears four times; "meteor hush" five times; "half-lit epiphanies" four times; "reverse/reversed" eight times; "seedy bars" four times. Adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure: "Motivation purified: explore storytelling not to provoke, but to mend" immediately follows "His motivation purified." Stock metaphors accumulate: "scalpels," "ink-stained gloves," "narrative gold." These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("Uncommonly serene, he led now toward light. In every hush after storm, epiphanies waited"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Filter-verb stacks in peak beats ("Half-lit epiphanies surged anew… What if subversion scarred more…") add −0.5. Sentence stems repeat: "The dome…" opens three consecutive paragraphs mid-story. Total deduction approximately −2.0, capping score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—artist renouncing subversive work for ethical purity—is familiar and executed without transformation. The urbane calligrapher/puppeteer combination is unusual on paper but functions as surface detail; the story would run unchanged if he were a playwright or spoken-word poet. The dome setting is underused; any quiet refuge would serve. The stick's reversed calligraphy is clever but remains metaphor without altering tactics. Emotional arc is linear (serene throughout) without complexity or counter-pressure. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece hedges toward the safety middle with a declared epiphany rather than earned ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and makes the decision to halt puppet shows and embrace campfire storytelling. However, the choice is not dramatized through on-page struggle—he begins serene, reflects on past shows (off-page), and concludes serene. No key turn results from a contested decision in the present scene; the argument with the troupe occurred before the story opens. The character observes and resolves internally without visible cost or friction, placing him in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The stick is handled in multiple beats: traced, twirled, held reverse to the lantern, inscribed anew, pocketed, and referenced in the final image ("campfire story stick reborn"). It seeds expectation early and reappears at closure. Its reversed calligraphy offers a metaphor (hero's rise → villain's fall) but does not constrain Elias's choice or alter his tactics; he could reach the same resolution without it. The stick functions as thematic emblem rather than causal lever, placing it in the mid-5s under the gate model (setup + payoff present, but development weak).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Half-lit epiphanies" is mentioned four times as a label for Elias's past audience reactions and his present realizations, but it does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. The concept remains thematic descriptor rather than active pressure. The piece tells us epiphanies occurred in bars and occur again in the dome, without dramatizing how partial revelation constrains or enables a choice. Ornamental use, late specificity (fully named only midway), and no causal role in closure keep the score below 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene" is applied to Elias four times as a character label but does not constrain or enable any on-page action with cost. The trait describes his emotional state rather than forcing a tradeoff—he remains calm throughout, and no beat shows him choosing serenity over another impulse (e.g., anger, grief, doubt). Label-only mentions and no visible cost place it in the ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Reverse" (and variants) appears eight times: he twirls the stick reverse, reads calligraphy reverse, imagines reversing course, and the troupe will be convinced by his "reverse." The repetition signals importance, but the action itself is metaphorical—reading backward does not mechanically cause the decision to halt shows. The turn could occur through direct reflection without the reversal gesture. Multiple mentions without causal necessity place it in the functional-but-replaceable band; specificity is absent (any symbolic gesture would serve).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The puppet shows in seedy bars are referenced across several beats: past performances (marionettes, patron's grief), motivation, and the resolution to abandon them. However, the mechanics never appear on the page—we do not see a show, preparation, audience interaction, or the moment of crossing into cruelty. All involvement is summary. The method shapes the central conflict (whether to continue) but is recounted rather than dramatized, and it resolves a problem (ethical breach) it only told us about. Setup and closure gates met; development gate (middle choice shaped by mechanics) is absent, capping at ~3.4 per the gate model. Swappability (any controversial art form would serve) and summary-only use apply as frictions.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dome is named early, described (curved walls, concrete floor, apex, hatch), and frames the entire scene. It supplies atmosphere and a metaphor (radar scanning his soul), but it does not pressure Elias's choice—he could reach the same resolution in a cabin, studio, or park. The space is postcard rather than tactical: no resource scarcity, no access constraint, no environmental threat. Setup and closure gates met (he exits through the hatch), but the middle development gate is absent (the dome does not constrain a mid-scene choice), capping eligibility around 4.6. Static description lowers the score within that range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the hush left behind by a heated argument" anchors the opening and recurs ("argument's hush had birthed reversal"). However, time does not tighten decisions—Elias has unlimited leisure to reflect, with no ticking clock or approaching troupe return to force urgency. The "hush" is atmospheric rather than a constraint. Setup gate met; development and closure gates weak (time does not shape the ending choice), capping around 3.4. The element is functional but passive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The motivation to explore ethical storytelling is named early ("motivation crystal") and recurs ("motivation purified"), framing the conflict between subversive provocation and honest tale-telling. However, it is told rather than dramatized—we see no on-page moment where Elias weighs the thrill of bars against the cost to patrons, no friction between desire and ethics in real time. The motivation drives the premise but remains abstract; no visible tradeoff or conflicted choice on the page. Setup and closure gates met (he exits pledging "honest tales"), but development is summary-only, placing it in the functional band near 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears five times, establishing a quiet, vast, contemplative tone that persists through the entire piece. The tone is coherent and matches Elias's serene state, but it does not modulate with pressure—no intensification, no break, no charged shift at the ending. A single static mood that supports atmosphere but lacks dynamic range. The tone charges the setting but not the final image specifically (the ending recycles "hush" and "serene" without new cadence). Setup, development (consistent application), and weak closure linkage place it in the mid-5s.</comment>
