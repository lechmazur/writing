<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are declared through label-heavy interiority ("hauntingly optimistic," "poetic wharf weaver") rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses under pressure. The sleepwalking trance erases agency for the entire climactic sequence; her hands move by "instinct" and "dream grip," leaving no visible trade-off or choice that she consciously forecloses. The final "work complete" arrival lacks any embodied struggle or cost—she simply awakens to find success. Emotional states are asserted ("fragile bloom," "orchid solace") without concrete sensory anchors or behavioral contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Elara is, where the village sits relative to the canyon, and when "tonight" occurs remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty and the Q3 cap at 7.0. The closure—Elara's tapestry reborn and villagers ascending—occurs off-stage during sleep and is summarized at dawn without on-page causal cost or a visible price paid. The drive lens is ambiguous (lyric-accumulative gestures coexist with a summary causal claim) and not held cleanly through the ending. Coincidence (somnolence "claims her") enables rather than complicates the resolution, violating situational and causal norms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The red canyon walls and labyrinth are described vividly ("petroglyphs," "sea brine," "cooling rock") but remain postcard backdrops—Elara never navigates a choice constrained by access, proximity, or spatial logic. The storybook plate and orchid thread appear as portable talismans without altering tactics or shaping a turn. The tide-pool timeframe is declared but never tightens a decision or imposes urgency. Sensory detail is present but not filtered through professional or personal bias; the catalog reads generic rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"carving a path from ruin to reverence"—is declared but never tested by a live on-page dilemma or escalation that narrows options. Elara's sleepwalking removes agency from the peak sequence, leaving no protagonist-driven reversal or choice with visible cost. The resolution (luminous tapestry, villagers ascending) is summarized rather than dramatized, and the "broken precedents dissolved" outcome arrives without trade-off or price legible on the page. Pressure is static from entry to dawn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme (tradition's rigidity versus adaptive grace, ruin as resource) is stated overtly in the opening and closing rather than emerging from dramatized choices. The final paragraph moralizes: "no more rigid rituals, but fluid paths born of shared sleepwalking grace" and "ruin reverenced the sea's wild wisdom," replacing scene pressure with thesis statements. The storybook plate and orchid thread recur but function as symbolic tokens rather than particulars that reweight meaning through specific tension. Subtext is absent; all metaphoric freight is declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Diction oscillates between elevated lyricism ("gossamer threads dyed the hue of orchid solace," "veins in the canyon's vast body") and generic abstraction ("fragile bloom in the desolation") without a stable perceptual signature. Register drift is pervasive: "broken precedents," "conceptual integrity," and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("soothed the soul's sharpest thorns") appear in peak beats, clashing with the folkloric frame. The sleepwalking sequence withholds Elara's interior entirely, leaving no POV-specific texture during the climactic act. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not testable, but the single-POV narration lacks rhythmic modulation under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Template cadence runs throughout: "those precedents… promised… yet they crumbled," "her spirit… envisioning… where the canyon's wounds," "deeper in, somnolence claimed her; her eyes fluttered shut, body swaying." Paraphrase loops recur (the plate's "faded scene" restated as "its wanderers seeming to nod approval," the thread's color named four times without functional variation). Stock metaphor strings ("fragile bloom," "veins in the canyon's vast body," "gossamer threads") and filter-verb stacks ("felt the pull," "heard the elders' tales," "seemed to nod") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. The final third is pervaded by these artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally and triggering the −1.7 baseline in Q7 plus the high-band entry cap at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The core premise—sleepwalking protagonist magically repairs communal rift via thread-sewing in a labyrinth—closely matches template folktale structures (solitary artisan, mystical trance, transformative craft) without fresh inflection. The "broken precedents" versus "fluid paths" binary resolves into tidy moral symmetry with no counter-reading or ambiguity. The orchid-dyed thread, storybook plate, and red canyon walls function as interchangeable symbolic placeholders; swapping them for other talismans would leave the emotional arc unchanged. No risk-taking heightens stakes—coincidence (somnolence) enables the climax, and the ending offers perfect consensus satisfaction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no on-page decision during the climactic sewing sequence—somnolence and "instinct" guide her hands. Her role is observational before the trance and summarized after awakening, with no visible choice that narrows options or incurs cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The storybook plate appears in two beats (salvaged cottage, dream grip) and is named at the summit, but its function is ornamental—it "pulsed with warmth" and "seemed to nod approval" without altering Elara's tactics or constraining a choice. Swappable with any heirloom talisman.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Broken precedents" are declared as backstory and thematic framing ("rigid rituals… crumbled") but never pressure an on-page choice or tactic. The concept is resolved in summary ("dissolved in its glow") rather than through a dramatized cost or dilemma tied to precedent-breaking.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Hauntingly optimistic" is a label applied twice without constraining action or enabling a visible trade-off. Elara's optimism is asserted ("her spirit a fragile bloom") but does not alter her approach, create friction, or incur cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sewing drives the central beat (threading the labyrinth) and appears in the closure image (tapestry complete). However, the act occurs during sleepwalking trance without on-page agency or choice, and the outcome is summarized rather than shown as a turn with visible cost. The action is essential to plot but not to character-driven escalation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Overlapping sleepwalking paths" are described in the middle beat ("spectral wanderers… paths converging") and are integral to the sewing's logic, but the mechanics remain vague and the method is not signaled early. It shapes the climax's texture but does not constrain a choice or impose a cost Elara must navigate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The "centuries-old labyrinth carved into red canyon walls" frames the setting across all three acts (tide pools, entry, dawn summit) and supplies the physical substrate for the tapestry. However, it functions as backdrop—no spatial constraint or access problem alters Elara's tactics, and the labyrinth's maze logic is never tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"After the tide pools empty" is mentioned in the opening and used to defy the elders' prohibition, but no clock tightens decisions afterward. The span from twilight to dawn is summarized without urgency or time-driven pressure on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to carve a path from ruin to reverence" is declared in the opening and restated at closure, but it is never tested by a conflicting want or on-page dilemma. Elara's desire is summarized rather than dramatized through friction between goal and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Orchid solace" is named three times as a thread color and mood label ("soothed the soul's sharpest thorns," "orchid solace… where ruin reverenced") but remains static—tone does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image through contrast or cadence shift. The label is decorative rather than functional.</comment>
