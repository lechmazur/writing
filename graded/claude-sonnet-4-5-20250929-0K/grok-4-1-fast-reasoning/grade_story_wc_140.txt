<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; the wanderer passively collects fragments without meaningful internal conflict or visible cost until the final beat. Motivation is declared ("to discover the texture of memories") but never tested through on-page tension between competing wants. The "death" backstory arrives late and feels convenient rather than earned through prior dramatized struggle. The final "smile into the fog" reads as aesthetic closure without foregrounding the psychological price of reclaimed identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens (layered fragments → final reweighting) but the closure unit is diffuse: the poison-label discovery and identity-reclamation occur in rapid summary rather than a single charged image with legible cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) emerge slowly across the first third without teaching disorientation as a pattern, yet the delay does not decisively harm the ending. The tidal rhythm provides structure, but causality remains loose—fragments accumulate without narrowing options until the abrupt convergence in the final paragraph. One meaningful deepening is present (label discovery → memory unlock), meeting minimum escalation for this length, but the cost remains asserted rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly rendered with recurring sensory detail (rust, salt, fog, tidal mudflats) and the tides function as a recurring environmental constraint that alters access and tactics across beats. The labyrinth itself does not constrain a pivotal choice—it serves as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure source—but the poison label, half-buried in muck at low tide, charges the final image by linking environment to discovery. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The micro-setting (tidal rhythm + found object) elevates the score toward the 7.0 threshold but falls short of indispensability.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early (discover memory texture / reclaim erased identity) and the tidal cycles provide patterned pressure, but escalation remains atmospheric rather than causal—fragments accumulate without forcing trade-offs or narrowing options until the final paragraph. The label discovery offers one reversal (un-erasing the protagonist's history), yet it arrives abruptly and resolves without visible cost: the wanderer "smiled into the fog" without renouncing a live alternative or paying a felt price. No on-page choice forecloses a path; the ending reconfigures understanding but lacks the agency-driven tightening required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (erased histories, identity reclaimed through fragmented memory) emerges from the labyrinth's layered particulars rather than statement, and the poison label functions as a non-literal anchor for the protagonist's un-erasure. The final image—label clutched, smile into fog—attempts resonance but lacks the tension or ambiguity that would deepen inquiry; the ending tidies complexity into affirmation ("memories' weave complete") without lingering cost. Subtext operates in the spectral overlays and the bureaucratic-error backstory, yet the piece leans toward illustrating its premise rather than interrogating it. The thematic question is present but resolved too cleanly to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual filter ("echoes of untold pasts overlaid the present like translucent skins") is established early and recurs consistently. However, the prose often narrates the filter rather than enacting it: "layered addition deepened the texture" tells the effect instead of showing sensory or cognitive distortion in real time. Diction is elevated and consistent but occasionally drifts into ornamental register ("cathedral of rust," "mocking tongue") that feels writerly rather than character-rooted. Dialogue is minimal (brief sailor/stevedore fragments) and serves function without subtext. Distance control is competent but the voice lacks a distinct rhythmic signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "Layering this…" / "Layered atop…" / "Layering it…" recur across six beats without variation, creating a mechanical rhythm (−0.6). "Texture" and "layered" are synonym-churned throughout without fresh synonyms or embodied alternatives. The opening paragraph front-loads modifiers ("towering labyrinth," "forgotten monoliths," "fog-shrouded docks") in a purple cluster that slows momentum. Information density is low in the middle third, where fragments are collected but not advanced through choice. Clarity remains high and no causality breaks occur, preventing deeper penalty, but the prose feels over-decorated and repetitive rather than propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The shipping-container labyrinth + bureaucratic erasure + tidal rhythm offers a specific setting synthesis, and the "filters reality differently" attribute provides a fresh perceptual angle. However, the emotional arc (nameless → identity reclaimed through found object) follows a familiar template without transformation: the poison label solves the mystery it did not complicate, and the ending affirms rather than costs. The piece commits fully to its premise but does not surprise or deepen it through character choice. Risk-taking is limited to atmospheric design; the core conflict and resolution remain within safe bounds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The death-certificate-error survivor is present throughout but makes no on-page decisions that alter tactics until the final paragraph, where the label discovery triggers memory rather than choice. The character observes, collects, and interprets without agency-driven turns. Introduced in paragraph two (setup ✓), mentioned across beats (development ✓), and present at closure (payoff ✓), but the role is passive receptor rather than decision-maker. Swappable with "amnesiac" or "identity seeker" without structural change. Two-gate participation (setup + payoff; middle is ambient) limits ceiling; passivity and swappability further lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The poison-bottle label is seeded in paragraph twelve via overheard dialogue, handled physically in paragraph twenty-four (pried from muck), and charges the final image as talisman. Three beats (sailor's tale, discovery, clutched at closure) with causal pressure: the label unlocks the protagonist's sabotage memory and anchors the un-erasure. However, it arrives late (past midpoint) and resolves a problem (erased identity) it did not help create on the page—the sabotage backstory is retroactively introduced alongside the object. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability (the exact label matters) elevate the score, but late arrival and lack of prior complication cap it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Erased histories frame the premise (bureaucratic error, smuggler/deserter community, burned logs, forged graves) and recur across the narrative as thematic through-line. The concept shapes the protagonist's quest (reclaim texture of memories) and the final image (history "un-erased"), but it does not constrain on-page choices—fragments are collected without friction or cost until the ending summary. Setup ✓ (paragraph three), development ✓ (permeates middle via overheard tales), payoff ✓ (closure image). The concept is thematically integrated but lacks causal teeth: removing it would weaken resonance but not break plot logic, as the quest could function as simple identity search. Thematic presence without tactical pressure places it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Filters reality differently" is introduced early (paragraph five) as perceptual veil where "echoes of untold pasts overlaid the present" and recurs throughout (spectral hands, phantom sailors, reality convulsing). However, the trait is narrated rather than enacted with cost: the overlays are described but never constrain or mislead a choice—no moment where the filtered vision causes error, delay, or trade-off. Setup ✓, development ✓ (ambient across beats), payoff ✓ (final convulsion), but the attribute remains illustrative rather than pressure-generating. Swappable with "obsessive listener" or "memory collector" without altering tactics. Consistent presence across all three gates allows mid-band entry, but lack of cost or tactical friction prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Layer" appears as method/action throughout: fragments are layered onto perception, causing spectral overlays to thicken and reality to fracture. The action is signaled early (paragraph six: "layered it onto their perception") and recurs across at least six beats, culminating in the final "layering this tangible fragment" that triggers memory convulsion and closure. However, the layering is passive accumulation—no beat where the protagonist must choose which fragment to layer or pay a cost for over-layering. Setup ✓, development ✓ (multiple beats), payoff ✓ (final convulsion). The action is irreplaceable (the story's core mechanic) but lacks agency or trade-off; swapping "layer" for "absorb" or "weave" would preserve structure. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage lift it into the 6.0s, but passivity caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Collecting fragments of overheard stories is introduced in paragraph eight and recurs across the narrative: sailor's poison tale, fisherwoman's murmur, stevedore's confession, shadowed exchange. The method drives at least four distinct beats and supplies the material for the final memory unlock. However, the mechanics lack friction—no moment where the protagonist must choose between listening and acting, or where a fragment misleads. Setup ✓ (paragraph eight), development ✓ (multiple collection beats), payoff ✓ (fragments converge to trigger closure). The method is specific and irreplaceable but could be replaced with "finding written records" without breaking logic. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage place it in the mid-6.0s; lack of cost or choice constraint prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shipping-container labyrinth is anchored in the opening line, recurs throughout as spatial frame, and provides the environmental constraint (tidal access) that structures the protagonist's movements and discoveries. The labyrinth supplies the muck-buried label at low tide (paragraph twenty-four), directly enabling closure. At least three beats depend on the setting: low-tide penetration, high-tide retreat, final low-tide discovery. Setup ✓ (paragraph one), development ✓ (tidal cycles constrain tactics across middle), payoff ✓ (labyrinth's heart yields the object). The setting is irreplaceable—no other locale would supply the tidal rhythm + hidden object combination—and it alters tactics on the page. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity all present; score reaches low-7.0s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Tidal rhythm is introduced early (paragraph nine: "low tide exposed muddy paths… high tide flooded") and recurs across at least four beats, structuring the narrative's temporal progression (ebb/flood cycles → spring/neap mention → stormy eve high tide → final ebb). The timeframe constrains access (low tide = deeper penetration, high tide = retreat to stacks) and enables the climactic discovery at ebb. Setup ✓ (paragraph nine), development ✓ (multiple tidal beats), payoff ✓ (low tide unearths the label). However, the tides function as backdrop constraint rather than live clock—no moment where the protagonist races rising water or sacrifices an opportunity due to tidal timing. The element is specific and recurrent but lacks urgent pressure. Causal involvement and closure linkage present; lack of high-stakes time pressure caps it below 6.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of memories" is stated in paragraph seven and recurs thematically (fragments "gritty," "velvety," "jagged," "coarse," "silken"). The motivation frames the quest and the final image ("memories' weave complete"), but it is never tested through on-page friction—no moment where the protagonist must choose between discovering texture and another want, or where the pursuit costs something tangible. Setup ✓ (paragraph seven), development ✓ (texture language recurs), payoff ✓ (closure affirms completion). The motivation is swappable with "reclaim identity" or "understand the past" without altering structure. Told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice; thematic presence without tactical cost places it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Nameless identity" is introduced early (paragraph two: "moved without a name," paragraph four: "officially erased") and sustained through diction choices (no proper name, "the wanderer," "they") across the narrative, culminating in "identity nameless no more, but textured, alive." The tone is coherent and intentional, modulating slightly at closure from drift to affirmation. Setup ✓ (paragraph two), development ✓ (sustained across beats), payoff ✓ (final reconfiguration). However, the tone operates primarily as stylistic choice rather than pressure source—namelessness does not constrain a choice or prevent an action on the page. The ending shift ("nameless no more") reweights the opening frame, qualifying as lyric reprise with thematic charge. Coherent tonal arc and closure linkage lift it into the 6.0s; lack of tactical constraint caps it below 7.0.</comment>
