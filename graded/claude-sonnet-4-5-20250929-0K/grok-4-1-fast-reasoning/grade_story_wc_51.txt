<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to collect burdens is declared but never tested by a contrary want or genuine inner conflict. The "boundary-less trap" and her realization arrive through metaphysical mechanism rather than embodied choice under pressure. Interiority remains abstract—"whalebone reverie," "essence toward the altar"—without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final act of orienting the burner reads as puzzle-solving, not a foreclosure with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Elara is, what "fractal weaver" concretely means, and the grotto's spatial layout remain hazy past the opening third, triggering a −0.4 penalty in Q2 and capping Q3 at 7.0. The accumulative/textural lens is inferred from layered imagery and the calcification climax, but the closure—Elara "coalesces" and touches the burner as "promise"—lacks a clear before/after in her options or stance; the cost (being trapped, then freed by hardening) is asserted rather than felt through a decisive renunciation or choice. The piece teaches its pattern of nested metaphor but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bronze grotto, starlight, and kerosene burner anchor the single scene and constrain the weave ritual through proximity and light mechanics. Sensory detail is vivid but often ornamental—"shingled hush," "meltwater pooling"—without altering Elara's tactical options. The burner's orientation does charge the climax, lifting the score above mid-band, though the spatial choreography of "essence toward the altar" while "smeared across patterns" remains unclear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing the fractal weave without being trapped—is signaled early but escalation is metaphysical rather than choice-driven: the weaves "overgrow" and Elara "realizes" calcification is needed without a prior decision that caused the trap. The tightening (fractals merging) happens to her; her agency at the climax (tilting the burner) reads as procedural execution, not a trade-off with visible cost. One meaningful pressure point is present but the cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of burden-bearing and transcendence through hardening emerges from the fractal metaphor and calcification action, but the final monument feels declared rather than earned from prior particulars—no specific burden reprise at closure ties the grand atlas to concrete human weight. The piece avoids overt moralizing yet the "whalebone reverie waning" and "promise of next season" soften the cost, leaning toward thematic summary instead of a non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single third-person POV is stable; the elevated, metaphor-dense register—"boundary-lessly," "calcification," "shingled hush"—is internally consistent but drifts into abstract diction that clashes with embodied action under peak pressure ("essence toward the altar"). No head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic across lyric fantasy rather than Elara-specific. Filter verbs ("felt the pull," "realized") cluster in the climax, dulling immediacy by −0.3 in Q6.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density pervades without pattern-teaching or payoff: "shingled hush" appears four times, "boundary-lessly" twice, "whalebone reverie" three times, creating paraphrase loops rather than escalation. Mixed metaphors—"bronze-veined stone" after "whalebone reverie," "captive star" alongside "needles"—muddle sense. Template cadence: "One fractal bloomed… another for… came last" in mid-scene. Artifact penalty −0.8 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The fractal-weaver premise and calcification climax offer a fresh synthesis of craft metaphor and psychological burden, but the execution leans on stock fantasy tropes—ancient grotto, starlight ritual, seasonal cycle—without lived specificity. Elara's process (lighting lamp, orienting burner, visualizing tilt) reads procedural rather than inevitable from character flaw or world constraint. The "boundary-less trap" and "whalebone reverie" register as ornamental neologisms rather than irreplaceable concepts that drive the turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her goal (complete the weave) frames the story, but her key "choice"—orienting the burner—arrives late as puzzle-solving rather than a decision that narrows prior options. She does not create the trap through earlier agency; the fractals "overgrow" autonomously. Setup present, closure participation weak, middle development mostly observation. Cap at 4.6 for late functional involvement; subtract −0.4 for swappability (any craftsperson could execute the ritual).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The kerosene lamp burner is introduced early (setup gate), handled in two beats (lighting, orienting), and its tilt mechanic drives the calcification climax (closure participation). All three gates met. Causal pressure: +0.9 for enabling the weave. Closure linkage: +1.0 for the climax turn. Specificity: its "soot-blackened wick holder" and "blue flame" matter to the light refraction. Final touch as "promise" adds lyric reprise. Strong integration; score 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Shingled hush" appears four times as atmospheric descriptor ("layered silence," "deeper," "deepened," "one final") but never constrains a choice or alters Elara's tactics—it is the result of her weave, not a mechanic she must navigate. Setup present (paragraph 2), no middle development, ornamental closure mention. Cap at 4.6 for late/passive use; subtract −0.5 for decorative repetition and −0.5 for thematic echo without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Boundary-lessly trapped" is introduced mid-story (paragraph 15), defines the central problem (Elara suspended in fractals), and the calcification directly addresses it by restoring boundaries. Setup missing (−0.8 late penalty), but Development and Payoff gates met. Causal pressure: +1.0 (drives the need for calcification). Closure linkage: +1.2 ("boundary-less no more"). Swappability: −0.6 (could be "endlessly trapped" with minor edits). Net ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Calcify" is seeded early in ancestor songs (setup), named as the solution mid-trap (development), and executed in the climax to harden the fractals and free Elara (payoff). All three gates. Causal pressure: +1.4 (the only means to escape). Closure linkage: +1.6 (the climax action). Irreplaceability: +0.6 (the crystallization mechanic is unique to the premise). Strong integration; score 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"By orienting properly" is signaled early (paragraph 9: "oriented the burner precisely toward the grotto's apex") and repeated at the climax (paragraph 27: "oriented it, the flame leaping as stars aligned"). Setup and Payoff gates met; middle development weak (Elara's middle-scene weaving does not revisit orientation). Causal pressure: +0.8 (enables the calcification). Closure linkage: +1.0. Swappability: −0.5 (could be "by aligning carefully"). Net ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The bronze grotto and starlight frame the entire ritual, anchor spatial choreography (altar, apex, walls), and the starlight refraction through bronze facets is the mechanism for calcification. Setup, Development (burner placement on bronze ledge), and Payoff (starlight lances through facets) all present. Causal pressure: +1.2 (environment enables the weave). Closure linkage: +1.0. Specificity: +0.5 (bronze and starlight matter). Score 6.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the first snowmelt" appears in the opening line and again as "post-snowmelt clarity" at the climax, but the timeframe does not create urgency or constrain Elara's choices—she could perform the ritual at any seasonal clarity. Setup present, no middle development, weak closure linkage. Lyric reprise qualifies for ~5.5–6.3 range, but the element is largely atmospheric. Cap at 4.6 for missing development; subtract −0.4 for ornamental setup and −0.4 for lack of temporal pressure. Net ~3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to collect the weights of different burdens" is declared in paragraph 3, illustrated by the three visitor confessions (farmer, widow, thief), and the final "calcified monument… etched with every burden's weight" completes the goal. Setup, Development (weaving each burden), and Payoff gates met. Causal pressure: +0.6 (drives her ritual). Closure linkage: +0.8 (monument as trove). Friction: −0.6 for told-only motivation (no on-page conflict between her want and a competing desire). Net ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Whalebone reverie" appears three times (paragraphs 1, 15, 32) as a label for Elara's trance state, but the tone remains uniformly elevated and metaphor-dense without modulation under pressure—panic is noted ("flickered") but the prose texture does not shift. Setup present, weak development (the reverie "holds her motives firm" but does not evolve), closure mention is ornamental ("waning"). Cap at 4.6 for static mood; no positive adjustments. Net ~4.7.</comment>
