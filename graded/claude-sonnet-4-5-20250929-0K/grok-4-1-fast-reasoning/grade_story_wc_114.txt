<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to reckon with the swallowed truth is clear, and her fault-tolerant nature shows in her peripherally aware method. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract poetic labels ("auroral sorrow," "swaying certainties") rather than concrete embodied thought under pressure. The cartographer's death is revealed as backstory summary rather than a dramatized choice that tests her in real time, weakening the felt cost of her final acceptance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates auroral imagery and oracle motifs toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Elara accepts the burden. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening beat. The closure lands—she accepts carrying the weight—but the cartographer's fate arrives as told backstory rather than on-page event, diluting the cost proof. The pattern holds, yet the decisive moment lacks immediate visible consequence, keeping it mid-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mountain weather station supplies vivid sensory detail—frost-rimed windows, aurora glow, kerosene lamp, barometer ticking—and the botanical illustration becomes a tactile object she physically alters. The smudging action at the desk constrains her ritual and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography (desk, window, lamp) remains coherent throughout, and the setting's isolation amplifies her emotional reckoning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the weight of the swallowed truth—is signaled early and coheres through the fever recovery and illustration ritual. The berry's burden tightens her internal pressure, but the climactic realization (the cartographer's death) is recounted rather than dramatized as a live choice that forecloses options. One meaningful deepening occurs (acceptance of cumulative fatalities), yet the cost remains more stated than viscerally enacted on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the oracle's peripherally aware method, the smudged margins of the illustration, and the berry's literal/metaphorical weight. The final image—certainties swaying between tolerance and torment—reweights prior material without explicit moralizing. However, the piece occasionally tilts toward abstract philosophizing ("fault-tolerant soul," "auroral melancholy") rather than letting concrete action carry the thematic question, and the cartographer serves as a thematic device more than a lived particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-close on Elara with a consistent poetic register. Perceptual signature (peripherally aware) colors her observations of aurora and illustration edges. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("auroral sorrow," "cumulative mass bending her resilient frame") that feels authorial rather than character-bound, especially during peak emotional beats. Filter verbs and passive constructions ("lay as testament," "winds howled a dirge") dull immediacy at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose carries a lyric texture but suffers from heavy figurative density in nearly every sentence without payoff variation—"knife-edge peak," "reluctant prophecies," "auroral sorrow," "mountain grasses," "bitter berry," "stone in her gut," "lightning veins," "leaden sky," "old grief," "mournful reel." Template cadence clusters appear ("her fault-tolerant nature," "fault-tolerant oracle," "fault-tolerant words," "fault-tolerant soul"). Paraphrase loops recur: "swaying certainties" / "certainties had swayed" / "certainties forever swaying." Register drift into abstraction ("cumulative mass," "hazy symbiosis") clashes with visceral setting. These artifacts pervade the closure paragraph, triggering the artifact penalty and 9+ disqualification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The oracle-at-a-weather-station frame offers a fresh synthesis, and the botanical illustration + margin-smudging ritual is specific. However, the fault-tolerant/peripherally-aware framework remains more conceptual than causally enacted, and the cartographer plot point echoes familiar tropes of prophecy failure. The piece retreats into abstraction rather than grounding its emotional truth in irreplaceable lived detail, and prompt labels ("fault-tolerant," "peripherally aware," "swaying certainties") recur as theme statements rather than transformed dramatic elements.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's oracle role is signaled early and her choice to smudge the illustration shapes the ritual beat. However, the cartographer's fate is recounted rather than dramatized as a live decision, and her final acceptance is more stance announcement than causal pivot. Present in setup and closure, but middle involvement is reflection rather than enacted choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The botanical illustration appears early, is physically handled during the smudging ritual (middle beat), and lies altered at closure as testament to her burden. It constrains her ritual action and charges the final image. The specific detail (veins like lightning, deceptive delicacy) matters on the page and its smudged state reweights prior pristine imagery.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Swaying certainties" is named multiple times as theme but does not mechanically constrain a choice on the page. The oracle's method involves peripheral awareness, yet the swaying quality remains metaphorical rather than forcing a tactical trade-off. Present as motif, late middle development via the berry's effect, and echoed at closure, but pressure is conceptual rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Peripherally aware" is signaled early and described as her method of divination—observing edges, occupying margins. It enables her smudging ritual (middle beat) and charges the closure image. However, it never forces a visible cost or constrains a choice under pressure; it functions as trait label and thematic echo more than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The smudge action occurs mid-story as a deliberate ritual, altering the illustration permanently and embodying her reckoning. It appears in setup (preparation), is enacted in the middle beat, and the smudged page lies as testament at closure. The action is specific and irreplaceable, though the cartographer revelation—not the smudging itself—carries the emotional weight of the turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"By occupying margins" is signaled early as her method (notes in journals, whispers at trailheads) and the smudging beat literalizes it. However, the mechanics remain more told than shown; we do not see her margin-work shape a live interaction or constrain a choice under immediate pressure. Present in setup and thematically reprised at closure, but middle development is summary.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mountain weather station supplies vivid concrete detail (barometer, anemometer, kerosene lamp, frost-rimed windows) that grounds the ritual and isolation. The aurora visible through cracks charges the atmosphere and final image. The desk and illustration constrain her physical action, and the station's remoteness amplifies the cartographer's fatal departure. Present across all three gates with purposeful detail.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"After fever breaks" is anchored in the opening line and frames her return to clarity. The fever's aftermath shapes her urgency to reckon with the berry's truth. However, time does not actively tighten decisions within the scene; the three-day backstory (berry ingestion, cartographer departure) is recounted rather than tracked as a live clock. Setup clear, closure linked, but middle pressure is reflective rather than temporally driven.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation to find the weight of the swallowed truth is explicit in the opening beats and drives her ritual with the illustration. The berry's burden and the cartographer's death provide friction and cost. However, the desire is more stated than dramatized through conflicting impulses; she moves toward acceptance without visible resistance or competing want. Present in setup, developed via reflection, and resolved at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" is named in the opening line and sustained through imagery—aurora lights, mournful reel, dirge, melancholy. Tone modulates with the fever's lift and the ritual's gravity, charging the final image of the swaying dawn. The coherence is strong, though the label is repeated rather than enacted through tonal shifts under pressure, and the mood remains static across emotional beats.</comment>
