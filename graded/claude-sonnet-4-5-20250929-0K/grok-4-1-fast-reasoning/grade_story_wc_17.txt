<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and his return to the manor is causally grounded in the echoes speaking to him. Interiority is generally concrete ("thorns snagging his sleeves like desperate fingers"), though some moments drift toward stock phrasing ("Heart pounding"). The final choice to sketch atonement feels somewhat unmotivated by prior on-page struggle—the shift from horror to duty arrives quickly without sufficient internal friction. His embodied emotion is present but the peak transformation lacks visible cost that would elevate the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when early enough and follows a causal chain: echoes lead to passage, passage to alcove, alcove to diaries, diaries to darkroom, darkroom to revelation. The closure—Elias vowing confession and sketching atonement—lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (dismantling family legacy). However, the final beat's cost is more asserted than dramatized; "burden lightened, transmuted into duty" reads as summary rather than a visible forfeiture or act that forecloses a path. One meaningful tightening is present (discovery narrows his understanding and forces a stance), satisfying the lens, but the ending could charge harder.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage, humid air, and soot-blackened fireplace are vivid and purposeful. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's cartographic attention ("low, mournful hum," "scent of charred paper"). The passage constrains his movement and the darkroom's "slivers of light piercing cracks" charges the revelation beat. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from passage to alcove to darkroom could be tighter. The climate-shifted verdant ruin anchors tone and thematic guilt effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the family secret and deciding what to do with it—is signaled early and tightens through discovery. The revelation (ancestors engineered quakes) raises moral cost and Elias's decision to voice the truth rather than destroy evidence is a meaningful turn. However, the escalation is largely through information gain rather than a choice under competing pressures; the vines "reclaiming" and "judging" feel more symbolic than a concrete obstacle that forces a trade-off. One tightening is present, but the cost at closure is more conceptual than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—legacy's burden and the ethics of inherited guilt—emerges organically from the discovery and Elias's choice to confess rather than conceal. The walls dreaming of betrayal is a resonant central metaphor that avoids overt statement. The final image of sketching atonement offers a non-literal answer to the question of what walls dream about, reweighting the cartographic inheritance. Elara's fevered diary line ("binds us to truths the walls dream but refuse to release") borders on thematic echo but is character-voiced and earns its place. No false-balance hedging; the ancestors are clearly culpable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited and the perceptual signature (sonic attention, echo metaphors) is consistent. However, repeated phrase structures create a template cadence: "Elias + [verb]" openings, "the + [noun]" descriptors, and filter verbs ("he found," "he glimpsed") stack in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("mournful hum," "tentative forgiveness") that feels imposed rather than character-emergent. No head-hopping, and the voice is generally coherent, but the line-level uniformity and filter-stack reduce the grade and disallow 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies somewhat, but several paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "sensitively perceptive" recurs three times as a modifier without variation; "legacy's burden" is repeated verbatim across beats; and runs of identical sentence stems ("Elias [verb]," "The [noun]") create a drumbeat. Mixed metaphor: "burden...weighed heavier than...roof tiles" clashes with "burden lightened, transmuted" at the end. The closure beat itself ("sketching—not corridors, but atonement") is clean, so capping at the Non-closure Accumulation level. Information density is generally good, but the artifacts and loops prevent higher scoring and disallow 9+ globally per the filter-stack and template-cadence rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—echo cartography mapping guilt encoded in architecture—offers a fresh synthesis of haunted-house and climate-ruin tropes. The emotional arc (discovery to confession) is earnest but the transformation test is borderline: swap "echo cartographer" for "historian" and the core still functions. The specific details (film developed in echo, walls dreaming of seismic sorrow) are memorable, and the stakes (inherited complicity in engineered disaster) avoid cliché. However, the final turn (sketching atonement) feels slightly generic as a resolution. No close echoes of famous works, and the piece commits to its premise, landing it in the solid-to-strong band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his cartographic skill (listening to echoes) drives the middle discovery beats and the darkroom method. His choices—to follow the draft, sift the diaries, trace Elara's maps, use echo to develop the film, and finally vow to voice the truth—create key turns. The character is seeded early, used in multiple beats (alcove, darkroom, final vow), and shapes the ending. Solid integration across setup, development, and payoff, with causal pressure and closure linkage present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The film negative strip appears in the darkroom beat, is held and "developed" via echo in a pivotal moment, and is pocketed at the end as proof. It appears in three distinct beats (discovery, development, exit) and its unique property (latent images revealed by echo) is irreplaceable. The strip's content (proof of ancestors' crimes) drives the final decision. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, with visible cost (carrying the evidence into the open).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Legacy's burden is named early, threaded through Elara's diary ("binds us to truths"), and directly shapes Elias's final choice: whether to destroy or confess. The concept constrains his options (cannot ignore the discovery) and the ending explicitly reweights it ("burden lightened, transmuted into duty"). Present in setup, middle reflection, and ending; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. The specificity (inherited complicity in engineered disaster) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" is stated three times but functions mostly as a descriptor rather than a constraint. It enables his echo-listening and sifting the diaries, but no visible trade-off or cost is shown—there's no moment where heightened sensitivity harms him or forces a difficult choice. Present in setup and middle, but ornamental rather than causal. Reaches mid-band for functional presence but not higher due to lack of cost or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glimpse (vision of ancestors' betrayal revealed through the film) is the story's hinge: it redefines Elias's understanding, shifts the stake from curiosity to moral reckoning, and drives the final vow. Seeded through Elara's warning, executed in the darkroom beat, and its content shapes the ending. Strong causal pressure, irreplaceable (no other action delivers the revelation), and closure-linked. All three gates present with high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries are discovered in the alcove, pieced together to reveal Elara's expedition, and carry the key clue (develop in echo) that enables the darkroom success. They appear in two beats (alcove discovery, map-tracing) and are clutched in Elias's hand at the end. The method (reading burned fragments) is signaled early, constrains the middle search, and contributes to closure. Solid beat involvement and causal linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is the physical threshold Elias crosses to reach the alcove and darkroom, and it "tightens" as he intrudes, adding atmospheric pressure. It recurs at the end ("stumbling back through") with reweighted meaning (nature judging the Voss sins). Present in setup, middle, and ending; the passage shapes access and charges the final exit. Good closure participation and a lyric reprise that reweights the stake, lifting it above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The climate-shift timeframe is established early ("relentless heat had unleashed vines") and provides the verdant-tomb setting that enables the manor's decay and the ivy's symbolic reclamation. However, it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock—Elias's exploration unfolds without time pressure. Present in setup and ending image (sky "bruised perpetual green"), but mostly atmospheric rather than causal. Functional but replaceable; a different disaster would work with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motivation (discover what walls dream about) is seeded early (grandfather's obsession, echoes in Elias's sleep), drives his return to the manor, and shapes every beat (following the hum, interpreting the diaries, using echo to develop the film). Friction is present: the revelation shatters the family legacy and forces a choice between concealment and confession. The ending reweights the motivation from curiosity to moral duty. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage with visible cost.</comment>
