<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared early (preserve forgotten names, atone for losing Lirien) but her interiority relies heavily on label-speak: "foxglove regret," "toxic bloom of remorse," "poisonous bloom of sorrowful purpose." These phrases recur as summary rather than embodied contradiction. The final beat offers no visible trade-off or renunciation—she completes her quest, the tube shatters, and she kneels amid success with "foxglove tears," which reads as performed emotion rather than a choice that forecloses a path. No on-page micro-choice between competing goods appears; the escalation is a tour through wings, not a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Elara moves through four museum wings in sequence, repeating the ritual (tube sings → light blooms → orchids capture names) with minor variation in each wing's extinct feeling. The pattern is taught by the second wing, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs mid-story; each wing functions identically until the tube shatters in the fourth. The closure image (Elara kneeling, names preserved, tube destroyed) offers a Conceptual Repricing—the museum is "no longer wholly deserted"—but the cost is ambiguous: she achieves her goal and the tube's destruction feels like natural exhaustion rather than a sacrifice or trade-off that forecloses a path. Orientation is clear (opal library, Elara, glass orchids) within the opening lines, so no penalty applies. The escalation curve is flat until the final wing, then resolves via external event (tube shatters) rather than protagonist agency narrowing options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The opal library above clouds is signaled early and recurs with vivid, purposeful detail: "rainbows fractured eternally through translucent walls," "iridescent winds howled against the opal panes." The winds and the tube's crack interact causally (winds rush through the fissure to birth sound), and the final line ("Above the clouds, the opal library drifted on") charges the closure image by anchoring Elara's endurance in spatial continuity. Spatial choreography across the four wings is coherent. However, the wings themselves (Wanderlust, Unbridled Laughter, Melancholy, Betrayed Trust) are described in abstract, postcard-like terms—"derelict alcoves," "faded murals," "shadowed alcoves"—without micro-setting details that constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics wing to wing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserve forgotten names before they dissolve) is signaled in paragraph five and persists throughout. However, pressure does not escalate under the Accumulative lens; each wing presents the same ritual without new obstacles or trade-offs until the tube cracks wider in the final wing. The tube's final shattering is presented as external exhaustion rather than a choice Elara makes under competing pressures. No reversal or tightening narrows her options mid-story; she completes her quest in all four wings, and the "cost" (tube destruction, Lirien's name faintly captured) arrives after success rather than forcing a renunciation or stance crystallization. The price is told ("foxglove tears") but not dramatized as a choice that forecloses a live alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (preservation against oblivion, regret as toxic beauty) emerges through the foxglove motif and the glass orchids' function as memory-vessels. The tube's destruction at closure offers a Conceptual Repricing: the act of preservation carries inevitable loss. However, "foxglove regret" is stated five times without evolving; the final image recycles the motif ("foxglove tears," "bittersweet bloom enduring") rather than reweighting it through a non-obvious particular. The extinct feelings (Wanderlust, Laughter, Melancholy, Betrayed Trust) function as thematic labels rather than dramatized pressures that force Elara to choose which names to save or which wing to abandon. Lirien's name appears "faintly, like a ghost" in the final wing, but this beat is summary rather than a scene choice that tests Elara's hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in Elara's perception. Diction is elevated and purposeful ("foxglove regret," "opal library suspended above the roiling clouds"), creating a distinct lyric texture. However, register drifts into ornamental phrasing under pressure: "gently systematic precision," "deserted marvels," "ethereal method," and "poisonous bloom of sorrowful purpose" recur as template anchors rather than voice-specific modulation. Sentence stems repeat: "Elara lifted," "Elara repeated," "Elara sank," "Elara's heart." The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the ending beat, flattening voice at closure. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the lexicon leans toward aesthetic decoration over character-particular perception under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Ornamental phrasing pervades the text: "gently systematic" (used three times), "deserted marvels" (twice), "foxglove regret" (five times), "by the echo of a long-forgotten song" (three times as a formulaic anchor). These phrases function as template stems rather than varied specificity. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraph 12 ("The cracked bamboo tube sang again, its echo weaving…") and paragraph 13 ("Light flared gently systematic from the fissure…") restate the ritual described in paragraphs 11–12 with synonym churn ("sang" / "echo," "light bloomed" / "light flared"). The final two paragraphs summarize the closure ("In preserving the forgotten names, she had lit a path through her own regret") rather than dramatizing it through concrete image or action. Sentence openings across the four-wing sequence follow identical structure: "That night, as she traversed… she held the tube aloft" / "Pressing onward… Elara repeated her ritual" / "Deeper she ventured… the tube channeled light once more." Template cadence across three or more beats triggers the Q7 artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The premise (caretaker preserving extinct emotions in glass orchids via a cracked wind chime) synthesizes fresh elements. However, the execution follows a repetitive tour structure without unexpected turns: Elara visits four wings, performs the same ritual in each, and succeeds until the tube breaks. The foxglove motif and "deserted marvels" phrase recur without transformation. The four extinct feelings (Wanderlust, Laughter, Melancholy, Betrayed Trust) are named but not dramatized as distinct pressures; they serve as interchangeable backdrops. The closure—Elara kneeling with the tube shattered and names preserved—echoes familiar sacrifice-through-creation templates without a non-obvious inflection. The Lirien reveal in the final wing adds emotional specificity but arrives late and is summary rather than a scene choice that reweights prior material.</comment>
