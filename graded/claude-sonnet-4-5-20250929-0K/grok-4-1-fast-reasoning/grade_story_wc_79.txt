<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's "quietly driven" motivation is asserted repeatedly but rarely dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied cost. Her choice to blow the whistle reads as mechanically advancing plot rather than emerging from internal conflict—no visible struggle between caution and obsession. The ending's tumble and realization summarize consequences without showing a foreclosed path or micro-choice with felt weight. Interiority leans on label-like phrasing ("quietly driven," "dread pooling like sweat") instead of character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who, where, when anchor after ~200 words of atmospheric setup, creating initial fog that never fully pays off (−0.3). The causal chain from whistle-use to shell-crack to visions is present but abrupt; the crack appears as convenient punishment rather than an earned reversal rooted in prior choice. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing (expedition's fate mirrored, watchers revealed as bound to turtles), but the final image ("smiling faintly") asserts menace without on-page cost that alters Elara's options—she staggers away with knowledge, not a foreclosed path or visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city is vividly rendered with specific detail (spiral grooves "deep as her arm," phosphorescent brine, bridges swaying). The shell's physical crack constrains the climax and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate's micro-setting test. Spatial choreography (workshop atop central shell, climb to scarred rim) remains clear throughout. Sensory detail occasionally tilts decorative ("sunlight poured...like molten gold") but mostly serves pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering the watchers' role in the lost expedition) is signaled early and sustained. The whistle-sequence constitutes one meaningful tightening when the shell cracks, narrowing Elara's options. However, escalation is abrupt—no prior micro-reversal or cost that shapes her tactics before the climactic attempt. The ending asserts doom ("city's fate cracked open") without showing a trade-off Elara made on the page; the crack happens to her rather than through a choice with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of forbidden knowledge and the cost of probing ancient powers emerges through image and pattern. The final crack and vision offer a non-literal answer to the central question (watchers bound to turtles, expedition's hubris mirrored). Yet the closing line's overt phrasing ("quietly driven motives yielding to sunwashed dread's inexorable tide") edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image resonate alone. No epiphany is thrust upon Elara; the piece earns resonance through concreteness, though the last sentence hedges with prompt-echo language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with consistent interiority. Perceptual signature is present but blurred by elevated diction ("inscribed with pattern languages," "dooming Tortuga Spire to drift faster toward the horizon") that reads more authorial than character-bound under pressure. The prose modulates with emotional intensity, yet some phrasings ("her quietly driven nature a silent storm amid the sunwashed haze") import workshop idiom rather than Elara's lived voice. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally maintained, but the piece carries pervasive figurative density without pattern-teaching: "molten gold," "silent storm," "dread pooling like sweat," "ripples and faded signals on the waves," "accusing fingers," "notes curling like smoke." In the climactic beats, metaphor stacks ("sunwashed dread crested," "visions flooded," "dooming...to drift faster") obscure immediate causality and flatten propulsion (−0.7). Paraphrase loops appear: "quietly driven" recurs four times across the text, and "sunwashed dread" is invoked thrice without reweighting (−0.4). Template stems ("Elara [verb]" opening multiple paragraphs) and filter-verb stacks ("she believed," "she ignored," "she perched," "she blew") dull immediacy in peak beats (−0.5). Combined artifact spread touching closure disallows 9+ globally and applies cap at 8.7 per high-band entry gate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The turtle-city and pattern-language premise offer fresh specificity, avoiding generic fantasy tropes. The spiral-shell cartographer role and reed whistle method feel purposefully integrated rather than ornamental. However, the core emotional arc—obsessive seeker cracks forbidden seal, unleashes doom—follows a familiar template without a non-obvious moral calculus or transformation through lived detail. The watchers' reveal (bound to turtles, silent as warning) arrives late and is summarized rather than discovered through choice. Risk-taking in structure is minimal; the piece plays safe within its chosen mode.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara frames the narrative, appears in every beat, and her whistle-use drives the climactic crack. Setup is immediate (cartographer tracing patterns), middle shows her decoding spirals and ignoring the council, and closure hinges on her questioning. However, her choices feel mechanically plotted—she proceeds without visible cost or friction until the crack happens to her. The tumble and realization are reactive, not decisions. Two gates met strongly (setup, payoff), middle involvement is present but lacks causal pressure. Swappable with another obsessive scholar archetype with minor edits (−0.5). Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure (weak) +0.3, swappability −0.5 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The reed whistle is introduced early (workshop scene), used actively in the climactic beat (blowing sequences, modulating spirals), and held silently at the end, marking Elara's failure. Three distinct beats: workshop mention, climb preparation, whistle-sequence, and silent grip at closure. Its sonic function (pattern-language key) is specific and irreplaceable. However, it does not evolve or acquire reweighted meaning—it performs its function once and then goes inert. No visible cost tied to its use beyond the general crack. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure presence +0.9, specificity +0.5, late-middle first active use −0.2, no cost linkage −0.2 = ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The lost expedition (Captain Lirra's crew) is seeded early, motivates Elara's obsession, and the climactic visions reveal their fate. Setup and payoff gates met. However, the expedition itself never constrains a present choice or shapes tactics—it remains narrative backstory that Elara pursues rather than a force altering her options. The visions answer her question but do not impose cost or narrow her path on the page. Score: early signal +0.5, two beats (backstory, visions) +0.9, closure linkage (weak) +0.4, summary-only −0.6 = ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is asserted four times ("quietly driven nature," "quietly driven, she ignored," "quietly driven motives") but never constrains a choice with visible cost. It functions as a label rather than a trait that enables or limits action under pressure. No on-page tradeoff shows Elara choosing persistence over safety, health, or relationship. Summary-only and label-only use. Score: three mentions +1.4, label-only −0.6, no cost −0.5, ornamental −0.7, late payoff (final sentence recaps) −0.5 = ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The crack is the story's hinge: it splits the shell, spews visions, shifts the turtles, and crystallizes Elara's failure. Setup (prior tremor rusted the gate), middle (Elara's questioning risks repeating the expedition's mistake), and closure (crack widens, visions flood, watchers sharpen). The action is irreplaceable—removing it collapses the ending. Visible cost (city doomed to drift, Elara tumbles, whistle silenced). Score: early setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure decisive +1.5, specificity +0.6, cost +0.5, first active appearance at 75% −0.6 = ~8.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Pattern languages are seeded early (spiral glyphs encoding memories), guide Elara's method (sonic sequences mimicking spirals), and enable the climactic whistle-use. Three gates met. However, the mechanics remain vague—how do spirals translate to trills and bursts? The method shapes Elara's attempt but does not alter her tactics when resistance appears; she blows once and the shell responds immediately. No learning curve or cost tied to mastery. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +0.9, mechanics vague −0.5, no failed attempt −0.5 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city is introduced in the opening line, provides the spiral grooves Elara decodes, supplies the crack's physical consequence (bridges sway, city shifts), and appears in the final image (drifting faster toward horizon). The shell constrains Elara's method (she must climb to the vortex of grooves) and the crack alters the city's fate. Four beats, strong causal pressure, closure-active. Score: early signal +0.8, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, cost +0.4 = ~7.6 (cap at 8.4 per rubric; actual falls below).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The rusted gate is introduced early (sealing supplies, trapping the city) and frames the timeframe. However, the gate itself does not impose a ticking clock—Elara's investigation proceeds at her chosen pace with no visible deadline or escalating scarcity. The gate is a static past event rather than a live constraint. Middle development is weak; closure does not hinge on the gate's timing. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats (backstory, implied consequence) +0.9, no live clock −0.8, summary-only −0.4, causal pressure (weak) +0.3, closure linkage (tangential) +0.2 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara's desire to question the watchers is stated early, drives her whistle-use, and the climactic visions answer her question. Three gates met. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—no on-page moment shows Elara wrestling with the cost of persistence versus safety. Her questions to the shell read as straightforward interrogation without friction between curiosity and fear. The ending reveals the watchers' nature but does not show Elara choosing between competing wants. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +1.0, dramatized friction (weak) +0.3, told-only −0.6, no visible tradeoff −0.6 = ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Sunwashed dread" is invoked by name three times and rendered through image (relentless glare masking dread, sun's pounding weight, dread cresting). The tone is coherent across beats and modulates with pressure—brightening sun accompanies rising dread, and the final "unrelenting sun" frames the watchers' menace. The overt label ("sunwashed dread") in the final sentence edges toward announcement, but the atmospheric work throughout supports it. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, modulation with pressure +0.8, closure charge +1.0, label repetition −0.4, final-line echo −0.3 = ~7.2.</comment>
