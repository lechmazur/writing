<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to find Mira drives the trek, but interiority leans heavily on poetic label-speak ("wild hush," "tinted revelations") rather than embodied contradiction. The reunion reveals Mira's transformation, yet her survival and role shift arrive through exposition rather than choices under pressure. The leaf functions as talisman but doesn't force a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. Elias's shift from body-hunter to life-hunter is declared rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: riddle → trek → reunion layered with recurring motifs (leaf, cylinder, "wild hush"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (shared life-hunting stance replaces solitary retirement), but the cost is asserted ("tinted yet true," "flawed") rather than shown in a decisive forfeiture or tactical constraint. The riddle's solution and Mira's survival feel convenient—her location and survival mechanism are told, not discovered through dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Scrapyard details (fuselage shack, rad-scorched suns, bone-piles, catwalks over rifts) are vivid and POV-filtered through Elias's bloodhound senses. The wasteland supplies spatial pressure (the rift crossing) but doesn't constrain a mid-trek choice or alter tactics. The phonograph cylinder and leaf are handled across beats, anchoring micro-setting effectively. Sensory hierarchy (nose to decay, wax warmth) reflects Elias's profession and charges the final walk, lifting the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate distance into closeness) is signaled early and drives the trek. One meaningful tightening occurs when the riddle solution points to Mira's location. However, the trek itself faces no reversal or tactical complication—Elias walks, finds her, and accepts her changed state without visible forfeit of an alternative path. The reunion offers emotional closure but no on-page price that narrows future options; "no more distance" declares resolution rather than dramatizing what was sacrificed to achieve it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of preservation vs. transformation emerges through the wax leaf, riddle grooves, and Mira's shift from survivor to body-hunter. "Tinted revelations" recurs but risks becoming a prompt echo rather than earned subtext. The ending offers a non-literal answer (mending through shared hunting rather than recovery of the past) and resists moralizing. The leaf's "lie-tint" insight and acceptance of "flawed closeness" add complexity, but the final lines ("Just them, spanning cracks eternal") veer toward thematic summary rather than image-driven resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias. However, diction drifts into poetic abstraction ("wild hush," "intuitively descriptive," "tinted") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Dialogue (Harlan, Mira) is brief and functional but lacks distinct idiom—Harlan's "Folks whisper" and Mira's "Tinted revelations, love" sound equally elevated. The prose substitutes lyric register for perceptual signature; under peak stress (the reunion), syntax doesn't compress or shift to reflect urgency. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he felt") are minimal, a strength, but voice reads as authorial rather than Elias-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Figurative density is extreme and uniform: "wild hush" appears nine times, "tinted" eight, "intuitively descriptive" thrice—pattern-taught but overworked, dulling impact. Runs of identical syntactic stems ("He [verb], noun [verb]") and paraphrase loops ("distance alchemized to pulse-sync" after "translate distance into closeness") create scaffold drag. Mixed metaphors: "breath a dry gale," "settlement's core hush," "moth-eaten memories" lack coherent vehicle logic. Template cadence in the final third (micro-paragraphs of 1–2 lines, each echoing "wild hush" or "tinted") flattens propulsion. Applying overwriting and loop penalties: −0.8 for density without payoff, −0.6 for paraphrase cycles, −0.4 for template cadence touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic riddle-quest and preserved-object motifs are familiar, but the phonograph-cylinder cipher and bloodhound-to-life-hunter arc offer a specific synthesis. The wax leaf and grooved text integrate scrapyard materiality with the closeness theme. However, the riddle's answer and Mira's survival mechanism feel predetermined rather than earned through character friction, reducing ingenuity. The "wild hush" refrain and "tinted revelations" risk prompt-echo rather than organic discovery. Risk-taking in structure (mosaic-style beats, lyric compression) is present but not bold enough to elevate past mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's bloodhound background is signaled early (finding bodies, nose to decay) and his retirement frames the inciting choice to trek. His decision to cross the rift and later shift to "hunting life" with Mira closes the arc. However, the bloodhound skill constrains no mid-trek choice—he walks through rad-mirages and bone-piles without tactical friction. The trait appears in description and backstory more than in on-page action under pressure. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) with weak middle development caps eligibility near 6.0; lack of causal pressure during the trek and swappability (any tracker role would serve) lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leaf appears in five beats: Elias clutching it (intro), pulsing warm during riddle-solving, preserved fall metaphor, Mira's amber eyes echoing it, pocketed at closure with "eternal fall preserved." It seeds the riddle's answer (preserves the fall, frozen glow) and bridges distance-to-closeness thematically. However, it doesn't constrain a choice or shift tactics—Elias never risks losing it or uses it instrumentally. Three-gate presence (setup, middle symbolic work, closure reprise) with thematic charge but no causal pressure: eligible above 6.0, lifted by closure linkage and specificity, capped by lack of visible cost tied to the object itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Tinted revelations" appears as phrase and concept (Mira's tinted truth, leaf's lie-tint, riddle's lens). It frames the theme but doesn't alter on-page tactics—Elias solves the riddle and accepts Mira's changed state without the concept forcing a trade-off. The term recurs in dialogue and narration, taught early, but remains thematic overlay rather than stake-shaping constraint. Two-gate presence (setup, closure echo) with ornamental middle use: eligible to ~6.0, lowered by swappability (any "partial truth" concept would serve) and lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" is applied twice to Elias's reading of the cylinder grooves and once to his perception of Mira. It labels his skill but doesn't constrain a choice or impose a cost—he decodes the riddle without friction or error. The attribute could be replaced with "perceptive" or "experienced" with no structural change. Label-only use without dramatized tradeoff trends low; late-middle introduction (first substantive use at the riddle beat, ~30% in) and ornamental function cap below 4.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The riddle appears at ~20%, drives Elias's解 solution and decision to trek, and its answer (the leaf) bridges to Mira's location. It creates one major turn (inciting journey) and is referenced at closure when Mira hands him a new cylinder "to unravel." Three-gate presence with causal pressure on the inciting choice. However, the riddle's solution feels convenient—Elias intuits the answer immediately without trial-and-error, reducing cost. Specificity (cylinder grooves, candlelight reading) and closure callback lift the score; lack of struggle during solving and swappability (any clue mechanism) prevent higher band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Method introduced early (Harlan's explanation ~15%) and demonstrated when Elias tilts the cylinder under lantern light to read micro-script. It enables the riddle solution (first cylinder) and recurs at closure (second cylinder). Two-beat use with clear mechanics and early signal. However, the reading itself faces no difficulty—"words bloomed intuitive"—so the method doesn't impose cost or shape tactics beyond unlocking information. Three-gate presence with functional causal role but no friction: eligible above 6.0, capped by ease of execution and swappability (any hidden-text method would serve).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Scrapyard frames the entire piece: shack, rift, catwalks, settlement lights. The cracked wasteland provides spatial pressure (the trek, rift crossing) and supplies the riddle's answer (cracks as eternal falls). The setting enables Elias's bloodhound skills (nose to decay, rad-scorched terrain) and charges the closure image (walking catwalks, spanning cracks). Three-gate presence with causal and thematic integration. The rift constrains the reunion beat (they meet at its lip) and the scrapyard's micro-objects (fuselage, hulks) anchor multiple beats. Specificity and closure charge place this in the 7+ band; lack of a mid-trek environmental complication that alters tactics prevents 8+.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Post-war timeframe anchors the world (resource barons, rad-scorched suns, bunker vaults) and motivates Mira's disappearance ("when the barons unleashed their final salvos"). However, it doesn't tighten a present decision or impose urgency—Elias treks at his own pace with no clock pressure. The timeframe is static backdrop rather than live constraint. Setup and thematic presence with no middle or closure pressure: functional but replaceable, trending mid-band. Lack of tactical consequence (no decay clock, no pursuit) caps below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation stated early ("translate distance into closeness") and drives every major beat: clutching the leaf, solving the riddle, trekking the wasteland, reunion. The desire is dramatized in micro-choices (pacing the shack, packing kit, closing the gap at the rift). Friction appears when closeness proves "flawed" (Mira changed, leaf a "lie-tint"), and the ending reconfigures the want (shared life-hunting rather than recovery). Three-gate presence with visible struggle and cost at closure. However, the cost is told ("tinted yet true") more than shown in a forfeited alternative. Strong causal role and closure linkage lift the score into mid-7 range; lack of on-page sacrifice (what does Elias give up to stay?) caps below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Wild hush" appears nine times (wind-whispers, twilight, riddle logic, dawn crack, Mira's voice, final walk) as recurring phrase and mood marker. It anchors tone coherently but becomes repetitive without modulation—crisis beats carry the same lyric register as calm ones. The phrase charges some images (twilight scavenger scene, final "wild hush enveloped them") but also dulls through overuse. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) with pervasive middle echo; tone is consistent but static, not responsive to pressure shifts. Overreliance on a single phrase and lack of tonal escalation under stress lower the score; closure callback provides modest lift.</comment>
