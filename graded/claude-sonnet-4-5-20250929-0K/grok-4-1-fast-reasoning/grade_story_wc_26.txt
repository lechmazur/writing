<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve hope's shape is established, but her interior life collapses into label-heavy abstractions ("luminous regret," "hope's shape") without embodied contradiction or visible micro-choices under pressure. The metamorphosis reads as summary declaration rather than dramatized struggle; we are told she "resolved to act" and "felt the pull" without witnessing genuine internal conflict or a hierarchy of values tested on the page. The stone-ritual sequence advances via passive transformation rather than active decision-making that forecloses competing paths with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are present early (library above clouds, dusk, Elara's role). The piece follows a causal arc: shadow corruption discovered → stone ritual initiated → metamorphosis enacted. However, the closure's cost—Elara "forever altered," mourning "human warmth"—is asserted rather than shown in a concrete final choice or image that makes the price undeniable. The metamorphosis itself is summarized ("Her form began to shift...") rather than dramatized, and the ending loops through multiple "resolved" beats without a single sharp reconfiguration that lands with felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds is vivid and purposeful, with luminous orbs, crystal panes, and "perpetual mist" creating a coherent ethereal space. The river stone anchors tactile grounding and recurs meaningfully. Spatial choreography is clear (aisles, orb clusters, nexus placement). However, the environment does not constrain a pivotal choice or pressure a tactic; Elara moves freely through the setting without friction, and the "thin, crisp air" and "clouds parting below" remain postcard details rather than forces shaping the final act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve hope's shape—is signaled early and the shadow's spread creates rising pressure. The video-comparison method provides a concrete tightening beat. Yet escalation is largely declarative: "The library trembled, petals curling inward" tells rather than shows resistance. The stone ritual resolves the problem without meaningful reversal or trade-off dramatized on the page; we learn the outcome ("orbs steadied") without witnessing Elara navigate cost in real time. Agency at closure is passive transformation rather than a decision that forecloses a live option with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of preservation versus wild potential emerges through the shadow-corruption arc, and "luminous regret" recurs as a motif. However, the final paragraphs explicitly state the thematic question ("wild potential, now leashed") and summarize the resolution ("Hope endured, shaped against oblivion") rather than allowing the reader to infer meaning from a resonant image. "She smiled faintly" and "purpose fulfilled" are sentimental closures that replace tension with tidy satisfaction. The piece leans heavily on prompt-language labels ("shape of hope," "metamorphosis," "unbound") without transforming them into lived particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance remains consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric ("softly deliberate," "luminous regret"), fitting the ethereal library setting. However, the prose often converges on a single register of poetic abstraction ("petals of memory unfurling," "hope's shape demanded preservation") that flattens emotional peaks. Elara's perceptual signature is not distinct—her way of noticing reads as generic narration rather than character-particular filtering. The video-comparison paragraph shifts to expository summary without interior coloring, and repeated stems ("The library," "Elara," "She") create rhythmic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Repeated scaffold structures dominate: "The library [verb]," "Elara [verb]," "She [verb]" appear in runs across the text. Paraphrase loops in the final third ("Hope endured, shaped against oblivion" followed by "Hope bloomed unbound no more") restate the same closure without added pressure. Figurative language is dense ("blooming," "petals," "luminous") but often decorative, with mixed metaphors (petals that unfurl vs. curling inward under stress). Stock openers ("One dusk, sharper than most") and template cadence ("Dusk settled fully. She smiled faintly. The library hummed.") accumulate into line-level drag. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence across closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise—dreams as shareable orbs, corruption via shadow—offers a fresh conceptual hook. The blooming-library-above-clouds setting is vivid and the river-stone anchor provides tactile counterweight. However, the arc follows a familiar guardian-sacrifice template without transformation: lone protector discovers threat, performs ritual, becomes eternal watcher. The "metamorphosis complete" and "legends" framing feels derivative of countless myth-echo endings. Execution leans on prompt vocabulary ("dusk noticer," "shape of hope," "softly deliberate") without synthesizing these elements into a vision that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is named and described early; her sharp-eyed vigilance is established in the opening paragraph. She activates the comparison archive (middle beat) and initiates the stone ritual (closure beat), satisfying all three gates. However, her "noticing" is passive observation until the final act, where she chants and transforms—actions that feel declarative rather than choice-driven. The trait does not constrain options or generate friction; Elara executes her plan without hesitation or visible cost tied to her sharp observation. Present across beats but largely ornamental until the ritual.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The river stone appears in paragraph 7 ("nestled in her pocket"), recurs in the middle reflection (paragraph 21: "washed ashore in her youth"), and is deployed at closure (paragraph 22: "She placed it at the nexus") where it binds the shadow and anchors Elara's transformation. Three distinct beats; early signal; closure linkage. The stone's "weight a promise" and "cracked but victorious" final state show causal pressure and a charged reprise. However, the mechanics of how the stone binds the shadow are asserted rather than dramatized, and the "primal essence" invocation reads abstract. Strong integration with minor swappability (any anchor object could serve with similar rhetoric).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The shadow unbound is introduced at paragraph 17 ("There, unbound, was a shadow—a shadow unbound"), appears in the transformation sequence (paragraph 25: "the shadow unbound writhed"), and is referenced at closure ("her shadow would dance bound"). The concept shapes the central problem and the ritual's goal. However, "shadow unbound" functions more as thematic label than dramatized force; we are told it "fed on collective fears" and "corrupted the blooms" but never see it constrain a tactic or test Elara's approach. The final reprise ("luminous echo") reweights it conceptually but the mechanics remain vague. Causal role in the premise and ending; mid-development use is summary.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" appears in paragraph 6 ("moved softly deliberate"), recurs at the metamorphosis (paragraph 27: "softly deliberate in her transformation"), and in the final patrol (paragraph 34: "resumed her softly deliberate patrol"). Three touches across setup, middle, and closure. However, the trait is used as descriptive label without constraining action or generating visible cost. We never see a moment where Elara's deliberate pace costs her speed or where softness prevents a harsher solution. The attribute characterizes her manner but does not enable or foreclose a choice. Present across beats but largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" is signaled in paragraph 23 ("initiating the metamorphosis"), drives the climax (paragraph 27: "the metamorphosis extending to her"), and frames closure (paragraph 34: "The metamorphosis complete"). The action redefines Elara's state and the library's future, forecloses her human warmth, and enables the shadow's recapture. All three gates satisfied; causal pressure at closure. The transformation is the story's central irreversible act. However, the process is summarized ("Her form began to shift, skin shimmering") rather than dramatized beat-by-beat, reducing visceral cost. Strong integration with minor execution slip.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The method is introduced and executed in paragraph 13 ("She activated the comparison archive, a method honed over years: by comparing silent video footage from decades apart"). It provides the evidence that escalates Elara's resolve (paragraphs 14–16). The method appears again in paragraph 26 ("Video comparisons looped silently behind her"). Setup and middle use satisfied; closure participation weak (the footage loops as backdrop but does not shape the ritual). The method is functional but could be replaced with any diagnostic tool (direct orb inspection, written records) without altering the arc. Mid-band for solid setup and middle use; capped by swappability and passive closure role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The blooming library above the clouds is established in the opening lines and recurs throughout (crystal panes, orbs, aisles, nexus, perpetual mist, thin air). The setting provides the orbs that contain the corrupted dreams and the spatial anchor for the ritual. It is present at closure ("In the blooming library, dreams shared on") and charges the final image with "petals unfolding to new dawns." All three gates satisfied. However, the library does not constrain Elara's tactics or supply scarce resources; she moves freely through it without friction. The ethereal environment is vivid but functions as stage rather than force. Strong presence and closure charge; lacks causal pressure on choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after dreams became shareable" is established in paragraph 4 and contextualizes the orb archive. The "post-dream era" frames the premise and the shadow's growth "since sharing began" (paragraph 19) provides causal history. The element is present at setup and informs the problem. However, the timeframe does not tighten a live decision or create urgency on the page; Elara's ritual is not time-pressured, and the "lately" corruption could have been underway for any duration without altering her response. The element is functional context but does not shape tactics or escalate pressure. Setup satisfied; development and closure participation weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to preserve the shape of hope" appears in paragraph 8 ("to preserve the shape of hope") and recurs at closure (paragraph 31: "feeling the shape of hope—preserved"). The desire drives Elara's ritual and frames her sacrifice. Setup and closure gates satisfied. However, the motivation is stated rather than dramatized in conflicted choices; we do not see Elara weigh preservation against another desire (e.g., her own safety, wild potential, individual dreamers' autonomy). The phrase "shape of hope" is repeated as thematic label without visible friction between wants and costs. Strong thematic presence; lacks on-page conflict that would elevate the score into high bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" appears in paragraph 17 ("painting the library in luminous regret"), recurs in paragraph 28 ("regret lingered in the air, luminous"), and closes the piece (paragraph 37: "Regret glowed softly"). The tone is seeded early, modulates through the transformation, and charges the final image. All three gates satisfied. The phrase itself is evocative and the interplay of luminosity and loss is purposeful. However, the tone is asserted through the repeated label rather than earned through scene texture; the regret is told ("she mourned the human warmth") without embodied hesitation or contradictory action that would make the feeling undeniable. Strong coherence and closure charge; execution leans on declaration.</comment>
