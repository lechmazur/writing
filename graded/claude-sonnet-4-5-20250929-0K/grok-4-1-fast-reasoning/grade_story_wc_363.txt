<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's core motivation is clear but her interiority drowns in abstract labels ("wistful," "latent sacrifice") rather than embodied contradiction. The pivotal sacrifice at the climax arrives through summary ("her life force dimming, body slumping") rather than a choice under pressure that reveals competing impulses. No secondary character appears to test her stance; the loom and orchard function as décor rather than crucible. The final act reads as predetermined execution of a ritual rather than a decision that forecloses a live path with visible internal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors appear late: "Deep within a bamboo forest" and "Elara, a wistful loom spinner" land by line 3, but who she is addressing and what immediate problem she faces remain vague until "One mist-shrouded morning" past the 25% mark. The story attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens (density increase toward a charged image), but causality is thin—Elara finds puzzle edges by chance, weaves without setback, and vanishes without on-page resistance or micro-turn. The closure image (bead half-buried, waiting) gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is asserted ("her life force dimming") rather than dramatized in a visible forfeiture or renunciation. Apply Orientation Test penalty −0.4 and cap Q3 at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The orchard and bamboo forest are introduced with vivid sensory detail ("emerald stalks clattered," "rotted sweetly"), but spatial choreography is vague—where the loom sits relative to the crate, how far the orchard extends. The puzzle edges and amber bead anchor micro-setting, yet neither constrains a choice; Elara simply strings the edges and embeds the bead without friction. The final image (bead half-buried) attempts to charge closure but lacks prior spatial setup that would make its position meaningful. Orientation debt from Q2 caps this category at 7.0 per the Orientation Test consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—delivering a message across impossible distance—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Elara's weaving proceeds without reversal: she finds the edges, strings them, embeds the bead, completes the rite, and the tapestry departs. No visible cost shapes tactics; her "latent sacrifice" is told in summary ("her life force dimming") rather than shown as a trade-off that narrows options. The receiver's hand-to-chest warmth is a micro-turn without on-page consequence. One meaningful tightening is absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of connection across unbridgeable distance emerges from the premise but remains abstract; the tapestry's departure and the distant figure's warmth gesture toward reunion without dramatizing what is gained or lost in concrete terms. The final image (bead waiting for the next spinner) hints at a cycle but does not reweight prior material—it adds a new idea rather than repricing the message Elara sent. Subtext operates in the loom's "clack-clack hymn" and the "raveling silence," yet these motifs recur as ornament rather than constraining choice or charging the climax with non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, but the narrative voice leans heavily on elevated, abstract diction ("wistful," "stoically sparkling," "latent sacrifice") that distances the reader from Elara's lived experience. Perceptual signature is generic—"fingers tracing patterns born of longing"—rather than idiosyncratic. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance never modulates; the prose maintains a uniform lyric register through discovery, weaving, and death, flattening emotional progression. Register drift into poetic abstraction ("the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" repeated thrice) reads as template cadence rather than voice-motivated compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Severe patterned artifacts: "the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" appears three times, "raveling silence" / "raveled" / "raveling" five times, and "stoically sparkling" three times without evolving function—textbook loops that dull the closure image. Template cadence runs through the middle third: "She carried… She strung… She wove… She recommenced…" Figurative density is high but incoherent: "rotted sweetly" (olfactory contradiction), "silence… stoically sparkling" (mixed sense metaphor), "threads loosening like whispers dying on the wind" (stacked simile obscuring the tenor). Paraphrase loops cluster in paragraphs 6–7 (puzzle edges as keys to patterns, then edges forming a border). Apply −1.4 baseline in Q7 for pervasive artifacts; escalate to −1.7 because loops touch the closure beat ("raveling silence deepened," "silence fully raveled"). Disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact penalty pack. Additionally, filter-verb stack in final third ("felt her essence fray," "absorbed her woven plea") adds −0.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The premise—weaver sends message via magical tapestry—is a familiar motif in secondary-world fantasy, executed here without fresh transformation. Jigsaw puzzle edges as structural scaffold is a specific touch, yet their function (framing chaos into coherence) is explained rather than demonstrated through resistance or cost. The orchard-in-bamboo setting and the amber bead offer vivid images but do not surprise; the emotional arc (solitary sacrifice for distant reunion) follows a well-worn template. No turn feels inevitable in hindsight because causality is loose; Elara's success depends on finding the right objects by chance rather than character-driven ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her motivation (carry a message) is clear, but she makes no on-page choice that alters tactics. She discovers, retrieves, weaves, and dies in a linear sequence without internal conflict or reversal. Her "wistfulness" is label-only; no contradictory impulse complicates the sacrifice. The final act (pouring life force into the bead) is summarized rather than dramatized as a decision under pressure. Swappable with any solitary craftsperson. Cap at 3.8 per swappability; deduct −0.3 for label-only trait ("wistful") and −0.3 for summary-only climax = 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The amber bead appears in paragraph 7 (setup), is described as a relic with "stoically sparkling" light, then embedded in the tapestry at the climax (payoff), and returns in the final line half-buried. Four distinct beats. However, its properties (captured light, stoic defiance) do not constrain Elara's choices; she uses it as a vessel without friction or cost tied to its specific nature. The final image reweights it slightly (waiting for the next spinner) but does not depend on prior causal work. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development is decorative. Base ~5.5 for two gates + lyric reprise; +0.4 for beat involvement (four touches across paragraphs 7, 27, 39) = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Raveling silence" is mentioned five times as atmosphere (paragraphs 6, 12, 22, 31) but never shapes a choice or tactic. It deepens as backdrop ("orchard shadows lengthening") yet Elara's weaving proceeds unaffected. No gate met: it is absent from setup (first third), does not constrain middle action, and at closure "silence fully raveled" is assertion rather than visible reweighting. Present but ornamental. Deduct −0.5 for ornamental use and −0.3 for label-only theme claim = cap at 2.9; round to 2.4 for pervasive mention without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Stoically sparkling" describes the amber bead three times (paragraphs 7, 27, 39) but the trait itself—stoic endurance—does not enable or constrain action. The bead's glow is static décor; no tradeoff or visible cost links to its "defiance against oblivion." Label-only. Deduct −0.5 ornamental, −0.3 label-only = cap 2.2; no beats where the attribute alters tactics = 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Recommence" appears once in paragraph 26 ("She recommenced the ancient rite") at the climax, signaling the weaving's final push. It frames the peak action but arrives late (final third) and is not seeded earlier; the term could be replaced with "completed" or "intensified" without structural loss. The action itself (weaving with frenzy) is summarized rather than dramatized in steps. Late arrival −0.6, summary-only −0.3, swappability −0.4 = base 4.7; closure linkage +0.7 = 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Jigsaw puzzle edges found in a rummage sale box appear in paragraph 17 (past 25% mark but within the middle third). Their mechanics—"keys to recommence broken patterns, framing chaos into coherence"—are explained in paragraph 18, then Elara strings them along the loom in paragraph 20. Two beats: discovery and use. However, the edges do not resist or fail; they simply hold the tapestry taut without friction. Setup gate missed (late intro −0.5), development gate met (middle use), payoff gate met (edges lock firm at climax). Two gates = eligible to ~6.0; late intro −0.5, swappability (any frame device) −0.4, causal pressure weak +0.3 = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The forgotten orchard and bamboo forest are introduced in paragraph 1 (setup gate met) and recur as backdrop (paragraphs 9, 31, 34). Spatial details—gnarled trees, vines, fallen apples—are vivid but do not pressure Elara's choices. The crate at the orchard's edge (paragraph 17) supplies the puzzle edges, a weak causal link. The final image (bead half-buried in earth) uses the orchard minimally. Setup met, middle and payoff decorative. Base ~4.5 for setup + weak middle link; postcard description −0.5, no closure pressure +0.3 = 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"The hush of time's unraveling tapestry" recurs three times (paragraphs 4, 9, 26) as poetic timeframe but does not impose a deadline or alter Elara's tactics. "Days blurred" (paragraph 9) summarizes duration without urgency. The climax unfolds in real-time ("as warp met weft") but no clock tightens decisions. Timeframe is present as theme, not constraint. Ornamental −0.5, label-only −0.3, no middle development −0.2 = cap 3.0; lyric reprise (three mentions) +0.6 = 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to carry a message across impossible distance—is stated in paragraph 5 (setup gate met) and drives her actions throughout: scavenging materials, weaving the tapestry, embedding the bead. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in friction; no competing desire or cost complicates her resolve until the final summary ("her life force dimming"). The distant lover is a shadow; no on-page memory or doubt tests her commitment. Setup met, middle pursuit functional but frictionless, payoff (tapestry departs) lands. Base ~5.5 for three gates; told-only interiority −0.3, functional pursuit +0.5 = 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Latent sacrifice" is named in paragraphs 5, 11, 25 and realized at the climax when Elara "poured her wistful core… her life force dimming" (paragraph 29). The tone is consistent—elegiac, muted—but does not modulate with pressure; discovery, weaving, and death all carry the same lyric distance. The final image (bead waiting) shifts slightly toward hope but the tonal charge is weak. Setup met (early mention), development repeats without evolution, payoff asserts rather than earns. Three gates met but static mood; base ~5.0, single mood −0.4 = 4.6.</comment>
