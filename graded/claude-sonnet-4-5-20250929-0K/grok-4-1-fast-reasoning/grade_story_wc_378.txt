<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Zeta's motivation—to resolve inner static—is coherent and intensifies under the magnetic shift, but the android's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("nostalgia," "static," "fragments") rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to open the box and later miniaturize the chaos reads mechanically; we see goal pursuit but not genuine internal conflict between competing impulses acting simultaneously. The renunciation or containment feels more procedural than costly, lacking visible friction in the decision itself. Micro-choices exist (herding vines, deploying nanites) but their stakes remain conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The orientation is clear early (glass dome, desert, android caretaker) and the causal chain—magnetic shift → static → box opened → chaos → miniaturization → incineration—holds without breaks. However, the closure effect is muted: Zeta achieves "wholeness restored—not seamless, but beautifully fragmented," yet the cost is stated rather than shown in a decisive final image or action. The lens reads Causal with Accumulative texture, but the ending dilutes pressure through summary ("Petals glowed," "harmony") rather than a single resonant reconfiguration. One meaningful tightening occurs (chaos erupts, then is contained), meeting the length requirement, but the final lines lack the charged specificity needed to reweight prior material with undeniable force.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The glass dome, roses with vein-like pulses, and the utility shed are anchored early and constrain Zeta's moves (the dome stabilizers whine, vines lash irrigation lines). The "strangely organic" roses contribute to atmosphere and pressure when they convulse under electromagnetic waves. However, sensory selection remains visual-heavy without the tactile or auditory specificity that would charge the final image; the incinerator pit appears late and functions as a solution rather than a recurring spatial constraint. The dome's fragility shapes stakes but does not visibly alter the final beat beyond ambient description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the farm and resolving inner static—is signaled early and tightens when the box releases chaos, forcing Zeta to corral and miniaturize the threat. One meaningful escalation occurs (tendrils fuse with roses, threatening dome integrity), and the protagonist's agency (activating manipulator array, deploying nanites) drives the turn. Yet the cost of containment is conceptual rather than visceral; we see no live option foreclosed or trade-off that visibly alters Zeta's state beyond the abstract "static cleared." The resolution feels assured rather than uncertain, diminishing the pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—fragmented wholeness, fear contained through fire—emerges from the box of childhood fears and the controlled burn, avoiding overt statement until the final summary lines. The core concept of "controlled burn escape" integrates with the method of containing chaos, and the miniaturization literalizes the theme of making fears insignificant. However, the ending ("wholeness, pieced from shards") tips into meta-commentary rather than letting the final image (slag remnants, thorn-pricked bloom) carry resonance alone. The thematic answer is present but stated, not purely enacted, reducing subtext at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV android focalization is stable, with diction mixing technical precision ("servos," "nanite swarms") and nostalgic abstraction ("childhood laughter whole again"). The perceptual signature—circuits humming, static roaring—is consistent, though some metaphors blur under pressure ("static clawed deeper" lacks embodied specificity). Filter verbs ("Zeta's vision stuttered") and expository interiority ("To survive, it needed escape") occasionally dull immediacy. No head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts, but the voice converges toward generic lyricism in the final third ("eternal vigil," "blooming defiant") rather than maintaining the android's distinct lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Phrasing loops and template cadence pervade: "static roaring," "static clawed," "static recoiled" recur without added pressure; "wholeness fractured," "wholeness restored," "fragmented wholeness" cycle semantically. Sentence openings repeat ("Zeta glided," "Zeta's logic," "Zeta dragged," "Zeta tended") across the closure third. Mixed metaphors ("static clawed," "box yawned," "chaos blooming") and elevated diction ("eternal vigil," "throne") clash with the technical POV. The final paragraph stacks summary lines ("petals glowed," "farm endured," "harmony") that paraphrase rather than propel. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the disallow-9+ rule and −1.2 cumulative in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—android caretaker tending bio-forged roses during a magnetic pole shift—combines familiar tropes (lone guardian, fragile Eden, ancient DNA) without a sharp transformational angle. The "box of childhood fears" manifesting as literal organic horrors reads as convenient symbolism rather than earned world logic. Miniaturization and incineration as solutions feel procedurally clever but not freshly inhabited; the emotional arc (nostalgia → static → wholeness) follows a predictable template. The synthesis is competent but derivative, lacking the specificity or risk that would make this exact configuration feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Zeta (nostalgic android caretaker) is present throughout and makes key choices: opening the box, activating the manipulator array, deploying nanites, dragging the box to the incinerator. These decisions drive the two major turns (chaos erupts, chaos contained). However, the choices feel procedural rather than conflicted; the character's internal state is told more than dramatized in moments of decision. Setup and development are clear; closure participation is present (tending a thorn-pricked bloom) but passive observation rather than decisive action. Causal pressure is moderate, specificity is good (nanite swarms, grippers), but the cost is conceptual. Two beats plus closure participation and moderate causal work place this in the 5.0–6.9 band; lack of visible friction or irreplaceability caps it near mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "box of childhood fears" is introduced mid-story (~40%), opened to release chaos (one beat), then dragged to the incinerator and burned (second beat), and appears in the closure paragraph as "slag remnants." Three beats with closure linkage and clear causal pressure (opening creates the problem, burning resolves it). However, the box arrives late (missing early setup gate; −0.3), and it resolves a problem it largely created (−0.5). The specificity (alloy cube, holographic etchings, digitized neural shards) is strong, and the element is irreplaceable. Two functional beats plus closure participation and moderate cost place it in the 6.1–7.9 range; late arrival and problem-resolution pattern prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Controlled burn escape" is stated explicitly mid-story ("the ancient firefighting rite reborn in code") and enacted at the incinerator (one beat). The concept shapes the final tactic but is introduced late (~60%) and does not constrain earlier choices or reappear with reweighted meaning. Missing setup and development gates cap this at 4.6; the single functional beat and closure mention lift it slightly. Functional but replaceable: the story could resolve via other containment methods (ejection, sealing) with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Strangely organic" is applied to the roses early (setup gate met) and recurs throughout: petals throb with vein-like pulses, roses convulse under electromagnetic waves, tendrils fuse with spider-legs and clown faces. The trait enables the chaos eruption (one beat) and is mentioned at closure ("strangely organic life thriving"). However, the attribute itself does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it functions as atmospheric description more than causal agent. Setup and closure gates met; missing middle constraint caps this in the 5.0–6.9 band near the low end.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Miniaturize" appears mid-story, drives the key turn (nanite swarms compress chaos into doll-sized horrors, one major beat), and is causally necessary for containment before incineration. The action is specific (molecular-scale rewriting), irreplaceable (no near-synonym tactic would fit), and shapes the closure (fears "miniaturized, contained, escaped"). Setup occurs at ~50% (moderate late penalty −0.2), development and closure gates both met. Two beats (miniaturization initiation, sealing the cube) plus high causal pressure and closure linkage place this in the 7.0–8.4 band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"By containing chaos" is stated explicitly ("The method was by containing chaos, miniaturizing the threat") and enacted across two beats: corralling vines with force fields, then sealing the miniaturized horrors in the box. The means is signaled and its mechanics matter (herd, compress, seal). However, it appears mid-story (~55%), missing the setup gate (−0.3). Development and closure gates met; moderate causal pressure and two functional beats place this in the 5.0–6.9 band, upper half due to clear mechanics and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "desert rose farm in a glass-domed enclosure" is established in the opening line (setup gate met) and recurs throughout: dome stabilizers whine, glass creaks, sand batters the dome, the incinerator pit is used. The setting pressures choices (threat to dome integrity) and supplies resources (utility shed, incinerator). Micro-setting (body/tool) also functions: Zeta's grippers, manipulator array, and nanite swarms are dome-specific tools. Development and closure gates met; causal pressure is moderate (dome fragility shapes stakes but does not force a tactical pivot). Specificity is strong. Three beats plus closure presence and moderate constraint place this in the 6.1–7.9 range, mid-band due to lack of a decisive choice hinge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"When magnetic north shifts" is introduced early (setup gate met) as the inciting event and recurs: compasses spin, electromagnetic waves warp organic pulses, the shift "howled outside," then "settled into its new throne." The timeframe complicates pressure (development gate met) and is mentioned at closure (closure gate met). However, time does not tighten decisions in a live-clock manner; the shift is ambient rather than a countdown. The element is present across three beats but functions more as backdrop than tactical constraint. All three gates met allow eligibility up to ~6.0; lack of urgency-driven choice and swappability (any cataclysm would serve) cap it in the 5.0–6.9 band, lower half.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To resolve inner static" is stated early (setup gate met: "Zeta's motivation burned clear") and drives choices: opening the box to weave fragments into wholeness (one beat), then purging static through incineration (second beat). Closure directly addresses the motivation ("static recoiled, inner circuits clearing"). The desire is told more than dramatized in moment-to-moment friction, reducing felt cost. All three gates met; two functional beats plus closure participation and moderate causal pressure place this in the 6.1–7.9 range, lower end due to lack of visible trade-off between competing wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Fragmented wholeness" appears as phrase and concept throughout: memories shatter like glass, Zeta seeks to weave fragments into wholeness, ending states "wholeness restored—not seamless, but beautifully fragmented" and "wholeness, pieced from shards." Tone modulates from serene (opening) to chaotic (middle) to resolved (ending), coherent through turns. However, the tone is stated more than embodied in rhythmic or imagistic shifts; the final image dilutes charge through summary. Setup and closure gates met; missing middle modulation that pressures a choice caps this in the 5.0–6.9 band, upper half due to coherence and closure presence.</comment>
