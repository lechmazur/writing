<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and particular ("walls lined with salvaged oddities," the ritual of carving driftwood), but the borrowed-memory mechanism arrives without establishing his baseline perceptual signature. The stranger remains a cipher whose motivations are reconstructed entirely through gaps, which is purposeful but risks flattening him into a device. The final choice—pinning the boutonnière and lighting the beam—feels earned by the flashback revelation of Elias's own lost love, though the leap from "the stranger borrowed Elias's memory through village lore" strains causality. Internal contradiction is present (isolation as curse vs. space where echoes meet) but the shift occurs in reflection rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are present early (lighthouse keeper, opal dock, nautical twilight). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: memories and gaps layer until the final reweighting when Elias realizes the stranger mirrored his own vigil. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elias accepts his sentinel role with the boutonnière pinned, no longer alone but bound to strangers' final gestures. Cost is conceptual and felt: he owns the isolation as vocation rather than curse. One meaningful deepening occurs when the gaps align to reveal the stranger as echo. The middle investigation sequence flattens slightly into summary ("That night, driven to decode…"), but the final image recharges the opal dock and the flower with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The opal dock's iridescent surface and mist function as micro-setting throughout, constraining action (Elias kneeling, the boutonnière lodged in a crevice) and charging the final image. Nautical twilight recurs as both timeframe and atmospheric anchor, modulating from opening to close. The lighthouse tower is spatially legible. Sensory detail is purposeful—"mist curling softly persistent," "bruise-purple sky"—filtered through Elias's eccentric, archive-keeper perspective. The Alps appear only in borrowed memory, cleanly differentiated from the dock's present.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the stranger's gesture—is signaled early and drives the investigation sequence. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias realizes the gaps encode shared isolation rather than betrayal. Agency is present: Elias chooses to probe absences, then to pin the boutonnière and own the vigil. Cost is conceptual (foregoing solitude for sentinel duty) but legible in the final image. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase via layered memories, though the middle "he began to investigate" beat summarizes rather than dramatizes pressure, softening the tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—isolation as the space where echoes meet—emerges from the layered particulars of dock, flower, and gaps rather than assertion. The Edelweiss shifts meaning from impossible love to endurance, from the stranger's devotion to Elias's own lost betrothed. The final image (lighthouse beam cutting fog, Elias as "eccentric guardian of gaps and gestures") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the stranger's silent salute and the boutonnière's dislodgment. Minor slip: "Isolation was no curse, but the space where echoes met" edges toward thesis statement in the penultimate paragraph, though the sea's whispered approval and Elias's watching posture restore image-driven closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias with distinct perceptual signature ("salvaged oddities," "ghost ships that never docked"). Psychic distance contracts appropriately during the memory-touch moment. Diction is consistent and elevated but voice-motivated for an eccentric keeper who reads washed-up journals. Minor register drift: "decode," "probe the absences," "method that had unraveled many a wreck's secret" flirts with abstracting the investigation into meta-commentary rather than embodied action. The phrase "the method" arrives without prior establishment, creating a brief filter. Rhythm varies purposefully, compressing at the stranger's plunge and expanding during reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive in high-pressure beats: "silhouette frayed at the edges," "dock's opal sheen now smeared with seawater," "borrowed memories bloomed unbidden," "looping like fog-bound echoes." Figurative density without pattern-teaching triggers −0.5. Paraphrase loop: "softly persistent" appears four times, violating economy (−0.3). Template cadence in the investigation sequence: "Gap one… Gap two… Flash… Gap two" (−0.4). Stock metaphor: "memories intertwined, no longer borrowed but owned" (−0.2). Cumulative artifact penalty in Q7 totals −1.4. Information density is high where not looped; the final image propels cleanly. Clarity holds despite texture, preventing deeper penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—borrowed memories decoded through gaps—offers a fresh synthesis of isolation and empathy. The opal dock and Edelweiss are specific anchors. The turn (stranger as echo of Elias's own loss) feels earned in hindsight, though "the stranger had borrowed Elias's memory through village lore" introduces a late mechanism not foreshadowed. Emotional truth (shared vigil across voids) avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking in lyric texture heightens atmosphere but occasionally obscures causality. The piece commits to its accumulative mode without retreat, though the doubled "softly persistent" and "gaps" motifs edge toward token recurrence rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his choices—approaching the stranger, touching the flower, investigating, pinning the boutonnière—drive key beats. Early signal strong. Causal pressure moderate: the investigation sequence is more reflective than decision-laden. Closure linkage clear: he pins the flower and lights the beam. Swappability low: his history with the dock and his betrothed's Edelweiss are specific. Slight deduction for passivity during the middle investigation beat (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The boutonnière appears in three beats: stranger pins it, Elias retrieves it, Elias pins it at closure. Early signal strong. Evolving meaning: impossible love → dried endurance → shared vigil. Causal linkage: touch triggers borrowed memories. Closure charge high. Minor swappability: another alpine flower could substitute with edits, but the Edelweiss's symbolic freight (impossible love, alpine purity) is specific (−0.2).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Borrowed memories shape the investigation and provide the flashback that reframes Elias's isolation. They appear early (flower touch) and participate in closure (memories "no longer borrowed but owned"). The mechanic—touch-triggered transfer—alters tactics (decoding gaps). Cost linkage moderate: the memories impose obligation but not visible forfeit. Late explanation ("borrowed Elias's memory through village lore") weakens causal grounding (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" is used four times as descriptive tag (mist, compulsion, memories, bond) but does not constrain an on-page choice with cost. Label-only (−0.5). No middle development or cost connection. Present in setup and closure as atmosphere/theme claim, but does not enable or block action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Investigation drives the middle sequence and leads to the realization that aligns the gaps. Early signal strong ("driven to decode"). Causal pressure moderate: investigation is reflective rather than action-based, summarized ("That night… he began to investigate") rather than dramatized (−0.4). Closure linkage clear: the decoded gesture becomes Elias's own. Swappability low: the method of observing gaps is specific to this investigation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Observing gaps is signaled early ("gaps yawned—missing faces, unspoken names") and explicitly named as Elias's method ("by observing gaps, he probed the absences, the method that had unraveled many a wreck's secret"). It shapes two beats: gap one (lover's voice absent), gap two (no rage). Causal pressure moderate: the method is described more than enacted in real-time choices (−0.4). Closure linkage clear: the gaps align to reveal the echo. Specificity high: this method is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The opal dock is present in setup, middle (kneeling, crevice), and closure (final gleam). It constrains action (boutonnière caught in crevice) and charges the final image ("opal dock gleamed faintly, holding secrets"). Spatial choreography clear. Causal pressure moderate: the dock provides stage and symbol but does not block or enable key choices beyond the flower's retrieval. Specificity high: opalescence ties to shimmer, whispers, fragility.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Nautical twilight is signaled in the opening line and recurs at closure ("Nautical twilight faded"). It establishes atmosphere and frames the encounter. Middle development weak: time does not tighten decisions or create urgency (−0.5). No clock pressure. Functions as poetic anchor rather than constraint. Closure linkage moderate: twilight fading underscores the shift to night watch.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The desire to decode the gesture is signaled early ("Why pin the Edelweiss before oblivion?") and drives the investigation. Causal pressure moderate: desire is reflective rather than conflicted by competing wants (−0.3). Closure linkage strong: decoding completes when Elias realizes the gesture encodes shared vigil. Cost moderate: the decoded meaning obligates Elias to sentinel duty. Specificity high: this exact motivation shapes the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Witnessed isolation is coherent from opening ("isolation clung heavier than the fog, witnessed only by the fading stars") through closure ("witnessed solitude, memories intertwined"). Tone modulates with pressure: expands during twilight hush, contracts during the plunge, expands again in the lighthouse. The final image ("Elias watched, forever decoding") charges isolation as vocation. Coheres across turns without static repetition. Minor slip: "Isolation was no curse" edges toward explaining tone rather than sustaining it (−0.2).</comment>
