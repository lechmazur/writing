<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is present but relies heavily on abstract phrases ("geography of healing," "wounds etched themselves into landscapes") rather than embodied contradiction. The motivation to heal his sister's absence is told rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses a path. The obituary-writing conceit suggests internal work, but the final "whole" declaration reads as unearned epiphany without visible cost or competing impulse acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The piece establishes a situational frame—Elias alone in the garden after the ships depart—but delivers no meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options. The obituaries accumulate without escalation; no reversal or choice alters his stance. The closure ("he was whole") asserts transformation but offers no legible before/after with felt cost: we see no path foreclosed, no option sacrificed. The orientation test is borderline: anchors arrive gradually across multiple paragraphs, and the "traveler who writes obituaries for the living" label remains abstract past the 120-word mark.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The garden setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (damp soil, fading jasmine, crimson leaves). However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that alters outcome. The thread functions more as a symbolic talisman than a tool that shapes tactics. Spatial choreography remains clear, and the autumn tone is consistent, but the setting does not meet the 9+ gate requiring environment or object to constrain choice or charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mapping healing through explained absences—is signaled early but never tightened. Each obituary repeats the same gesture (writing, projecting presence, feeling warmth) without escalation or reversal. No on-page choice narrows options or changes knowledge; coincidence (finding the thread) enables the writing, and the resolution ("he was whole") is declared without dramatized cost. Under a situational lens, we expect pressure to force stance crystallization; here the stance simply arrives.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of explained absences and healing geographies emerges through repeated images (thread, garden, obituaries), but the final paragraph moralizes directly: "wounds as waypoints, presences eternal in projection." The obituaries themselves carry resonance, yet the ending opts for thematic summary ("In the garden's embrace, he was whole") rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The lonesome-splendor motif recurs without shifting meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated register and employs free indirect style cleanly. However, the diction frequently drifts into ornate abstraction ("invisible maps where wounds etched themselves," "salt-wind cartography of freedom's boundless gales") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Elias's perceptual signature is present but generic; the prose does not modulate with emotional pressure. No head-hopping, and POV remains stable throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Density of figurative language in most sentences creates overwriting: "jagged horizon," "filigreed patterns," "bruised purple," "vein of molten amber," "arterial blood yet soft as a lover's sigh" cluster without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence appears in the obituary beats: "For Captain Lira Voss… For Mira… For Thorne… For Elowen" with parallel syntax across multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loops recur: "projecting presence" is restated across lines without added pressure. Applying −0.9 for density and template runs, plus −0.3 for loops, totaling approximately −1.2 in Q7, and the artifacts touch multiple beats including near-closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise of writing obituaries for the living offers a fresh angle, and the weft-thread talisman adds specificity. However, the emotional arc and resolution (solitary reflection leading to declared wholeness) follow a familiar template without transformation through lived particulars. The "geography of healing" remains metaphorical rather than grounded in a non-obvious moral calculus or world logic. The piece does not take structural risk, and the final image does not feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his role as obituary-writer frames the action, but his choices do not create key turns. He observes, writes, and feels; no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. The character is functional but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The thread appears early (first third), is handled in multiple beats (kneeling, lifting to lips, binding to wrist, final tuck into journal spine), and recurs with reweighted meaning at the end ("frayed yet luminous"). It enables the projection mechanism and participates in closure, meeting setup, development, and payoff gates. However, its causal pressure is moderate: the thread facilitates rather than constrains, and the cost tied to it is implied rather than visible.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Explained absences is named and thematically present throughout ("Her absence is explained by…"). It frames the stakes but does not change on-page options or force a choice with cost. The concept is functional but remains abstract; removing it would require reframing the obituaries, but the emotional arc (solitary reflection → wholeness) could proceed with a near-synonym concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Vividly descriptive language saturates the prose (crimson leaves, filigreed patterns, dew-slick gravel, molten amber thread). The attribute constrains voice and tone but does not enable or prevent a key action with visible cost. It is present across beats and shapes atmosphere, meeting two gates, but remains swappable for "richly descriptive" or similar without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Intimate appears as a recurring label ("intimate act," "projection bloomed intimate," "intimately," "intimate talisman") across multiple beats. It colors the tone and the protagonist's engagement with the thread and presences, but does not drive a major turn or redefine options. The action of projecting presence could be framed as "close" or "personal" with minor edits; the exact word does not carry unique causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Projecting presence is signaled early ("by projecting presence through it") and mechanics appear in several beats: imagining weavers' hands, summoning echoes, projecting Lira's laughter, Mira's form, Thorne's voice, Elowen fully. The method shapes the obituary-writing attempts and participates in closure ("presences eternal in projection"). However, it is told rather than dramatized with visible cost, and the mechanism remains abstract. It meets setup and development gates but closure participation is thematic rather than causally active.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden is established early and described across multiple beats (oaks, rose arbors, stone bench, pavilion ruins). The setting provides the thread, the solitude, and the atmospheric charge. It participates in closure ("In the garden's embrace, he was whole") and the "lonesome splendor" tone is sustained. However, the garden does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it is stage rather than pressure. It meets all three gates and is integral to tone, but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last ship sails" anchors the opening and establishes solitude. However, time does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. The passage from dusk to moonlight is noted but does not create urgency or alter moves. The element is present and sets the initial condition but remains ornamental to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Understanding the geography of healing is stated early and repeated ("He sought the geography of healing," "healing's map unfolded within him"). The motivation drives the obituary-writing and frames the stakes. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; there is no on-page friction between want and cost. The motivation is functional and present across beats, meeting setup and development, and it participates thematically in closure, but lacks visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lonesome splendor appears as a recurring phrase ("Autumn's lonesome splendor," "lonesome splendor swelled," "lonesome splendor deepened," "In lonesome splendor, Elias rose") and the tone is coherent across the piece. The mood modulates subtly from initial isolation to final "embrace," and the final image ("lonesome splendor") charges the closure by reprising the opening motif. The tone meets all three gates and is tightly woven, though it does not constrain a choice.</comment>
