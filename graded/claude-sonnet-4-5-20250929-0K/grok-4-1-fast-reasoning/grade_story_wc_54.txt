<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's engineering motivation is established early and her micro-choices (splicing lines, routing water, adjusting the sextant) track consistently. However, interiority remains largely functional rather than contradictory—her "stoic wonder" and "functionally creative" mindset feel like stable labels rather than impulses in tension. The final moment lacks embodied cost; she simply "stood back, breath even," then walks out with "equations for hope etched in her mind"—more summary than felt renunciation or gain. Competence overwhelms struggle, flattening the stakes of her choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly within the opening paragraph. The causal lens holds: Elara's sextant discovery enables navigation, which enables rerouting, which awakens the resonator. Closure occurs on-page when the resonator chimes and offers "a route to untouched worlds," but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—"hope, quantified" in her notes—rather than a visible forfeiture or tension. The inferred lens (Causal) is stable, yet the ending image doesn't crystallize what she sacrificed or risked to achieve this resurrection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal is vividly rendered through cracked ferrocrete, dormant panels, and rusted pipes. Elara's engineering POV filters sensory detail purposefully: she notices "stress fractures that whispered of unmet promises" and conduits "snaking like veins." The sextant's use to align with Polaris through a cracked dome integrates environment into action. Spatial choreography across sublevel generators and access tunnels remains coherent, though some descriptor choices ("stoic wonder at the stars") tilt abstract rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resurrect the terminal to prove "decay reversible"—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Elara maps hidden flows, redirects power, and calibrates the sextant, but each step succeeds without visible trade-off or error that compounds. The resonator's awakening is a victory without a felt price: no injury, no resource exhausted, no social cost, no path foreclosed. One meaningful tightening occurs (the convergence at the junction), yet the resolution feels more like puzzle completion than a choice under constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Equations for hope" and "intentions unraveled and reborn" recur as thematic anchors, but the final image—star maps blooming, a route to untouched worlds—asserts meaning rather than letting it emerge from cost. The sextant and redirected flows function more as literal engineering moves than charged metaphors. The closing line "equations for hope etched in her mind, the maze behind her humming with quiet promise" borders on thematic summary, undercutting the resonance a more oblique image might achieve.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and voice-specific: Elara's engineering lexicon ("splicing auxiliary lines," "gravity-fed from rooftop collectors") grounds perception. Psychic distance remains consistent. However, elevated register occasionally intrudes—"stoic wonder," "functionally creative mind igniting," "fractal patterns of flow convergence"—phrases that feel writerly rather than emerging from an intern's interior texture under pressure. No dialogue present; internal syntax is clean but lacks rhythmic variation during high-intensity beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear, with purposeful technical detail and clean grammar. However, template-cadence runs appear: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" structures ("She knelt," "She traced," "She walked"), and synonym loops recur around "stoic" and "intentions." The phrase "equations for hope" is repeated without reweighting. Figurative language occasionally stacks without payoff: "a maze of intentions," "veins to a heart," "lattice of possibility" within a few beats. Information density is moderate; some scaffolding ("her functionally creative mind igniting") could compress.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—lone engineer resurrects a proto-AI navigation system through clever rerouting—is competent but recognizable from tech-resurrection templates. The sextant piece provides specificity, and the carnival's departure frames solitude, yet neither transforms the core arc. Elara's success feels overdetermined: no failure, no bitter trade-off, no friction between stoic wonder and functional pragmatism. The ending's "hope, quantified" reads as prompt echo rather than earned synthesis. Risk-taking is minimal; the story prefers demonstrable competence over ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's choices (prying panels, splicing lines, routing water, adjusting the sextant) drive all major beats. Setup is immediate, middle involves multiple engineering decisions, and closure hinges on her successful calibration. However, her intern status never constrains her; she executes flawlessly without struggle, reducing the element's causal friction. The "curious" trait is mentioned but not tested—she never chooses between safety and discovery.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The sextant appears early (amid candy wrappers), is used mid-story to map flows via scanner readings, and returns at closure when Elara adjusts it to calibrate the resonator's stellar inputs. Three distinct beats, each functional. Yet the object's "arc etched with celestial calibrations" is more atmospheric than mechanically specific—its exact properties don't constrain her choices or impose cost. Swappable with another navigation tool without major rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"A maze of intentions" appears as metaphor in narration ("the terminal sprawled like a maze of intentions," "the maze's tangled purposes aligned") but never materially limits Elara's pathfinding. She navigates corridors via the sextant and her scanner; the maze's intentionality is told, not enacted as a puzzle or trap. Present thematically but not as a stake-shaping constraint. Missing middle development as a causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" is stated twice ("her functionally creative mind igniting," "Functionally creative, she envisioned redirecting flows") but not dramatized as a trait with cost. Does it mean she favors elegance over brute force? If so, we never see her reject a simpler, cruder option. Label-only; no on-page tradeoff between creativity and practicality. Mentioned in setup and middle, absent from closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Resurrect" is the story's central action: signaled in Elara's motivation ("prove decay reversible"), enacted through power/water/air restoration, and completed when the resonator awakens and speaks. All three gates met; causally irreplaceable. However, the resurrection succeeds without visible cost—no injury, no resource exhausted, no failure that forces adaptation—slightly reducing its charge. Strong integration, moderate cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Redirected flows" (electrical, coolant, air) is the method Elara uses in three sequential beats: splicing auxiliary lines, routing rooftop water to heat sinks, unsealing vents. The method is specific, signaled early ("she envisioned redirecting flows"), and drives the middle escalation. It shapes her approach—elegant rerouting vs. brute repair—and culminates in the resonator's hum. Setup, middle, and payoff all present; causal pressure clear.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is established immediately and supplies resources (sublevel generators, rooftop collectors, access tunnels, the resonator core) that Elara uses across multiple beats. Spatial choreography is coherent; the setting constrains her tactics (she must map hidden infrastructure). Closure occurs within the terminal as the resonator awakens. Strong setup and middle; the ending image includes the setting ("the maze behind her humming") but doesn't foreground a final environmental constraint or cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After the carnival leaves town" anchors the opening but imposes no live clock. Elara explores "hours blurred," dawn arrives at the end—time is noted but never pressures her choices or tactics. No urgency, no risk of discovery, no deadline that narrows options. Setup only; absent from middle escalation and closure. Static backdrop rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated early and recurs at closure ("equations for hope etched in her mind"). Elara's actions align—she attempts resurrection to prove salvage possible—but the desire is never conflicted. No friction between hope and pragmatism, no moment where optimism costs her safety or resources. Told-only motivation with causal follow-through but no dramatized cost. Setup and payoff present; middle friction weak.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" is invoked three times ("stoic wonder at the stars," "stoic exploration," "wonder stoic as the light bathed her face") but reads as label rather than modulated texture. The prose remains evenly controlled across beats—no compression under stress, no cadence shift at revelation. Tone is coherent but static, missing the charge that would come from letting wonder crack stoicism or vice versa at closure.</comment>
