<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is defined by labels ("grim optimist," "balancedly daring") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The motivation to "capture the texture" of a missed leap remains abstract; the die-rolling and equation-sketching feel decorative rather than embodying genuine internal conflict. The ending renews the climb without visible cost that forecloses a path—he pockets the chipped die and resumes, which reads as stasis without the felt price required for Earned Stasis. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("heart pounding in timeless rhythm") and the backstory of the ledge/love choice arrives late, told rather than dramatized through present micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are present early, and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (staircase ascent, looping proofs, die symbolism). However, closure lacks decisive cost: the staircase reforms "seamlessly, stronger in denial," Elias resumes climbing, and the final image offers recurrence without a legible price that reweights prior material. The flawless die shatters mid-air, but this rupture is immediately undone, deflating the closure unit. The ending gesture—rolling the chipped die and smiling—feels like a reset rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt consequence, falling short of the required closure standard.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is vividly established and returns at closure (steps blur into "golden mean helix," stairs "reform seamlessly"). The chipped die functions as a micro-setting element, handled across multiple beats and charged with meaning (the chip from a prior fall). Sensory selection is purposeful during the proof-sketching beat ("air humming with symbols"). However, the setting does not constrain a pivotal choice—Elias's actions (sketching, rolling dice, hurling them) occur within the staircase but are not altered by its spatial properties, keeping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving perpetual motion to rupture confinement—is signaled early. Elias's agency appears in the proof-building and dice-hurling, and a micro-turn occurs when the flawless die shatters. Yet the immediate reformation of the stairs ("seamlessly, stronger in denial") negates the rupture, undercutting escalation. The cost is declared ("captured it, not escaped") but not felt on the page in a way that narrows future options or charges the final image. The cycle resumes without a visible trade-off, reducing the pressure's impact on closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the staircase-as-perpetual-motion metaphor and the chipped die as emblem of missed opportunity. The final image—rolling the die and resuming the climb—reweights the premise without overt moralizing. However, the texture of regret remains somewhat abstract ("the wind's kiss, love's potential grasp") rather than anchored in a concrete, irreversible action. The phrase "free in confinement, optimist unbowed" edges toward thematic statement rather than letting the image speak. The piece invites reflection on futility and persistence, achieving mid-band resonance without full earned wisdom from specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with consistent focalization on Elias. Diction is elevated and voice-consistent ("grim smile cracking his lips," "rupture: the flawless die shattered mid-air"), though some phrases lean toward generic lyricism ("steps blurring into a golden mean helix"). No dialogue is present. Perceptual signature is somewhat character-specific (mathematician's lens on conservation laws, Hamiltonian cycles), but the register occasionally drifts into over-ornamented abstraction ("texture lingered, motivation sated yet insatiable") that reduces immediacy. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully across beats, and information density is generally high. However, multiple lines exhibit paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "perpetual motion" and "endless" recur heavily without added pressure, and adjacent sentences restate concepts ("proofs etched into steps behind him, a trail of grim hope, perpetual in their futility"). Template cadence appears in the equation-building passage ("Line by line, he built the model: ... His pen raced, proving ..."). The final paragraph stacks summary-like constructions ("texture lingered, motivation sated yet insatiable, driving ...") that dull momentum. Stock metaphor ("heart pounding in timeless rhythm") and filter-verb stacks reduce immediacy. Apply −0.8 for pattern artifacts and loop issues within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—mathematician trapped on infinite stairs attempts to prove perpetual motion—offers a fresh synthesis of allegory and speculative constraint. The chipped die as talisman of regret and the rupture-via-proof concept are specific angles. However, the core emotional arc (man confronts past missed chance through symbolic action, then resumes) follows a familiar template, and the transformation is limited: Elias ends where he began, climbing. The perpetual-motion theorem is sketched with physics terminology but remains ornamental rather than causally decisive—swapping it for another impossible proof would not fundamentally alter the story. Risk-taking in structure and voice is present but does not fully overcome the derivative "eternal-confinement-as-personal-hell" frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and makes the decision to sketch proofs, roll dice, and hurl them upward. However, these choices do not create key turns that alter tactics or options with visible cost. The ending returns him to climbing, a decision framed as acceptance rather than a causal pivot. Label-only trait ("grim optimist") is declared rather than enacted through contradictory impulses in scene. Setup and development gates are met; payoff is weak (he resumes climbing without transformation). Score in functional-but-replaceable band with small lift for sustained presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The pair of dice (one chipped, one flawless) appears early, is handled in multiple beats (rolled, spun, hurled), and returns at closure (chipped die alone, twin's shards dust). The chip is tied to backstory (a fall, a missed leap) and the flawless die's shattering marks the rupture beat. The object's properties (chip vs. flawless) mirror the proof's asymmetry. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the dice are more symbolic than causal—removing them would require rewriting metaphor but not break the core logic of proof-attempt and resumed climb. Score in mid-band: essential across beats but not fully indispensable to closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Perpetual motion is the explicit focus: Elias attempts to prove it mathematically, the staircase is framed as a frictionless engine, and the concept is thematically central ("perpetual in their futility"). Setup and payoff gates are met. However, the concept shapes stakes more thematically than tactically—the proofs are summarized rather than shown to constrain choices, and the rupture's mechanics remain abstract. The concept is signaled early and present at closure, but its causal work is limited. Score at boundary of functional/purposeful: one key turn (rupture via proof) but replaceable with another impossible theorem.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Balancedly daring" is declared early ("Balancedly daring by nature, Elias weighed every decision like a scale—reckless impulse tempered by cold calculation") but remains label-only. No on-page action demonstrates the trait constraining or enabling a choice with visible cost. The decision to hurl the dice and the choice to resume climbing are narrated outcomes rather than moments where balanced daring creates friction or tradeoff. Setup gate is met; development and payoff are absent. Score in ornamental band: present as character description but not enacted with consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rupture occurs mid-story when the flawless die shatters and "equations fracturing like glass as reality recoiled." This beat is the story's peak reversal and is directly tied to Elias's proof-attempt. Setup (building proofs), development (hurling dice to test the theorem), and payoff (staircase groans, breach opens) gates are met. However, the rupture is immediately undone ("stairs reformed seamlessly"), which deflates its causal impact on the ending. Elias resumes climbing without the rupture having permanently altered options. Score in purposeful band: drives one major beat and shapes the ending, but the reset reduces indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Mathematical proofs are signaled early and occupy the central beat: Elias sketches integrals, conservation laws, Hamiltonian cycles, and ergodic flows. Setup and development gates are met. However, the proofs are summarized in abstract terminology without mechanics that constrain choices or shape tactics—we are told he builds a model, not shown how the model's logic forces trade-offs. The proofs enable the rupture but are recounted rather than dramatized. Payoff is weak (proofs "etched into steps" as metaphor). Score in functional band: present across beats but swappable with another symbolic intellectual method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is introduced in the opening line, pressures every beat (endless ascent without summit), and returns at closure (stairs reform, Elias resumes climbing). The setting is not merely backdrop—it embodies boundless confinement and is the object of Elias's rupture attempt. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The setting does not supply resources that alter tactics in a granular way (no choice between paths, no tool from the stairs), but it is the story's central constraint and charges the final image. Score in essential band: drives multiple beats and shapes the ending, though its pressure is thematic rather than micro-tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to capture the texture of a missed opportunity" is stated explicitly and tied to the chipped die and backstory (ledge, leap for love). Setup and payoff gates are met. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—Elias's proof-building and dice-rolling are framed as pursuit of this goal, but no on-page choice enacts friction between the desire and its cost. The ending declares "texture lingered, motivation sated yet insatiable" without showing how capturing the texture forecloses a path or imposes a price. Score at boundary of functional/purposeful: shapes one key beat (the rupture attempt) but lacks visible tradeoff in action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Boundless confinement" is coherent throughout: the infinite staircase, the endless ascent, the reformed stairs, and the final "free in confinement" all maintain the paradox. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Tone modulates slightly (building hope during the proof, rupture tension at the die-shattering, resigned acceptance at the end) without breaking coherence. The final image—rolling the die and resuming the climb—charges the tone with cost. However, the tone is somewhat static across beats (consistent grim optimism without sharper emotional pivot). Score in essential band: present across beats and charges the ending, but lacks a decisive tonal shift that would elevate to high-band.</comment>
