<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared but not tested through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she moves through the sanctum without friction between competing desires. Her "technically gentle" precision and forgiveness arc are told rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The apprentice's injury is backstory payload without present consequence that alters a visible choice. Internal conflict is summarized ("guilt into purpose") rather than dramatized as competing wants colliding in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The closure—voices erupting and Elara weeping—lands on the page, but the cost is decorative: her tears freeze and thaw without foreclosing a path or altering future options. The piece teaches an Accumulative lens (aurora, rope, card converge in the final illumination), but the before/after is cosmetic—she arrives seeking preservation and achieves it without trade-off. Orientation is anchored early (sanctum, Elara, aurora), waiving penalties. The single meaningful tightening (threading the card into the rope) occurs, but the resolution feels like wish fulfillment rather than earned closure with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum is vividly anchored (glacial heart, aurora veils, snowmelt ardor), and the rope's silver filaments + perforations constrain her method at the altar. However, the environment does not force a mid-scene choice or limit her movements—it remains a backdrop for her uninterrupted work. Spatial choreography is clear, and the auroral light charges the final image, lifting the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve forgotten names—is signaled early and pursued without opposition. No reversal occurs; Elara threads the card, twists the rope, and succeeds in one unbroken arc. The "action: illuminate" is the climax, but no live option is foreclosed and no price is visible on the page beyond atmospheric tears. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification (the braids locking, hum stirring) occurs, but escalation does not narrow her choices or raise felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—memory as transcription, preservation against erasure—emerges through the punched card and rope mechanics rather than direct statement. However, the final image ("forgotten names lived again") states the thesis rather than allowing it to resonate through implication. The ending offers no non-literal answer; Elara's arc from guilt to purpose resolves tidily without ambiguity or conceptual repricing. Subtext is present in the rope-as-vessel image but undercut by expository interiority ("forgiveness had led her here").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature (artisan's eye, wax-caster metaphors) colors the narration consistently. Elara's lexicon ("technically gentle," "snowmelt ardor") is distinctive but occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("holographic voices chanting"). No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance is controlled. The prose reflects her state under pressure (short clauses at the climax), but filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") dull immediacy in several beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically controlled and sensory, but figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without purposeful pattern or payoff: "veins of fire," "serpent of braided hemp," "lattice of captured light," "living archive." Mixed vehicle: tears "freezing mid-fall only to thaw" contradicts the established physics of the sanctum's warmth. Paraphrase loops appear: "technically gentle" is restated three times with synonym churn ("reverence," "precision," "without snap or fray"). Template cadence in the middle section: "She approached... She unspooled... She began... She worked..." Register drift into abstract elevation ("holographic voices," "phonemes") clashes with her artisan POV. Density is high, but momentum drags under ornamental metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—lost-wax casting + street-organ mechanics + auroral light—is conceptually fresh, but the execution leans on familiar redemption-through-craft beats without a non-obvious turn. The punched-card-as-memory-vessel is the strongest inflection, yet the story does not follow its implications into friction or cost. Elara's guilt and northward journey echo archetypal exile-and-return without transformation through specific lived detail. The ending pivots to an artisan's triumph that could swap into adjacent genres (blacksmith, weaver) with minor edits, suggesting insufficient irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her decision to thread the card into the rope drives the climax. However, her choices are unopposed and do not create reversals—she executes a plan without friction. She is introduced early (setup ✓), her wax-caster precision enables the method (development ✓), and she carries the rope at closure (payoff ✓). All three gates pass, eligible ≥6.1, but her agency does not narrow options or incur visible cost, and her occupation could be swapped (jeweler, weaver) without altering the arc. Late-penalty waived (present from line one). Causal pressure minimal; closure linkage present but passive. Base ~5.0 for three gates + causal work, −0.8 for swappability and lack of cost = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The card is introduced early ("In her palm lay..."), threaded into the rope's core at the method beat (mid-scene), and its perforations project the voices at closure—three distinct beats, all three gates. The card's punched voids are irreplaceable (the rope cannot sing without them), and the final illumination depends on aligning perforations with silver conduits. Setup ✓ +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (enables the projection) +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5 = base ~6.7. No major frictions. Round to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Transcribed memory is the premise, named early ("memory as transcription") and embodied in the punched card's perforations encoding voices. The concept shapes her method (threading card into rope to align perforations) and the closure effect (voices erupting as holographic scripts). Setup ✓, development (the card-threading beat relies on it) ✓, payoff (voices as transcription manifest) ✓. Three gates met, eligible ≥6.1. Base ~6.0 for premise-level work + two beats + closure link. −0.3 for theme-claim phrasing ("memory as transcription, etched not in wax...") that tells rather than enacts. No swappability. 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" is introduced early (paragraph 5), stated three times, and enacted when Elara parts the rope strands "without snap or fray." Setup ✓, development (rope-handling beat) ✓, but closure does not hinge on gentleness—the illumination depends on alignment, not delicacy. Two gates, eligible ~6.0 max per guidance. One beat +0.4, causal enabler (unspools without breaking) +0.5. −0.3 label-only repetition, −0.5 swappable (could be "precise" or "patient"), −0.4 no cost tied to the trait. Base ~5.5, frictions −1.2 = 4.3, but closure link (rope remains intact for final glow) adds +0.4 = 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Illuminate" is named as the climactic action and executed when auroral light surges through the reconfigured rope, projecting the voices. Setup (method foreshadowed as "channeling auroral rays") ✓, development (rope alignment prepares the light path) ✓, payoff (the illuminate beat is the closure trigger) ✓. Three gates. Early signal +0.5, three beats (preparation, threading, surge) +1.4, causal pressure (the light is the pour that casts sound) +1.2, closure linkage (drives the final image) +1.5, irreplaceability +0.6. Base ~8.2. −0.3 the voices erupt without obstacle, lowering cost visibility. −0.3 swappable verb (could be "activate" or "charge"). Final 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method is introduced early (paragraph 11: "She approached the sanctum's altar, where a centuries-old ceremonial rope lay"), explained in the next beat ("reconfiguring the braids... aligning perforations with silver conduits"), and executed across the middle third. Setup ✓, development (the braiding work is the protagonist's task) ✓, payoff (final braid cinched, then illuminate) ✓. Three gates. Early signal +0.6, three beats (unspooling, threading, cinching) +1.4, causal pressure (mechanics matter: alignment is required) +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (rope + card + filaments) +0.5. Base ~7.5. −0.4 mechanics feel decorative rather than constrained by material limits. Final 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum is anchored in the opening sentence and the aurora + snowmelt pressure is sustained. Setup ✓, development (altar provides the rope) ✓, payoff (ice walls as projection surface, "sanctum's ice groaning") ✓. Three gates. Early +0.7, two beats (arrival, projection) +0.9, closure linkage (ice walls receive the scripts) +0.9, causal pressure (aurora supplies the light) +0.8. Base ~7.3. −0.5 postcard descriptors ("shivering veils," "glacial heart") without tactical constraint. −0.4 she moves freely without environmental friction. Final 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After forgiving herself" anchors the story's emotional premise and frames her wandering north. Setup ✓ (opening sentence). Development and payoff: forgiveness is revisited mid-scene ("forgiving herself anew with every precise knot") and at closure ("Forgiveness had led her here"), but these are restatements without new tactical pressure. Two gates (setup + thematic reprise), eligible ~6.0 max. Early signal +0.5, lyric reprise +0.4. −0.8 the timeframe is static backstory, not a live clock that alters moves. −0.7 summary-only at closure. −0.6 swappable (could be "after losing your apprentice" with same structure). Base ~4.4, frictions −2.1 = 2.3, +1.5 for thematic weight across beats = 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Preservation of forgotten names is stated early ("to preserve those sounds") and drives every choice: wandering north, threading the card, aligning the rope. Setup ✓, development (the method serves this goal) ✓, payoff (voices erupt, names chanted) ✓. Three gates. Early signal +0.6, three beats (scavenging card, threading, illuminate) +1.4, causal pressure (the entire arc pursues this stake) +1.3, closure linkage (voices name "Kaelith," "Vorrun") +1.2. Base ~7.5. −0.6 no friction between preservation and another want. −0.7 told-only in opening and ending, not tested on the page. Final 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor"—passionate thaw vs. ice—is introduced early (paragraph 3) and repeated at closure ("Snowmelt ardor coursed through her veins"). The tone is coherent (warmth vs. cold, guilt thawing into purpose) and modulates with the aurora's pulse. Setup ✓, development (ardor as counterforce mentioned mid-scene) ✓, payoff (ardor made manifest in glowing scripts) ✓. Three gates. Early +0.5, lyric reprise +0.6, closure linkage +0.8. −0.5 static metaphor (thaw = forgiveness) restated without tonal shift. −0.4 label-only ("snowmelt ardor" is named, not enacted in diction). −0.3 the prose remains elevated throughout, no modulation under pressure. Base ~6.1, frictions −1.2 = 4.9, +0.4 for charging the final image = 5.3.</comment>
