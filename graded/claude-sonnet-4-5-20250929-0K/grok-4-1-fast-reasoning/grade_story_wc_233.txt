<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elowen's disenchantment is declared but her interior life remains abstract—"reclaim her fraying soul" and "dreams' tyranny" read as placeholder motivations rather than embodied contradictions. The grotto sequence offers minimal micro-choices; she touches the pool and "inhales the bleeding starlight" without visible internal conflict or trade-off in the moment. Thorne functions as a named shadow with no distinct pressure or resistance. The final transformation is asserted ("power woven in menace") rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a causal lens (dreams → climb → grotto → transformation) and delivers an on-page Decisive Change when Elowen absorbs the starlight and gains resolve. However, the orientation window is muddy: who/where/when anchors arrive piecemeal across the opening third, and the "final warning" timeframe remains vague. The climax—touching the pool and inhaling starlight—compresses causality into summary ("visions sharpened," "future laced with vengeful grace") rather than dramatizing the choice and its immediate cost. Closure lands but feels narrated rather than experienced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto, ember glow, and bleeding starlight pools offer vivid sensory anchors that guide the ascent and frame the climax. Spatial choreography during the climb is clear (ropes, boots, ledge), and the grotto's "lacy menace" modulates atmosphere. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental feature meaningfully constrains a choice or alters tactics. The "crystalline pools" participate in closure by being touched, meeting the micro-setting threshold, but the interaction remains passive description rather than active constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—ending the dreams' tyranny—is signaled early and pursued through the climb. The ascent itself tightens physical peril (thinning air, jagged stone), and the grotto offers temptation ("power unbound"). Yet the pivotal choice—touching the pool—arrives without visible trade-off or consequence in the moment; the "sacrifice" and "vengeful grace" are asserted in summary rather than shown as a foreclosed path. One meaningful tightening occurs (the council's warning → defiant climb), but agency at closure feels narrated rather than enacted with legible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of reclaiming agency from hollow ritual emerges through Elowen's disenchantment and the grotto's test. Bleeding starlight as a bloodline curse and the firefly crown as absolution offer symbolic weight. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly ("dreams unraveled into destiny's sharp pattern," "thorns hidden in petals") rather than letting the image resonate. The "vengeful grace" and "transformative hush" read as thematic shortcuts—labels replacing earned insight. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into a tidy empowerment arc without ambiguity or cost that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, but diction drifts into elevated ornament ("spilled mercury," "lacy menace," "deceptive delicacy") that clashes with the claimed urgency and flattens perceptual specificity. Elowen's interior voice lacks a distinct rhythm or bias; her thoughts read as narrated summary rather than embodied perception under pressure. Thorne's single line of dialogue is functional but generic. Register inconsistency is most visible in the final descent: "power woven in menace as fine as lace" and "destiny's sharp pattern" slide into abstract poeticism that distances rather than intensifies the POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prose carries consistent ornament ("ghost of royal splendor," "seductive peril," "prophetic lace") but accumulates scaffold loops: "softly commanding" recurs as label, "bleeding starlight" is paraphrased across multiple beats without advancing pressure, and the final paragraph stacks synonym variants ("thorns hidden in petals," "deceptive delicacy"). Template cadence appears in the middle third: "Higher they pressed... The ridge emerged... Breath ragged, they hauled..." follows identical [action] then [state] stems. Figurative density in peak beats (grotto climax) muddles clarity: "lacy menace," "silvery rivulets," "prophetic lace," "noose of glowing threads" within six lines without pattern-teaching or payoff. Apply −0.8 for loops and template runs, −0.4 for figurative clutter in the closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The disenchanted queen seeking mystical transformation follows a familiar empowerment template without specific transformation. The grotto's mechanics—bleeding starlight, firefly crown, absorbing power—echo generic fantasy quest-resolution without surprise or fresh synthesis. Emotional specificity is thin: "hollow decrees," "loveless alliances," and "courtiers' simpering plots" remain abstract grievances rather than lived particulars. The piece executes its template competently but offers no turn, inflection, or synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight or rooted in non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elowen is present throughout (setup, climb, grotto, descent) and her choice to touch the pool drives the climax. However, the decision arrives without visible internal conflict or trade-off in the moment; cost is asserted afterward in summary. She shapes two beats (departure command, pool touch) but remains reactive rather than driving reversals. Swappable with "disenchanted ruler" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ember grotto appears in setup (dreams), middle (climb destination), and closure (transformation site). It constrains the climb spatially and frames the starlight encounter. However, its "ember" quality—flickering without flame—remains ornamental; the cobalt hue and glow do not alter tactics or choices. The grotto's participation in closure is spatial rather than causal; any mystical cave could serve the same function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight seeds the dreams (setup), materializes as dripping rifts in the grotto (middle), and is absorbed at climax (closure). It shapes the dominant stake (understanding the visions) and enables the transformation. However, the mechanics remain vague—why it bleeds, what absorption costs in the moment—so the concept functions more as symbol than active constraint. Present across all three gates but lacks the specificity to make it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Softly commanding" is labeled twice (dialogue tag, descent description) but never shown constraining or enabling a choice with visible cost. Elowen's command to Thorne ("Prepare the ascent," "Stay; this unraveling is mine alone") could be delivered in any tone without altering outcome. The attribute functions as decorative character texture rather than a trait that shapes tactics or incurs trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The climb is signaled early (command to Thorne), occupies the middle third (ropes, stone, eagles' nests), and delivers them to the grotto where closure occurs. It provides physical escalation (thinning air, jagged flanks) and embodies defiance of the council's warning. The ascent is essential to access the resolution site and dramatizes commitment. However, the climb itself could be replaced with another arduous journey (crossing desert, diving depths) without fundamental story breakage; it is more vehicle than irreplaceable mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The shared exhale and fireflies appear only in the grotto sequence (late second half) and trigger the vortex/memory flood in one beat. The method is not seeded earlier, and its mechanics—why synchronized breath matters, how fireflies unlock the curse—remain unexplained. It functions as a convenient key rather than a prepared, irreplaceable means. Late arrival and ornamental use cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto above clouds is the destination from setup, frames the middle climb, and hosts the entire closure sequence. Its verticality (above clouds, ridge access) constrains approach and its interior features (pools, bleeding rifts) enable the transformation. However, the grotto's properties do not alter tactics—Elowen's choices inside (touch pool, inhale starlight) are not shaped by cobalt hue or ember glow. The setting provides the stage but does not pressure decisions within it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the final warning" is mentioned in the setup (council warning at dawn, departure at twilight) but does not function as a ticking clock. No deadline tightens choices during the climb or grotto sequence; the timeframe is scenic ("twilight," "moonlight," "dawn") rather than tactical. The warning itself (heights claim the unwary) poses abstract peril that never materializes as concrete cost. Present in setup, absent in middle pressure, decorative at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Unraveling the recurring dreams is stated as the goal in setup and middle ("end the dreams' tyranny") and is resolved when Elowen touches the pool and visions clarify. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible internal friction. The dreams themselves are described (bleeding starlight, cobalt grotto) but their emotional cost—why they tyrannize—remains abstract. The motivation drives the plot but lacks the embodied contradiction or trade-off that would make it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Lacy menace" is labeled repeatedly ("menace as delicate as spider silk," "shadows that danced with lacy menace," "lacy tendrils of light coiling") and modulates slightly (ethereal beauty → tightening noose) as the grotto sequence progresses. The tone is consistent and charges the grotto atmosphere. However, it functions primarily as decorative descriptor rather than a tonal constraint that shapes choices or alters the final image's charge. The label recurs without evolving meaning or imposing felt cost.</comment>
