<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lirien's motivation is declared ("preserve the color of wonder") but his internal conflict never materializes on the page—he moves through the ritual without visible struggle, doubt, or cost. Elowen appears as a passive recipient rather than a character under pressure; her "dulled eyes" and "frayed spirit" are labels, not embodied states that shift through dramatized choice. The pruning ritual unfolds as a demonstration piece with no missteps or tradeoffs that would reveal character limits. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("insatiably creative," "radiant hush") rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who Lirien is and what the heirloom seed does remain vague past the opening third, though context eventually clarifies. The piece follows an Accumulative lens (texture and density building toward a pattern-charged ending), but causality is weak: Elowen's arrival, Lirien's decision to help, and the seed's transformation occur without on-page resistance or complication. Closure lands as Decisive Change (the tree erupts, wonder restored), yet the cost is asserted rather than felt—no visible price paid by Lirien or Elowen that forecloses a live option. The ritual sequence reads as explanation more than pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The verdant parapet, waterfall, and orchards are described with vivid sensory detail ("mossy ledge," "spray danced in sunbeams"), but they function as backdrop rather than constraint—no choice hinges on proximity, access, or environmental friction. The heirloom seed is handled across multiple beats (revealed, glowing, pressed into Elowen's palm, planted), qualifying as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, though the "weaving between worlds" remains abstract and does not impose legible physical or social limits on tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring wonder to a graying world—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens: Lirien's ritual succeeds without complication, and Elowen receives the seed without conflict over trust, cost, or doubt. No reversal or escalation appears; the sequence is linear demonstration. Agency is minimal: Lirien performs, Elowen accepts, the seed works. Coincidence does not resolve (the ritual is motivated), but the absence of on-page friction or tradeoff keeps stakes abstract. The tree's eruption is a declared success, not an earned narrowing of options with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme (preservation of wonder, bridging worlds, essence as succor) emerges from repeated images—heirloom seed, color draining, the tree blooming—but the final image does not reweight prior material with fresh tension or ambiguity. The seed-to-tree transformation is too tidy, resolving complexity into a single symbolic flourish without moral calculus or counter-pressure. Subtext is thin; dialogue and gesture state rather than imply. The "radiant hush" and "budding hope" motifs recur but do not constrain choice or charge the ending with non-literal resonance; they ornament rather than complicate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV anchored in Lirien is stable, with no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent lyric-elevated register ("verdant parapet," "insatiably creative," "radiant hush"), but diction often drifts into stock lyricism rather than character-particular perception—Lirien's "wise gaze" and "orchard wisdom" are told, not shown through his noticing. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Lirien's lines ("You seek what blooms only in hidden groves") read as thematic exposition rather than goal-driven speech. Psychic distance stays mid-range throughout, with no modulation under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic rather than specific to a decades-long pruner.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dense figurative language pervades most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff: "upon the hush of budding hope," "dawn's first light kissed the mist," "storm-torn petals," "hope incarnate." Template cadence appears in runs of parallel structures ("From the waterfall... Then from the verdant parapet... From the orchards"). Paraphrase loops occur: "preserve that color" / "the vibrant hue" / "the color of wonder" recur across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("thread of calm," "beacon against the fade") and label-only interiority ("insatiably creative") cluster in peak beats. Information density is low—many sentences restate stakes or describe without advancing causality. Clarity is maintained, but momentum drags under ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—wise gardener performs ritual to restore fading wonder via heirloom seed—follows a familiar mentor-gift template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "weaving between worlds" and "capturing essence" mechanics are declared but not dramatized with unique constraints or tradeoffs. Emotional specificity is minimal; the arc (despair → restoration) is linear and generic. The verdant parapet and waterfall supply vivid texture, but the conflict and resolution could port to many other settings and characters with minor edits. No bold risk-taking or fresh inflection distinguishes the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirien ("wise orchard pruner") is present in setup, performs the central ritual (middle development), and nods in approval at closure. His pruning skill shapes the "weaving" action—tracing air, snipping threads—so the occupation matters mechanically. However, his choices do not create reversals or narrow options under pressure; he executes a plan without friction. Cost is absent: no visible tradeoff tied to his expertise or age. Early signal +0.5, two distinct beats (ritual, final nod) +0.9, closure linkage (observes outcome) +0.4, moderate causal pressure (enables ritual) +0.8, but no felt cost (−0.5), somewhat swappable profession (−0.4). Base ~6.5 – 0.9 friction = 5.6, round down to 5.8 for mechanical integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The heirloom seed appears in setup (grandmother's final breath), is held and described during the ritual (middle), and planted at closure (tree erupts). It is handled on the page in three beats: reveal, ritual transformation, planting. Its "speckled orb" and iridescent glow supply specificity, and the tree's eruption depends on it. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (tree) +1.2, moderate causal pressure (succor device) +0.9, some irreplaceability (heirloom trait) +0.5. No on-page cost tied to the seed itself (Elowen receives it without sacrifice) (−0.4). Base ~4.2 + 4.6 positives – 0.4 = 8.4, but swappability friction (another magical seed could substitute) (−0.5) and summary-only transformation (we are told it "drank" essence, not shown through resistance or side effect) (−0.6) lower to ~7.3. Piggyback closure: the tree is a new object, not the seed reweighted (−0.5). Final 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Weaving between worlds" is named in setup ("core of his art lay in weaving"), invoked during the ritual ("wove between worlds now"), and present at closure (tree as bridge). However, the mechanic remains abstract—no on-page rule, cost, or constraint defines what "weaving" entails or risks. The concept is theme-adjacent but does not change tactics or narrow options. Early signal +0.4, three mentions (setup, middle, closure) but only one functional beat (ritual) +0.4, closure linkage (conceptual) +0.3, low causal pressure (label-only) +0.2, high swappability (could be "channeling" or "calling") (−0.7). Base ~1.6, round to 4.1 for thematic coherence without mechanical teeth.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Insatiably creative" appears as a label in the opening paragraph and is mentioned again during the ritual ("insatiably creative, threading these essences"). It does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost—Lirien's creativity is asserted, not dramatized through improvisation, risk, or tradeoff. Setup mention +0.3, one beat (ritual invocation) +0.4, no middle constraint or closure cost (−0.8), label-only (−0.6), highly swappable (−0.6). Base ~(−1.3), floor at 2.8 for presence without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Succor" is named in setup ("succor was needed"), Lirien explains it during the ritual ("This is succor... essence preserved"), and Elowen feels it at closure ("feeling succor root deep"). The action (providing aid) drives the plot—Lirien's ritual is succor in practice. Early signal +0.5, three beats (need, ritual, effect) +1.4, closure linkage (Elowen's restoration) +1.0, moderate causal pressure (the ritual is succor) +0.9, some irreplaceability (thematic anchor) +0.4. No on-page cost to Lirien for providing succor (−0.5), somewhat swappable (could be "healing" or "restoration") (−0.5). Base ~3.2 + 4.2 positives – 1.0 friction = 6.4, lifted slightly for thematic coherence to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Capturing essence" is introduced mid-story ("He captured essence first from the waterfall") and executed in the ritual beats. The method is signaled and its mechanics (vapor from waterfall, pulse from parapet, promise from orchards) are described on the page, shaping the ritual sequence. No setup (late signal, second third) (−0.4), two distinct beats (capture, weave) +0.9, closure linkage (seed transformation depends on captured essence) +1.0, moderate causal pressure (enables succor) +0.8, some specificity (three sources named) +0.4. Summary-only capture (told he "captured," not shown through resistance or cost) (−0.6). Base ~2.1 + 3.1 positives – 1.0 friction = 4.2, lifted for mechanical clarity to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The verdant parapet and waterfall are present in setup, frame the encounter with Elowen (middle), and supply the ritual's raw material (essence from waterfall and parapet). The setting provides resources (essence sources) and atmosphere but does not constrain choice—Lirien's ritual could occur elsewhere with different sources. Early signal +0.6, two beats (encounter, ritual) +0.9, closure linkage (essences enable tree) +0.5, low causal pressure (postcard function) +0.3, moderate swappability (−0.6). Base ~1.7, round to 5.2 for resource provision and thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Upon the hush of budding hope" appears in the opening line and "budding hope" recurs in the final third ("Budding hope swelled"). The timeframe is evocative but vague—no clock, urgency, or deadline shapes tactics. Setup +0.4, closure reprise +0.3, no middle constraint (−0.5), ornamental (time does not narrow options) (−0.8). Base ~(−0.6), floor at 3.4 for lyric coherence without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"To preserve the color of wonder" is named in setup ("Lirien's motivation burned deep"), referenced during the ritual ("preserve... by capturing essence"), and fulfilled at closure (tree blooms, wonder restored). The desire drives plot but is not dramatized through conflicted choice—no on-page friction between preserving wonder and another want or cost. Early signal +0.5, three beats (declaration, ritual, resolution) +1.4, closure linkage (tree) +0.8, low causal pressure (told-only friction) +0.4, no visible cost tied to motivation (−0.6), somewhat swappable (could be "restore magic" or "heal despair") (−0.5). Base ~1.0 + 3.1 positives – 1.1 friction = 3.0, lifted for thematic coherence to 5.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Radiant hush" recurs throughout (opening, ritual, final nod: "radiant hush enveloped all"). The tone is consistent—lyric, elevated, calm—but does not modulate with pressure; peak beats (ritual climax, tree eruption) maintain the same hushed cadence as the opening. Early signal +0.5, four mentions across beats +1.4, closure linkage (final image) +0.6, low causal pressure (atmosphere, not constraint) +0.3, static mood (no intensification under stress) (−0.7). Base ~1.7, round to 4.7 for coherent atmosphere without dynamic range.</comment>
