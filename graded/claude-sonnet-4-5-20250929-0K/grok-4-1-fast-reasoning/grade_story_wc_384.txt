<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—revenge for abandonment transformed into a quest for release—is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The final "unlinking" feels like a completed ritual rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost; we see him perform steps but not wrestle with what he's giving up. Interiority leans heavily on abstract formulations ("wisdom had endured," "catharsis") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The calligrapher's craft never constrains a micro-choice on the page; his skill serves backstory but not present stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the opening lines, satisfying the test. The closure unit—Elias severing the tether via blood ritual—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (a stance crystallization freeing him from grudge), but the cost remains asserted ("no longer bound") rather than shown through a foreclosed option or visible trade-off. The accumulative lens (ritual steps, stalactite rhythm, aurora as witness) is taught early but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; we are told he is free without seeing what freedom now denies him. Causality is clean within the ritual sequence, but the ritual itself solves a problem (the tether) introduced only in this scene, weakening necessity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary, aurora, and stalactites are vividly rendered and establish a coherent atmosphere. However, setting remains postcard-descriptive; the cavern does not constrain Elias's choices or supply a resource that alters his tactics. The heritage rose thorn is handled as a tool, but the sanctuary itself functions as backdrop rather than pressure. Spatial choreography is minimal (kneeling, inscribing on the floor) and does not shift options or charge the closure image beyond mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias seeking release from the chain of treason—is signaled early, but pressure remains static: he arrives at the sanctuary intending the ritual, performs it without complication, and succeeds. No reversal or tightening narrows his options; the ritual unfolds as a checklist (draw thorn, pierce wrist, inscribe counter-strokes, feel chain snap). Cost is declared ("embracing the half-life") but not legible as a trade-off on the page. The emperor's corruption and the treason's impact are backstory; no present antagonist or constraint tests Elias's commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme—forgiveness of the unfinished, transformation of abandonment into self-forged mastery—emerges from Elias's arc and is woven through imagery (thorn, blood, counter-strokes). The final image ("thorn now of healing rather than harm") attempts resonance but tips into direct statement rather than non-literal answer. The story resists overt moralizing until "In forgiving the unfinished apprenticeship, he had unlinked not just fate, but generations of grudge," which summarizes rather than lets the image speak. Subtext operates in the ritual mechanics but emotional complexity is limited; Elias's internal contradiction is told, not shown in conflicting action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent, establishing a heightened, lyric register ("pearl twilight," "spectral grasp," "invisible tether"). However, the voice leans toward ornamental phrasing that obscures urgency: "stalactites dripped their slow litany," "aurora ribbons wove through the marble dome." Psychic distance remains far throughout; we are told Elias's feelings ("trembled not from cold but catharsis") rather than inhabiting his sensory present under pressure. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression is attempted but the result feels distancing rather than intensifying.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the ritual sequence carries figurative language ("invisible absolution," "stalactites dripped faster now, syncing with his heartbeat," "aurora swirling in approval or warning") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops recur: "calibrated treason" appears four times, "stalactites drip" anchors six beats with minimal variation, "wisely enduring" is repeated. Template cadence: "The treason had been… But wisdom had endured… Tonight, as stalactites dripped…" uses parallel "The X" / "But Y" / "Tonight, Z" stems. Mixed metaphor: "invisible chain" and "key of thorn" lack coherent vehicle logic. Density is low; many sentences restate prior content ("to forgive the unfinished meant embracing the half-life" after we've been told he seeks release). Register drifts into abstraction ("catharsis," "recalibrated into quiet legend") that clashes with the embodied ritual. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph), triggering the −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The calligraphy forger + blood-ink ritual offers a specific synthesis, and the sanctuary under aurora provides vivid atmosphere. However, the emotional arc—revenge → catharsis via symbolic rite—follows a familiar template: wronged apprentice, symbolic severance, declared freedom. The treason itself (forged edicts toppling an empire) remains backstory ornament rather than on-page friction. No bold risk heightens stakes; the ritual proceeds without obstacle, and the final image ("thorn now of healing") restates theme directly. Transformation test: the plot could swap "calligrapher" for "alchemist" and "thorn" for "vial" with minimal structural change.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias (calligraphy forger) is the protagonist and focalizer, present throughout. His craft is backstory; the on-page action is ritual performance, not forgery. No decision alters tactics—he arrives intending the unlinking and completes it without complication. Observation and summary dominate. Present in setup, middle ritual, and ending, satisfying gate structure, but his choices do not create turns. Swappable with "ritual practitioner" or similar. Band guidance: functional but replaceable, no causal pressure at beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Heritage rose thorn appears in setup (drawn from robes), middle (pressed to wrist, pierces old mark, dipped in blood), and ending (tucked away, "thorn now of healing"). Beats: (1) drawn and described, (2) used to pierce and inscribe, (3) final image. Causal work: the thorn's tip "had pricked his palm during the forging, mingling his blood with the ink"—this past action establishes the ritual logic. Present cost: piercing the wrist to draw blood. Closure linkage: the thorn's transformation ("healing rather than harm") charges the final image. Specificity: its heritage (emperor's garden) and prior blood-binding matter. Satisfies all three gates and shows beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage, but the thorn does not narrow Elias's options or impose trade-offs on the page—its use is straightforward. Band: essential across beats, contributing to ending charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Calibrated treason" anchors backstory (forged edicts that toppled the emperor) and recurs as thematic label. Setup: introduced early. Middle: Elias recalls "each treasonous flourish" and unmakes them. Ending: "calibrated treason recalibrated into quiet legend." However, the treason itself is past; on-page stakes concern the unlinking ritual, not active betrayal. The concept shapes theme but does not change present options or tactics. No causal pressure in scene. Swappable with "past crime" or "buried guilt." Band: functional presence, thematic echo, but does not drive on-page turns.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Wisely enduring" appears three times as descriptor: "He was wisely enduring," "wisdom had endured through exile's chill," "wisely enduring the thorn's bite." The trait is told rather than shown constraining a choice. No visible trade-off: Elias does not forgo an easier path or pay a cost tied to endurance on the page. The ritual proceeds smoothly; his endurance is asserted but not tested. Swappable with "patient" or "resilient." Band: present and logically consistent, but label-only without on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unlink" is the ritual's goal, stated in setup ("Tonight… Elias would unlink himself"), executed in the middle (inscribing counter-strokes, "Each unlink severed a thread"), and completed at closure ("felt the invisible chain snap"). Beats: (1) intention declared, (2) ritual steps, (3) chain snaps. Causal work: the unlinking drives the sequence. However, no complication or failed attempt; the action succeeds as planned without redefining options. Closure linkage: the snap is the climax. Specificity: tied to blood ritual and thorn mechanics. Satisfies gates and shows causal role, but the action is straightforward—easily renamed ("sever," "release") with minor edits. Band: shapes key turn and ending, but lacks strong irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"A key with no apparent lock" is described in setup: "the thorn… served as the method: a key with no apparent lock, for the link was not of iron but of essence." Middle: thorn pierces the mark, unlocking the tether. Ending: "the key of thorn had found its lockless home in his soul's hidden chamber." The metaphor is explained rather than demonstrated; its mechanics (blood-to-blood ritual) are signaled but the "key" framing feels ornamental. The thorn's function (pierce, draw blood, inscribe) would work without the key/lock conceit. Swappable with "tool of release." Band: present across structure, logically consistent, but the "no apparent lock" framing does not shape attempts or impose constraint—it's a narrative label for ritual logic already clear.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Marble sanctuary under aurora is established in the opening and sustained throughout. Setup: vivid description (quartz veins, stalactites, pearl twilight). Middle: aurora and stalactites witness the ritual. Ending: "marble sanctuary stood sentinel." Atmosphere is strong, but setting does not pressure Elias's choices or supply resources that alter outcome. The cavern is a stage, not a constraint. No micro-setting use: Elias kneels, inscribes on the floor, but the marble and aurora remain postcard elements. Swappable with any remote ritual site. Band: functional atmosphere, present in closure image, but does not drive tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"As stalactites drip" recurs as rhythmic marker: opening, middle ("Stalactites dripped faster now, syncing with his heartbeat"), and ending ("stalactites resuming their drip"). The dripping tracks ritual duration but does not tighten decisions. No live clock: Elias is undisturbed and completes the rite at his own pace. Time is textural, not tactical. The stalactites' acceleration mid-ritual suggests rising intensity but does not alter Elias's moves. Band: atmospheric presence with purposeful recurrence, but vague tracking without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To forgive the unfinished" is stated early: "His motivation burned deep: to forgive the unfinished… when the emperor… had abandoned their shared craft." Middle: the ritual enacts forgiveness by unlinking. Ending: "In forgiving the unfinished apprenticeship, he had unlinked not just fate, but generations of grudge." The motivation is told and drives the ritual structure. However, no on-page friction between desire and cost: Elias arrives resolved and completes the act without internal contradiction or competing want. Dramatization is summary-level. Band: shapes the arc and ending, but told-only with minimal conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Pearl twilight" is introduced in the opening ("pearl twilight bathed the cavern"), recurs in middle ("Pearl twilight deepened"), and frames the ending ("its pearl twilight a testament to wisely endured redemption"). Tone is ethereal, solemn, and elevated throughout, modulating subtly (deepening at the ritual's peak). Coherence is strong. Closure linkage: the twilight charges the final image as "testament." However, tone remains static—no sharp turn or pressure-driven shift. The twilight supports mood but does not reweight stakes. Band: coherent and purposefully modulated, contributes to ending charge, but lacks dynamic shift under pressure.</comment>
