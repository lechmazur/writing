<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation ("sculpt possibility from ashes of 'never'") is told rather than dramatized through concrete choices under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstract language ("luminous disbelief," "pixelated amnesty") that reads more like thematic echo than character-particular thought. The final vow to follow the trail tomorrow displaces the climactic choice off-page. Backstory about the wife's death and prior vows appears but doesn't sufficiently anchor present micro-choices that would earn the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who/where/when emerges gradually across the first third without clear anchors by ~120 words, creating drift (−0.4). The closure unit—vowing to follow the trail—defers agency to an off-page future rather than landing a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost now. The hitchhiker's vanishing, the glass flake discovery, and the scaffold-wrap map feel sequenced by coincidence rather than protagonist causality. Under a situational or accumulative lens, the piece needed a crystallized stance or reweighted image with undeniable pressure; instead the ending summarizes intent without cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mountain pullout and scaffold wrap are vividly rendered and the wrap's "fluttering cartography" provides a concrete map that shapes the protagonist's next move. Sensory detail is selective and the body (calloused fingers, kneeling, breath catching) grounds key beats. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than constraint—the environment does not narrow options or force a trade-off at closure, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to trust the stranger's implicit invitation and follow the hidden path—is signaled but never tested on the page. The hitchhiker's vanishing and the discoveries (flake, map) arrive via coincidence rather than protagonist agency. The final vow to follow the trail tomorrow postpones escalation and visible cost, leaving no on-page tightening that forecloses a live option or exacts a felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of forgiveness and re-opened possibility emerges through the motifs (pixelated amnesty, bridge-song, scaffold map), but the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "possibility emerged, sculpted from luminous ashes." The wet-plate flake and bridge imagery recur but function more as symbolic tokens than constraints that charge the closure. The piece withholds embodied insight in favor of abstract recap.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and carries a lyric, reflective register throughout. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated abstraction ("luminous disbelief," "pixelated amnesty," "ephemeral patterns") that feels authorial rather than character-particular for a bridge-side fiddler. Perceptual signature is present ("dynamically observant") but applied as a label more than lived selectivity. No dialogue appears, so subtext and voice distinction tests do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats carries figurative language or elevated diction ("gilding the aspens in golden disbelief," "merciful anonymity," "spectral wings"). Paraphrase loops appear: the concept of "pixelated amnesty" is restated across multiple beats without added pressure. Template cadence and synonym churn ("luminous" appears six times) flatten momentum. Register drift into poetic abstraction clashes with the fiddler's working-class occupation. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering cumulative penalty (−1.7) and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The premise—mysterious hitchhiker leaves clues that reopen a guarded heart—follows a familiar template without fresh transformation. The wet-plate collodion flake and scaffold-wrap map are specific objects, but their function (breadcrumb trail to redemption) reads as decorative rather than inevitable. The emotional arc (grief → guardedness → renewed hope) proceeds without surprising turns or moral calculus that would complicate the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The bridge-song fiddler is present throughout and plays the fiddle at the end, but the act of playing does not create a key turn or alter tactics—it recounts events already concluded. The character's decisions (to examine the flake, to vow to follow the trail) are observational and deferred rather than pressured choices with immediate cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The wet-plate collodion glass flake appears in two distinct beats: discovery and pocketing, then referenced in the song and final paragraph. Its "pixelated amnesty" reframes the protagonist's vow but does not constrain a choice or shape the ending's action—it is carried as a talisman rather than used. Present in setup, middle, and closure participation, but causal pressure is weak (−0.6 for swappability with any relic).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Pixelated amnesty is named and thematically echoed throughout but never shapes an on-page stake or tactic. The concept remains abstract and decorative, invoked in reflection and song rather than tested through a choice with visible cost. It functions as theme claim, not causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dynamically observant is labeled once ("Dynamically observant by trade") and applied to noticing the glass flake and reading the scaffold wrap's pattern. These observations enable discovery but do not constrain action or exact a trade-off—the trait is convenient rather than costly. No visible friction or price tied to this attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Recount appears centrally: the protagonist plays the fiddle and sings the tale aloud in the final third, weaving the events into a bridge-song. This act structures the ending and participates in closure, but the recount itself does not redefine options or impose cost—it summarizes rather than transforms. Present across beats and ending, but lacks causal pressure that would push the score higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The scaffold wrap flutters are introduced mid-story and decode into a map that points to the concealed trail. The method is signaled and its mechanics (billowing plastic, shadows forming outlines) are described. However, the map appears as a gift rather than a problem the protagonist must solve, and it does not constrain attempts—it simply reveals the path. Setup and payoff present, but minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The mountain scenic pullout is named early and provides spatial grounding for the entire sequence. The setting supplies resources (the glass flake, the scaffold wrap) but does not pressure the protagonist's choice—it functions as stage rather than crucible. No trade-off or tactic shift arises from the setting's constraints.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>After the hitchhiker vanishes signals the inciting moment and frames the discovery sequence. However, time does not tighten decisions—the protagonist has ample leisure to examine the flake, observe the scaffold, play the fiddle, and recount the tale. No live clock or deadline alters tactics or escalates pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>To sculpt possibility from the ashes of "never" is articulated clearly and tied to the protagonist's history (the wife's death, the vow never to trust strangers). The motivation frames the arc but is told rather than dramatized through conflicted on-page choices. The ending vow to follow the trail expresses the motivation but defers the cost to an off-page future, weakening immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Luminous disbelief is named explicitly and recurs as a tonal marker ("luminous wonder," "luminous against the dusk," "luminous ashes," "disbelief lingered"). The tone is coherent but static—disbelief does not modulate meaningfully with escalation or resolve at closure. The repetition reads as decorative rather than a tonal shift that charges the final image.</comment>
