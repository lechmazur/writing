<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is defined almost entirely by the repeated label "infinitely patient" and "cryptic," with no embodied contradictions or internal friction. His motivation ("to restore shared balance") remains an abstract declaration never tested by a trade-off or competing desire. The spectral townsfolk appear as passive recipients rather than pressure sources, and the protagonist's choices feel procedural—strike fork, walk, observe—without visible cost or renunciation. The ending grants him complete success with no foreclosed path, reading as wish-fulfillment rather than earned transformation or Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who, where, and when within the first paragraph (waiving Orientation debt), but causality is weak: Elias's actions (striking the fork, pacing) trigger rebuilding through unmotivated magic with no resistance, failure, or discovery. The ending delivers a Decisive Change (town revived, ghosts solidified), yet the cost is invisible—Elias simply "vanished into the wild dawn" with no forfeited option, visible sacrifice, or reweighted stance. The narrative reads as and-then sequencing under a vague Accumulative lens that never meaningfully tightens or deepens; the fork's mechanics are asserted rather than discovered under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ancient archway and cobblestones recur throughout and charge the final image ("steps danced forever"), meeting the micro-setting gate and earning ~5.0 baseline. Sensory detail leans heavily on visual and auditory clichés ("shadows clung like forgotten whispers," "dust across cobblestones") with minimal embodiment or POV filter. Spatial choreography is coherent, but the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics—it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (revive Perivale) is signaled early, but pressure never escalates: Elias encounters no failure, adaptation, or trade-off. His first fork strike immediately triggers ghost footsteps, and subsequent actions (pacing, striking again) proceed in a frictionless success cascade. No reversal narrows options; the spectral townsfolk cooperate without complication. The ending resolves via his uncontested action with no visible price paid—no stamina cost, no personal renunciation, no failed alternative—reading as convenient magic rather than earned escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme (harmony/discord, collective rhythm) emerges from recurring imagery (footsteps, balance, rhythm) and the final image does offer a non-literal answer through restored cadence. However, the piece leans heavily on explicit theme statements: "the stones remember," "Balance walks again," "the fork sleeps; the stones sing eternal," and the closing paragraph moralizes overtly ("Balance, once lost, now the heartbeat of stone and soul"). The thematic work is delivered through assertion rather than discovered particulars, and the final lines veer into thematic echo. No counter-reading or friction complicates the harmony-is-good premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated register ("cryptic," "infinitely patient," "wild hush"). Perceptual signature is generic—Elias notices archetypal ghost-town details without character-specific bias. Dialogue (two cryptic lines) feels ornamental rather than goal-driven. Under peak pressure (the climactic revival), diction remains uniform rather than modulating with urgency, and filter verbs ("watched," "nodded") dull immediacy at closure. The repeated phrase "infinitely patient" and stock descriptors like "wild hush" approach template cadence but remain just shy of −0.4 threshold.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn damage clarity and momentum: "ghost town" / "forsaken place" / "ghost town" recur within three paragraphs; "infinitely patient" appears four times; "wild hush" five times, often in identical syntactic slots. Template cadence runs dominate middle paragraphs ("He struck… He moved… He halted…"). Stock metaphors cluster without fresh vehicle: "shadows clung like forgotten whispers," "hours bled into dusk," "balance held." These artifacts touch the closure beat ("wild hush lingered softly, wild no more"), triggering baseline −0.6, escalated to −1.0 for spread, plus −0.7 for closure contamination. Capping at 4.9 per the artifact penalty pack and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise (bell tuner revives ghost town via tuning fork and rhythm) is a familiar fantasy/magical-realism template executed without transformation. Elias's occupation ("cryptic bell tuner") and tool (ebony fork struck by lightning) read as stock mystical-craftsman tropes with no fresh angle. The emotional arc and plot structure (lone wanderer, procedural success, departure) could transfer unchanged to necromancer/ruins or bard/lost city with only superficial edits, failing the transformation test. No bold risk-taking or non-obvious synthesis elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his actions (striking fork, pacing) trigger plot beats, but his choices are procedural rather than pressured—he never faces a dilemma, adapts tactics, or pays a cost. His "cryptic" label is ornamental; his decisions do not alter stakes or tactics. Functional but swappable with any competent mystical artisan.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ebony tuning fork appears in setup (paragraph 8), middle beats (struck twice on-page, held aloft), and closure (slipped into satchel, referenced in final reflection). It enables the revival and reappears with reweighted meaning at the end ("the fork sleeps; the stones sing eternal"). It is not swappable—its lightning-struck origin and resonance are specific—but it resolves a problem it did not help create and the climactic use is summary-heavy ("capturing and projecting the beat") rather than tactile. Scores ~6.8 for three-gate presence and causal enabling, capped by summary execution and no visible cost tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the explicit dominant stake signaled in paragraph 6, shapes all middle beats (Elias's fork strikes, pacing, the spectral footsteps multiplying, buildings reforming), and delivers the closure outcome (town revived, ghosts solidified). It is indispensable—remove it and no story remains. However, the mechanics are asserted rather than discovered, and no alternative or failure complicates the path, lowering the causal pressure score within the 7–8 band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Infinitely patient" is repeated four times as a label but never dramatized with a visible trade-off or constraint. Elias waits hours for the ghost steps to manifest, but the wait itself is summarized ("Hours bled into dusk") with no impatience to resist, no cost of delay, no tactical alteration. The attribute is ornamental and could be omitted without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is the central action: Elias's fork strikes and pacing trigger the town's repair ("Cracks in walls began to seal," "Roofs lifted from rubble"), and the ending ratifies the rebuild's success. The action is signaled early, drives multiple beats, and is present at closure ("Perivale thrived anew"). It is not swappable—revival is the plot. However, the rebuild proceeds without complication or visible cost to the protagonist, preventing entry to the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method (rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones) is seeded early ("faint vibrations lingered," "the stones remember"), becomes the explicit mechanism mid-story ("ghost of footsteps, ethereal taps"), and charges the final image ("steps danced forever in harmonious hush"). It appears in setup, middle beats (Elias joins the spectral footsteps), and closure, meeting all three gates. It is specific and not easily swapped. However, the mechanics are told rather than discovered under pressure ("the fork capturing and projecting the beat"), and the method does not constrain or complicate Elias's choices. Scores ~6.4 for three-gate presence and thematic resonance, capped by summary execution and no visible friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The ancient archway is named in the opening line, recurs as a spatial anchor ("under the archway," "at the archway"), and appears in the final image ("Under the ancient archway, steps danced forever"). It provides framing and atmosphere but never constrains a choice, supplies a resource, or pressures tactics. It is swappable with "town square" or "gate" without structural loss. Scores ~4.8 for three-touch presence and closure participation, capped by ornamental function and swappability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Before the collapse" is mentioned in paragraphs 5, 20, 36, and 49, framing the urgency and appearing at closure. However, the collapse never materializes as a live clock or ticking constraint—Elias works at his own pace with no time pressure, no failed race, no cost of delay. The timeframe is thematic backdrop rather than tactical force. Functional but replaceable with "abandoned" or "in ruins."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to restore shared balance" is declared in paragraph 7 and restated at closure ("Balance restored," "Balance, once lost, now the heartbeat"). It explains Elias's goal but is never dramatized as conflicted or tested by a competing want. He encounters no temptation, doubt, or cost that forces him to re-examine or prioritize this desire. The motivation is told-only and ornamental, swappable with "revive harmony" or "heal the town."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Wild hush" appears five times across the piece (paragraphs 2, 13, 28, 47, 51) and modulates slightly at the end ("wild hush lingered softly, wild no more, but hushed with life"). It is present in setup, middle, and closure, meeting all three gates. The tone is coherent and the final reprise reweights the phrase with life versus desolation. However, the recurrence reads as template-cadence repetition rather than purposeful pattern-teaching, and the shift at closure is told ("wild no more") rather than enacted through sensory change. Scores ~5.9 for three-gate presence and attempted thematic charge, capped by ornamental execution and synonym churn.</comment>
