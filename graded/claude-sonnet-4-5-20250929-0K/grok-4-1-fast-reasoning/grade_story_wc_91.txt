<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's philanthropic impulse is established early, but his interior life remains abstract—"yearned to understand the texture of transformation" never translates into contradictory micro-choices under pressure. The climactic release of the bugs is accidental ("uncorked the bottles accidentally as a gust from the volcano snatched the satchel"), undermining agency at the pivotal beat. Embodied emotion is sparse; most interiority reads as poetic summary ("purpose solidified, drawing him from giver to guide") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The widow and child appear healed without on-page cost to Elias beyond his prior destitution, so the transformation feels declared rather than earned through foreclosed paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive adequately by the opening paragraphs. The drive lens reads Situational-Accumulative Hybrid: Elias orchestrates "coincidences" and the celestial alignment frames expectation, but the climax hinges on accidental prophecy fulfillment—coincidence resolving rather than complicating—which violates Situational constraints. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("destitution transmuted… purpose solidified"), but the cost is asserted in summary ("transformation's weave was coincidence orchestrated in whispers") without a visible choice or forfeiture on the page. The prophecy mechanism is introduced late ("ancient lore" appears only at the climax) and conveniently solves the problem it did not help create, breaking causal linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Black sand, bioluminescent plankton, and the volcano's crimson glow create vivid sensory anchors filtered through Elias's purposeful journey. The beach setting constrains the final beat (villagers converge, bugs swirl upward), meeting the minimal 9+ gate requirement. However, much description remains postcard-like ("vivid obsidian sands gleamed under starfire") without tactical pressure, and the satchel—key to the climax—is handled generically ("satchel open") rather than with embodied detail. Spatial choreography of the villagers' emergence and the bugs' flight is coherent but leans toward spectacle over choice-shaping constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias seeking "the texture of transformation"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. One tightening occurs when the gust snatches the satchel, but this is externally imposed luck rather than protagonist agency under the inferred lens. The prophecy fulfillment ("calming the mountain's wrath") introduces a secondary stake late without prior setup, and the resolution (ailments fade, volcano sighs) is granted by coincidence rather than earned choice. No visible trade-off or foreclosed path charges the final image; the bugs simply "faded into the alignment" without cost to Elias beyond what he'd already given away before the story began.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of transformation and orchestrated coincidence emerges through recurring images (bugs as bottled light, black sand, celestial dance). The final line attempts thematic closure ("transformation's weave was coincidence orchestrated in whispers"), but this reads as overt statement rather than non-literal answer arising from particulars. Subtext in villagers' unknowing convergence and Elias's quiet machinations is present, yet the prophecy twist undercuts thematic coherence—if transformation is "orchestrated," the accidental fulfillment contradicts the premise. The bugs' release offers visual resonance but no earned wisdom tied to Elias's internal arc; the ending summarizes theme rather than embodying it in a final charged image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction leans heavily ornate ("destitute philanthropist," "inexorable pull," "velvet breath") and clusters purple phrasing in nearly every paragraph ("vibrant hush," "whispering hush," "slow dance," "texture of transformation"), creating register drift from the scene's immediacy. Perceptual signature is present—Elias notices light, coincidence, transformation—but the voice converges toward stock lyricism under pressure rather than tightening with character-specific idiom. Dialogue appears minimally (one line: "To share the light"), so most voice issues reside in narration. Psychic distance remains controlled, though the final summative turn ("he stood renewed") asserts closure rather than letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting pervades: "vibrant hush," "whispering hush," "slow dance of celestial bodies," and "texture of transformation" recur as unearned poetic stock phrases without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear ("a vibrant hush cloaked the world" / "The whispering hush deepened"), and template cadence runs in the opening ("He had given away… his final jar… Now, penniless…"). Mixed metaphors muddle clarity: "light as sea foam" while "clutched a weathered satchel" contradicts weightlessness; "miniature auroras" for bugs inflates scale. Figurative density in the climax (fireflowers, silent symphony, velvet breath) obscures propulsion. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering −1.7 baseline plus additional deductions for spread, and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work (bugs pulse "in rhythm with the aligning planets"), but scaffold redundancy and synonym churn drag momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—philanthropist accidentally fulfills prophecy via bottled lightning bugs—combines familiar elements (chosen-one trope, elemental prophecy, destitute giver) without a non-obvious synthesis. The "orchestrates coincidences" attribute holds potential freshness, but on-page execution defaults to passive convergence; villagers follow cryptic notes and shells with no friction. The prophecy arrives only at the climax as a convenient rule change to solve the volcano threat Elias did not create, reducing hindsight inevitability. Specificity in world detail (black sand, bioluminescent plankton) offers surface texture, but the emotional arc—destitution to renewed purpose—follows a template trajectory without transformation test resistance. No bold structural risk; the piece plays safely within lush-fantasy conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his prior giving sets the frame, but his climactic choice is negated by accident ("uncorked the bottles accidentally"). He observes and yearns but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics at the closure beat. Meets setup and is present at closure, but middle development shows no constraining choice—he simply walks the detour and kneels. The accidental release strips agency, capping the score and preventing higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bottled bugs appear early (setup), are carried and referenced during the journey (middle), and drive the climax when released. Their "soft pulses" sync with the planets, and their flight calms the volcano—causal pressure at closure. However, Elias does not choose to release them; a gust snatches the satchel. The bugs' mechanics (light amplification, planetary sync) arrive only at the climax without prior teaching. Two distinct beats (carrying, releasing) plus closure linkage and causal effect earn mid-high range, but the accidental trigger and late-breaking mechanics cap the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Vibrant hush" and "whispering hush" recur as atmospheric labels throughout but do not shape stakes or constrain tactics. The concept remains tonal decoration; no choice turns on the hush, and it does not alter options at the ending. Present in setup and closure as repeated phrase, but purely ornamental. Meets minimal setup and closure mention, eligible up to ~6.0 under lyric allowance, but without any beat involvement or causal pressure, score remains low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Orchestrates coincidences" is labeled early (notes in bowls, scattered shells) and frames Elias's method, meeting setup. The villagers' convergence shows the attribute's effect in the middle (development beat). At closure, the attribute is thematically summarized ("coincidence orchestrated in whispers") but does not constrain a final choice—the prophecy fulfillment is accidental, not orchestrated. Two beats (setup, middle effect) plus thematic closure mention allow eligibility above 5.0, but lack of on-page cost or final-beat constraint limits the score. Swappable with "subtle manipulator" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The detour along lava cliffs is chosen mid-journey when fog veils the direct path. It provides spatial variation and allows Elias to reflect on his orchestrations, meeting middle development. However, the detour does not redefine options or create a turn—he reaches the beach as planned, and the climax (gust releasing bugs) is unconnected to the detour choice. Present in two gates (middle, implicit in arrival), but causal linkage to closure is absent. Could be replaced with "direct path through village" with minor scene adjustments, indicating mid-replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The prophecy mechanism appears only at the climax ("ancient lore" introduced in the final third) with no prior setup or teaching. Elias is "ignorant of the tale," so the method does not shape his attempts or tactics. The accidental fulfillment ("uncorked the bottles accidentally") grants closure participation but as a late-breaking rule that resolves a problem (volcano's wrath) the element did not help create. Missing setup gate (−0.2 to −0.5 late penalty) and ornamental middle; closure participation alone allows ~4.0 range, but swappability and convenience capping apply, preventing higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The black sand beach at the volcano's foot is the story's primary location, anchoring setup and closure. The volcano's rumbles and crimson glow supply atmospheric pressure, and the beach serves as the convergence point where the prophecy is fulfilled—direct closure linkage. However, the setting does not constrain Elias's tactics (he kneels and the gust acts) or provide resources that alter outcome; it functions as stage rather than active pressure. Three gates met (setup, implicit middle presence, closure), plus specificity (black sand, bioluminescent plankton), but passive role in choice-shaping limits score to mid-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The celestial alignment ("slow dance… rare alignment") is signaled early and frames the journey's timing (setup). The alignment's "flux" amplifies the bugs' glow at the climax (closure participation), creating causal effect. However, no live clock tightens Elias's decisions; the journey takes vague "hours" and midnight arrival is atmospherically noted but does not pressure tactics. Two gates (setup, closure) with causal effect at ending allow mid-5 range, but lack of middle decision-pressure and minimal tactical constraint prevent higher scores. Could be replaced with "during eclipse" with minor adjustments, indicating moderate replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To understand the texture of transformation" is stated early as Elias's motivation (setup). The final beat asserts he "felt it then—the texture of transformation… purpose solidified" (closure mention). However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicted micro-choices; Elias walks, kneels, and the gust acts. No friction between want and cost shapes the middle. Two gates (setup, closure summary) allow eligibility near 5.0, but told-only execution and lack of choice-driven dramatization cap the score in functional-replaceable band. Swappable with "to find renewal" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Vibrant hush" recurs throughout as tonal marker (setup, middle, closure: "In the vibrant hush that followed"). The tone remains stable—reverent, lyrical—without modulation under pressure; peak beats (gust, bug release, volcano's sigh) carry the same register as the opening. The hush charges the final image thematically ("quiet miracles") but does not escalate or shift cadence when pressure rises. Three gates met with closure linkage, but static mood and lack of pressure-responsive modulation limit the score to mid-5 band. Coherent but not dynamically purposeful.</comment>
