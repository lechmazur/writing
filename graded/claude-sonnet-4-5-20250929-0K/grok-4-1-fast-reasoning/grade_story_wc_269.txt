<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is characterized primarily through external markers—his witness role, tapping habit, isolation—rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The motivation to understand disappeared paths is clear and sustained, but internal conflict remains thin; the choice to broadcast feels more like resolution of a puzzle than a foreclosure with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present in gripping the railing and drumming fingers, but these gestures recur without deepening under pressure. The final stance crystallization reads as intellectual clarity rather than a decision that trades one path for another.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines. The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elias assembles fragments (logs, atlas page, core samples) in a pattern that builds density until the interplay of bleaching and gyres crystallizes at the climax. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final broadcast and pocket-folded atlas page reconfigure his witness role from passive observer to active sharer, with the cost felt in his decades of isolation now reweighted as necessary prelude. One causal seam: the "delayed revelation crested like a rogue wave" arrives without prior on-page friction or false hypothesis that the revelation overturns, reducing the sense of earned discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The monitoring station supplies concrete sensory anchors—rusted railing, solar hum, corroded holodisks, groaning moorings—that filter through Elias's professional and memorial priorities. Spatial choreography is clear across deck, observation level, and workbench. The station's moored-yet-drifting state directly mirrors and pressures Elias's suspended life, meeting the 9+ gate test: environment charges the final image when he steps to the deck "tethered eternally to the sea's slow mending." The post-ban Pacific setting supplies world rules (inertia of sea rise, nascent coral regeneration) that constrain his inquiry and enable the closure insight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering why shipping paths disappeared—is signaled early and pursued through assembling data fragments. Pressure accumulates as Elias gathers holodisks, aligns overlays, and incorporates core samples, but the escalation is methodical rather than urgent; no live obstacle or ticking cost forces trade-offs. The revelation that reefs destabilized gyres is a knowledge gain, not a choice that forecloses an option, and the broadcast decision feels like sharing knowledge rather than paying a price. One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes "not end, but metamorphosis," reweighting his witness role, but the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the interplay of bleaching, rise, and regeneration: paths vanish and re-emerge in cycles, and witness testimony becomes an act of hope. The atlas page as "torn symbol of loss" that becomes "proof of cyclic hope" offers a concrete thematic vessel without overt moralizing. The "periodically eternal" motif charges the ending when tides become metaphor for mending, and the final image—"paths awaited rediscovery"—resonates without stating a moral. One weakness: "metamorphosis" and "cyclic hope" edge toward abstraction rather than remaining anchored in the specific mechanics of gyres and polyps that the story has earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with Elias throughout; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and poetic ("bone under relentless heat," "rogue wave," "tethered eternally"), consistent with a solitary observer's reflective voice, though the register occasionally drifts into writerly abstraction ("Morse-like pulses," "liturgy against isolation") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. The tapping practice is described but does not carry distinct idiom or perceptual signature that differentiates this mind from a generic lyric narrator. Free indirect style is clean, but the voice lacks a perceptual signature—what Elias notices is filtered by his role (witness, scientist) but not by contradictory biases or blind spots that reveal character under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths that support the accumulative design. Information density is high in the assembly sequence, where each beat layers data points. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Taps guided his hands, rhythms dictating piece by piece" closely echoes "tapping rhythms transmitted the assembled map"; "periodically eternal" recurs in identical phrasing three times without reweighting. Template cadence in the middle third: "He pried…gathering," "He wired…assembling," "He tapped…rhythms evolving" creates a monotonous He-verb stem run across four paragraphs. Mixed metaphor: "revelation crested like a rogue wave" after "Dawn broke with partial clarity" stacks oceanic and solar figures without coherence. Deductions: paraphrase −0.2, template cadence −0.5, mixed metaphor −0.4, stock phrase ("eyes on horizons reborn") −0.2; total artifact penalty −1.3 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—sea-level monitoring after a fossil fuel ban, with coral bleaching reshaping ocean currents—offers a climate-fiction angle grounded in plausible mechanics (reef-gyre interplay). The "delayed revelation" and assembly-of-fragments structure are familiar investigative beats, executed competently but without a non-obvious synthesis. The tapping practice is introduced as characterization but does not transform or subvert expectation; it encodes memories in "Morse-like pulses" without that encoding affecting the plot. The ending's "cyclic hope" and "paths awaited rediscovery" feel earnest but predictable within eco-recovery narratives. No close echoes of famous work, but the emotional and thematic arc could transfer to another solitary-scientist-discovers-hope frame with minimal adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elias as "coral bleaching witness" frames his motivation and supplies the reef surveys that contribute to the revelation. His witness role is present across setup (opening documentation), development (core samples from witness dives), and payoff (broadcast decision). However, his choices are data-gathering steps rather than turns that narrow options; the witness identity enables the plot but does not constrain or cost him a visible trade-off. Present in all three gates and shapes the ending, but swappable with "marine biologist" or "environmental researcher" without deep structural change. Two beats (witness dives, broadcast as witness) + closure linkage + moderate specificity = mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The atlas page appears early (forgotten drawer), is spread on the workbench during assembly, aligned with digital overlay, serves as pillow during exhaustion, and is folded in pocket at the end. Present in setup, development (pillow moment subtly reweights it as comfort object), and payoff (pocket fold signals shift from relic to proof). The page's depiction of vanished trade routes is the puzzle Elias solves, and its transformation from "torn symbol of loss" to "proof of cyclic hope" charges the closure. Three beats + early signal + closure linkage + lyric reprise = solid mid-6s. Moderate replaceability (could be a printed map or chart) and one ornamental use (sleeping on it) prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Delayed revelation" structures the entire investigation: Elias assembles fragments across the story until the gyre-destabilization insight arrives near the end. Present in setup (opening question: why paths disappeared), development (hours of assembly, partial clarity at dawn), and payoff (revelation crests, changes understanding). The concept shapes tactics (gathering logs, aligning overlays) and reweights the stake from loss to metamorphosis. However, the delay is more methodical than pressured—no false hypothesis is tested and overturned, no cost paid for waiting. The revelation itself is told rather than dramatized through a moment of perceptual shift. Two gates strongly + one weak + causal role in reweighting = low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" appears as descriptor for tidal cycles and the moon-tide pulse, anchoring the thematic frame of cyclical return. It modulates Elias's tapping rhythms and recurs in the final line ("periodically eternal dance of tides"). Present in setup (sensors "ticked eternal rhythms"), development (tapping "syncing to tidal cycles—periodically eternal"), and payoff (closing line). The attribute colors tone and theme but does not constrain an on-page choice or enable a tactic with cost; it functions as thematic echo rather than story engine. Lyric reprise + thematic coherence but no causal pressure or tradeoff = low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Assemble" is the dominant action: Elias assembles sensor logs, atlas overlay, printouts, projectors, and core samples across multiple beats. The assembly sequence drives the middle third and produces the holographic map that enables the revelation. Present in setup (decision to assemble fragments), development (aligning, wiring, incorporating samples), and payoff (assembled map transmitted in broadcast). Two major beats + causal role in revelation + closure linkage. Irreplaceability is moderate—"analyze" or "synthesize" could substitute with edits. Strong development + closure but moderate specificity = low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The tapping practice is introduced early ("fingers drummed idly," "Morse-like pulses"), recurs across the assembly sequence ("Taps guided his hands," "tapping rhythms transmitted"), and appears in the payoff (broadcast). Present in setup, development (taps encode data, sync to tidal cycles), and payoff. However, the mechanics remain vague—how tapping encodes memories or guides assembly is asserted, not demonstrated. The method does not constrain a choice or create a visible cost; it functions as character tic and thematic linkage (rhythm = tides) rather than story engine. Three beats + closure presence but low causal pressure and high replaceability = high-4s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The monitoring station supplies the physical space (deck, observation level, archives), resources (sensors, holodisks, mainframe, projectors), and isolation that frame Elias's inquiry. It pressures his choices by limiting social contact and forcing solitary problem-solving. Present in setup (opening on the station), development (lockers, workbench, salvaged projectors all enable assembly), and payoff (station broadcast capability, deck as final vantage). The moored-yet-drifting state mirrors his suspended life and charges the ending ("tethered eternally"). Three beats + causal enabling + closure charge + high specificity (buoy field, corroded archives, groaning moorings) = high-7s. Just shy of 8+ because the station's constraints do not force a trade-off or visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The post-ban timeframe (2047, two decades after bleaching, smokestacks cooled) establishes the world state and motivates the inquiry into vanished paths. Present in setup (opening exposition), development (post-ban regeneration data), and payoff (nascent corals forming new paths). The timeframe supplies context and enables the regeneration subplot, but does not impose a ticking pressure or force a time-constrained choice. Elias works across "hours" and a night-to-dawn cycle, but the urgency is self-imposed rather than externally tightened. Three gates + moderate causal role (regeneration depends on post-ban time) but no tactical pressure = high-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover why some paths disappear" is stated explicitly and pursued on-page through the entire assembly sequence. Present in setup (opening paragraph: "Why some paths disappeared gnawed at Elias"), development (gathering fragments, aligning data), and payoff (discovery and broadcast). The desire drives every beat, but lacks friction—no competing want, no cost for pursuing it, no moment where Elias weighs continuing the search against another need. The motivation is monolithic rather than conflicted. Three gates + strong causal role but zero friction or trade-off = mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Drifting moored" supplies the tonal oxymoron that pervades the story: Elias is tethered yet suspended, observer yet isolated, witness to death and nascent rebirth. The tone is elegiac and reflective throughout, modulating slightly as assembly accelerates ("urgent," "relentlessly") and resolving in the final image of "tethered eternally" awaiting rediscovery. Present in setup (opening "Drifting moored," "suspended life"), development (maintained through assembly), and payoff (final lines reprise the motif). The tone remains coherent and charges the ending, but does not modulate sharply under pressure or create a tonal turn that reweights the stake. Three gates + closure charge + thematic coherence but static arc = low-6s.</comment>
