<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (share light without fire) is clear and rooted in backstory trauma, but her interior life relies heavily on label-only emotion ("resurfacing memories," "yearning") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The polishing work shows goal-directed action, yet the final choice—holding the gem and sharing it with villagers—feels more like fulfillment of a declared plan than a decision that forecloses a credible alternative path with visible cost. Backstory dominates (~35% of the text) but anchors to present stimuli (mist, sea glass) and micro-choices (polishing strokes, venturing at dawn), meeting the BRR reflection-led exception; however, the sheer volume still flattens present-tense pressure in the middle third.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (polishing transforms sea glass into a beacon; memories accumulate and settle). Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~120 words (grotto, Elara, tonight). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara reframes her earthbound state from chain to choice, and the village adopts her method—a cadence shift that reweights her stance with visible emotional cost (unburdening, acceptance). However, cost at closure is more stated ("felt unburdened") than shown through a decisive forfeiture or visible price paid on the page, and the villagers' adoption feels convenient rather than dramatized with friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto is vividly rendered with sensory detail (mist, salt-kissed sea glass, damp stone) and recurs across beats. The setting constrains Elara's method (abrasive sands from the grotto floor, seawater as wheel) and charges the final image (grotto pulsing with shared wonder). Spatial choreography is clear, and the mist functions as atmosphere. However, the grotto does not pressure a pivotal choice—it enables rather than opposes—and the ending's "grotto's edge" is more symbolic backdrop than active constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (share light without fire) is signaled early and persists. One meaningful tightening occurs when memories resurface and Elara decides to polish the sea glass, narrowing focus from passive vigil to active transformation. The ending shows light spreading to villagers, but this feels more like declared success than a turn with visible cost or trade-off. No on-page opposition tests Elara's resolve; the sea glass yields to her work, villagers accept the beacon without skepticism, and the path from solitary grotto to shared legacy unfolds without friction or forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—earthbound longing transformed into grounded purpose—emerges through the polishing metaphor and the pearl of stillness, avoiding overt statement until the ending's "choice blooming into purpose." The sea glass as reflective vessel and the resurfacing memories as allies rather than burdens offer resonance. However, the final paragraph's explicit thematic summary ("wove her legacy," "bridges rather than burdens") edges toward moralizing, and the "reflectively vibrant harmony" phrase reads as label rather than image. The ending reweights prior material but states the answer more than it shows it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent, and the prose carries a lyric, elevated register ("zephyr of celestial petals," "pearl of stillness"). However, diction frequently drifts into poetic abstraction that reads decorative rather than character-particular ("serpentine grotto," "blooming zephyr," "reflectively vibrant"). Elara's perceptual signature is filtered through celestial metaphor but lacks micro-level idiosyncrasy. The villagers' brief dialogue ("See…") is functional but generic. Psychic distance remains stable, yet the uniform lyric texture does not modulate under pressure—high-emotion beats (polishing, venturing to village) carry the same ornate cadence as quieter exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Severe overwriting throughout: "reflectively vibrant," "zephyr bloom," "pearl of stillness," "serpentine," "blooming," and "resurfaced/resurfacing" appear in nearly every paragraph, creating decorative density that slows momentum. Paraphrase loops are frequent: "resurfaced unbidden" / "memories resurfaced in waves" / "as memories resurfaced" / "memories fully resurfaced"; "bloomed softly" / "bloom of possibility" / "blooming into purpose" / "bloomed like a zephyr-kissed flower." Template cadence: multiple sentences open with participial phrases or "As [noun]" constructions. Mixed metaphors: "mist swirling like a blooming zephyr" (zephyr is a breeze, not a visual bloom). These artifacts pervade the closure paragraph ("blooming into purpose," "reflectively vibrant harmony"), applying the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally. Filter-verb stacks ("felt lighter," "felt unburdened") dull immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—earthbound starwatcher who polishes sea glass into a non-fire light source—offers a lyric, mythic frame with some freshness. However, the emotional arc (longing → acceptance, grief → purpose) follows a familiar template without unexpected turns or moral ambiguity. The polishing method and pearl-of-stillness outcome read more magical than grounded, and the villagers' seamless adoption lacks friction or counter-pressure that would test the concept's limits. Symbolic convenience: the sea glass arrives at the perfect moment, yields easily, and solves the village's fire problem without complication. The story's lush ornamentation (serpentine, zephyr, bloom) substitutes for narrative risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (deciding to polish, venturing to the village, holding the gem high) create key beats. However, most beats are acts of fulfillment rather than decisions under conflicting pressure. Her arc is more linear progression (vigil → polish → share) than a turn that forecloses a credible alternative. She appears in the closure scene, but her final stance (earthbound as choice) is stated more than dramatized through a costly decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sea glass is handled in multiple beats: discovery, polishing across hours, weighing in palm, holding high at village, and implied continuation ("polished more shards"). Its transformation (frosted shard → reflectively vibrant gem) drives the middle sequence and its final state (pearl of stillness) charges the ending image. The object's properties (smoothed by eons, capturing starlight) matter to the plot. Swappability is low; another object would require different mechanics. Strong integration, but the sea glass does not constrain a difficult choice—it enables rather than costs.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Pearl of stillness" appears mid-story as the polishing outcome and recurs in the ending ("each birthing its pearl of stillness"). It shapes the dominant stake (light without fire) by providing the narrative mechanism. However, it does not constrain Elara's options or force a trade-off; it is the solution rather than a complicating pressure. The concept charges the final image and is irreplaceable to the story's logic, but its role is more thematic vessel than active stake-shaper.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Reflectively vibrant" appears as descriptor for the sea glass after polishing and again in the closure paragraph ("reflectively vibrant patterns," "reflectively vibrant harmony"). It is label-only; the trait does not enable or constrain an action with cost. It functions as atmospheric adjective rather than actionable attribute. Easily swappable with "luminous" or "radiant." No visible trade-off tied to this quality.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Weigh" appears once as a physical action ("paused to weigh the transformed sea glass in her palm") and once metaphorically ("recognizing the wisdom in her weigh-ed choice"). The literal weighing creates a micro-beat that transitions from work to assessment, and the metaphoric callback charges the elders' recognition. The action is purposeful but not indispensable—"examined" or "held" could substitute with minor edits. It does not drive a major turn or constrain the ending, though it does participate in the closure sequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Gem polishing is signaled early ("employed the method of gem polishing, using fine abrasive sands…seawater as her wheel") and its mechanics matter on the page: she works with deliberate strokes across hours, the surface yields, and the method's output (pearl of stillness) shapes the ending. The process drives the middle sequence and the village later adopts it ("Elara polished more shards"). Mechanics are specific enough to feel irreplaceable. However, the polishing encounters no friction or failure; it succeeds as planned without forcing a tactical adaptation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto frames the story (opening vigil, middle polishing workspace, ending beacon site) and supplies resources (abrasive sands, seawater). It recurs with charged imagery ("grotto pulsed with shared wonder") in the closure. However, the grotto enables rather than pressures; Elara never faces a constraint from the space (e.g., insufficient sand, tide timing). It is atmospheric and purposeful but does not alter a tactic or force a choice. Strong lyric reprise (first → last) reweights the stake from solitary to communal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"As memories resurface" is the stated timeframe and the phrase recurs throughout ("memories resurfaced unbidden," "as memories resurfaced," "memories fully resurfaced and settled"). However, the resurfacing is more thematic rhythm than a tightening clock. No urgency or deadline is established; Elara's work unfolds "hours blurred" without time pressure altering her tactics. The frame is present and coherent but does not drive escalation. Functional but replaceable with "over the course of one night."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation (share light without fire) is declared early with backstory anchor (festival fire scarred her village) and dramatized in the ending when she holds the sea glass high, casting light "without a single spark." The desire drives her polishing work and village demonstration. However, the motivation is fulfilled rather than conflicted on the page—no scene tests whether fire might be necessary or whether non-fire light carries its own cost. The friction between want (share light) and constraint (no fire) is told in backstory, not tested in present action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Zephyr bloom" as tone: lyric, gentle, mythic, with recurrent "zephyr" imagery (zephyr of celestial petals, blooming zephyr, zephyr-kissed flower) and "bloom" motifs throughout. The tone is coherent and consistent but does not modulate with pressure—peak beats (polishing climax, village revelation) carry the same ornate cadence as exposition. Static lushness trends mid-low. The final image does echo the tone ("blooming into purpose"), charging it slightly, but the uniformity flattens emotional peaks.</comment>
