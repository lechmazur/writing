<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Thorne's motivation (preserve a dying language through sonic textures) is clear and intensifies across the piece, driving his final action. However, interiority remains abstract—copper veins "pulsing" and "dimming" functions as visual shorthand rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic harnessing feels narrated rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure; we're told he "channeled" and "invoked" without visible struggle or tactical adjustment. No secondary character applies immediate pressure, leaving the stakes largely internal and declarative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (who, where, when) within the opening lines and moves through a compressed timeframe ("years blurred," then "one dusk," then the final ritual). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the diamond transforms from cursed to vault, the language is reborn in sound, and Thorne's purpose is "fulfilled." However, the cost remains oblique—no on-page forfeiture or visible price paid in the final beat; "his final tale etched eternally" and a faint smile suggest satisfaction without felt sacrifice. The causal link between starling patterns and echo modulation is asserted rather than demonstrated step-by-step, weakening because/therefore tightness at the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bone towers, canyon echoes, and tunnel of echoes are vivid and consistent, anchoring every beat. The flawed diamond and the flock's aerial geometries become functional micro-settings that constrain and enable Thorne's final act: he positions the gem at the tunnel mouth, synchronizes his chant to wingbeats, and the birds' shadows modulate reverberations. This charges the closure image—setting details directly shape the resolution. Sensory specificity (grit, silk, frost translated into bass, harmonics, staccato) is purposeful and POV-filtered, though at times the metaphoric density risks ornament over immediacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve tactile language essence before extinction—is signaled early and tightens as elders die and children adopt "crude tongues." One meaningful deepening occurs when Thorne discovers the flawed diamond and gambles on its curse, then escalates when he harnesses the starling flock to modulate echoes. Agency at closure is present (he "invoked," "channeled," "poured") but largely told; no live obstacle or reversal forces a tactical pivot in the final scene. The cost (dimming veins, solitude) is narrated across years rather than dramatized in a single forfeiture that alters the ending image, keeping escalation legible but not viscerally charged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (language as sensory archive, imperfection as prerequisite for preservation) emerges organically from Thorne's choices and the diamond's flaw. The tunnel's echoes "not as mere reflections, but as living patterns" and the final image of "dead tongue's living essence" offer resonant closure without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the diamond's curse bending to purpose and the flock scripting the air. However, lines like "his purpose fulfilled" and "guardians of the dead tongue's living essence" edge toward thematic summary rather than letting the final image stand alone, and the piece occasionally explicates its own metaphor ("texture into sound," "grit became gravelly bass").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering through Thorne's copper-veined perspective. Diction is elevated and consistent ("quietly articulate," "labyrinthine choirs," "zhar'keth," "syl'vren"), creating a distinct narrative texture. However, perceptual signature is more atmospheric than character-specific—Thorne's way of noticing reads generic-lyric rather than uniquely his own. The sparse dialogue ("The birds script the air; they can script the echoes too") is aptly measured but insufficient to test voice under conversational pressure. Psychic distance holds steady, though the final paragraphs shift slightly toward omniscient summary ("future wanderers would enter").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, with mixed results: "towers of bone thrust skyward like the ribs of ancient leviathans" is vivid, but "words that lingered like mist" and "silk of wind, the bite of frost" cluster into stock poetic gestures. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "Thorne's people once spoke... But across the death... Thorne, driven to translate... One dusk, in the fractured base..." (repeated "[Noun/Name], [participial phrase]" openings). Paraphrase loops surface: "the core concept of the tunnel revealed itself: echoes not as mere reflections, but as living patterns" is immediately followed by "to harness the tunnel's echoes through the flawed diamond, transforming the language's lost textures into undying soundscapes"—two adjacent sentences restating mechanism. The climactic sequence narrates transformation ("Grit became gravelly bass tones; silk wove into shimmering harmonics") rather than dramatizing Thorne's real-time adjustments, flattening propulsion. Clarity remains high, but information density sags under ornamental repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of dying language, flawed artifact, and murmuration-patterning is specific and non-obvious, avoiding pure template. The premise (sensory language archived in sonic form via natural phenomenon) offers a fresh angle, and the diamond's imperfection mirroring the language's nuance is thematically apt. However, the emotional and plot arc could function with different particulars—swap "bone towers" for "ice spires," "diamond" for "crystal," "starlings" for "fireflies," and the structure holds unchanged, suggesting the details are purposeful but not fully indispensable. Risk-taking in structure (compressed timeframe, elliptical "years blurred") is present but modest; the piece does not subvert or challenge its own premise once established.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Thorne is present throughout and his choices (roaming towers, pocketing the diamond, climbing to the tunnel, positioning the gem, chanting to synchronize with birds) drive all major beats and the closure. However, many choices are narrated in summary ("driven to translate... he roamed"; "years blurred as the last elders perished, [he] watched"; "he positioned... entered... waited... stepped forth") rather than dramatized as micro-decisions under visible pressure. The final ritual—harnessing starling patterns—is the strongest on-page choice but feels declared ("he began to harness") rather than shown through tactical friction. Present in setup, development, and payoff, but causal texture remains medium.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The flawed diamond appears at the inciting discovery ("one dusk, in the fractured base... he unearthed"), returns when Thorne positions it at the tunnel mouth, and transforms at closure ("now hummed flawless, its core a vault of sonic textures"). Its curse and internal fracture directly enable the resolution—"fractures within aligned, cursing no more but crystallizing texture into sound"—making it functionally irreplaceable. However, its mechanics in the middle beat (how it "drank in" the echoes, how the curse "bent to purpose") are asserted rather than demonstrated through observable interaction. Three touches across setup, development, and payoff, with strong closure linkage but moderate causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tunnel of echoes is seeded early ("sinuous passage bored through the canyon's heart"), its core concept revealed mid-piece ("echoes not as mere reflections, but as living patterns... capable of being shaped into symphonies"), and it becomes the physical site and mechanism of the climax ("he entered the tunnel... the tunnel roared back a new chorus"). It constrains Thorne's method—he must position the diamond at its mouth, modulate reverberations via the flock's shadows—and the final image relies on it ("future wanderers would enter the tunnel of echoes and hear the old language reborn"). Causally active in at least three beats and indispensable to closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Quietly articulate" is labeled three times ("Quietly articulate, he wove narratives"; "Quietly articulate, Thorne murmured"; "his quietly articulate timbre now amplified") but never constrains or enables a specific on-page action with cost. It describes Thorne's narrative style rather than forcing a tactical choice—no moment where restraint costs him speed, clarity, or alliance. The trait coheres with tone but functions as atmospheric descriptor rather than active story lever. Present in setup and payoff mention, absent from development choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Harness" is the verb of the climax: Thorne waits for the flock, "began to harness their patterns," and "channeled this method—through the patterns in the flock of birds in flight—directing aerial geometries to thread the tunnel's reverberations." The action drives the transformation from cursed chaos to "symphony preserving the tongue's tactile soul" and is irreplaceable—no other verb (translate, invoke, capture) fits the specific mechanics of using external natural pattern to modulate echoes. However, the action itself is told rather than shown beat-by-beat (we don't see him adjust his chant in real time or correct a misstep), weakening causal granularity. Strong closure linkage, moderate embodiment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The flock of starlings is seeded at the turning point ("Dawn brought the answer: a vast flock... their flight tracing intricate patterns"), and Thorne explicitly observes "The birds script the air; they can script the echoes too." He waits for the flock, syncs his voice to wingbeats, and their shadows modulate the tunnel's reverberations—this method is the mechanical hinge of the climax. However, the method arrives late (final third) and its mechanics are asserted ("modulating the echoes into synchronized waves"; "formations imprinting precision") rather than tested through trial or obstacle. Two touches (recognition, execution), strong closure participation, but limited development friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon of echoes frame every scene, appearing in the title elements, the inciting discovery ("fractured base of a toppled tower"), and the closure ("In the bone towers' shadows, future wanderers..."). The canyon's endless echoes are not mere backdrop—they amplify every whisper into eternity, creating the problem (how to capture texture in sound) and supplying the solution (the tunnel's labyrinthine reverberations). Spatial choreography is clear (towers → tunnel mouth → tunnel interior → emergence), and the environment's acoustic properties constrain Thorne's method (he must position the diamond precisely, time the flock's passage). Causally active across all beats and indispensable to closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Across the death of a language" appears in the title phrase and is narrated as both backstory (speakers dwindling, "thirst claimed the oases and exile scattered the clans") and present urgency ("Years blurred as the last elders perished"; "Thorne watched children adopt crude tongues"). The timeframe creates pressure—Thorne must act before the last textures are lost—but the passage of years is summarized rather than tracked beat-by-beat with escalating cost. The final ritual occurs "one dusk" with no live clock constraining his choices within that scene. Present across setup (historical death), middle (watching loss), and payoff (preservation achieved), but the time pressure remains declarative rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The desire to translate texture into sound is stated early ("driven to translate texture into sound before all was lost") and motivates every major choice: roaming towers, taking the cursed diamond, seeking the tunnel, and performing the final ritual. The motivation crystallizes mid-piece ("Thorne's motivation crystallized—to harness the tunnel's echoes... transforming the language's lost textures into undying soundscapes") and is fulfilled at closure ("he poured every texture into the gem"). However, the motivation is never shown in friction—no moment where Thorne must choose between fidelity to texture and another competing want (survival, connection, recognition). Desire is consistent and drives plot, but lacks internal contradiction or visible cost that tests commitment.</comment>
