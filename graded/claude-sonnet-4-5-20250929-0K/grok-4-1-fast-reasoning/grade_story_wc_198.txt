<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is driven by sister-loss and prophecy-silencing, but his interiority defaults to stock phrasing ("eerie nostalgia," "vested hush") rather than embodied contradiction. The final smile ("nostalgic for the hush he had wrought, eerie in its fragile permanence") reads as aesthetic pose, not earned renunciation with visible cost. Emotional progression is asserted through labels ("resolve," "crested") without on-page micro-choices that alter tactics. The protagonist operates in isolation with no relationship crucible or secondary pressure to test motive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through repeated motifs (dewdrops, mist, prism) and musical pauses. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear early. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elias hushes the prophecy and departs—but cost is told ("weight of silenced code lightening his step") rather than shown in forfeited options or visible consequence. The "one final dew-prism caught his eye, refracting a coded glint" micro-turn signals fragility but does not reconfigure prior stakes with undeniable pressure. No on-page price alters his stance or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The grotto is vividly anchored (luminous ferns, dripping stalactites, prism atrium) and the mist/dewdrops recur to charge atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's nostalgic lens. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; he positions himself, plays, and departs without spatial friction. The final dew-prism refracts a coded glint but does not force a decision. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) is present but ornamental at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silencing the prophecy—is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as intensifying description (dewdrops cascade, mist thickens, prophecy "fights back") but no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The saxophone's "negative space" method and Elias's whispered hush are asserted to bind the prophecy, yet the prophecy's resistance is told ("murmurs rose," "code unraveling") without dramatized pressure that alters his tactics. The ending smile and departure lack visible cost; the "faint tremor" is atmospheric, not a consequence that reweights his stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—fragile control over fate, the cost of silencing the past—emerges through recurring images (mist, dewdrops, prism, negative space). The final "eerie in its fragile permanence" line attempts thematic resonance but defaults to abstraction rather than a concrete image that reweights prior material. The "vested hush" and "negative space" are prompt-adjacent concepts repeated without on-page friction that tests their limits. No character insight or final action offers a non-literal answer to the thematic question; the ending restates mood.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is consistently elevated ("eerie nostalgia," "quietly vivid," "vested hush") but often defaults to prompt-label recycling rather than character-particular perception. Psychic distance holds steady. Perceptual signature is present (music, mist, memory) but not idiosyncratic under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose carries a lyric texture, but register occasionally drifts into corporate abstraction ("imposing a vested hush," "negative space") that sits uneasily with the saxophonist's embodied experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "dewdrops formed," "quietly vivid," "eerie," "nostalgic," and "vested hush" recur without causal advance. Runs of identical stems ("The prophecy fought back… The prophecy persisted… prophecy's echoes fracturing") across multiple sentences. Stock metaphors ("tendrils curling," "pregnant silence," "brittle ice") stack without fresh specificity. Figurative density in high-pressure beats (climax paragraph) blurs momentum. Filter-verb stacks ("watching," "lingering") dull immediacy. Apply −1.4 in Q7 for spread and touch at closure; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The "morning fog saxophonist silencing a prophecy through negative space" premise is conceptually ambitious but executes through familiar fantasy-quest tropes (seer, coded prophecy, atrium trial). The "negative space" method and "vested hush" are asserted labels rather than dramatized mechanics that reveal fresh causality. Emotional arc (grief-driven musician confronts fate) follows a median template without lived-in detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The prism-grotto setting is vivid but does not transform the structure. No bold risk elevates stakes beyond the prompt frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; drives the action (enters grotto, plays saxophone, whispers hush). However, his choices are declared rather than tested: he "vowed to silence," "positioned himself," "played," "lowered the instrument," "turned to leave." No on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. Setup + middle involvement present, but closure participation is passive observation (watching, smiling). Late smile is micro-turn, not causal choice. Cap 4.6 for missing middle development of choice; swappability and ornamental closure lower to 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: "prism atrium in mist" introduced early. Development: Elias positions himself "within the prism's glow"; light refracts "into quietly vivid rainbows"; "Quietly vivid hues shifted in the prism atrium" as he plays. Payoff: "one final dew-prism caught his eye, refracting a coded glint." Present in ≥2 beats with evolving meaning (neutral beauty → battleground → lingering threat). However, the prism does not constrain his choice or supply a resource; it is backdrop. No visible cost tied to the object. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure mention +0.4, but ornamental use −0.7, swappability −0.5. All three gates met; 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setup: "vested hush" named explicitly ("imposing a vested hush, a silence earned") in opening third. Development: "He countered with a breath… a hush vested in the fog's chill embrace"; "The vested hush took hold, a palpable weight descending"; "the vested hush fully vested itself." Payoff: "The vested hush held—for now" and "nostalgic for the hush he had wrought." Present in ≥3 beats and closure. However, "vested hush" is a label repeated without mechanics that alter options; it shapes theme but not tactics. No on-page cost or constraint tied to the concept. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure +0.7, but ornamental/label-only −1.0, swappability −0.8. Round down: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Quietly vivid" appears in: "quietly vivid rainbows," "quietly vivid spectrum," "Quietly vivid hues shifted," "Quietly vivid afterimages lingered," "quietly vivid in the radiant grotto's mist-shrouded heart." Setup early, present in middle beats and closure. However, it is a descriptive modifier (aesthetic label) that does not constrain or enable an action with cost. No on-page tradeoff or choice tied to this attribute. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure +0.7, ornamental −1.0, label-only −0.3, swappability −0.8. Round down: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setup: "whisper" introduced early ("whispers of laughter," prophecy in "coded words"). Development: "He countered with a breath, whispering into the reed—not words, but intent"; "Elias whispered aloud now… 'Silence the spiral, veil the shards'"; "Through the saxophone's negative space, his words diffused, not as sound but as absence." Payoff: "leaving only whispers of what he had stilled." Present in ≥3 beats and closure; the whispered counter-spell is the climactic act. However, the whisper is easily swappable with "chant," "breathe," or "sing" without structural change; no unique properties matter. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure +0.9, but swappability −0.8, summary-only (result told) −0.6. Round down: 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: "His music would work through negative space—the pauses between notes, the voids where sound dared not tread." Development: "Through negative space, the silence between his slow, mournful phrases grew pregnant"; "His pauses lengthened, negative space expanding"; "Through the saxophone's negative space, his words diffused"; "In that negative space, the vested hush fully vested itself." Payoff: final paragraph references stilled "whispers." Present in ≥3 beats and closure; the method is named and repeated. However, "negative space" is asserted as the mechanism without dramatized mechanics that alter his tactics or impose visible cost; he plays, pauses, whispers—standard musical actions. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure +0.7, but ornamental/label-only −1.0, swappability −0.8. Round down: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: "radiant grotto veiled by mist" opens the piece; "luminous ferns," "dripping stalactites," "fog that clung to his bones," "prism atrium in mist" anchor early. Development: mist parts at threshold; Elias positions himself "within the prism's glow"; "Dewdrops trembled on the prisms, amplifying the saxophone's tone"; "The mist thickened, dewdrops cascading"; "the grotto exhaling as if relieved." Payoff: "the radiant grotto's mist-shrouded heart"; "morning fog enveloped him once more." Present in ≥3 beats and closure; the grotto is the arena. However, it does not constrain choice or supply a resource that affects outcome—Elias enters, plays, and departs without spatial friction. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure +0.9, but postcard description (no tactical pressure) −0.9, swappability (any mystical arena) −0.6. Round down: 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"As dewdrops formed" opens the piece and recurs: "dewdrops formed on luminous ferns," "Dewdrops trembled," "dewdrops vibrating," "Dewdrops formed faster," "dewdrops cascading," "dewdrops glistening on his shoulders," "one final dew-prism." Present in ≥3 beats and closure. However, dewdrop formation is atmospheric backdrop, not a ticking clock that alters tactics. Time passage is vague ("Now," "Back then," "dawn's first light," "morning fog"); no urgency or deadline forces a choice. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure +0.7, but vague/untracked time −1.0, ornamental −0.7, swappability −0.5. Round down: 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "Back then, an ancient seer had spoken a prophecy in code… Elias had vowed to silence it, driven by the loss of his sister." Development: "his motivation burned: to hush that prophecy forever"; "remembering the seer's voice: cryptic phrases"; "The prophecy stirred now… faint murmurs rose"; "The prophecy fought back"; "Elias leaned deeper into the music"; final paragraph "he had preserved this place, his past, from the code's unraveling doom." Present in ≥3 beats and closure; the desire frames all action. However, it is told rather than dramatized in conflicted on-page choices; no friction between want and cost (he plays, succeeds, smiles). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure +0.9, but told-only −1.0, no visible tradeoff −0.6. Round down: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Eerie nostalgia" named explicitly and recurs: "Eerie nostalgia wrapped the air, whispers of laughter from his youth"; "nostalgic melodies from his sister's lullabies twisted into haunting refrain"; "saxophone keening a nostalgic dirge, eerie tones evoking playground games turned ghostly"; "Quietly vivid afterimages lingered—his youth, the grotto's innocent glow"; "Nostalgia crested, eerie and complete"; "nostalgic for the hush he had wrought, eerie in its fragile permanence." Present in ≥4 beats and closure; coherent through turns. However, tone is static label rather than modulated pressure; no shift in diction or rhythm under stress. Early signal +0.8, four beats +1.6, closure +0.9, but static mood (no modulation) −0.8, label-only −0.3, template phrasing −0.3. Round down: 6.1.</comment>
