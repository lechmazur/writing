<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find unused courage is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The guides function as exposition vessels offering therapy-speak wisdom ("Direct paths bind tighter than any leash") without embodied struggle or distinct agency. Interior life remains abstract and label-driven ("motivation burned brighter") with no micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. The final transformation is asserted, not earned through on-page contradiction and cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning, but closure fails the cost test: Elara's star-stamped courage and guide transformation are declared outcomes without visible forfeiture or foreclosed path. The "traverse back, forever changed" summary replaces dramatized consequence. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early. The piece teaches its pattern of repetition and accumulative imagery, but the final RR lacks undeniable cost—no specific choice is refused, no relationship altered with felt price on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway and tidal pool setting constrain movement through fog and indirect routes, shaping the journey's tactics. Sensory work—"brambles parting like reluctant curtains," "saltwater spray"—grounds key beats. However, spatial choreography remains vague (how do they reach the promontory? where exactly are the guides standing?), and the setting functions more as symbolic backdrop than tactical pressure that narrows options at closure. The ticket punch's star stamp charges the final pool image, lifting the score past pure postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding unused courage—is signaled early but never tested by a trade-off or narrowed choice. The guides lead Elara through loops without visible cost or tactical shift; doubt is mentioned ("when doubt made her falter") but not dramatized as a reversal that changes options. The tidal pool revelation is handed to her rather than earned through protagonist agency. No on-page price alters tactics; the journey accumulates atmosphere but not escalating pressure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme of breaking free from constraint emerges through the leash/ridgeway/courage motif, but the ending resolves into overt moralizing: "carrying the star-stamped courage through indirect routes of her new life" is a theme summary rather than a resonant image. The prompt elements (leash-broken, veiled, unused courage) recur as labels without reweighting through specific, non-obvious action. The tidal pool as courage-mirror is allegorically convenient. Subtext is thin; the guides' wisdom is stated directly rather than implied through gesture or silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance. However, voice lacks perceptual signature—diction is elevated and generic ("rhythmic murmur matching the shoreline's lullaby," "essence," "crystallizing") without character-specific texture. Dialogue from the guides is interchangeable and expository ("Direct paths bind tighter than any leash"). The prose reads as committee consensus rather than a singular perspective. Filter verbs ("sensed," "urged") appear frequently but remain voice-neutral. No distinct rhythm under pressure; syntax stays uniform.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence damage momentum: "gently persistent" recurs identically three times; "traverse/traversed" appears five times; "leash-broken" and "unused courage" are repeated without variation. Figurative language stacks without pattern payoff ("veiled ridgeway," "shoreline lullaby," "twilight vigil" recycled mechanically). Synonym churn for "path" (route, ridgeway, way) and stock metaphors ("shells buried in wet sand," "kelp in tide") flatten texture. Closure beat suffers from summary telling ("forever changed") rather than concrete image. Applying −1.2 for loops/artifacts and −0.3 for figurative density without coherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core premise—journey to find inner courage via mystical guides—follows familiar template (hero's journey, liminal threshold crossing) without transformation through specific detail. The leash/courage/ridgeway/star-stamp elements feel checklist-assembled rather than organically synthesized. The ferry-guide conceit and ticket-punch ritual are gestures toward originality but remain allegorically transparent. No bold risk or non-obvious angle; the emotional arc (bound → liberated) could transfer to any setting with minor noun swaps. Applying −1.0 for derivative premise without meaningful specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Eldrin and Mira appear after the midpoint, offer expository wisdom, and guide Elara without making choices that create turns. They observe and instruct but do not act with agency that alters tactics. Present in closure (handing the punch, fading into fog) but their role is facilitative, not causal. Two gates (middle, payoff) but minimal pressure. Cap 4.6 for late intro, subtract −0.4 for ornamental function.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Ticket punch introduced at first guide appearance (~30%), used twice (scrap ticket, pool's edge), and present at closure. The star stamp marks passage and ignites the tidal pool, participating in the final image. Three gates met (setup deferred, development, payoff). Causal role is modest—it ritualizes rather than constrains. Swappable with any magical marker. +0.9 for two beats, +0.7 for closure linkage, −0.5 for late intro, −0.4 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vigil in twilight frames the entire journey from "twilight called her" through "twilight's vigil ended." The timeframe shapes atmosphere and the tone of watch/passage, but does not constrain choices with cost. The concept is more thematic container than tactical driver. Present early, sustained, and echoed at closure, but the story would function with "journey at dusk" with minor edits. Two gates plus closure echo. +0.8 early, +0.6 closure, −0.6 swappability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" applied three times: wind, Eldrin's guidance, tale-sharing. Label-only; no action shows a tradeoff between gentleness and force. The attribute describes rather than constrains. Present across beats but ornamental. +0.4 one beat involvement, −0.5 label-only, −0.3 template artifact (repeated stem).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Traverse" is the structural spine: Elara traverses the ridgeway, the guides lead her to traverse with them, she traverses back. The action defines the journey and shapes the resolution ("carrying the star-stamped courage through indirect routes"). Early signal, multiple beats, closure participation. Removing it breaks the frame. +0.8 early, +1.4 three beats, +1.0 closure, −0.4 for recycled verb without variation, −0.6 summary-only in final use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Indirect routes named early ("path twisted through indirect routes"), enacted in the middle (loops, brambles, spiral to cleft), and invoked at closure ("indirect routes of her new life"). The method shapes the physical journey and is thematized in Mira's dialogue. However, the mechanics are vague—what makes a route indirect versus direct on this ridgeway?—and the metaphor overshadows tactical function. Three gates. +0.8 early, +0.9 two beats, +0.5 closure, −0.6 swappability (could be "winding paths"), −0.3 vague mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway is the primary setting, named early, sustained throughout, and site of the closure tidal pool. Fog and brambles provide micro-obstacles. The promontory/cleft overlook is the revelation location. Setting guides movement and supplies the final courage-mirror pool. Three gates, clear causal role in shaping journey. +0.8 early, +1.4 three beats, +1.0 closure, +0.5 constrains tactics, −0.8 vague choreography (spatial positions unclear), −0.5 postcard elements (mist, shore) outweigh pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the leash breaks" establishes the inciting before-state. Time is referenced ("hours blurred," "twilight deepened to near-night") but not tracked as a constraint. The timeframe sets backstory context but does not tighten decisions. One gate (setup as past catalyst). +0.3 setup, −0.6 late effect (only a premise marker), −0.8 summary-only (the break is told in opening line, not dramatized), no middle or closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Motivation to find unused courage is stated in paragraph 7, repeated ("motivation burned brighter"), and fulfilled at the tidal pool. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. No on-page friction between the want and a cost. Present across structure but declarative. Two gates (setup deferred to ~25%, payoff). +0.4 early-ish, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure, −0.8 told-only, −0.6 no dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Shoreline lullaby" appears early ("sea sang its lullaby"), sustained ("shoreline's lullaby below," "lullaby grew louder"), and closes the story ("waves' lullaby," "sea's lullaby"). Tone is soothing, lyric, consistent. It charges the final image of Elara's dance with the waves. However, tone does not modulate with pressure—it remains static rather than tightening or breaking at peak moments. Three gates, strong reprise. +0.8 early, +1.4 three beats, +1.2 closure, −0.8 static (no modulation), −0.6 ornamental (could swap "song" or "melody").</comment>
