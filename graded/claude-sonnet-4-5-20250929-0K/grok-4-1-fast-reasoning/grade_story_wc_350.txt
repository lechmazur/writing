<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("bridges from silos") but her interiority reads as label-only: "empathetically decisive" and "vigorous tender" are applied as tags without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The bridge-building montage summarizes her rallying crews and physical work in a single paragraph, flattening what should be fraught decisions into efficient narration. The climactic talk atop the bridge resolves through her choral weaving of languages, but no internal cost or foreclosed path is dramatized—she succeeds without visible struggle or trade-off. Emotional progression is absent; she moves from resolve to triumph without degradation, doubt, or genuine friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal-Situational hybrid: Elara's bridge construction should narrow options and force stance crystallization, but the montage elides all reversals between conception and completion. The orientation anchors (tower, silos, starlight) appear early, waiving the Orientation Test penalty, but the middle montage ("Hours earlier, she'd rallied crews…") compresses the entire build into summary, erasing on-page escalation. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (the talks "rehabilitated," disputes "dissolving in the chorus"), yet no visible cost attaches to the final image—hands clasp, laughter bubbles, and the bridge stands as symbol without felt sacrifice or foreclosed alternative. The weight drop is vivid but serves setup, not a turn that changes knowledge or narrows Elara's options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower supplies vivid anchors (brass binoculars, orrery dome, whirring escapements, cuckoo clock weight) and the grain elevators loom as "silent titans," but spatial choreography during the bridge-building montage is vague—ropes "snaked," cables "taut," spans "connected" without close tracking of distances, angles, or Elara's physical position. The cuckoo clock weight returns as "bridge talisman" at closure, charging the final image with purposeful recurrence. Micro-setting (the weight, the pulley rig) constrains the bridge mechanism, lifting the score toward the 7-band threshold, but the silos themselves remain postcard titans rather than lived-in spaces that pressure Elara's choices during the talks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rehabilitate the talks, prevent "irreparable fracture") is signaled early, but the story elides all on-page reversals: Elara conceives the plan, the weight drops, the bridge forms "by dawn's tease," and the talks convene without complication. The montage phrase "reluctant hands" hints at resistance, yet no dramatized refusal, sabotage, or failure beat tests her commitment. The climactic talk shows "grumbles" and "counters" dissolving "in the chorus" within a single paragraph, compressing what should be fraught negotiation into summary resolution. No visible price is paid—no injury, no social cost, no foreclosed path—leaving escalation abstract and the closure effect unanchored to dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme (unity from silos, voices bridging divides) emerges from the bridge metaphor and the multilingual chorus, but the final image—"Wheatheart breathed unified once more"—delivers an overtly stated moral rather than a resonant, non-literal answer. The cuckoo clock weight as "symbol of dropped weights lifting all" is explained on the page rather than trusted to inference, flattening subtext. The story's emotional arc tilts toward sentimental satisfaction (laughter, clasped hands, "vigorous tender triumph") without ambiguity or counter-reading; no unresolved tension or cost lingers to charge reflection beyond the immediate plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited anchors to Elara, but the prose drifts into elevated register ("vertiginous summits," "comet tails," "ethereal hush") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Dialogue appears in the climactic talk ("Escuchen, listen, послухайте") but is scaffolded by exposition ("her harmonious choral timbre rising polyphonically") that tells effect rather than trusting the reader to hear it. The phrase "vigorous tender" recurs as a template descriptor (four times), creating a rhythmic tic that flattens voice under pressure. Perceptual signature is weak—Elara's way of noticing (brass, stars, weights) remains generic librarian-astronomer rather than idiosyncratic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "borrowed starlight," "silent titans," "comet tails," "fertile tomorrows," and "silos eternal" cluster without payoff, creating register drift (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear ("rehabilitate the talks, restoring their spirit" / "rehabilitated grain elevator talks"; "vigorous tender" × 4), triggering the template-cadence penalty (−0.6). The montage paragraph beginning "Hours earlier" compresses bridge-building into a synonym chain ("rallied crews," "stirred reluctant hands," "cables taut," "spans connected") that obscures causal sequencing. Stock metaphors ("woven voices," "fragile arc of unity") and therapy-speak ("empathetically decisive") touch the closure beat, escalating the artifact deduction to −1.0 total and disqualifying 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Core premise (librarian uses choral voice and physical ingenuity to build literal bridges between divided communities) offers a fresh synthesis of occupation and metaphor, but the execution leans on familiar beats: the divided town, the midnight gathering, the multilingual chorus dissolving conflict. The cuckoo clock weight as pulley counterbalance is specific, yet the turn (weight drops, bridge forms, talks succeed) follows a straight line without earned complication or non-obvious moral calculus. Emotional specificity is thin—triumph arrives without ambiguity, and the ending's "vigorous tender" triumph and "silos eternal" read as prompt-echo rather than inevitable image.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Elara frames the story and appears in all major beats (tower, weight drop, bridge assembly, talks), but her decisions are summarized rather than dramatized: she "firmly charted her path," "rallied crews," "secured the weight," "stepped center-bridge." The climactic talk shows her interspersing languages and "weaving grievances into melody," yet this is told effect rather than shown choice with cost. Present in setup, middle montage, and closure (three gates), but causal pressure is weak—no on-page moment where her choice narrows options or imposes visible sacrifice. Caps at ~6.0 for gate presence; swappability and summary use lower to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cuckoo clock weight appears in three distinct beats: Elara lifts it from the astronomical face (setup), secures it to the pulley car and releases it to yank the cable (middle action), and it returns as "bridge talisman, dangling at the center" (closure reprise). Early signal (+0.5), three-beat involvement (+1.4), causal role (enables bridge mechanism, +0.8), and closure linkage (reweighted as symbol, +1.0) lift the score. However, the weight's mechanics are summarized ("plummeted…yanking the first steel cable") rather than shown with close attention to pulley physics, and the final mention as "symbol of dropped weights lifting all" is explained rather than charged, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The grain elevator talks are named in the opening ("once-vibrant midnight gatherings…devolved into shouted accusations") and return at closure ("rehabilitated grain elevator talks convened atop the newborn bridge"), framing the dominant stake. The talks shape Elara's goal (rehabilitate them) and supply the setting for the climactic resolution, satisfying setup and payoff gates. However, the talks themselves are summarized in the final paragraph ("grumbles," "counters," "laments," then "disputes dissolving") rather than dramatized with speaker-level pressure or turn, limiting middle development. Lyric reprise + two gates allow mid-5s; lack of middle causal work prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Empathetically decisive" is introduced as a label ("Empathetically decisive, Elara had listened…then firmly charted her path") and repeated at the climactic talk ("Empathetically decisive, she stepped center-bridge"), but no on-page action demonstrates the trait's cost or constraint. The attribute is told twice without a dramatized moment where empathy conflicts with decisiveness or imposes a visible trade-off. Setup gate met (label in opening third); closure gate met (label restated); middle development absent. Label-only use (−0.6) and swappability (−0.5) lower the score to low-3s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Rehabilitate" is declared as Elara's vow in the opening ("Rehabilitate the talks, she vowed") and returns at closure ("rehabilitated grain elevator talks convened"), framing the action. The bridge construction is the on-page method of rehabilitation, and the talks' success completes the action, satisfying setup and payoff. However, the middle execution is montage-compressed ("Hours earlier, she'd rallied crews…by dawn's tease, spans connected"), summarizing what should be the story's central causal chain. Two gates met but middle dramatization weak; lyric reprise + causal framing allow mid-5s, but summary-only execution (−0.6) and swappability (another action could "unite" the town with minor edits, −0.5) cap below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interspersing languages is signaled early ("¡Uníos, unite, єднайтеся!") when Elara rallies crews and returns at closure ("Escuchen, listen, послухайте…English baritones joining Spanish sopranos, Ukrainian tenors swelling the refrain"). The method enables the choral effect that dissolves disputes, satisfying causal role. Setup and closure gates met; middle beat (rallying crews) shows the method in use. However, the mechanics remain abstract—how does interspersing languages compel reluctant hands or alter tactics?—and the final talk's multilingual weaving is told ("her harmonious choral timbre rising polyphonically") rather than shown line-by-line. Two strong gates + causal linkage allow low-6s; lack of close dramatization and swappability (another unifying gesture could substitute) prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower supplies the cuckoo clock weight, the orrery dome's starlight, and the pinnacle anchor for the rope rig, constraining the bridge's starting point and providing the symbolic setting for the opening and closing frames. The tower is present in setup (Elara peers from it), middle (weight lifted from its heart), and closure (the orrery bathes the bridge, gears chime approval). Three gates met. However, the tower does not pressure Elara's choices—she could rally crews and build the bridge from another high point—and the tower's gears and astrolabes remain decorative. Lyric reprise and resource role allow mid-5s; lack of tactical constraint caps below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Under the hush of borrowed starlight" appears in the opening line and returns at closure ("Under borrowed starlight's vigilant hush, Wheatheart breathed unified once more"), framing the timeframe as night. The phrase "by dawn's tease" signals passage to morning, placing the talks "that night" after the bridge is complete. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Elara has as long as needed to rally crews and build—and the story does not track elapsed hours or impose a deadline. Setup and closure gates met (lyric reprise); middle development absent. Ornamental framing (−0.7) and no causal pressure (−0.5) lower to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to construct bridges from silos" is declared early ("Her motivation burned vigorous tender") and drives the bridge-building action and the climactic talks. The desire shapes the dominant stake and reappears at closure when "bridges from silos stood not just plank and rope, but woven voices." Setup, middle action, and payoff gates all met. However, the motivation is told ("Her motivation burned…to construct bridges") rather than dramatized through on-page friction—no moment where the desire conflicts with fear, resource scarcity, or social cost. Three gates + causal framing allow mid-5s; told-only delivery (−0.6) and lack of internal conflict (−0.4) cap below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Vigorous tender" is introduced as descriptor ("Her motivation burned vigorous tender") and recurs four times ("vigorous tender breath," "vigorous tender cadence," "Vigorous tender triumph"), creating a template tic rather than tonal modulation. The tone aims for earnest uplift blending resolve and compassion, coherent across the opening, middle montage, and triumphant closure. However, the repetition of the exact phrase reads as label rather than embodied shift, and the tone remains static—no tonal contrast or deepening as pressure should rise. Setup and closure gates met; middle uses the phrase but does not modulate. Repetition without evolution (−0.5), label-only application (−0.4), and lack of tonal pressure arc lower to high-4s.</comment>
