<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (translating silence into music) is stated rather than embodied in contradictory impulses under pressure. The climactic moment with Kai shows some embodied work—kneeling, mapping turmoil up close—but the emotional arc remains abstract: "scarlet spikes piercing blue regret" reads as label-only cartography rather than lived contradiction. Internal conflict is told through heat-map metaphors instead of dramatized in micro-choices with visible cost. The final image offers no renunciation or foreclosed path; Elara departs "transformed" by declaration, smiling in generic triumph.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (who, where, when) adequately in the opening lines. Causal linkage is thin: Elara's tuning-fork plan unfolds without obstacle until Kai's eruption, which she resolves via a fork choice with no prior setup of his brother's drowning or the glacial lily's fragility. The closure unit—"rectifying the conservatory's hush into a tangible chorus of souls"—is a thematic declaration rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost. The final image (smiling, "her work just begun") offers poise without consequence or foreclosed option. Cost is asserted ("once stormy seas of loss, now serene waves of creation") but not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory supplies vivid sensory anchors—"crystalline ferns," "ice orchids pulsing with inner light," "frost-veiled pane"—and the heat-mapping mechanic creates a tactile interaction with the setting. However, spatial choreography during the group scene is vague (atrium layout, lily placement, Kai's proximity), and the conservatory does not meaningfully constrain Elara's choices; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure source. The micro-setting (tuning fork case) appears but does not alter tactics. The final image recycles earlier description without evolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resurrecting harmony from The Hush—is signaled early but remains abstract until the group gathering. The sole on-page complication is Kai's rage; it arrives late and is resolved within two beats via a fork choice with no prior setup cost. No meaningful tightening forecloses a live option: Elara succeeds without trade-off, and the "finale" is a declared triumph rather than a choice under pressure. Agency at closure is performance, not renunciation or decision with visible price. The piece reads as outline-like sequencing—and-then she gathered, and-then she struck—without escalation under any inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The theme (translating silence into music, community healing) is stated overtly in multiple passages: "to translate silence into music," "rectifying the fracture," "silence no longer void but vessel." The final paragraph moralizes directly: "she had translated silence into music, her capsize survival the key to unshaken marvels enduring." Subtext is minimal; the tuning forks are symbolic conveniences rather than particulars that charge the ending. The piece offers no non-literal answer; instead it asserts the thesis in prompt-like language. Thematic Echo in the final paragraph triggers penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative voice maintains consistent distance. However, the prose lacks perceptual signature—Elara's way of noticing is generic ("eyes lit with purpose," "heart burned with a singular motivation") rather than character-specific. Register drifts into elevated, abstracted diction ("souls' invisible fire," "tangible chorus of souls") that does not cohere with a shipwreck survivor's interior texture. Dialogue is absent. Psychic distance remains static; emotional peaks do not modulate rhythm or syntax in character-particular ways.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "silently expressive" appears four times, "unshaken marvels" five times, "heat-mapped" eight times, often in near-identical constructions. Runs of identical sentence stems in the climax ("She struck… She gathered… She selected… She placed") create mechanical rhythm. Stock metaphors ("eyes lit with purpose," "heart burned") and therapy-speak labels ("scarlet fury," "teal resolve") cluster in peak beats. Filter-verb stacks ("she saw," "she noticed," "she found") dull immediacy. The closure paragraph is summary rather than scene. Multiple artifact types across the final third disallow 9+ globally and trigger cumulative penalty beyond baseline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The core premise—emotion-mapping glass enables silent communication—has conceptual potential but is executed via familiar post-apocalyptic beats: trauma survivor leads healing ritual, rage threatens fragile peace, communal catharsis restores order. The tuning forks and winterglass are decorative conveniences; they could swap for singing bowls and mood-sensing crystals with minimal edits. No fresh inflection in the final image; the ending declares transformation without earned surprise. The capsize backstory and Kai's drowned brother arrive as exposition rather than lived particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara (capsize survivor) is present throughout and makes the key choice to use the tuning fork on Kai, but the decision is not constrained by her survivor experience in a meaningful way. Her capsize backstory is told in summary ("her father's violin mid-storm") and does not shape her tactics or the final image with survivor-specific friction. She observes and facilitates but does not face an on-page dilemma rooted in her survival trauma that alters the outcome. Present in closure (final paragraph mentions "capsize survival") but as label rather than causal force.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tuning fork case is handled in three beats: opening (clutched, described), group gathering (unclasped, forks selected), and Kai's crisis (deepest fork chosen). It appears in the final paragraph ("lay open, ready") as a resonant callback. The forks enable the central action (rectification), but their specific properties (silver, crystal, etched pitches) do not constrain choices—any vibration tool could substitute. The case itself is passive; the forks do the work. Functional across beats with closure reprise, but swappable mechanics cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Unshaken marvels" is repeated five times but remains ornamental: the conservatory's flora (ferns, orchids, glacial lily) are described as indifferent and unchanging. The lily teeters once but is mended without cost or tactic shift. The concept does not shape stakes—Elara's goal (translate silence) is independent of whether the marvels endure. The phrase is a thematic label rather than a mechanic that alters options. Present but decorative.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Silently expressive" is applied to Elara four times as a descriptor ("her wide eyes and fluid hands," "faces curious," "she knelt") but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. In a world where noise is impossible, silent expressiveness is the baseline, not a distinctive trait. No scene shows Elara struggling with or leveraging this attribute to alter tactics. Label-only mention trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Rectify" and "rectified" appear three times, driving the group gathering and Kai's crisis resolution. Elara's method (heat-mapping emotions → tuning fork selection) depends on rectification as the framing action. However, the mechanics are vague—what does "rectifying" require beyond matching colors to pitches?—and the action could swap for "harmonize" or "attune" with minimal edits. Present across beats and in closure summary but lacks irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions is introduced early ("faint heat blooms, swirling patterns"), demonstrated in the middle (child's yellow wonder, elder's violet sorrow, Kai's scarlet fury), and mentioned at closure ("heat-mapped hearts beating"). The method shapes Elara's fork choices in two beats (group gathering, Kai's crisis), creating causal linkage. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown—how does body warmth encode grief versus joy?—and the method does not face a constraint or failure that forces a tactic shift. Functional across beats with closure presence but no felt cost tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is present throughout, supplies the heat-mapping mechanic (panes react to body warmth), and provides the glacial lily crisis point. It anchors the spatial frame and enables Elara's method. However, the conservatory does not constrain her choices—she moves freely, gathers survivors without obstacle—and the setting could swap for any enclosed space with reactive surfaces. The final image returns to it ("In the winterglass conservatory, after noise became impossible") as thematic anchor. Essential to the method but not irreplaceable in its specific properties.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After noise became impossible" is signaled in the opening ("after The Hush, when noise became impossible") and repeated in the final paragraph. The timeframe premise (silence enforced by cosmic fracture) motivates Elara's method (vibration replaces sound) but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. No scene shows the Hush constraining her actions—vibration works immediately without trial. The timeframe is a backdrop rule rather than a live clock. Present in setup and closure but does not shape middle beats with pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To translate silence into music" is stated in paragraph seven as Elara's motivation and repeated verbatim in the final paragraph. The desire drives her choice to use the tuning forks (middle beat) and frames the closure summary. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through contradictory wants or fears—no scene shows Elara hesitating, risking failure, or choosing this goal over another need. The phrase appears as thematic label; friction between want and cost is absent. Functional but not conflicted.</comment>
