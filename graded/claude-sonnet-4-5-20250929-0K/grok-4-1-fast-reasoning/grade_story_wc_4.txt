<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's "perceptively calm" demeanor is asserted repeatedly but never tested by contradictory impulses in scene. Her arc from arriving with a map case to completing a mosaic feels executed without visible cost or resistance; the townspeople appear, confess, and heal in a frictionless sequence. The final choice to "walk away" carries no dramatized stakes or forfeiture that would demonstrate what she has renounced or endured. Interiority consists of label-only feelings ("earnest whimsy," "calm purpose") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story establishes Elara arranging photographs but does not dramatize a meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows her options. Townspeople gather and immediately participate without resistance, erasing pressure. The closure—Elara closing the case and walking away—lacks visible cost; no on-page sentence shows what she has sacrificed, endured, or foreclosed. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires density increase or cadence shift with cost; the ending offers only a return to the opening posture without reweighting prior material or making a before/after legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lavender field and rusted factory are anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("purple blooms," "skeletal iron beams," "vines climbing"). However, the setting remains ornamental; no on-page choice hinges on proximity, access, or environmental constraint. The vines' repeated climbing functions as atmospheric decoration rather than a resource or obstacle that alters Elara's tactics or the townspeople's participation. The micro-setting (map case, salvaged crate) is described but not used to pressure a decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transmuting collective pain into a masterpiece—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or a choice that narrows options. Elara's work proceeds without friction: she arranges photos, townspeople arrive and participate willingly, laughter erupts, and she departs. No reversal or tightening forecloses a path; no trade-off between competing goods or unavoidable harms is dramatized. The piece lacks escalation under any lens; pressure remains static from midpoint to close.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of collective healing is stated directly ("collective healing bloomed fully") rather than emerging from concrete choices and costs. "Arcs" recur as a motif but function as decorative metaphor without constraining action or charging the closure. The final paragraph moralizes ("a masterpiece etched in time," "ready to transmute the next hidden pain") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer. The piece tells its theme rather than allowing it to arise from the particulars of Elara's decisions and the townspeople's responses.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is stable third-limited but relies on stock phrases ("earnest whimsy," "perceptively calm," "dove gray") recycled across beats without variation under pressure. Diction drifts into elevated register ("transmute," "luminous," "verdant") that exceeds the scene's immediate urgency. The townspeople's dialogue ("See here, where the beam's fatal bend arcs into a bridge of memory?") reads as expository rather than goal-driven speech. Psychic distance remains constant; no modulation reflects emotional intensity or stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Pervasive template cadence: "Elara [verb], her [noun] [verb]-ing" recurs across a dozen beats. Paraphrase loops abound: "linger," "vines climbing," and "arcs" are recycled without added pressure. The phrase "earnest whimsy" appears four times; "perceptively calm" three times. Mixed metaphors cluster in the opening: vines as "patient fingers" immediately followed by blooms in "gentle conspiracy." Filter-verb stacks ("she saw," "she unclasped," "she arranged") dull immediacy in high-density beats. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("her calm purpose ignited anew"), disallowing 9+ and capping high-band eligibility globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The premise—archivist uses photographs to heal a town's grief—is functional but closely resembles common "art heals trauma" templates without fresh transformation. The "arcs in photographs" conceit is asserted but not made concrete through specific image mechanics or contested interpretation. No on-page risk or unconventional choice heightens stakes; Elara's method succeeds without resistance, and the townspeople's immediate cooperation erases surprise. The final image ("vines climbed into the stars") repeats earlier description without reweighting it through prior causality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her occupation (puzzle archivist) is mentioned, but her on-page choices do not create key turns. She arranges photographs and narrates their meaning; townspeople respond without her needing to adapt tactics. The decision to "walk away" is not prepared by prior conflict or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The map case is opened early (first third), closed at the end (closure beat), but its use in the middle is purely descriptive. No choice hinges on the case's contents or condition; it functions as a container without constraining action or enabling a specific tactic. The closure reprise ("closed the map case, its dove gray whispering promises") reweights nothing; it is a symmetric return without cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Collective healing is the stated goal and final outcome, but it does not shape on-page tactics or force a trade-off. The concept is told ("collective healing bloomed fully") rather than shown through choices that narrow options. It echoes as theme without altering what Elara or the townspeople do in scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" is asserted five times but never constrains or enables a specific action with visible cost. The trait functions as a label; no moment shows Elara's calmness foreclosing an impulse or allowing her to notice something others miss that then changes tactics. It remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Linger" appears three times (opening, midpoint, penultimate beat) and frames the pacing, but it does not create a key turn. Elara's lingering allows time for townspeople to gather, but the gathering itself is not a reversal she causes. The action shapes atmosphere more than decision; swapping "linger" for "remain" or "stay" would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The photographs are signaled early (first third), used in the middle (Elara arranges them, describes arcs), and present at closure (the mosaic is complete). However, the mechanics—how arcs in images enable healing—are asserted, not dramatized. No townsperson resists or misreads an arc; the method succeeds without friction. The means shapes one major beat (the arrangement) but does not constrain later choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lavender field and rusted factory are anchored early, supply vivid sensory detail, and frame the gathering. The setting enables the event (a secluded space where townspeople can assemble) and the vines' growth provides a recurring image tied to the timeframe. However, no on-page choice hinges on spatial constraint; the field does not alter tactics or supply a resource that shapes outcome. It serves as charged backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"As vines climb" recurs four times, establishing a slow-growth timeframe. However, the vines' progress does not tighten decisions or create urgency. Elara's work unfolds without a clock pressing her; townspeople arrive on cue without time pressure altering their participation. The timeframe decorates rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated in the opening ("to transmute pain into a masterpiece") and returns at the close ("ready to transmute the next hidden pain"). However, the desire is not dramatized through conflicted choices. No on-page moment shows Elara weighing the cost of engaging the townspeople's pain or risking failure. The motivation frames the premise but does not create friction between want and obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Earnest whimsy" is declared four times but does not modulate with pressure. The tone remains uniform from opening description through townspeople's confessions to final departure; no shift in cadence or diction reflects escalation. The phrase functions as a label rather than an enacted tonal quality that charges the final image or constrains voice under stress.</comment>
