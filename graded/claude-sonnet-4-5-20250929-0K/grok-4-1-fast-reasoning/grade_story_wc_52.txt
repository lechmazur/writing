<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete—grief channeled through woodworking, memories crystallized in quartz—and her micro-choices (selecting tools, each chisel cut) serve the dominant drive. However, the characterization leans heavily on reflective summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene; her progress from blank to locket is linear, without genuine friction or risk of failure. The final choice (snapping the locket shut) feels procedurally inevitable rather than a renunciation with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but muted by the lyric register; no moment forces her to balance competing needs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (widow, loft, circus grounds, kettle boiling). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure deepens through the ritual of carving, layering memory with each cut, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where she "contained eternity while it boiled." Cost is conceptual—she relinquishes raw grief for crystallized control—but legible in the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs as the kettle's rising whistle paces her toward completion. The closure lands cleanly under the lens, though the cost feels more asserted ("Tea could wait") than dramatized through a forfeited option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The loft is vividly rendered (rust-hued skylight, rain pattering, scarred oak table, faded big cat posters) and the ash wood blank materially constrains her action—she must shape it while the kettle boils, using Theo's tools. The rain and amber light recur purposefully, charging the final closure image with atmospheric coherence. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (wood dust "sifting like fine sand," steam "threading upward"). The micro-setting (table, tools, blank) anchors every beat and the kettle functions as a ticking clock, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint and closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: contain scattered memories before they are lost. The kettle's boil imposes a live time constraint, and the carving deepens from clasp to hollow to hinge, each step narrowing her focus. However, escalation is primarily procedural—no reversal or complication threatens her success. The cost at closure (tea delayed, eternity bottled) is more conceptual than felt; no live option is foreclosed on the page. Agency is present (she chooses each cut) but never tested by friction or competing need, keeping this in the mid-7s under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—"here and gone," the ephemeral made permanent—emerges through action (carving, crystallizing time) and the recurring motif of Theo's fearless embrace of the moment. Subtext operates in silence and image: the blank warming under her hands, the kettle's shriek punctuating her triumph. The final line ("she had contained eternity while it boiled") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "harvest lessons from loss" edges toward thematic echo, repeated almost verbatim from the opening, risking redundancy. Overall, particulars (ash grain, quartz shards, lion's mane oil) ground the universal without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, filtering all through Elara's grief-sharpened attention. Perceptual signature is present (rust-hued light, wood grain "whispering," steam as "genie's promise") but the diction occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism ("hauntingly practical," "crystallized time," "rust-hued peace") that feels more authorial than character-particular under peak pressure. The prose texture is consistent, yet the voice lacks the urgency or roughness one might expect mid-carving. No dialogue to judge. Filter verbs ("envisioning," "summoning") are sparse and voice-motivated. Psychic distance remains controlled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"rust-hued peace," "grief's forge," "steam threading upward like a genie's promise," "wood dust sifted like fine sand"—without relief or contrast, creating a lyric saturation that flattens urgency in the carving beats. Template cadence appears in mid-section: "She selected… She lifted… She polished… She engraved…" (−0.4). Paraphrase loops: "here and gone" recurs five times without evolving meaning (−0.3). Some phrases border on stock ("bottling the roar of life against silence"). Information density is solid; no major clarity breaks. The combined artifacts and overwriting pull this below 7.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—circus widow + crystallized memory magic + woodworking ritual—is specific and non-obvious, avoiding pure trope. The lion's mane fungi oil and quartz memory-shards add fresh detail. However, the emotional arc (grief → ritualized containment → peace) follows a familiar template without bold complication; the carving succeeds as planned, with no risk of failure to deepen stakes. The "here and gone" concept is well-integrated but not transformed by a surprising turn. Proximity check passes; voice and material cohere. Solid originality, yet the piece plays it safe within its lyric frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout, framing the stake, making each micro-choice (selecting tools, each cut, final engraving), and sealing the locket at closure. Her decisions alter tactics beat-by-beat (clasp, hollow, hinge) and the final snap completes the ritual. Strong setup, development, and payoff; her agency drives all three gates. Cost is conceptual (grief ritualized) rather than a visible trade-off, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ash wood blank appears in setup (gifted by Theo, sitting on the table), is handled across multiple beats (lifted, traced, chiseled, polished, engraved), and the completed locket snaps shut at closure. Each carving step transforms it from "pale and unyielding" to "nascent locket, intimate as a heartbeat." The object's grain and warmth are noted, and its evolution is irreplaceable to the closure effect. All three gates met with strong causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Here and gone" is signaled early (Theo's snap death, "crystallized time"), shapes her motive (contain ephemeral memories), recurs in mid-section reflection ("Theo's life had epitomized it"), and frames the final image ("contained eternity while it boiled"). The concept constrains her choice to carve now, before memories scatter. It participates in closure by reweighting permanence vs. loss. Strong integration across all gates with clear causal and thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Hauntingly practical" appears twice as a label (describing the blank's promise and the ritual itself) but does not visibly enable or constrain an on-page action with cost. It characterizes her approach rather than forcing a trade-off. Setup and thematic presence are clear, but no middle choice or closure beat hinges on this exact trait. Functional but replaceable with "methodical" or "pragmatic" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Contain" is the verb that organizes the entire piece: she must contain scattered crystals (setup), carves a locket to contain them (development across multiple beats), and snaps the locket shut to contain eternity (closure). The action is irreplaceable—removing it collapses the plot. Each beat (clasp, hollow, hinge, seal) is a containment step. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage. Cost is conceptual but legible.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Crystallized time" is explained early (quartz shards holding memory via lion's mane oil and spotlight heat), motivates the carving (locket to hold the crystals), and the largest crystal (wedding vow) is nested at closure. The method shapes her goal and the mechanics matter on the page. Setup, development (she selects the largest crystal for the hollow), and payoff all present. Specificity and irreplaceability are high; removing this method breaks the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The loft anchors every beat: rain on skylight, amber light, scarred table, faded posters, antique stove. The setting supplies the tools (Theo's chisel and mallet), the table as workspace, and the atmospheric "rust-hued peace" that modulates tone. The kettle on the single burner imposes the time constraint. Setup, development (tools selected from shelves), and closure (loft seals her ritual) all met. The setting constrains her action (single burner paces the boil) and charges the final image with sensory coherence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The kettle is introduced early ("flame licking blue," "steam in mere minutes"), its rising hum and whistle pace the carving beats, and it shrieks at closure ("As the kettle shrieked full-voiced"). The timeframe tightens urgency in the final third but is not tracked precisely beat-by-beat; mid-section reflection slows the clock's pressure. All three gates present, but the live-clock constraint is more atmospheric than tactical—no moment where she must skip a step to beat the boil. Solid integration, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Harvest lessons from loss" is stated early, dramatized through the carving ritual (each cut extracts a lesson: adapt, love fiercely, embrace the ephemeral), and enacted at closure ("Harvest the roar" engraved, locket sealed). The motive drives every beat and is tested against the kettle's deadline. Setup, development, and payoff all clear. Minor friction: the motive is declared more than conflicted—no moment where she hesitates or questions the ritual's worth. Strong integration with slight tell-heavy delivery.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Rust-hued peace" anchors the opening (rain through amber panes), recurs in mid-section ("loft's rust-hued peace"), and seals the closure ("rust-hued peace sealing her motive complete"). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly with pressure (calm opening, focused carving, triumphant finale). The amber/rust palette charges the final image. All three gates met. However, the tone is mostly static—no sharp tonal shift under pressure; the "peace" remains untroubled throughout, limiting its causal force. Solid lyric resonance, not indispensable.</comment>
