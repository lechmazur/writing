<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is largely abstract and label-driven ("quietly driven," "tender ache," "umbral tenderness swelled") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The protagonist's emotional arc reads as a sequence of declarations about feeling rather than lived tension: no genuine struggle between competing wants surfaces on the page. The climactic realization—"the flowers' secret was vulnerability's grace"—arrives as an unearned epiphany delivered through exposition rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Motivation remains static across the entire arc; no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece lacks a legible closure unit with on-page cost. The final beat offers only thematic summary ("reckon the beauty in what hides") and a vague promise ("her next mural awaited") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing that makes a before/after legible. Orientation is delayed well past 120 words—who Elara is, where the pavilion stands relative to the cathedral, and when this occurs remain hazy until deep into the second paragraph, warranting a −0.4 penalty and triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0. The accumulative lens is suggested by the slow reveal of glass layers, yet no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; each discovery is merely additive without narrowing options or changing knowledge in a way that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The amber pavilion and cathedral window are described vividly ("glass-domed haven," "towering pane of etched glass") and recur throughout, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image—disqualifying 9+ per the quick test. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (incense, cool stone, meltwater pattering), yet spatial choreography between pavilion and cathedral remains vague: no transit, distance, or threshold is dramatized. The postcards and glass function as passive exposition vehicles rather than active setting elements that alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows Elara's options; each glass layer she uncovers adds information without consequence or cost. The climactic "dawning" realization arrives through reflection and metaphor rather than protagonist agency: Elara does not choose, renounce, or endure anything that forecloses a path. Pressure remains flat across the arc, and coincidence (the inherited postcards, the cathedral's proximity) enables discovery without struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme—vulnerability opening in darkness to rare suitors—emerges through sustained imagery (night flowers, moths, shadowed lovers) rather than overt statement, which is a strength. However, the final paragraph lapses into direct thematic summary: "reckon the beauty in what hides" and "surrender to the dark, where true tenderness takes root" replace scene pressure withmoralizing. The ending offers no non-literal answer to the central question; instead it explains the metaphor explicitly, forfeiting resonance. Prompt language ("quietly driven," "umbral tenderness," "reckon") recurs throughout as unearned labels rather than dramatized particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited, but diction drifts into elevated register that clashes with grounded action: "umbral tenderness," "nocturnal embrace," "vivid testaments to petals that shunned the sun." Perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices beauty and mystery in identical lyric cadence throughout, with no character-specific bias or blind spot. Filter verbs and summary interiority dominate: "she reckoned," "she knew," "Elara understood," externalizing thought rather than inhabiting it. No dialogue appears. The final third recycles sentence stems ("Elara rose," "Elara breathed," "Elara sealed") without variation, flattening rhythm under what should be peak emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn stall momentum: "quietly driven" appears in three separate beats with no added pressure; "umbral tenderness" is restated as "tender ache in the umbral half-light" and "Umbral tenderness swelled"; "dawning hush" recurs four times as a thematic label without causal work. Template cadence runs dominate the final third ("Elara rose… Elara stepped… Elara sealed… Elara breathed"), triggering −0.6 for stem repetition. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats (final glass discovery, tears, masterpiece declaration) without pattern-teaching or payoff: "vivid swirls," "defiant splendor," "haunted her dreams," "lover's whispered secret," "forgotten promises," "impatient fingers"—register drift and stock metaphor strings together warrant −0.8. Combined artifact penalties and the final-third contamination disqualify 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—artist discovers ancestral mystery through glass restoration—follows a familiar template (creative protagonist, inherited object, layered secret, epiphany about vulnerability). Elara's arc could swap medium and setting (sculptor/fresco, musician/score, dancer/choreography) without altering emotional or thematic contours, failing the transformation test. The ending offers no fresh inflection or non-obvious synthesis; the flowers-as-metaphor-for-hidden-love reading is stated rather than earned through specific, grounded choices. Prompt elements (umbral, reckon, quietly driven, dawning hush) recur as aesthetic ornament rather than integrated particulars that constrain action.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her "choices"—unpacking postcards, visiting the cathedral, cleaning glass—are recounted actions without internal conflict or visible cost. The final beat ("ready to paint eternities") is declaration, not dramatized turn. Present in setup and ending but purely observational; cap at 3.8 for swappability, apply −0.6 for summary-only involvement across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Postcards appear early (setup), are cross-referenced at the pavilion table (middle beat), and return in the final image ("fingers lingered on a postcard's bloom"). However, their use remains static description; no on-page moment shows Elara handling them under pressure or choosing between competing cards to alter tactics. The cryptic note seeds the glass search but the cards themselves do not constrain later choices. Two-gate presence (setup, closure callback) with weak causal pressure and no felt cost tied to the object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" appears as a thematic label in seven lines but never shapes stakes or tactics on the page. It is invoked at the realization beat ("This dawning hush enveloped her") and closing ("Dawning husk complete") as aesthetic echo, not a constraint or driver of choice. Ornamental recurrence without causal work; cap at 2.8 for missing middle development, apply −0.7 for label-only use across beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is mentioned in three separate passages ("Quietly driven by a single burning question," "Quietly driven, she returned obsessively," "her quietly driven spirit alight") but functions only as a trait label. No on-page moment shows this quality constraining or enabling an action with visible cost—Elara's persistence is told, not tested under competing pressures. Setup and ending presence, but purely decorative; apply −0.9 for label-only use and no dramatized tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Reckon" appears in five beats: "reckon the hidden layers," "Elara reckoned it then," "lovers reckoning truths," "reckon the beauty in what hides." The word is used synonymously with "understand" or "perceive" rather than as a distinct action with unique mechanics. The major turn—Elara's epiphany about vulnerability—is narrated ("she reckoned it then") rather than dramatized through a choice that alters options. Present across beats but swappable with "realize" or "discern"; cap at 3.8 for replaceability, raise to 4.9 for closure linkage but no felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The etched glass is signaled early (cryptic postcard note), its mechanics matter (layered cleaning reveals symbols), and it appears in the climactic discovery and final reflection. Elara's cleaning attempts span multiple beats, and the glass motif charges the ending image ("the cathedral's echo in glass"). However, the process itself is recounted rather than dramatized under pressure; no on-page moment shows a failed attempt, a tool constraint, or a cost tied to the method. Three gates met; causal involvement in two beats; closure linkage; but weak cost connection prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The pavilion is introduced early, recurs as Elara's sketching sanctuary, and frames the final mural scene. Its "amber glow" and "autumnal" quality are invoked repeatedly, and it provides spatial grounding for the ending. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; Elara could sketch anywhere. The pavilion functions as backdrop rather than active pressure. Three gates met but ornamental use; specificity (glass dome, mosaic table) adds texture without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The melting snow is invoked in eight passages as a temporal marker paralleling Elara's progress, and the transition from "late winter" to "spring's cusp" frames the arc. However, no on-page moment shows time tightening a decision or altering tactics; the snow's retreat is purely metaphorical. The phrase "across the melting of winter's last snow" is repeated without dramatized clock pressure. Present in setup and ending as lyric device, but no middle beat where the timeframe constrains choice; cap at 4.6 for missing development gate, slight raise for closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The desire to understand night-blooming flowers is stated in the opening and restated in reflection ("Why bloom at night? The question gnawed"), but it is never dramatized in conflict with a competing want or cost. Elara's quest proceeds without friction; no moment shows her choosing this pursuit over another obligation or relationship. The motivation is told rather than tested; by the ending, the answer arrives as an unearned epiphany rather than the product of a choice with visible sacrifice. Setup and thematic echo present, but no middle development where the want forces a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Umbral tenderness" appears as a phrase in four lines and as a tonal description (shadowed blooms, lantern-lit work, moonlit lovers) throughout. The tone remains static across turns—lyric and soft even at the discovery beat—without modulating with pressure or charging the final image with fresh intensity. The final paragraph recycles the same tender-shadow idiom without escalation. Coherent and purposeful but does not deepen or shift to mark the ending's stakes; mid-band for consistency without dynamic range.</comment>
