<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (preserving small moments) is stated but her choices feel more ritualistic than genuinely conflicted. The walnut-ink archivist role is ornamental; her craft details don't constrain decisions or reveal internal contradiction under pressure. The spectral reunion at the climax arrives through magical mechanics rather than embodied struggle, and her "haunted euphoria" reads as a label applied repeatedly rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ending's emotional calculus—smiling, locket warm—resolves too tidily without visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece signals an Accumulative/Textural lens through layered ritual and motif repetition, but the closure—spectral form coalescing, covenant renewed—relies on convenience (the steep works because the text says it does) rather than pressure that narrows options. The "regenerated covenant" is declared complete without on-page cost; he fades "willingly," she walks away "lighter," and the final image offers reassurance rather than a felt price. The RR form is attempted but the reconfiguration lacks undeniable conceptual or emotional weight at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The jetty at twilight is vividly rendered with luminous petals, darkening sea, and moon-crested closure. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara's archival focus (walnut-ink scent, pollen like stardust regrets). The setting participates actively: seawater gathered warm, blooms intensifying to bathe her in light, the sea sighing approval. However, the environment does not meaningfully constrain a choice or alter tactics; it facilitates rather than pressures, and the blooms' mechanics (how they enable the ritual) remain vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—renewing the covenant with her deceased partner—is signaled early. Pressure remains static: Elara follows a ritual sequence without meaningful resistance or cost. The "gently thorough" layering of petals and the steep action unfold as planned; no reversal tests her commitment. The climax (spectral form rising, covenant sealed) is gift rather than earned alteration. The piece declares weight ("the weight of small moments") but does not dramatize a trade-off or foreclosed option on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (the preservation of fleeting intimacies against oblivion) is coherent and emerges through concrete ritual: petals chosen for resonance, ink steeped with memory-residue. The locket photo and spectral reunion offer a non-literal answer to loss. However, the final declaration—"haunted euphoria," "small moments, steeped true, outweighed worlds"—edges into thematic echo, and the ending's reassurance (he watches, waiting; she presses on) resolves ambiguity too neatly. The piece invites reflection but stops short of uncomfortable complexity or counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable and closely tied to Elara's archival perspective. Diction is controlled and purposefully elevated ("inexorable pull," "viscous brew," "vapor-shapes"). Sensory filtering reflects her priorities (ink, petals, photo). However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("context changes," "proximate causes") that feels imposed rather than character-organic, and the phrase "haunted euphoria" recurs as a label rather than modulating under pressure. Perceptual signature is present but could be more distinctly hers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence carries figurative language ("forgotten whispers," "stardust regrets," "lover's breath," "seeking vines") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density that slows momentum rather than charging beats. Paraphrase loops appear ("gently thorough" x3, "haunted euphoria" x4, "small moments" x5) and template cadence runs flatten rhythm ("She selected... She drew... She began... She lifted..."). The phrase "context changes" is used abstractly without grounding. Mixed metaphors (petals as vessels, ink incarnate, vapor-shapes) blur rather than sharpen. Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat ("haunted euphoria swelled... euphoric waves... euphoric haunting"), triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The core premise—grief ritual using memory-ink and spectral flowers—offers surface novelty but executes a familiar template: protagonist mourns, performs ritual, achieves mystical reunion. The "proximate causes" method (recreating the sequence of their meeting) is declared rather than made mechanically essential. Emotional truth is undercut by the tidy resolution: he becomes "guardian now of their archive," she walks away "lighter," and the covenant blooms "forever" without trade-off. The story could function unchanged with different names and ritual tokens, indicating insufficient transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her archival craft frames the piece. However, her choices are procedural (select petals, pour ink, stir) rather than decisive under pressure. No key turn traces to her agency; the ritual unfolds as planned and the covenant regenerates because the mechanics allow it. She is active but not tested.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locket photo appears early (first third), is placed at the ritual's center, and returns pristine at closure with "eyes alight with recognition." It bridges past and present, earning Setup and Payoff gates. However, its middle use is static description rather than a choice-altering beat, and its transformation (tarnished → vivid) is result rather than causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The regenerated covenant is the stated goal and frames the ending ("Their covenant, regenerated, bloomed forever"). It shapes the dominant stake and recurs across beats (original vow, renewal ritual, spectral form intoning renewal, parchment inscribed). However, the mechanics of regeneration remain vague, and the concept does not constrain tactics or impose visible cost—it is achieved rather than earned through friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Gently thorough" appears three times as a descriptor of Elara's method (kneeling, layering petals, inscribing). It characterizes her approach but does not constrain an on-page choice or create a visible trade-off. The trait is label-only; we do not see a moment where thoroughness costs her speed or where gentleness forces a renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Steep" (the action of steeping walnut-ink over the assemblage) occupies the ritual's climax and produces the viscous brew that enables the spectral reunion. It is signaled early (vials of ink, walnut husks), executed at the peak beat, and directly generates the closure effect. However, the action itself is procedural; removing "steep" in favor of another ink-preparation method would not fundamentally alter story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Through proximate causes" is stated explicitly twice and guides Elara's petal selection (wave, gull's cry, shell in sequence). The method shapes her ritual design. However, the mechanics are asserted rather than tested—we do not see a moment where incorrect sequencing imposes cost or where the method's specificity enables a turn. It is present and functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight is anchored early, vividly rendered, and participates throughout: petals pulse, blooms intensify, seawater is gathered, the moon crests at culmination. The setting enables the ritual and charges the final image with its dimming flowers. However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it facilitates rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"When context changes" (twilight to moonrise) is flagged explicitly and marks the ritual's timeframe. The shift from last rays to moon-crested signals the steep's culmination. However, time does not impose a live deadline or tighten decisions; the transition is atmospheric marker rather than pressure mechanism. The piece could function without this specific temporal bracket.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To preserve the weight of small moments" is Elara's stated motivation, echoed across beats (fleeting glances, brushed fingers, the wave/laugh/shell sequence). It shapes her ritual choices and frames the thematic question. However, the motivation is told and recited rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; we do not see a moment where preserving small moments costs her a larger goal or forces a renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Haunted euphoria" is named four times and attempts to braid joy with ghostly chill. The tone is coherent across beats (shiver, tears, euphoric waves, euphoric haunting) and charges the reunion scene. However, it reads as a label applied rather than modulated under pressure, and the final image resolves into reassurance ("smiled, locket warm") that flattens the haunting edge promised earlier.</comment>
