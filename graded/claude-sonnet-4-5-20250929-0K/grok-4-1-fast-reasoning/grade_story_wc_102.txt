<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's spiritual curiosity is asserted but his micro-choices under pressure feel pre-determined by the pilgrim-of-sparks framework rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The healing moment arrives through camera-obscura mechanics without visible internal trade-off or foreclosed path on Elias's part—he guides Mira but pays no legible cost. Mira's wound-healing reads as passive receipt rather than embodied choice. The final realization ("unused love… stored in these connections") lands as epiphany-by-narration rather than earned shift from prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when adequately early (viaduct, twilight, Elias). A single escalation occurs when Elias discovers Mira and applies the camera obscura, constituting one meaningful tightening. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias's realization reweights his quest), yet the cost is conceptual and told rather than visible on the page in a specific forfeiture or physical consequence. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of sparks, past-life memory, camera technique converging), but the final image does not impose undeniable pressure—Mira's healing is achieved, fog lifts, and Elias departs clarified without a felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The viaduct's iron arches, blooming wisteria, and misty ravine ground the scene with vivid, selective detail filtered through Elias's spiritually curious lens. The camera obscura functions as micro-setting and tool, constraining the method of healing and charging the projection moment. Spatial choreography is clear (beam, ties, projection screen). The environment does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elias unpacks the obscura unopposed—but the blooming rail ties and foggy lucidity recur in the final image, reweighting the ending without forcing a tactical shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find where unused love is stored) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias encounters Mira's wound and decides to use Kwan Yin's tear in the camera obscura. The escalation is driven by Elias's agency under an Accumulative lens, yet the cost is abstract: no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized—Mira heals, Elias gains clarity, sparks merge. The resolution feels awarded rather than earned through renunciation or endurance with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (unused love as healing connection) emerges from the camera obscura projection and past-life memory rather than direct statement. The final realization is asserted in Elias's thought ("stored in these connections") rather than arising non-literally from image alone, weakening resonance. Kwan Yin's tear recurs with shifted meaning (compassion catalyst), but the ending's thematic answer reads as epiphany-by-narration. Subtext operates in the projection's violet glow and sparks, yet the piece resolves into a tidy synthesis without ambiguity or conceptual friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, focused on Elias. Perceptual signature is present (spiritually curious, attuned to sparks) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("foggy lucidity," "halos in violet wisteria glow") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. The brief dialogue ("I see the lights too," "Breathe with the projection," "Release it") is functional but minimal, lacking subtext or goal pursuit tension. Elias's internal texture stays consistent, though some lines ("the pilgrim of sparks igniting her inner fire") read as external labeling rather than lived perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("Fog clung… like a half-remembered dream," "foggy lucidity," "blooming rail ties") without pattern-teaching or payoff, cluttering peak beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "spiritually curious" recurs three times, "foggy lucidity/lucid" four times, "sparks" nine times without meaningful reweighting. Template cadence: "He [verb]" sentence stems repeat across the opening third. Stock metaphor ("inner fire") and elevated diction ("hoarding unused love in a sacred vessel") clash with immediacy during the healing climax. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work (tear + projection + wound), but scaffold sentences ("Now, driven to find…") slow momentum. Clarity remains adequate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The camera obscura as healing device offers a fresh angle, synthesizing past-life memory, compassion relic, and optical projection. Yet the core emotional arc (self-discovery through helping another) and the resolution (love was within all along) follow a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The viaduct setting and wisteria blooms are vivid but do not impose unique constraints. "Pilgrim of sparks" and "unused love" read as prompt labels rather than irreplaceable concepts that alter tactics. The healing unfolds without friction, risk, or trade-off, resulting in median choices that avoid bold stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and makes two key decisions: pausing at the viaduct (driven by sparks) and positioning the camera obscura toward Mira. However, these choices feel pre-determined by the pilgrim framework rather than altering tactics under pressure. His artist identity is mentioned but not demonstrated in a beat that constrains options. Introduced early, involved in two beats, but swappable with "healer" or "mystic" without structural loss. Late-breaking cost connection is asserted (carries love freely now) rather than visible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's tear appears in three beats: acquisition backstory, pinhole mount, and humming during healing. It enables the projection method and recurs with reweighted meaning (compassion essence becomes healing catalyst). Early signal present. However, the tear's unique properties (pearlescent, cool, refracting) do not impose a cost or constraint—swapping for "sacred lens" would require only minor edits. Strong closure linkage ("pulsed brighter, merging sparks") but no visible trade-off tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Pilgrim of sparks" is mentioned three times as a label and frames Elias's quest thematically, but does not shape on-page stakes or alter tactics. The sparks lead him to the viaduct and flicker around Mira's wound, yet this mechanic is ornamental—Elias follows them without friction, cost, or a choice between competing spark-trails. Present early and at closure ("carried the love freely now"), but functions as thematic echo rather than causal pressure. Replaceable with "seeker" or "wanderer" without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious" is stated three times but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. Elias's curiosity prompts him to press the tear into the camera and whisper to Mira, yet these acts do not involve a visible trade-off or friction with a competing impulse. The trait remains label-only; swapping for "compassionate" or "determined" would not alter beats. Present early and mid-scene, but no visible price paid for curiosity versus caution or detachment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Heal" drives the climax: Elias guides Mira's breathing, the projection reveals the blockage, and her wound knits. This action shapes two major beats (projection setup, breathing synchronization) and defines the closure unit (Mira whole, Elias clarified). Early intention is implicit (past-life memory of hoarded love). However, the healing is achieved without failure, adaptation, or cost—removing "heal" would hollow the arc, but the method (breath + projection) does the causal work, making "heal" a strong but not indispensable label for the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The breathing method is signaled mid-scene ("Breathe with the projection"), demonstrated in two beats (Mira synchronizes inhales, then deep exhales dissolve the knot), and directly enables healing. It shapes the central attempt and payoff. Introduced after the first third (~40% mark when Mira is discovered), capping eligibility. The mechanics matter (breath rhythm unlocks sparks), but late arrival and no early priming weaken integration. Swapping for "touch" or "visualization" would require moderate edits but not break causality. Closure linkage strong, but no cost tied to the method itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct in bloom grounds the scene with vivid detail (iron arches, wisteria, misty ravine) and recurs in the final image ("viaduct's blooms shimmering"). Present throughout. However, the setting does not pressure choices—Elias arrives unopposed, unpacks his obscura, and works without environmental constraint. The blooming vines sway atmospherically but do not alter tactics. Lyric reprise at closure reweights mood (fog lifts, clarity), yet the viaduct itself is replaceable with "garden" or "temple courtyard" without structural loss. Two gates (setup, closure), solid atmospheric work, but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the past life memory surfaces") is stated early and motivates Elias's pilgrimage to the viaduct. It frames the quest but does not tighten decisions—no clock, no urgency shift. The memory content (monk hoarding love) primes the thematic resolution but is recounted rather than pressure-imposing. Present in two beats (opening, closing realization) as backstory anchor. Swapping to "after the vision" or "following the dream" would change only one phrase. No visible cost tied to the timing; the memory clarifies rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To find where unused love is stored" is declared early ("driven to find") and motivates the journey. It shapes two beats: following sparks to the viaduct and the final realization ("stored in these connections"). The quest desire drives the arc to closure. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in friction—Elias pursues it without competing want, doubt, or visible trade-off. The closure insight reweights the goal (love in acts, not a vault), satisfying the quest conceptually. Present early and at closure, but no on-page cost for seeking versus another priority. Mid-band for causal role, capped by lack of embodied conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Foggy lucidity" appears four times, anchoring tone through atmospheric detail (fog, haze, misty ravine, lucid dusk). It modulates slightly—opening mystery, mid-scene projection clarity, closing lift ("fog lifted slightly, lucid and eternal")—charging the final image with conceptual weight. Present throughout, coherent across turns. However, the tone does not pressure choices; it decorates rather than constrains. The final tonal shift (fog lifts) signals resolution but reads as post-closure flourish rather than causal force. Strong atmospheric consistency and closure reprise, but no cost or tactical impact tied to the tone itself.</comment>
