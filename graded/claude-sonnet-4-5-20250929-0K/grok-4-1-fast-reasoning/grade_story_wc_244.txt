<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias arrives with clear motivation (cure for loneliness) and the moon-rock premise drives his actions, but his "desperately jocular" trait remains largely label-only; the quips are told rather than embodied with visible cost. The community members (Mira, mechanic, poet) exist as one-dimensional figures cycling through the same reciprocity gesture without contradiction or internal friction. The ending declares emotional change ("heart mended") without on-page struggle or a foreclosed path that would earn the transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pattern of reciprocity builds through exchanges. Orientation anchors arrive early (station, dusk, community). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (loneliness fractured by reciprocity chains), but cost remains abstract: no visible forfeiture or tactical shift marks the "before" state against the "after." The rock's passage and Elias's lingering constitute the closure beat, yet the emotional price ("heart mended") is asserted rather than dramatized with a legible on-page loss or constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The disused railway station with ivy appears early and returns at closure ("ivy rustled approval"), charging the final image. Spatial choreography (tracks, arches, lantern light, bicycle entry) remains coherent. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure source, capping the score below 7.0 per the quick test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cure for loneliness) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the rock is passed and stories are exchanged, narrowing options toward communal bonds. However, the escalation is told in summary ("rumor chains ignited," "each touch sparked reciprocities") rather than dramatized beat-by-beat with visible tradeoffs. No live choice forecloses a path with on-page cost; Elias's shift from elusive to lingering is declared but not earned through a decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (reciprocity as cure for isolation) emerges from the rock-exchange ritual and is reinforced by recurring motifs (ivy, station, "polite anarchy"). The final line "bound eternally" offers resonance without moralizing. Weakness: the rock's symbolic work ("moon's just gravel, but favors? They're the real orbit!") edges toward on-the-nose articulation, and the thematic Echo ("Who knew moon dust could derail solitude?") in the penultimate beat verbalizes the story's thesis rather than letting the image carry it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds Elias as focal character with stable distance and consistent narrative stance. Voice carries a faintly elevated, lyric register ("eerie dusk when old tales twist," "electric exchange") that remains coherent. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Mira's line and Elias's quips pursue goals (offering scones, defusing doubt). Weakness: the prose occasionally slips into expository summary ("He believed it embodied reciprocity") that tells motive rather than showing it through on-page micro-choices, and the narration's certainty about community emotion ("loneliness fractured") exceeds what one focalizer can plausibly know.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; no extended runs of identical sentence stems. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("rumors…slither through the ivy like mischievous vines"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "loneliness, that relentless shadow" is immediately echoed by "cures for their isolation"; "He'd vanish after each crisis" followed by "now, burned out, he craved his own relief" restates the same emotional arc. Template cadence in the exchange sequence ("A mechanic confessed…a poet traded…") flattens momentum. The scaffold "One held it, felt compelled…binding the next in turn" summarizes rather than dramatizes the key closure sequence, dulling the final image's propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Core premise (moon rock catalyzes belonging) blends familiar tropes (magical object, isolated community, found family) without sharp transformation. The improbable-rumor-chain mechanism is mentioned but not developed into a fresh angle. Emotional arc (lone logistician finds community) follows a median trajectory without risk or surprise. The "polite anarchy" frame offers some distinctiveness, but the resolution grants symmetric satisfaction (everyone healed, no one pays a visible cost) rather than pursuing a bold or morally ambiguous stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias appears mid-story (~40% mark), seeds rumors (told in backstory), arrives, passes the rock, and lingers at closure. His decision to stay alters the ending image, granting middle development and closure participation. However, his choices are recounted rather than dramatized in real-time beats, and the "elusive" trait shifts to "lingering" without on-page friction or cost that would elevate the score above functional.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Moon rock is introduced early (Siberian op backstory, "glinted in his pocket"), handled in the central exchange beat (held up, passed to Mira, "cradled," passed hand-to-hand), and present at closure ("fragment passed"). Three touches across beats with causal involvement (rock's passage triggers story exchanges). Weakness: the rock's mechanics (how it "compels bonds") remain abstract; no specific property constrains a choice or alters tactics, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Reciprocity frames the community's ethos from the opening line ("every gift bound the giver and receiver"), drives the exchange ritual (Mira offers scones, receives rock; stories traded), and reappears at closure ("chains of reciprocity they'd forged"). The concept shapes two beats and charges the ending. However, it does not narrow options or impose a visible cost—no character refuses reciprocity or pays a price for accepting it—limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Desperately jocular" is named twice ("desperately jocular," "joked through tears," "joked desperately") but remains label-only; the quips are quoted ("Oh, this old pebble? It only works if you laugh…") without embodied cost or a moment where the joking fails or forecloses an option. No setup beat establishes the trait before the exchange, no middle choice is constrained by it, and no closure friction ties it to the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Catalyze" appears in the title of the moon rock's function, the exchange sequence ("each touch…sparked reciprocities"), and the final reflection ("mere catalyst"). The action drives the central beat (passing the rock initiates story exchanges) and the ending transformation. However, the mechanism is abstract (no visible chemistry or constraint), and the exchanges are summarized rather than dramatized in distinct beats, capping causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Improbable rumor chains are introduced early ("Rumors began to slither," seeded via "trucker…smuggler…graffiti"), mentioned in Elias's backstory, and invoked at closure ("improbable rumor chains"). The method appears in three story moments. However, the mechanics (how rumors travel, why they work) are told rather than shown in a dramatized beat, and no choice or tactic depends on the chain's structure, limiting functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Disused railway station with ivy anchors the opening paragraph, provides spatial coordinates (tracks, arches, lantern light, bicycle entry), and returns at closure ("ivy rustled approval"). Three beats, early signal, closure reprise. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it remains atmospheric rather than tactical, preventing entry into the 7+ band per the irreplaceability test.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"When the story changes" and "eerie dusk" frame the opening, "twilight deepened" marks the exchange, and "dawn's first light" closes the sequence. Time is present at setup and closure but does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline. The dusk-to-dawn passage is descriptive rather than causally pressured; no choice is forced by the clock, capping the score at the missing-middle-development threshold.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Loneliness is named in paragraph three ("shared ache: loneliness"), drives Elias's stated motive ("he craved his own relief: the cure for loneliness"), and the ending declares it resolved ("loneliness fractured," "heart mended"). Present at setup, middle, and closure. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices; Elias does not face a tradeoff between isolation and connection on the page, and the "cure" arrives without visible cost, limiting friction and causal depth.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Polite anarchy" appears in the opening line, modulates through "courteous impatience" and "polite chaos," and evolves at closure ("Polite anarchy evolved"). Tone is coherent and purposeful across beats. However, the modulation is asserted rather than enacted through syntax or rhythm shifts under pressure; the prose maintains the same elevated register throughout without a cadence break that would charge the final image, preventing entry into higher bands.</comment>
