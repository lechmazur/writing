<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—survivor hunting power from wedding rubble—is clear and consistent, and her scars provide embodiment. However, interiority leans toward label-speak ("bleak exhilaration," "unused potential") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to "seal the crystal" and "return, again and again" reads more as declaration than a decision with visible cost that forecloses a path. Backstory is present but does not tilt a present micro-choice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who and where within opening lines; the ten-minute breaker window establishes when. The closure unit is a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid: Elara seals the pool's signature and declares intent to return. Cost is implied (she's "changed—survivor turned sovereign") but the final image does not make the price undeniable on the page; the "changed" claim tells rather than shows a foreclosed path. One meaningful deepening occurs (alarms → silence → hunt → seal), satisfying accumulative escalation, but the felt cost at closure remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating observatory is anchored early with vivid detail (anti-grav coils, recycled air, grated floors, panoramic crater view). The geode crystal—cool, yielding, phasing—functions as micro-setting and constrains the hunt action in the null-grav spindle. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (sparks, thrumming air, shimmer). The setting directly enables the closure beat when she presses the crystal into the pool at the spindle, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harvest unused potential—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: alarms force the hunt during the ten-minute breaker window. Agency is present (she initiates the perturbation, hunts the pool, seals the crystal), but coincidence aids resolution (the pool "coalesces" at the spindle without clear prior setup). The cost at closure is told ("changed") rather than shown as a visible trade-off or foreclosed option, keeping escalation in the mid-band under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—unused potential in a dying world—emerges from events and the geode's phasing property. The wedding-rubble origin ties personal trauma to cosmic waste without overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph leans toward thematic summary ("potential pooled eternally," "Unfiltered, unbreakable") rather than letting the image resonate. The crystal's pulse as "her heart's echo" is a purposeful callback, but the ending asserts meaning instead of earning it through the final action. Subtext operates in the "jagged sound of exhilaration" and the bleak planet view.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature (scars itching, drone whine memory) is specific. The prose carries distinct texture ("intangibly tangible," "mist made stone," "quantum specter") that matches the SF-lyric mode. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register during peak beats ("roiling haze of virtual particles pregnant with power") that feels imposed rather than character-filtered. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. The final one-word fragments ("Unfiltered, unbreakable") feel voice-motivated and charge the ending.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (wedding backstory, crystal properties, perturbation method delivered efficiently). However, template cadence appears in the closure sequence: "She'd return, again and again, hunting more. The geode pulsed, her heart's echo. Unfiltered, unbreakable." applies repetitive short-stem structure without taught pattern payoff, triggering −0.4. Mixed metaphor: "mist made stone" and "quantum specter" sit uneasily with "solid to the eye yet phasing through barriers." Figurative density is high but mostly coherent. Paraphrase loop: "unused potential pooling" recurs without added pressure in final paragraph, applying −0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The SF-grief synthesis (wedding survivor + quantum vacuum energy) is specific, and the phasing geode offers a fresh inflection on relic-as-tool. However, the core frame—traumatized scientist hunts power in floating lab—maps closely to familiar post-apocalyptic templates without deep transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The perturbation method and vacuum energy add SFnal texture but remain ornamental rather than driving irreplaceable turns. Risk-taking in lyric compression is present but does not fully overcome the derivative premise baseline, applying −0.8 adjustment within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's choice to initiate the perturbation sequence triggers the alarm (turn one) and her choice to hunt during the breaker window drives the middle. However, the climax—finding and sealing the pool—unfolds without visible decision friction; the pool "coalesces" and she "pressed the crystal into it" with no on-page deliberation or alternate path considered. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, closure) but swappable trauma backstory; another survivor archetype could slot in with minor edits. Two beats + closure participation + early signal grant eligibility above 4.0, but lack of peak choice caps mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The geode crystal is handled across four beats: discovery in rubble, perturbation experiment, hunt with handheld emitter, and sealing the pool signature. Its phasing property ("intangibly tangible") enables the final action (pressing through the barrier). Early signal, causal pressure (syncs emitter, anchors hunt), closure linkage (seals pool, thrums with power, final pulse), and specificity (purple, jagged, vacuum resonance) all present. Cost tied to the element: she claims power but the crystal's "stolen might" and her transformation into "sovereign of the unseen" imply irreversible change. Strong integration across all gates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Unfiltered awakening" is told in one paragraph: "No data streams…just raw sensation…clarity amid desolation." It does not shape tactics or narrow options on the page; Elara hunts the same way before and after the breaker trip. The concept echoes as theme in the final line ("Unfiltered, unbreakable") but remains ornamental—swappable with "desperate focus" or "survivor's resolve" without altering structure. Present in setup (alarms trip) and closure (label reprise) but missing middle development, capping at 4.6; ornamental use and label-only treatment subtract further.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" is demonstrated three times: "phasing through barriers," "slipping half through her palm like mist made stone," and "phasing through the intangible barrier" at the null-grav spindle. The trait enables the closure action (pressing into the pool) with visible cost (she seals "stolen might," altering herself). Early signal, two distinct beats, closure linkage, and causal pressure present. However, the trait could be replaced with "permeable" or "quantum-phase" with minor edits, reducing irreplaceability. All three gates met; specificity and cost connection push into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The hunt action drives three beats: initiating the perturbation (which triggers alarms), hunting pools with the emitter during the breaker window, and zeroing in on the spindle pool. It redefines options by turning crisis (power loss) into opportunity (unfiltered clarity enables the hunt). Early signal ("she hunted here among the clouds"), middle development (hunt with emitter), and closure participation (finds and seals pool). Causal pressure and cost connection (transformation into hunter-sovereign) present. Could be replaced with "search" or "scan" with moderate edits, limiting irreplaceability; still essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Perturbation theory is named twice: "initiating the sequence through perturbation theory" and "nudge the system, watch the echoes, map the unseen." The method shapes one middle beat (micro-pulses from emitter "sent ripples into the quantum foam, echoes bouncing back"), but mechanics are told, not dramatized—no visible choice between perturbation vs. another approach. Present in setup and middle, absent from closure (she "pressed" and "sealed" without method reprise). Functional but replaceable; "resonance scan" could substitute. Missing closure gate caps at 4.6; summary-only use subtracts further.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating observatory provides the ten-minute window (breakers cooling), supplies the geode and emitter, and its null-grav spindle becomes the climax location where the pool coalesces. Early signal (opening lines anchor anti-grav coils, dome, altitude), middle development (drifts, panoramic view pressures mood), closure participation (spindle enables pool discovery). Spatial choreography is clear (dome → core chamber → spindle). Setting constraints alter tactics (she must hunt during the brief window). Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and beat involvement; irreplaceability high (ground lab would not provide null-grav spindle or drifting isolation).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The ten-minute breaker cooldown frames the hunt window: "This was the timeframe…ten precious minutes before reboot." It tightens the middle (she moves quickly, "boots silent") and the ending notes "breakers hummed toward reset." However, elapsed time is never tracked on the page—no countdown, no halfway marker, no scramble as the clock runs out. Present in setup (announced), middle (implicit urgency), and closure (reboot noted after success). Functional constraint but not live-clock tactics; swappable with "limited battery" or "approaching dawn." All three gates met; causal pressure moderate; caps mid-band for lack of tracked progression.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elara's desire to "find where unused potential pools" is stated early and pursued throughout: she initiates perturbation, hunts during the window, and seals the pool. Motivation is consistent and drives all three major beats. However, it is never dramatized in conflict—no temptation to stop, no competing want (safety vs. discovery), no on-page hesitation or cost weighed. Told in exposition ("her motive—to find…"), not embodied in choice friction. Early signal, beat involvement (three beats), closure participation (finds and claims pool); cost connection (transformation) present but abstract. All gates met; friction between want and cost missing caps upper band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Bleak exhilaration" is named once and demonstrated throughout: "bleak…the world's end had stripped the filters, leaving truth stark and thrilling"; "Bleak, yes, but the thrill surged"; "jagged sound of exhilaration in the gloom"; "in bleak exhilaration, potential pooled eternally." Tone is coherent across turns (alarm → silence → hunt → triumph) and modulates with pressure (silence brings "raw sensation," discovery brings "jagged laugh"). Charges the final image ("unbreakable" caps the exhilaration). Early signal, development across beats, closure participation all present. However, reliance on the label itself rather than pure embodiment in action and image slightly lowers irreplaceability. Strong integration; tone work elevates ending.</comment>
