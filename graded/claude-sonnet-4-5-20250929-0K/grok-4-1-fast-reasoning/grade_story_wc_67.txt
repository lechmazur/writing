<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to crystallize fleeting emotion is concrete and drives the ritual action. His interiority shows selective memory work ("omitting the bitterness of her decline") that reveals character-specific processing. However, the mask removal at the end feels gestural rather than earned by contradiction, and the internal debate ("had he truly captured her, or merely the mirage") arrives too late to complicate the preceding beats. Embodied emotion is present but the final questioning undercuts rather than deepens the cost already paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the ritual accumulates detail (ignite, powder, scatter) and the final image reweights the premise with a felt cost ("grief's rock would resume in subtler forms"). Orientation anchors who/where/what early. The rocking chair's stop functions as a clear timeframe gate that triggers the ritual. Cost is visible in the doubt and mask removal, though the ending's questioning ("had he truly captured her") slightly diffuses the charge rather than crystallizing it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gallery's vanishing points, tapered walls, and dim glow anchor the mirage-of-safety concept in spatial terms. The rocking chair is handled across multiple beats (its creak, faltering rhythm, final stop) and constrains the timing of the ritual. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "scent of scorched paper mingling with aged wood polish," "motes spiraling into the vanishing point." The environment charges the final scatter action, making it indispensable to the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving his mother's essence against decay—is signaled early and drives the ritual. The rocking chair's stop creates a clear tightening that narrows the window for action. Escalation is accumulative: sketch, ignite, powder, scatter. However, the ritual unfolds without meaningful resistance or complication; no beat forces a trade-off or alters tactics. The final doubt arrives after all costs are paid, reducing its pressure on the protagonist's agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—truth versus illusion, safety as mirage—emerges from concrete action (weaving truth carefully, scattering ash into vanishing points) rather than statement. The mask's shattered porcelain embodies fragile wholeness without over-explaining. The ending resists tidy closure: "had he truly captured her, or merely the mirage his incomplete longing allowed?" reweights the ritual without moralizing. Subtext operates in the gallery's architectural deceit and Elias's selective memory, though "mirage of safety" is slightly over-echoed across the text.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filters perception through Elias's professional and personal lens. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("somber marvel," "kinetic elegy"). However, register occasionally elevates beyond immediate pressure: "crystallizing the fleeting emotion into imperishable grains" and "perpetuating the delicate weave" feel more authorial than character-bound. The self-editing fragments near the end ("No, trim later—wait, count precise") break POV consistency and read as scaffolding left on the page.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>句rhythm varies and figurative language is generally purposeful. However, "weaves truth carefully" and "incomplete information" are repeated verbatim across distant beats without evolution, creating conceptual loops. The phrase "somber marvel" recurs five times, dulling its impact. The meta-commentary at the end ("Wait, adjust: exhaled, perpetuating the weave. [792—final tally...]") is visible scaffolding that breaks immersion and confirms generation artifact. Deduct −0.8 for loops and scaffold touching the closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The charcoal-portrait-ash-scatterer premise offers a fresh synthesis of ritual, art, and grief. The rocking chair powered by hidden gears is a specific, non-generic detail. However, the vanishing-point gallery and mask-of-shattered-porcelain lean toward symbolic convenience, and the mirage-of-safety concept is stated more than discovered. The ritual itself—ignite, powder, scatter—follows a predictable arc without a turn that subverts expectation. Emotional honesty is present, but the ending's doubt feels like a familiar retreat from bold commitment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias makes the key choice to perform the ritual unbidden, drives all four major beats (sketch, ignite, powder, scatter), and his selective memory ("omitting the bitterness") actively shapes the portrait. His final doubt and mask removal close the arc. Setup early, multiple beats, closure linkage, and visible cost all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mask appears in the opening, recurs at the ritual's midpoint ("mask's shards glinting"), and is removed at the end ("shedding porcelain flecks like tears"). However, its handling is largely descriptive; it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The final removal charges the moment but feels symbolic rather than causally necessary. Lyric reprise with moderate closure weight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Mirage of safety" is named early, recurs in the gallery description and the scattering beat, and frames the protagonist's doubt at closure. It shapes emotional stakes but does not alter tactics or narrow options in a concrete beat. The concept is more thematic echo than pressure-generating constraint. Present in closure with felt cost, but replaceable with similar abstractions.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" appears early, governs the selective portraiture ("omitting the bitterness"), and is echoed at closure ("truths carefully woven yet ever prone to shatter"). It enables the ritual and ties to the final doubt. However, the trait is more label than dramatized constraint; no on-page moment shows a visible trade-off between truth and omission. Functional across beats but lacks sharp causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Powder" is the climactic action: "took up pestle and mortar, powdering the cooled ash to finest dust, each grind crystallizing the fleeting emotion into imperishable grains." The powdering is irreplaceable—scattering ash alone would lack the transformation ritual. Setup (materials implied), development (the grinding), and payoff (scattering the powder) all present. Drives closure and embodies the core concept.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Through incomplete information" is signaled early ("fragments of memory, incomplete whispers") and recurs in the ritual beat ("Through incomplete information—memories half-told"). It shapes the selective portrait-making and charges the final doubt. However, it operates more as thematic claim than mechanical constraint; no beat shows how incompleteness alters his tactics or introduces a visible cost. Present across beats but replaceable with "selective memory."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The vanishing-point gallery frames the story, its tapered walls and illusory depths anchor the mirage concept, and the "vanishing point, where perspective devoured them into nothingness—or infinity" charges the scattering beat. The central alcove houses the rocking chair. Setup, development (the ritual occurs here), and payoff (ash scattered into the vanishing point) all present. The setting constrains the ritual's spatial logic and elevates the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"As the old rocking chair finally slows to a stop" is the precise trigger for the ritual: "This was the moment: as the old rocking chair finally slows to a stop, he enacted the rite." The chair's rhythm is tracked early ("creak a metronome"), falters mid-story ("gears whispering protest"), and its cessation gates the climax. Irreplaceable timeframe that tightens pressure and enables closure. Setup, development, payoff, and causal linkage all strong.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To crystallize a fleeting emotion" is named early as Elias's singular motivation, drives the unbidden ritual ("the fleeting emotion that haunted him: the tender ache of her last smile"), and recurs in the powder beat ("each grind crystallizing the fleeting emotion"). The motivation shapes all choices and charges the final doubt. However, internal friction between desire and doubt arrives late, reducing the sense of conflicted urgency during the ritual itself. Strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Somber marvel" is named in the opening, recurs five times, and modulates subtly (from visitor experience to Elias's own state). The tone coheres through all beats and charges the final image ("face etched by the same somber marvel"). However, repetition of the exact phrase dulls its impact, and the tone remains static rather than shifting under pressure. Present at closure but over-signaled.</comment>
