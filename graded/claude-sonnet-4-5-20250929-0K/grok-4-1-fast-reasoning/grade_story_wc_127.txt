<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias demonstrates consistent professional detachment through concrete choices (selecting the petal, calibrating notes, channeling the grotto's charge), but his interiority remains abstract—"professionally thorough," "affectionate detachment"—rather than embodied contradiction. Mira's transformation is told through labels ("raw anguish," "luminous stillness") without lived embodiment or micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to subsume her sorrow reads mechanically; no competing impulse acts in scene, and the cost (his own detachment) is asserted rather than dramatized through a foreclosed option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation (who, where, when) arrives cleanly in the opening. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the blotter petal appears in multiple beats, static electricity recurs, and the final image ("carrying the blotter petal's secret charge into the night") reweights prior material. However, the closure effect—Mira's transformation sealed, Elias unchanged—lacks visible cost; her smile and his fond removal land without forfeiting a live option or redefining his stance. One meaningful deepening (the petal absorbs her sorrow) occurs, but the ending asserts stasis rather than making cost undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The amber grotto is vividly rendered (honeyed light, resin veins, static charge) and supplies a tool (friction against jagged outcrop) that enables the scent calibration. Spatial choreography is clear (walls, ledge, depths). The grotto constrains one choice (using static to test the petal) but does not charge the final image—Elias steps out carrying the petal, and the setting falls away. Sensory detail is purposeful but not filtered through urgency; crisis does not narrow perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing Mira's transformation via the final elixir—is signaled early and pursued across beats (selecting the petal, rubbing it on amber, channeling the charge). One tightening occurs when her transformation accelerates ("Now," she gasped) and he must act immediately. However, pressure never narrows options or forces a trade-off; Elias performs his craft without friction, and the resolution (pocketing the spent petal, watching her fade) costs him nothing visible on the page. Agency is demonstration, not decision under competing goods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of "half-truths that feel whole" emerges through concrete beats (the counterfeit calm, the blotter petal darkening, Mira's detached affection mirroring Elias's). Yet the piece repeatedly labels its theme: "half-truth of serene acceptance," "half-truths sustained them all," "Thank you for the half-truth that feels whole." The final image (carrying the petal's charge into the night) offers a quiet resonance, but the penultimate paragraph's explicit statement ("bridging empathy's chasm with insight's unyielding span") undercuts earned emergence. Thematic echo in the final third lowers the score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; Elias's perceptual signature reads as professionally detached ("observing a cherished painting from afar"). Diction is consistent but occasionally drifts into elevated register not fully earned by the focalizer ("subsuming magic," "affectionate illusion," "unyielding span"). Dialogue is minimal and functional. Under peak stress (Mira's gasped "Now"), the prose does not compress or accelerate; rhythm remains uniform. Filter verbs ("sensing," "willed silently") appear but do not flatten immediacy. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Multiple text-pattern artifacts harm momentum: "affectionate" appears seven times across the piece (affectionate embrace, affectionate detachment, affectionate veil, affectionate illusion, affectionate echoes, etc.), creating a label loop that dulls specificity. Template cadence appears in stacked "professionally thorough" mentions and repeated "half-truth" constructions. The phrase "Elias, the counterfeit emotion dealer" and similar appositive labels feel scaffolded. Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "affectionate detachment" → "fond removal" → "affectionate echoes" restate without advancing pressure. Stock metaphors ("forbidden flower," "lover's parting touch") appear in peak beats without fresh inflection. These artifacts touch the closure sequence, triggering the disallowance of 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise—emotion dealer using fragrance and static electricity—offers a fresh synthesis of alchemical metaphor and sensory craft. The blotter petal as both diagnostic tool and absorption vessel is specific. However, the core emotional arc (professional detachment enabling another's transformation while the practitioner remains unmoved) follows a recognizable template. "Half-truths" as the thematic frame is signaled repeatedly rather than earned through ironic discovery. The grotto and static method feel purposeful but not indispensable; near-synonyms (another charged setting, another sensory method) could substitute with minor edits. Risk-taking is present in the lyric texture but does not heighten stakes at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias ("Counterfeit emotion dealer") is present throughout and makes key choices: selecting the blotter petal, rubbing it against amber to generate static, adjusting the scent with myrrh, channeling the grotto's charge, and drawing Mira's sorrow into the petal. Setup: introduced in paragraph 2. Development: constrains middle action (calibrating the scent, sensing imbalances). Payoff: his final choice to pocket the spent petal and step into the night shapes the ending. Three gates met. Causal pressure: his decisions enable Mira's transformation. Closure linkage: he carries the petal's charge forward. However, no visible cost or competing impulse is dramatized—his detachment is asserted, not forfeited. Swappability: "emotion dealer" could be "healer" or "alchemist" with minor rewording. Additive: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0. Subtractive: swappability −0.6, no dramatized cost −0.5. Rounding down: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "Fragrance chemist's blotter petal" is introduced early (paragraph 11), used in multiple beats (rubbed against amber to test static, held to Mira's nostrils, absorbs her sorrow, pocketed as spent, tested again for the next seeker), and appears in the final image ("carrying the blotter petal's secret charge"). Setup: paragraph 11. Development: enables scent calibration and absorption of sorrow. Payoff: final line references it. Three gates met. Beat involvement: five distinct uses. Causal pressure: the petal's properties (porosity, scent infusion, static sensitivity) drive the transformation. Closure linkage: carried forward into the night. Specificity: "orchid-shaped strip of porous paper" with unique absorption and static-testing functions is irreplaceable. Additive: early signal +0.6, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7. No major friction. Rounding down: 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Half truths" is introduced in paragraph 3 ("He specialized in half-truths") and recurs throughout as a thematic label. Setup: early. Development: the blotter petal is described as holding "a half-truth of serene acceptance," and Elias's method is to "fuse insight with empathy" via counterfeit emotion. Payoff: Mira says "Thank you for the half-truth that feels whole," and the penultimate paragraph declares "Half-truths sustained them all." Three gates met, but the concept operates primarily as theme statement rather than shaping on-page choices. Causal pressure is weak: no moment where the half-truth itself narrows options or creates a trade-off. The concept is told and reiterated, not tested. Additive: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0. Subtractive: label-only use (theme claim without constraining action) −0.3, swappability (could be "illusions" or "balm") −0.5, summary-only (recounted rather than forcing choice) −0.5. Rounding down: 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Professionally thorough" appears as a label four times ("professionally thorough hands," "With professional thoroughness," "professionally thorough even in solitude," "professionally aloof"). Setup: paragraph 2. Development: used to describe his calibration process (adjusting with myrrh, sensing imbalances). Payoff: mentioned in the final third but not in the final image. Two gates (setup, development); no closure participation. Beat involvement: descriptor in two functional beats (calibration, absorption). Causal pressure: the trait enables precision but does not create a visible trade-off or cost. Cost: none dramatized—his thoroughness succeeds without friction. Specificity: swappable with "meticulous" or "precise." Additive: early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (enabling only) +0.4. Subtractive: label-only (no enacted constraint) −0.3, swappability −0.5, missing closure gate −0.6, no cost −0.5. Rounding down: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Subsume" appears five times: Elias subsumes insight with empathy, grief into crystalline detachment, excess sorrow into the blotter petal, his own faint pang of detachment into the work. Setup: paragraph 3 ("turning her grief into crystalline detachment"). Development: the major turn occurs when Elias draws Mira's anguish into the petal ("With professional thoroughness, he subsumed it"). Payoff: the transformation is sealed and he subsumes his own detachment in solitude. Three gates met. Beat involvement: three distinct beats. Causal pressure: the act of subsuming enables the transformation. Closure linkage: the completed transformation is the ending's hinge. However, "subsume" could be replaced with "absorb," "channel," or "transmute" with minimal edits—the word itself is not irreplaceable. Additive: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2. Subtractive: swappability −0.6, label repetition (five uses dilute specificity) −0.3. Rounding down: 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Sensing through static electricity" is introduced mid-story (paragraph 13: "He closed his eyes, sensing through static electricity") and used in two beats: calibrating the scent (a spark jumps, he adjusts with myrrh) and channeling the grotto's charge to complete Mira's transformation. Setup: late first appearance (paragraph 13, ~38% through). Development: enables scent adjustment. Payoff: used at the transformation's climax and tested again in the penultimate paragraph. Two gates (development, payoff); setup is late. Beat involvement: three touches (calibration, transformation, solo test). Causal pressure: the method enables the transformation. Closure linkage: the final solo test ("sparking static to test a fresh petal") extends the method into the next cycle. Specificity: the grotto's amber provides the charge, and static reveals "imbalances in the fragrance's emotional weave"—unique mechanics. Additive: two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.6. Subtractive: late first appearance (second third) −0.4. Rounding down: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "Amber grotto at dusk" is introduced in the opening line and recurs throughout (honeyed light, resin veins, static-prone amber, ancient charge, walls that sigh approval). Setup: immediate. Development: Elias rubs the blotter petal against a jagged amber outcrop to generate static—the setting supplies a tool that enables the scent calibration. Payoff: the grotto's glow softens around Mira's new form, and Elias tests another amber vein alone before stepping out. Three gates met. Beat involvement: three distinct beats (opening atmosphere, friction for static, solo test). Causal pressure: the outcrop's friction is necessary for static calibration. Closure linkage: the grotto holds its breath in the penultimate paragraph, and Elias traces another amber vein, but the final image is "stepped out...into the night"—the setting is left behind, not charged in the last line. Specificity: amber's static properties are unique. Additive: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage (partial—present but not in final image) +0.6, specificity +0.6. Subtractive: the grotto does not constrain a choice (no locked door, no forbidden zone, no cost for staying or leaving). Rounding down: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"As the transformation completes" is the structural hinge. Setup: Mira's transformation is introduced in paragraph 5 ("the transformation neared completion") and signals urgency. Development: her breaths grow ragged, the transformation accelerates, she gasps "Now," and Elias must act immediately. Payoff: "the transformation sealed," "the transformation's completion a quiet victory." Three gates met. The timeframe tightens decisions in the middle (the "Now" moment forces Elias to hold the petal to her nostrils and channel the charge). Causal pressure: the accelerating transformation narrows the window for action. Closure linkage: "the transformation's completion" is the ending's anchor. However, the clock is not tracked with concrete markers (seconds, breaths, physical changes in sequence)—urgency is asserted rather than metered on the page. Additive: early signal +0.5, two beats (urgency cue, climax) +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.2. Subtractive: vague tracking (no concrete countdown) −0.4. Rounding down: 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To fuse insight with empathy" is introduced in paragraph 4 ("fusing insight's clarity with empathy's warmth") and recurs as Elias's stated goal. Setup: early. Development: the blotter petal is "meticulously balanced to evoke empathy's pull while insight's logic held it at bay," and the final scent is "grief's insight retained, its empathetic sting subsumed into affectionate illusion." Payoff: Mira says "You've fused it perfectly." Three gates met. However, the motivation is told and demonstrated (he performs the fusion successfully) rather than dramatized as conflicted choice. No moment where Elias must choose between insight and empathy or pay a cost for fusing them. The desire is label-only, without friction. Additive: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (Mira's line) +0.8. Subtractive: label-only (no enacted trade-off) −0.3, told-only (no dramatized conflict between wants and costs) −0.5, swappability (could be "balance detachment with comfort") −0.4. Rounding down: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" is introduced in paragraph 4 and recurs seven times as descriptor and label ("affectionate embrace," "affectionate veil," "affectionate illusion," "affectionate removal," "affectionate echoes"). Setup: immediate. Development: the tone colors Elias's narration ("observing a cherished painting from afar," "fond removal") and modulates slightly under pressure ("his fingers tingled, sensing the emotional torrent"). Payoff: the final image maintains the tone ("professionally thorough even in solitude," "affectionate echoes in the air"). Three gates met. The tone is coherent across beats and charges the ending by sustaining Elias's unchanged stance. However, repetition of "affectionate" (seven uses) creates a label loop that flattens specificity rather than modulating with pressure. The tone does not shift under stress—Elias remains uniformly detached. Additive: early signal +0.6, three+ beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, coherence across turns +0.5. Subtractive: label repetition (seven uses without fresh inflection) −0.5, static mood (no modulation under peak stress) −0.4. Rounding down: 6.7.</comment>
