<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The guard's transformation from "dreamless" to "faint reverie stirring" tracks through the text, but the arc relies heavily on abstract terms ("purpose blooms," "sparks in freighted soul") rather than embodied contradiction. Internal conflict is present but operates at a symbolic register that distances the reader from immediate pressure. The final micro-choice—setting the clock down and walking on—carries some weight but feels inevitable rather than torn. Interiority remains lyric-specific rather than therapy-speak, which preserves voice, but the lack of visceral stakes or competing impulses keeps this in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (lyric compression, elliptical fragments, motif accretion) and maintains it through closure. Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (guard, dune, post-burn wasteland), satisfying the test. The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the guard's role shifts from passive freight-tender to active spark-cultivator, crystallized in "dreamless no longer quite so" and the image of blooms glowing on. Cost is conceptual and felt—his prior dreamless stasis is broken—but the final image could land with sharper on-page consequence. One meaningful deepening occurs when he touches the clock and the archive awakens, altering his tactics from guarding to nurturing. The lens holds, but the cost at closure remains oblique rather than viscerally legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glowing dune functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: phosphor thorns house the clock, blooms cradle sparks, veins thread the sand. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("silica veins that throb with hidden fire," "petals parting to reveal sparks"), filtered through the guard's perceptual lens. The dune's glow "fractures sharper" as pressure builds, modulating with the narrative arc. Spatial choreography is coherent across the guard's movements. The final image—blooms glowing on, petals folding soft—charges closure by embodying the cultivated sparks. The dune is indispensable to the story's logic and directly shapes the ending, meeting the high-band test for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to cultivate sparks in unlit corners, signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the guard lifts the clock and "purpose blooms within," narrowing his role from passive freight-tender to active nurturer. The archive's awakening ("visions cascade") presents a reversal that changes his knowledge and options. Agency is present but operates at a symbolic register—"charms," "wave functions bend"—rather than through concrete forfeiture or physical trade-off. The cost is conceptual (dreamless stasis breaks) but not viscerally felt on the page. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, and the final image reweights the opening state, but the escalation lacks sharp on-page friction or a moment where the guard must sacrifice one live option for another.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—renewal from ash, agency in tending fragile possibility—emerges through recurring images (sparks, blooms, lullaby, fractured) rather than statement. The chess clock as "key to the divergent archive" integrates premise and theme organically. The final image ("After the burn, new forests dream in waiting") reweights the opening without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image (clock warming, petals closing, faint smile). The piece resists tidy resolution, leaving "occasionally everywhere" and "bloom on" as charged ambiguity. However, the thematic vocabulary recurs frequently enough to feel slightly over-signaled ("fractured," "lullaby," "sparks," "unlit corners" appear in most paragraphs), and the conceptual cost at closure remains abstract rather than particular. Strong thematic coherence, but the resonance is more asserted than earned through on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyric-specific, with purposeful compression and patterned diction ("occasionally everywhere," "wave functions hum approval"). POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates intentionally (close interiority to wider declarative at closure). Non-standard punctuation and fragments are pattern-taught and legible. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats ("wave functions coiling like smoke," "essence smeared across probabilities") that sits at the edge of the guard's plausible lexicon. Perceptual signature is present but somewhat generic for a "dreamless" figure; his noticing is more conceptual than sensorily particular. Rhythmic control is strong, but the recursive sentence stems ("He + action," "Sparks + verb," "The dune + state") create mild template cadence in the middle third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and the piece reads aloud with lyric cadence. Information density is high; most lines serve multiple functions. However, paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "purpose blooms within" / "motivation stirs, unbidden"; "freight he guards" / "no longer mere cargo"; "dreamless vigil fractures" / "dreamless no longer quite so." Template cadence runs are present: "He + verb" stems cluster in the middle third ("He pauses," "He lifts," "He knows," "He moves," "He sets"). Stock metaphors recur without fresh inflection ("heavy as a silenced heart," "click, though time denies it"). The figurative language is dense but sometimes muddles ("wave functions coiling like smoke from a dying pyre" mixes quantum abstraction with combustion imagery). Apply paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template-cadence (−0.5), and stock-metaphor (−0.3) deductions for cumulative −1.0 in Q7, plus mild figurative muddle (−0.3). These artifacts touch multiple beats but do not obscure the closure image directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic wasteland, quantum divergence, and lullaby tone is non-obvious and specific. The chess clock as archive key is a fresh inflection on the "relic unlocks hidden world" trope. The guard's shift from dreamless to dreaming offers emotional specificity rather than generic hope-from-despair. The "occasionally everywhere" attribute and wave-function method integrate the quantum premise into narrative action rather than ornament. However, the core arc—lone guardian finds artifact, awakens hidden power, becomes active agent—follows a familiar template. The lyric register and speculative vocabulary distinguish the execution, but the emotional and plot beats do not transform the premise into something unrecognizable from its blueprint. Risk-taking in tone and compression is present, but the arc itself is conventional. Within-band adjustment +0.2 for coherent risk in voice and concept, but proximity to template structure limits the ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dreamless freight guard is present from the opening, frames the POV, and drives the key turn when he "clutches it tighter" and "purpose blooms within." His decision to charm the clock and awaken the archive changes tactics from passive guarding to active nurturing. He appears in the climax ("sets the clock amid the flowers") and the final image ("walks on, dreamless no longer quite so"). His choices create the arc. Setup +0.8, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.5. No significant frictions. Score: 3.0 base +4.8 = 7.8, round down to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The chess clock appears early ("There, half-buried"), is lifted and felt ("heavy as a silenced heart"), identified as the archive key, touched to charm the wave functions, has its hands moved ("click, though time denies it"), warms as sparks leap, and is set amid flowers at closure with "hands twitching toward dawn." Present in setup +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7. No frictions. 3.0 +5.7 = 8.7, round to 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The divergent archive is named early, described as "core repository of timelines splintered," and its awakening floods the guard's mind with visions. It enables his shift from passive to active agent and is referenced at closure ("archive dormant yet alive"). Setup +0.8, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.4. No major frictions. 3.0 +3.4 = 6.4, round to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Occasionally everywhere" is introduced mid-story ("He is occasionally everywhere"), repeated in multiple paragraphs, and appears in the final image ("In the divergent weave, all is occasionally everywhere"). It conveys thematic resonance but does not constrain an on-page choice or create a visible tradeoff. The attribute is present but ornamental. Setup absent (−0.4), closure mention +0.7, ornamental use (−0.8), swappability (−0.5). 3.0 −1.0 = 2.0, but lyric reprise lifts to mid-4s: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Charm" is signaled early ("action born of quiet will"), executed at the key turn ("With a touch, he charms it"), repeated across beats ("he dances the charm," "He charms deeper," "charm complete"), and referenced at closure ("waiting his next charm"). It drives the archive's awakening and the guard's shift in role. Setup +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5. No frictions. 3.0 +4.8 = 7.8, round to 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Through wave functions" is named early ("He knows the method: through wave functions"), repeated in the charm sequence ("wave functions, the quantum weave," "Wave functions bend," "wave functions settle"), and appears at closure ("Wave functions hum their approval"). It shapes the mechanics of the archive's awakening but remains abstract rather than tactile. Setup +0.8, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +0.8, abstract texture (−0.5). 3.0 +2.7 = 5.7, round to 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glowing dune is present from the opening ("petals sigh on the glowing dune in bloom"), its glow "fractures sharper" as pressure builds, blooms house the clock and cradle sparks, veins thread the sand, and the final image centers on "blooms glow on" and "petals folding soft." It constrains the guard's movements and supplies the sparks he nurtures. Setup +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.6. No frictions. 3.0 +5.9 = 8.9, round to 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the last forest burns" appears in the opening and closing lines, framing the piece. It provides thematic atmosphere and stakes (post-burn wasteland, possibility of renewal) but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Setup +0.8, closure reprise +0.7, no middle pressure, swappable with similar post-collapse frames (−0.6). 3.0 +0.9 = 3.9, lyric reprise lifts to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners" is signaled early ("His motivation stirs"), drives the middle turn (archive awakening, nurturing sparks), and is referenced at closure ("Sparks flicker in unlit corners, waiting his next charm"). It shapes the guard's choices but is told more than dramatized in friction. Setup +0.8, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, told-only (−0.5). 3.0 +3.4 = 6.4, round to 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Fractured lullaby" is present in the opening ("mother's fractured croon"), recurs in the middle ("lullaby shards," "Hush now, little embers," "lullaby fractures the night"), and charges the final image ("lullaby weaving eternal," "Fractured lullaby carries on the wind"). Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure. Setup +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.6. Slight static repetition (−0.3). 3.0 +3.8 = 6.8, round to 6.5.</comment>
