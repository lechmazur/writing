<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is told ("to encrypt vulnerability as strength") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Her choices follow a linear path—descend, retrieve, dance, unlock—without genuine internal friction or cost that would make her struggle credible. The cryo-pod colleagues arrive as convenient plot furniture, not relationships under pressure. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("calm defiance," "racing pulse") and therapy-speak abstractions instead of embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words—who Elara is, why she's diving now, and what "corporate saboteurs" means remain vague until well into the piece, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The closure involves dancing to unlock a vault and then reviving colleagues, but the causal chain is weak: the dance-as-explanation and the sudden cryo-pod discovery feel introduced for convenience rather than earned by prior setup. Cost at closure is asserted ("vulnerability forged into collective strength") but not dramatically visible on the page; we don't see what Elara loses or forecloses by this choice. The drive lens appears Causal but linkages are often declarative rather than because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is described with atmospheric detail (phosphorescent algae, silt, rusted bulkheads) but functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is coherent and the underwater environment adds texture, yet no environmental feature materially narrows Elara's tactical options or charges the final image—she moves through the space freely. The setting meets mid-band functionality but does not elevate to necessity. (Q3 cap at 7.0 applied per Orientation Test penalty in Q2.)</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—retrieve the archive—is signaled early, but pressure remains static: Elara encounters each obstacle (journal, vault lock, cryo-pods) in sequence and solves it without visible trade-offs or escalating cost. The hull groans are mentioned as a timing pressure but never force a choice or alter tactics. The cryo-pod colleagues' revival is a micro turn, not a deepening driven by protagonist agency; it feels appended rather than earned. No on-page tightening that forecloses a live option or forces a sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated in the final paragraphs ("calm defiance," "vulnerability forged into collective strength," "quiet revolution") rather than emerging from specific action and image. The hangman's dice and dance motifs are mentioned but never accumulate into a resonant non-literal answer; they serve as ornamental callbacks. The ending summarizes the journey's meaning instead of letting the final image reweigh prior material. Subtext is minimal; most emotional and thematic content is declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable with no head-hopping, but perceptual signature is generic—Elara's noticing does not reflect character-specific bias or idiom. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("mysterious familiarity," "lyrical triumph") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. The brief dialogue at the end is functional but lacks subtext or goal-driven indirection. Filter verbs and expository interiority ("her motivation burned deep") dull immediacy. Prose rhythm is competent but not voice-distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence dominate: "calm defiance" appears five times, "mysterious familiarity" three times, "as a spider spins" recurs without payoff, and many paragraphs open with "Elara [verb]" or "The [noun]" stems. Stock metaphors ("spider's web," "silken thread") and therapy-speak labels ("encrypt vulnerability as strength") in peak beats reduce specificity. The final third is saturated with summary and thematic echo rather than scene pressure, triggering the artifact cap: disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8. Sentence-level propulsion is sluggish; many lines repeat content without adding pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—underwater heist via lyrical dance and coded dice—reads as a prompt-assembled checklist rather than an organic synthesis. Core tropes (lone genius, corporate saboteurs, cryo-pods) are unmodified stock elements. The dance-as-explanation and hangman's dice mechanics are mentioned but not explored with specific constraints or costs that would make them feel inevitable. Emotional arc could transfer to any retrieval plot with minor edits. No bold perspectival or structural risk beyond surface novelty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara makes choices (descend, decode, dance, revive) but these are sequential task completions rather than turns that redefine stakes or options. She is present throughout but functions as plot executor; no key reversal traces to her internal conflict or transformation. Late-scene decision to revive colleagues is reactive, not causal pressure from her lyrical code-breaking trait.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Hangman's dice appear in three beats: journal decoding, the lyrical melody roll, and the final palm-pass to a colleague. Setup is present by first third; middle use is functional but static (rolls are described, not shown constraining choice); ending reprise is ornamental. The dice do not narrow options or impose visible cost. Swappable with any decryption token. Capped at 4.6 for minimal causal work and closure role that is mentioned, not active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Calm defiance" is asserted repeatedly as label but does not shape on-page tactics or choices in a way that distinguishes it from generic determination. No moment where calm versus panic alters what Elara can or cannot do. Concept functions as theme claim, not stake constraint. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dance-as-explanation is setup in journal lore, deployed in the vault-unlock beat, and reprised briefly during cryo-pod revival. Middle use shows the attribute enabling a key action (AI recognition), meeting the gate for 5.0–6.9 band. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown with specific cost or trade-off (e.g., time pressure, physical exhaustion). No visible price tied to the dance itself, limiting score within band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Liberate" frames the mission from the start, drives the vault-unlock beat, and extends to freeing colleagues at closure. Present across setup, middle, and ending. The action is central but somewhat generic—any retrieval verb could substitute with modest edits. No unique constraint or cost specific to "liberate" versus "retrieve" or "recover." Mid-band for solid integration but limited irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Coded journal entries are discovered mid-scene, decoded via hangman's dice, and provide vault passphrases. Setup is late (second third), but the method does enable the middle unlock beat. However, the journal is inert once decoded; it does not constrain later choices or reappear at closure. Functional but replaceable; capped at 4.6 for late introduction and minimal closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sunken laboratory anchors the entire scene, provides atmospheric texture (algae, silt, pressure), and the vault chamber is the goal locus. Setup is immediate; middle beats occur within its confines; ending remains situated there before ascent. The setting does not, however, force a tactical choice or visibly shape the final image—Elara's actions would proceed similarly in any underwater ruin. Solid presence across gates but limited causal pressure, placing it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"As a spider spins its web" appears as simile four times but never functions as tracked time or countdown. No ticking clock or temporal constraint that alters Elara's decisions. The phrase is decorative metaphor, not a timeframe mechanic. Ornamental mention, no gate satisfaction.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Motivation is told early ("to encrypt vulnerability as strength") and reasserted at closure, satisfying setup and ending mention. However, it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—Elara does not face a choice where encrypting vulnerability requires a sacrifice or trade-off on the page. Summary-only, no middle friction. Capped at functional but replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is declared in paragraph two, repeated as phrase throughout, and reasserted in the final lines. Tone is asserted rather than modulated through diction or rhythm; the prose maintains a uniform elevated register regardless of pressure. No coherent tonal shift or purposeful tension. Label-only integration, minimal causal work, capped at mid-low functional band.</comment>
