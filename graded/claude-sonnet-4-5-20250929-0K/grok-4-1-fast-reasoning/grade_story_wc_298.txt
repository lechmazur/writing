<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—patching soul-holes—is declared but never constrained by competing impulses; she moves through the ritual without hesitation, doubt, or embodied cost until the very end. Internal contradiction is absent: "fiercely gentle" reads as a label rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The final worry ("wondered if mending her soul had ensnared another's") arrives as afterthought rather than earned friction, and no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first paragraph; the single scene holds spatial coherence. Causality is present but thin: Elara finds the card, performs a ritual, and blood seals the pact—each step follows the prior, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs until the vague final worry. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant: "soul patched, trammel complete"), yet the cost—"wondered if mending her soul had ensnared another's"—is asserted rather than dramatized, weakening legibility. Under a Causal lens, the ritual proceeds without reversal or narrowed options; under Accumulative, the pattern does not break or shift cadence decisively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly anchored with sensory particulars (phosphorescent fungi, bone-laced walls, loam-strewn corridors, roots coiling). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elara kneels, chants, and completes the ritual without environmental resistance—preventing entry to the 9-band. The burned tarot card and roots function as props rather than environmental pressures that shape outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—patching Elara's soul—is signaled early but never tightens meaningfully. No on-page reversal or cost narrows options; the ritual proceeds linearly from card discovery to blood seal to vague success. Agency is present (she decides to perform the rite) but does not foreclose a live option with visible price. The final note ("wondered if mending her soul had ensnared another's") gestures at consequence but does not dramatize it, leaving cost legibility weak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme—bartering destinies and the cost of mending—emerges from particulars (the burned card, roots, blood), yet the ending offers no resonant, non-literal answer; it states the outcome ("soul patched, trammel complete") without reweighting prior material. The final worry is an assertion rather than an image that charges the question. Recurrence of "fiercely gentle," "trammel," and "inlaying meaning" reads as label-repetition rather than motifs that constrain choice or accumulate pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited with stable distance and consistent tense. Perceptual signature is present ("dusky resolve," "fiercely gentle") but does not vary under pressure; diction remains elevated and uniform throughout, with no compression or rhythm shift at peak stress. Repeated stems ("her reckless…her idealist…her brother's…") and synonym churn ("fiercely gentle," "dusky resolve," "reckless idealist") flatten texture. No dialogue on the page.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Elara had come…Elara's soul ached…Elara felt…Elara smiled…Elara departed" recurs across eight beats; "fiercely gentle" and "reckless idealist" cycle without added pressure. Mixed metaphors ("roots…like veins through marble" juxtaposed with "roots groaned, coiling to trammel") and stock metaphors ("heart a…flame," "glow pulsing like a heartbeat") reduce clarity in peak beats. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard setting and the burned tarot card offer specific texture, yet the ritual arc—grief-driven protagonist performs forbidden rite to resurrect/commune with a lost loved one—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The phrase "bartered destinies" and "trammeling fates" echo stock fantasy idiom. The final ambiguity ("wondered if…") is a late gesture rather than a synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara's recklessness is labeled ("reckless idealist") but does not create a key turn; she decides to perform the ritual and completes it without meaningful choice under pressure. Her idealism motivates the attempt but does not constrain or enable a pivotal beat with visible cost. Present throughout but swappable with "determined grieving protagonist" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The burned tarot card appears in three beats: discovery in the skull's eye socket, examination with gold-leaf inlay, and pressing against the root to seal the pact. Its burned state and "The Lovers" image shape the ritual's thematic frame. However, its use does not narrow options or enable a tactic that would fail without it; a generic relic could replace it with minor edits. Early signal and beat involvement elevate it, but swappability and lack of causal pressure cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Bartered destinies" is labeled in exposition ("destinies could be bartered like tarnished coins," "bartered destinies swapped like cards") and thematically echoed, but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. The ritual is performed, not negotiated or traded; no exchange with another party occurs. Present as theme claim but does not change options or constrain a choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Fiercely gentle" appears as a label in five beats ("fiercely gentle flame," "Fiercely gentle in her touch," "fiercely gentle precision," "fiercely gentle magic," "fiercely gentle art") but never constrains or enables an action with visible cost. The trait is asserted, not dramatized through a tradeoff or choice where gentleness limits force or vice versa. Ornamental repetition without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Trammel" appears in six beats: used as verb (trammeling destiny to echo, might trammel souls and freedom, roots trammel the card), noun (trammel bound tighter, trammel complete), and thematic echo. It shapes the ritual's framing and final image but does not create a major turn; the binding proceeds without reversal or cost that traces to this specific action. Could be replaced with "bind," "seal," or "ensnare" with minor edits. Early signal and closure participation elevate it, but swappability caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Inlaying meaning everywhere" is labeled twice ("lived by inlaying meaning everywhere," "fiercely gentle art of meaning inlaid everywhere") and described once (tracing runes, binding life threads). The method is summarized rather than dramatized; mechanics are not shown in a way that shapes tactics or outcomes. Functional but replaceable with "ritual magic" or "weaving spells."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard frames the entire scene with vivid sensory detail (phosphorescent fungi, bone-laced walls, roots snaking through bones) and supplies the materials for the ritual (skull, roots, bones). The setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure, but it is indispensable to the ritual's logic and charges the final image ("glow lingered behind her"). Early signal, beat involvement across the entire piece, and closure linkage elevate it; lack of causal pressure or tactical constraint prevents higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Within the glow of half-lit corridors" anchors the setting luminance but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions or tracks elapsed duration. No clock or temporal pressure is evident; the ritual unfolds without urgency or time constraint. Ornamental mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To patch holes in the soul" is signaled early, dramatized through the ritual (pressing card, chanting, slicing palm, sealing with blood), and paid off in the final image ("soul patched"). The desire drives the scene's action and is tied to visible cost (blood, binding tighter than foreseen). Early signal, beat involvement, and closure linkage elevate it; lack of friction between wants and competing costs (no meaningful hesitation or tradeoff on the page) prevents higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Dusky resolve" is labeled in three beats (opening, midpoint, final third) and matches the somber, determined atmosphere. Tone remains static throughout—no modulation with pressure or cadence shift at peak beats. The mood is coherent but does not charge the final image with contrast or intensification. Functional but replaceable with "grim determination" or "quiet resolve."</comment>
