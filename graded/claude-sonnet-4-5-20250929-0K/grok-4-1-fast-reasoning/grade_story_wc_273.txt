<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation (discovering why time slows in crisis) is stated clearly but remains abstract; his choices in the scene—crushing the drone, stepping into the ink—feel reactive rather than shaped by internal contradiction. The "serene anger" is labeled repeatedly without embodied tension or competing impulses acting simultaneously. Mira's appearance and disappearance function as plot devices without enough relational pressure to test Elowen's values. The final "resolve" is told rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a visible path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when coalesce only after the opening paragraph, and the encampment's spatial layout remains vague throughout. The piece infers a Causal lens (drone message → ink patterns → disappearance → pursuit → revelation), but the closure unit—Elowen's understanding and Mira's return—lands off-stage in summary ("he understood now") rather than through a dramatized on-page reversal. The cost is asserted ("serene anger eased to resolve") but not visibly paid in action or image. Escalation is present (bandits → eclipse crisis → Mira's disappearance → void journey) but the final beat summarizes rather than shows the change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment is evocative in the opening, and the ink patterns on parched ground anchor the inciting action. However, spatial choreography is weak: we never learn tent positions, distances, or how the ink pools relate to Elowen's or Mira's locations. The void and "prismatic shards" remain abstract; no tactile or sensory detail grounds the journey. The encampment does not constrain any choice or charge the final image, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding time's warp in crisis—is signaled early but remains conceptual; the scene pressure comes from Mira's disappearance, a secondary event. Elowen's agency at the key turn (crushing the drone, stepping into the ink) is reactive and lacks a visible trade-off or cost on the page. The void journey replays past crisis imagery but does not narrow options or force a choice. Mira's explanation ("Crisis inks the soul…") tells the answer rather than dramatizing a discovery that changes tactics, and the return happens off-stage without earned consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of time, crisis, and wild perception emerges clearly, but the resolution leans on direct statement: "Crisis inks the soul; time slows for those consciously wild…" and "evolutionary echo, survival's gift." The final paragraph's "serene anger eased to resolve" is a tidy emotional summary rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. The ink motif recurs but does not shift meaning at closure; it remains a mechanical device rather than a charged symbol. No counter-reading complicates the premise; the explanation is presented as settled fact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elowen, but perceptual signature is thin: his observations (eclipse's umbra, wind-carved tents, ink patterns) could belong to any narrator. Diction drifts into elevated academic register ("consciously wild," "shadow-weavers," "temporal affliction," "evolutionary echo") that sits uneasily with a tracker's interiority. Dialogue is minimal; Mira's single line ("Crisis inks the soul…") reads as thematic exposition rather than goal-driven speech. The void sequence ("time warped instantly, stretching the encampment's tents into infinite echoes") abstracts rather than grounds perception. Rhythmic control is present in the opening but flattens during the climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The prose carries heavy overwriting throughout: "sinuous, bone-like forms that whispered of endurance," "deliberate feral grace," "serene anger," "ephemeral patterns: swirling mandalas of azure fractals that danced and reformed like living runes." Stock metaphor strings ("time's secret," "ink's embrace," "raw pulse of the wild") cluster in peak beats without specificity. Template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "He moved…rejecting…"; "A serene anger simmered…none more maddening…"; "That question burned…propelling…". Paraphrase loops are frequent: "time slows for those consciously wild, rejecting fate's haste" echoes the earlier "rejecting the encampment's fragile order for the raw pulse of the wild." Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to hold its breath," "his voice echoed") dull immediacy. The closure beat summarizes ("he understood now") rather than showing in image or action, and the final line ("the wind-carved world sharper in crisis's wake") is abstract.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The albino tracker, disappearing ink, and time-warp crisis premise combine familiar speculative elements without a fresh synthesis. The emotional arc—mystery pursued, answer given, anger resolved—follows a template trajectory. The void journey and Mira's exposition deliver the answer rather than forcing Elowen to discover it through specific action or cost. The "evolutionary echo" explanation for time dilation is told as settled fact rather than an earned, ambiguous insight. The wind-carved encampment and eclipse are vivid but not transformed through Elowen's specific choices or worldview.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elowen is present throughout and his albino traits are mentioned, but his choices (crushing the drone, stepping into the ink) are reactive; he does not create the key turns. His tracking ability is mentioned but never used on the page. Setup is present, middle development is weak (he follows rather than decides), and closure participation is passive (understanding arrives via Mira's explanation).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The hummingbird drone appears in one beat, delivering the message cylinder, then is crushed to release ink. It enables the inciting complication but does not return with reweighted meaning or constrain a later choice. Setup is present, middle use is functional (crushing for ink), but closure participation is absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Disappearing ink is the core mechanism: it forms patterns, Mira uses them to vanish, and Elowen follows. It shapes the inciting turn and the pursuit, and the void journey literalizes its properties. However, the mechanics are abstract ("ephemeral patterns," "ink's embrace") rather than tactile, and the ink does not constrain tactics or reappear at closure to reweight meaning. Setup, middle use, and thematic presence earn mid-band placement, but the lack of closure charge and swappability (could be any vanishing device) limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Consciously wild" is labeled repeatedly ("consciously wild nature," "consciously wild instincts," "consciously wild path") but never enacted in a specific choice with visible cost. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action that would fail without it. Late in the story, Mira's explanation ties it to time perception, but this is told rather than dramatized. Ornamental use without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Disappearance drives the structure: Mira disappears, pulling Elowen into pursuit; he disappears into the ink patterns, entering the void. The action is signaled early, enacted at the midpoint, and shapes the void journey. However, the return ("emerging in the encampment") is summarized, and the final image does not hinge on disappearance itself but on understanding. Present in setup, middle, and ending; causal but not indispensable to the final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Ephemeral patterns in spilled ink are described in detail ("swirling mandalas of azure fractals") and Mira traces them to vanish; Elowen spills more ink to reignite the patterns and follows. The method is signaled, its mechanics matter to the pursuit, and it structures the middle sequence. However, the patterns do not return at closure or constrain the final choice; the ending summarizes understanding without revisiting the ink. Setup and middle use are strong; closure participation is absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment is named four times and described vividly in the opening, but it does not pressure any choice or supply resources. The "wind-carved world sharper in crisis's wake" returns as a final-line image, but the encampment itself does not constrain tactics or reweight meaning. Postcard description without causal work; late reprise is thematic but does not alter options.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After the eclipse ends" anchors the opening and the bandits' raid occurred "as the moon devoured the sun," but the timeframe does not tighten decisions. No clock or deadline presses Elowen's pursuit; the eclipse is past and does not recur. Present in setup, absent in middle escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elowen's desire to discover why time slows in crisis is stated explicitly and propels him into the ink. However, the motivation remains abstract and does not create friction or cost; Mira simply explains the answer in the void. The motivation is present in setup and middle pursuit, but the payoff is told rather than earned through a choice that tests competing wants. Functional but not charged with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Serene anger" is named five times as a label ("serene anger simmered," "that quiet rage," "serene anger etching his features," "anger lingered serene," "Serene anger eased to resolve") but is not enacted in contradictory gesture, speech, or choice. The tone does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image; it is asserted uniformly. Label-only use without embodiment or closure participation.</comment>
