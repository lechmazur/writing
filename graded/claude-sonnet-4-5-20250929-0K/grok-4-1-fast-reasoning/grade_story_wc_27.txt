<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("discover meaning in the mess") is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "awkwardly confident" trait appears as label-only repetition without constraining choices or revealing internal conflict in action. The climactic moment—placing palms on the stone, receiving visions—happens *to* her rather than through a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("pulse quickening," "resolve steeling") and therapy-speak abstractions ("meaning pierced the mess") instead of embodied, character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening lines, satisfying the test. However, the closure relies on a convenience artifact: the stone circle's hum broadcasts to rebel comms without prior setup of transmission mechanics or Elara's agency in choosing to activate it. The "rebellion reignited" outcome is told via summary ("distant voices rousing") rather than shown through a decisive on-page change with felt cost. The drive lens reads as attempted Causal but collapses into Situational coincidence (ancient relic solves the problem it did not help create), and no meaningful tightening occurs—Elara's stance at the end is identical to her opening motivation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The spaceport repair bay is anchored early with vivid, purpose-driven detail ("rusted hulls," "grit-strewn ferrocrete," "fractured dome"). Sensory selection reflects the POV's priorities (stars, relics, the stone circle's chill). However, the setting does not constrain a key choice—Elara moves freely through the bay without spatial or resource friction. The stone circle charges the final image but appears late (past midpoint) and does not shape prior tactics, capping the score below 7.0 per the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("discover meaning") is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page tightening forces a trade-off or narrows options. The stone circle's hum resolves the rebellion's lull without Elara making a decision that costs her something visible—she kneels, receives visions, and the problem solves itself. Coincidence (ancient relic conveniently broadcasts the signal) drives the outcome rather than protagonist agency. No meaningful escalation under any lens; pressure is declared ("gnawed at her," "doubt") but not dramatized through choices that alter tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme (meaning amid chaos, rebellion as cosmic thread) emerges from concrete particulars (stars, stones, vintage opera glasses). However, the final paragraph lapses into direct statement: "Meaning pierced the mess: stars, stones, and souls aligned" is on-the-nose moralizing rather than resonant image. The opera glasses recur but serve ornamental rather than thematic pressure—they amplify the hum without constraining a choice or reweighting prior material. The "thunderous serenity" motif is repeated as label without modulating under pressure or charging the closure with subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable (close third, single focalizer). However, diction repeatedly drifts into elevated register inconsistent with crisis perception: "thunderous serenity," "molten amber and deepening indigo," "cosmic thread" feel writerly rather than character-particular. Recycled syntactic stems dominate: "She [verb]," "Elara [verb]," "The [noun] [verb]" across a dozen consecutive beats. Perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices stars and stones but her way of noticing lacks idiosyncratic bias. Free indirect style is clean, but voice lacks the specificity required for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "thunderous serenity" appears six times, "awkwardly confident" four times, "barefoot" five times, often within a single sentence of prior mention. Template cadence runs through the final third: "She [verb]. Elara [verb]. The [noun] [verb]." Stock metaphors dominate peak beats: "like a heart paused before the storm," "sparks leaping," "fury's prelude." Mixed vehicle: "thunderous serenity" is contradictory without coherent sensory grounding. Filter-verb stacks ("felt the hum," "saw the convergence") dull immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure unit ("meaning bloomed eternal"), triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Core premise (mystical relic reignites rebellion during a lull) is a widely used template without transformation. The stone circle arrives as a problem-solver rather than arising from established world logic or character pursuit. Elara's "barefoot stargazer" and "awkwardly confident" traits are quirky ornament rather than specific lived detail that alters choices. The vintage opera glasses amplify the hum but feel like checklist integration rather than organic synthesis. Emotional truth is generic ("hope dimmed like a failing reactor core"); no fresh angle on rebellion, meaning, or renewal beyond surface novelty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara (barefoot stargazer) is present throughout and observes extensively, but her key "choices"—kneeling, placing palms, peering through glasses—are passive receptions of the stone circle's hum rather than decisions that alter tactics. The reignition happens *to* her (visions flood, hum broadcasts) without agency-driven cost. Setup is strong (first paragraph); middle beats involve movement and observation but no constraining choice; closure participation is summary-only ("she strode out," "rebellion stirred"). Late first-third positioning and ornamental closure cap the score below functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The vintage opera glasses appear in two distinct beats: workbench discovery (mid-first third) and amplification of the hum (final third). However, their function is swappable—any magnification tool could serve the same role. They do not constrain a choice (Elara simply picks them up) and their "amplify the hum into a beacon" mechanic arrives without prior setup. The celestial motifs are described but do not reweight meaning at closure. Present across beats but replaceable and ornamental, capping the score at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"A lull in rebellion" is signaled early ("sputtered into a lull, fighters scattered") and shapes the dominant stake (reignite hope). The concept constrains Elara's motivation and the ending's resolution (lull shattered, rebels mobilized). However, the mechanics are told rather than shown—"distant voices rousing" is summary, not dramatized choice. The lull itself does not pressure Elara's tactics; she encounters no resistance or scarcity tied to the rebellion's state. Setup and thematic closure participation are strong; middle development and causal pressure are weak, placing the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Awkwardly confident" appears four times as label-only description ("moved with awkwardly confident grace," "awkwardly confident resolve," "awkward confidence no longer a quirk"). It never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost—Elara's movements and choices read identically whether the trait is present or not. No tradeoff, friction, or earned transformation tied to the attribute. Ornamental and forced, scoring in the minimal-integration band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Reignite" is the story's central action, signaled early ("reignite the fire") and resolved in the climax ("reignited her spirit," "reignited the rebellion"). The stone circle's hum is the method, and Elara's placement of palms triggers the broadcast. However, the action is passive reception rather than protagonist decision, and the mechanics arrive without prior setup (late-breaking rule). Present in setup, climax, and closure summary, but causality is weak and the outcome is convenience-driven. Strong closure linkage but swappable mechanics cap the score at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"By the hum of an ancient stone circle" is signaled past the midpoint ("half-buried beneath collapsed gantries") and its mechanics (broadcast to rebel comms) are introduced only at the climax. The hum itself does not shape Elara's prior attempts—she discovers it, kneels, and it solves the problem. Method-as-solution rather than method-shaping-tactics. Late arrival, ornamental middle, and closure participation via convenience cap the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is anchored in the opening line and supplies vivid particulars (rusted hulls, ferrocrete, fractured dome, workbench with opera glasses). However, the setting does not constrain choices—Elara moves freely without spatial friction or resource scarcity. The stone circle is buried within the bay and charges the final image, but the bay itself is postcard description rather than tactical pressure. Setup is strong; middle and closure participation are weak, placing the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"In the margin of daylight" appears in the opening line and final third ("margin of daylight's fade"), creating a lyric frame. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Elara has unlimited time to explore, kneel, and activate the stone circle. No clock pressure, no urgency tied to twilight ending. The phrase is atmospheric but functionally inert, scoring in the ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To discover meaning in the mess" is declared early ("driven by a singular motivation") and returns at closure ("meaning pierced the mess"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through contradictory wants or costs. Elara seeks meaning, finds the stone circle, and receives visions—no friction between desire and price. Setup and thematic closure linkage are present; embodied conflict and choice-driven cost are absent, capping the score at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Thunderous serenity" appears six times across the story as a repeated label ("thunderous serenity enveloped her," "thunderous serenity crashing within," "thunderous serenity birthed fury's prelude"). The phrase is oxymoronic without coherent sensory grounding—how does silence "thunder"? Tone does not modulate with pressure; it remains a static descriptor rather than a quality that charges the final image. Ornamental repetition without integration, scoring in the low-functional band.</comment>
