<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover deleted files is clear and drives her choices, but her interiority leans heavily on descriptive labels ("brightly attentive," "motivation surged") rather than embodied contradiction. The lie and archive access form a credible escalation, yet the final cost—job loss for truth—is asserted in summary rather than dramatized with visible consequences that alter her present stance. Her agency at closure reads as observation more than a choice that forecloses options with felt weight on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story establishes a causal lens: Elara's fixation leads to pattern discovery, lie, archive unlock, crew revelation, and corporate purge. Orientation anchors (corporate memory keeper, Social Nexus Archive, her cubicle) arrive early enough. However, the closure unit—"became the bridge to the deleted"—lands as metaphorical assertion rather than a decisive change with on-page cost; the job-loss consequence is told in summary ("The lie had cost her job") two beats after the climax, diluting the felt price at the moment of reckoning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Social Nexus Archive as digital mausoleum is evocative, and the cubicle's "sterile hum" grounds early beats. The mission patch's "gold-threaded rocket insignia" and "high-res scan" add tactile specificity. The archive's "underlayers" and "corporate purgatory" constrain Elara's access, shaping the lie beat, but the final image does not charge the setting element—logged-out screen and "night" are generic. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—where deleted files go—is signaled early and drives the query, lie, and archive dive. The lie triggers approval and unlocks the vault, a meaningful tightening that narrows options. Yet the alarms and "corporate purge inbound" arrive as external coincidence rather than a consequence of her prior choice, and the final cost (job loss) is summarized after the fact rather than paid in the closure beat, softening the felt price under causal pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of digital ghosts and corporate erasure emerges through Lena's crew backups and the recurring 2519 motif. "We're not gone; we're archived in the absence" offers a conceptual hook, but "nothing truly vanished" in the penultimate line states the thesis rather than letting the patch or 2519 reprise carry it obliquely. The final image—numbers on retinas, "bridge to the deleted"—gestures toward resonance but abstracts rather than grounds the thematic question in a specific, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Voice establishes corporate-archival diction early ("catalog forgotten profiles, prune ghost accounts") and Elara's perceptual bias toward anomalies. However, mid-story the prose drifts into meta-commentary ("word count exceeded; trim back mentally") that breaks the fourth wall and undermines focalization. Filter verbs ("her fixation gnawed," "truth resonated") cluster without voice motivation, and the final paragraph's "sensed absence lifted" repeats the prompt phrase rather than embodying the shift through distinct perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "Did they dissolve into nothingness, or haunt the archive's underlayers" closely mirrors "where deleted files truly went, beyond the official purge." Template cadence ("Yet here… Yet the numbers…") and synonym churn ("recurring," "recurred," "persisted") cluster in the middle third. The self-aware scaffold ("word count exceeded; trim back mentally, but proceed as is? No, must fit") is a generation artifact that breaks immersion. The final third includes "sensed absence" three times without fresh pressure, and "2519 pulsed once more, a final song unsung" stacks metaphors that blur sense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—consciousness backups hidden in social-media detritus—offers a fresh angle on digital-afterlife tropes, and the mission patch as beacon is specific. However, the cold-case framework and corporate-purge climax follow familiar templates, and the emotional arc (lone keeper risks job for truth) does not transform the structure through non-obvious moral calculus. The meta-commentary about word count undermines immersion and reads as unfinished draft rather than purposeful risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara's role as memory keeper frames the story and her attentiveness enables pattern detection (setup). She composes the query and forges the timestamp (middle choice), and the ending names her "the bridge to the deleted." However, her final stance is asserted ("became the bridge") rather than enacted through a closure decision with visible cost, and the job-loss consequence is summarized post-climax. Two of three gates met; causal involvement moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The patch appears in the obscured post scan (setup), is described with tactile specificity ("gold-threaded rocket insignia"), and Elara archives it locally before logout (closure participation). It functions as Lena's beacon and the key to the crew's trail, driving Elara's revelation. Present across three beats with clear causal pressure and irreplaceability (the exact artifact matters), but it does not constrain a middle choice or visibly alter tactics between discovery and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Odyssey-2519 cold case is introduced at the midpoint, frames the crew mystery, and Elara's discovery of consciousness backups rewrites the "no survivors" narrative (setup and middle turn). The ending calls it "a cold case thawed," tying closure to the concept. However, "missing persons" as a procedural stake does not shape on-page tactics—Elara's method is archival pattern-matching, not investigation. Two gates met with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive" appears twice as a descriptor ("Elara was brightly attentive," "brightly attentive gaze locked") but functions as label rather than constraint. It does not enable a distinct choice with visible cost or trade-off; Elara's pattern-spotting could proceed identically with "meticulous" or "focused." Setup only; ornamental use without middle or closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lie (forging timestamp, "urgent compliance audit") unlocks the sealed archive, a decisive middle turn. Approval "pinged back instantly," enabling the crew discovery. The ending asserts "The lie had cost her job," tying consequence to the action, and names it in the final third ("the lie"). However, the cost is told in summary after the climax rather than paid on-page at closure, and the approval arrives as instant convenience, softening felt price. Two gates; moderate causal force.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>2519 appears throughout: comment timestamps, likes, pixel glitches, account name "CrewEcho2519," mission patch, consciousness backup markers, and final reprise on her retinas. Setup before the 25% mark; drives the trace backward, Odyssey discovery, and crew revelation (middle beats). The ending image—"2519 pulsed once more"—recharges the motif with cost ("promising more absences to chase"). Three gates; strong beat involvement and closure linkage, though the mechanics (why 2519 marks backups) are asserted rather than shown.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The Social Nexus Archive frames the entire story (setup), and its "sealed archives—off-limits without executive nod" constrains Elara's access, forcing the lie (middle pressure). The "corporate purgatory" where half-deleted files persist enables the crew discovery. Terminal lockout at closure reflects archive control. Three gates; causal pressure across beats, though the cubicle and logout do not uniquely shape the final image compared to any other workspace.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" appears in the framing (setup) and twice in the middle ("echo of faded space ballads," "Across the echo of forgotten songs, 2519 wove their trail") as ambient metaphor. The songs—"Stellar Drift" from 2047, crew banter remixes—mark timeline layers but do not create urgency or tighten decisions. Timeframe is structural (decades of archive history) rather than tactical (a live clock). Setup and thematic presence; swappable with "layers of archive history."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover "where deleted files truly went" is stated in paragraph four (setup), drives her fixation on 2519 (middle beats), and the ending answers the question: "Where deleted files went? To keepers like her." The query and lie are tactics in service of this want. Three gates; clear causal linkage, though the friction between want and cost is told ("motivation surged") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Sensed absence" appears throughout: "echoes faded into sensed absence," "in the sensed absence of answers," "sensed absence, truth resonated," "Sensed absence lifted." Setup early; modulates from ambient void to revelation to final lift. However, the phrase functions as label more than embodied perception—Elara's experience of absence is asserted rather than shown through selective attention or cognitive gaps. Tone coherent but static; the lift at closure is declared, not charged through image.</comment>
