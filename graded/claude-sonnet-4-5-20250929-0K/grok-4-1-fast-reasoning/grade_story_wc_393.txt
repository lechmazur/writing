<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's core motivation (guilt over Marcus) is clear and embodied through concrete memories. The internal conflict between his prior judgment and present remorse drives the repair-shop visit with visible cost. However, the character leans toward retrospective contemplation rather than live contradiction under pressure; his choices feel more dutiful than torn. The final vow arrives as declaration rather than a decision with on-page tradeoff, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias vows to advocate with "aptly deliberate" grace, reweighting his earlier failure. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (guilt accretes through memory, the music box's revival, and storm imagery converge to shift stance). Orientation is clean. Cost is felt but oblique—he recognizes Marcus deserved better, yet the vow itself remains abstract promise rather than on-page forfeit or tactical shift. The Harrow scene delivers one meaningful deepening (the heart ticking) but the climactic insight ("second opinions...deserve to beat anew") reads as thematic summary rather than dramatized renunciation or crystallized choice with immediate consequence, holding the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The repair shop is vividly rendered (dust motes, dangling keys, mullioned windows) and the clockwork heart constrains Harrow's work, directly shaping the pivotal repair beat. The storm exterior mirrors interior pressure and the final light-break charges the closure moment. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The workbench and tools function as micro-setting that enables the turn, meeting the 9+ gate requirement and lifting the score solidly into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—redeeming Marcus's memory by repairing the heart—is signaled early and coheres. One meaningful tightening occurs when the heart quivers under lightning, then ticks. Agency is present (Elias brings the box, Harrow repairs it) but the escalation is external (storm, light) rather than driven by protagonist choices under rising pressure. The final vow feels aspirational rather than a trade-off that narrows options with visible cost, holding escalation clarity in the mid-6s under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (second opinions as grace, mechanical and moral redemption) emerges organically from the clockwork heart and Elias's regret. The final image—box ticking, light cascading—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moral. However, the closing paragraph ("second opinions...deserve to beat anew") edges toward thematic statement rather than pure image, and "realization bloomed" reads as authorial summary. The story invites reflection through particulars but the last lines nudge exposition, capping the score just below 7.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias; distance and tense are consistent. Diction is elevated ("filigreed ventricle," "ethereal tinkles") and purposeful, creating a distinct texture. Dialogue (Elias and Harrow) carries subtext and advances plot cleanly. However, "aptly deliberate" appears three times in identical phrasing, reading as prompt-insertion rather than organic voice. The phrase "vibrant hush" recurs mechanically (opening, mid, close) without modulation, and some interiority ("guilt propelled him") tells rather than embodies under peak pressure, preventing entry into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentences vary in structure and rhythm; figurative language (dust motes as fireflies, light as mercy) is vivid and mostly coherent. Information density is high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "aptly deliberate" (three times), "vibrant hush" (three times), and "calm before realization" (twice) without functional variation. The phrase "by the way light breaks through storm clouds" arrives mid-story as a tagged requirement, reading as scaffolded insertion. Template cadence in the final paragraph ("Stepping out...he vowed...realization bloomed") stacks declarative summary beats. Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template cadence (−0.4), and phrase-insertion artifact (−0.3) totals roughly −0.9 in Q7, holding the score in the low-6s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The chaplain + clockwork heart + repair-shop frame is a recognizable redemption template (guilt → symbolic repair → vow). The premise does not transform the pattern through unexpected moral calculus or world logic; emotional beats (regret, repair, resolve) follow predictable stations. The light-breaking device and storm backdrop lean on stock symbolism. Specific details (Bible verses etched on gears, Marcus carving by candlelight) add texture but do not inflect the arc with a non-obvious synthesis. Applying derivative-premise adjustment (−0.8) and mid-level specificity, the score lands in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias frames the story and his choice to bring the box drives setup and closure participation. He appears in at least three beats (entry, confession, final vow). However, his climactic action is the vow itself—an internal declaration rather than a decision that alters on-page tactics with visible cost. The repair is executed by Harrow; Elias observes. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, but observer role at climax and summary vow cap causal pressure. Total ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The clockwork heart is present in setup (carried under arm), development (Harrow examines and repairs), and closure (ticks, hymn plays). It appears in at least three beats and its transformation (still → ticking) directly enables the thematic turn. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (Bible verses, filigreed ventricle) +0.5. No major frictions. Total ~7.2, rounding to 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Second opinions are discussed in dialogue (Harrow: "second opinions are the soul of repair") and frame Elias's regret (he never gave Marcus one). The concept shapes the dominant stake thematically. However, it is not tested through on-page choice—Elias does not face a scene where granting or withholding a second opinion alters tactics. The phrase recurs in the final paragraph as thematic summary rather than decision point. Present throughout +0.4, thematic linkage +0.5, but no beat-level causal pressure or cost. Swappability (could use "second chance" with minor edits) −0.5. Total ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Aptly deliberate" appears three times identically (Elias's footsteps, Harrow's movements, Elias's quest). The trait describes pacing but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost—no moment where deliberateness prevents haste or costs time under pressure. It reads as label-only trait inserted to satisfy the prompt. Label-only −0.6, ornamental use −0.5, swappability −0.4. Total ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Deserve" recurs throughout: Elias tells Marcus "you deserve this second chance," reflects "Marcus deserved better," Harrow says "deserve...that's for clocks and men," and the final line claims second opinions are what broken hearts "deserve." The action shapes the dominant stake and closure thematically. However, it is discussed rather than dramatized through a scene where worthiness is tested or contested with on-page cost. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, thematic closure linkage +0.9, but no causal pressure moment where "deserve" narrows options. Total ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Light breaking through storm clouds occurs once, mid-story, when lightning strikes the workbench and bathes the heart in glow, triggering the quiver and repair. The method is signaled (storm exterior mentioned earlier) and its mechanics matter (light warms brass → click). It appears in one key beat and enables the turn. Setup (storm mentioned) +0.4, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage (repair leads to vow) +0.5, but late first functional use (second third) −0.3. Total ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The antique music box repair shop is named in the opening line and grounds all action. It supplies the workbench, tools, and Harrow's expertise, directly enabling the repair. The shop's "vibrant hush" and ticking curios create atmosphere throughout. Early signal +0.7, three beats (entry, examination, repair) +1.4, causal pressure (shop resources enable plot) +1.0, closure linkage (final hymn fills shop) +0.9, specificity (dangling keys, mullioned windows) +0.5. No major frictions. Total ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Calm before realization" appears three times (opening, mid, close) but functions as atmosphere label rather than a ticking clock. Time is not tracked or tight; no moment where elapsed minutes alter choices. The storm swells outside but does not impose deadline pressure. The phrase recurs thematically at closure ("realization bloomed") but without temporal constraint. Lyric reprise +0.3, closure participation (thematic) +0.4, but ornamental use −0.6, no causal tightening −0.5, swappability −0.4. Total ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias's desire to turn apology into action is stated early ("too quick to judge...dismissed Marcus's plea") and drives the repair-shop visit. Harrow echoes it ("your bringing it here turned apology into action"). The motivation appears in setup, middle reflection, and closure dialogue. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8. However, the final vow is told rather than dramatized through a choice with visible cost; friction between regret and action is summarized, not shown under pressure. Summary-only climax −0.6, told motivation −0.4. Total ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Vibrant hush" appears in the opening line, mid-story ("vibrant hush, where every word resonated"), and closing paragraph ("vibrant hush reborn"). The tone modulates slightly (anticipation → grief → hope) but the phrase itself is repeated identically without evolving meaning. It charges the final image thematically but does not constrain choice or shift cadence under pressure. Lyric reprise +0.5, closure participation +0.6, three mentions +0.8, but static phrasing −0.5, ornamental use −0.4, label-only cohesion −0.3. Total ~5.1.</comment>
