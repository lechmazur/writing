<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to cultivate psychological safety is clearly stated, and his choice to use the glass eye is purposeful. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("fractured grace," "veritas nerve") rather than embodied contradiction. The moments with Lira and Thom show outcome but not visceral internal conflict during the act itself. The final reflection—"had occlusion truly healed, or merely draped the fractures in silken deceit?"—reads as externally posed rather than character-specific doubt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows a causal arc: Elias finds the relic, performs the ritual, tests the occlusion, and the orchard responds. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis—he accepts the cost of deceit to preserve communal safety—but the cost is asserted in reflection rather than dramatized through a forfeited option or visible consequence. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (orchard, Elias, post-virus world), and the lens reads as Causal with an accumulative texture. The final cost ("pondered the cost…had occlusion truly healed") is told rather than shown in a choice or loss on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The hanging orchard, ravine, and storms are vividly rendered and recur throughout. The glass eye as micro-setting object constrains Elias's final choice and charges the ending image ("the relic occluding deeper doubts"). However, spatial choreography during the ritual and descent is vague—no concrete sense of where Elias stands or moves. Setting details ("gnarled trees," "storm-battered walls") are poetic but do not alter tactics or options in a legible way during peak beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—psychological safety versus involuntary truth—is signaled early and drives Elias's choice to insert the eye. One meaningful tightening occurs when he tests the occlusion on Lira and Thom, narrowing his path forward. However, escalation is compressed: the ritual itself lacks visible resistance or complication, and the cost is reflected upon rather than paid in a forfeited relationship or immediate consequence. The closure reconfigures his stance but does so through internal monologue rather than a dramatized turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus merciful deceit emerges organically from the virus premise and Elias's actions. The glass eye and truffle imagery recur and shift meaning, particularly in the final line ("whole in his duality"). However, the closing reflection—"had occlusion truly healed, or merely draped the fractures in silken deceit?"—borders on explicit theme statement rather than resonant implication. The particulars (eye, truffles, storm) support the theme without forcing it, but the ending leans toward articulating the question rather than dramatizing its answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent elevated register throughout, but diction frequently drifts into ornamental abstraction ("shards of fractured grace," "elegies to lost illusions," "silken deceit") that obscures immediate action. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Elias's lies to Lira and Thom read naturally. However, the narrative voice does not modulate under pressure—peak moments (the insertion, the first test) carry the same lyric density as exposition, flattening urgency. Perceptual signature is vague; Elias's way of noticing (via sensors and probes) is asserted but not shown in sensory selectivity during the ritual or descent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prose is dense with figurative language in nearly every sentence ("defiant prayers," "fractured grace," "veritas nerve," "mycelium rumored to bridge relic and flesh"), creating a pattern of elevated diction that dulls propulsion in high-pressure beats. The ritual sequence—"disinfected…anointed…pressed"—is clear but surrounded by ornamental phrasing that slows momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "psychological safety demanded sacrifice" is restated as "cultivating the safety he'd chased." Mixed metaphors ("storm-trapped moon," "veritas nerve") and stock constructions ("winds howled elegies") reduce clarity. The artifact density is pervasive and touches the closure beat ("fractured but unbroken," "whole in his duality"), triggering the lower artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the guidance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The empathy virus premise and the glass-eye cure offer a fresh synthesis, and the orchard setting is specific. However, the core emotional arc—choosing comforting lies over painful truth—follows a familiar template without a non-obvious moral calculus. The "rumored cure" and "discredited textbook" feel like convenient plot devices rather than deeply integrated world logic. The ending's duality ("whole in his duality") gestures toward transformation but does not surprise or reweight prior material in an unexpected way. Risk-taking is modest; the lyric density is consistent but does not heighten stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias appears early, drives the ritual choice at midpoint, and his observation-plus-action (unearthing, inserting, testing) alters tactics. His rationalism (sensors, probes) is asserted but not shown constraining choices during the ritual. Present in closure but his final reflection is passive rather than a decisive turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass eye is unearthed early, handled during the ritual (disinfected, anointed, inserted), tested on Lira and Thom, and returns in the final image ("unblinking sentinel," "whole in his duality"). It shapes two beats (ritual, test) and charges the ending. Cost is tied to it (the lie-enabling occlusion). Minor cap for slightly ornamental final mention, but causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The smuggled relic is introduced early (unearthed glass eye from Venetian guild), enables the ritual, and reappears at closure. However, "smuggled" matters less than "occluding device"—the smuggling backstory does not constrain choices or alter tactics on the page. The concept is present and logically consistent but largely replaceable with "forbidden cure" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Involuntary truthfulness is established early (virus rewired survivors), drives Elias's motivation (his admissions shattered Lira's love, exposed Thom's ambitions), and the glass eye's function is to block it. The trait constrains his relationships and enables the ritual's stakes. Visible tradeoff: he gains social safety but loses authenticity. Present in closure ("occluding deeper doubts"). Cost is clear.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Occlude is the mechanism of the ritual ("occlude the veritas nerve," "pressed the antique eye into place, its cool sphere occluding") and returns at closure ("the relic occluding deeper doubts"). It shapes one major beat (the insertion) and charges the final image. However, the action itself is brief and could be swapped for "block" or "suppress" without structural loss. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Discredited textbooks are introduced early (Elias hoards them, one passage describes the eye's function), and the ritual follows their archaic method. The method signals the eye's use but does not constrain Elias's tactics—he could have used trial and error. Present in setup and payoff (ritual and closure), but the middle beat lacks friction from the method itself. Functional; slightly generic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hanging orchard is anchored early and recurs throughout (root ball, upper branches, tenders below, storms). It provides the discovery site (eye under root ball) and social context (tenders Lira and Thom). Storms mirror internal conflict but do not alter tactics on the page. Setting participates in closure ("orchard pulsed with renewed rhythm") but as backdrop rather than active constraint. One causal beat (discovery); closure presence weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Post-virus timeframe is established early and provides the involuntary-truthfulness affliction that drives the plot. However, "after the empathy virus" functions as static backstory rather than a live timeline—no clock tightens decisions, and the passage of time (from dawn to eve) is vague. Present in setup and thematically at closure, but does not pressure choices in the middle. Functional background, not a driver.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Psychological safety is introduced early ("he sought psychological safety"), drives the ritual choice (block involuntary truth to restore communal bonds), and is tested on Lira and Thom ("You've given us space to breathe"). The motivation is dramatized through Elias's past failures (Lira's shattered love, Thom's exposed ambitions) and the final outcome (orchard tenders gather, "safety took root"). Friction is present: truth versus safety. Cost is visible (he sacrifices authenticity). Strong integration across beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Fractured grace appears as a recurring phrase ("fractured grace," "grace in the breach," "conversations laced with fractured grace," "grace fractured but unbroken") and matches the lyric register. However, tone is static—no modulation between calm and crisis beats. The phrase is ornamental in most instances and does not charge the final image with new meaning. Present throughout but more label than lived pressure. Mid-band for consistent presence without escalation.</comment>
