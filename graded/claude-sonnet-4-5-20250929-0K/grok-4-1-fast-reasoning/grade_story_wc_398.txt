<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation (seeking solace after a quarrel) is established, but her internal experience remains abstract—we get "heart echoing," "futile shadows," labels rather than embodied contradiction. Theo is more vivid (calloused hand, vigilant eyes), yet his choices don't alter tactics; he simply recounts his backstory. The ending shift ("not rejection but nature's gentle redirection") arrives as告诉 insight without on-page micro-choices that earn it, and diagnostic phrasing like "intersubjective understanding" and "destined mismatches" intrudes where bodily reaction would ground the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation is prompt: Elena, autumn dusk, vacant station, vineyard pavilion. The story follows a Situational lens—Elena arrives, listens, reframes her quarrel—but the closure is a summary declaration ("rediscovered in the night's subtle passion") rather than an on-page decisive change or charged image. The reversal (quarrel as revelation rather than fracture) is asserted in Theo's dialogue and then told in the penultimate paragraph, not dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Cost is conceptual but abstract, not anchored in a concrete final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The amber pavilion, skeletal vines, lantern glow, and mulled wine anchor the scene with sensory detail filtered through Elena's urgency. The burned letter fragment functions as a micro-object that constrains the conversation and charges the final exchange. Spatial choreography is clean (threshold, bench, Theo's vest pocket). The setting pressures Elena's choice by offering refuge and a parallel story, lifting the score above mere postcard description, though the autumn imagery ("swirling amber leaves," "honeyed light") leans decorative in the opening and middle without fresh specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elena processing her quarrel and deciding whether to stay or leave—is signaled early. Theo's parallel story functions as a complication, but the tightening is conceptual (recognition of mismatch) rather than a decision that narrows options with visible cost. The final act ("rose as dawn's first light gilded") tells us she departs "rediscovered," yet we don't see what she sacrifices or what path she forecloses; the coincidence of Theo's matching story provides the turn, not Elena's agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of destined mismatches as sculptors of self emerges through Theo's parallel and the burned letter, but the final image ("rediscovered in the night's subtle passion") states the theme rather than offering a non-literal answer. The penultimate paragraph summarizes the concept ("teach us to nurture understanding beyond possession") in near-prompt language. The letter fragment and vine metaphors recur but feel arranged to echo the thesis rather than arising from concrete choice pressure, and the ending's tidy affirmation undercuts ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays stable on Elena with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated ("encroaching night," "destiny's quiet ache," "fated enigmas") but remains consistent, though phrases like "intersubjective understanding" and "nurture understanding beyond possession" read academic rather than Elena's perceptual signature under stress. Theo's dialogue carries subtext and specificity ("vines whisper secrets," "eternal clashes that birth beauty"), distinguishing his voice from Elena's interiority. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at emotional beats (close when Elena traces the fragment, wider when Theo recounts backstory), but the final summary paragraph ("rediscovered in the night's subtle passion") tells rather than showing her shift through image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is adequate; no causality breaks or spatial confusion. Rhythm varies across paragraphs, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes. However, paraphrase loops appear: "destined to diverge like vines twisting apart" / "destined mismatches"; "amber glow" recurs four times without fresh detail; "gently persuasive" is labeled twice. Stock metaphors cluster in peak beats: "overripe fruit," "steady flame," "tapestry of passionate subtlety," "eternal clashes that birth beauty." Register drift into abstraction ("intersubjective understanding," "alchemy where one heart echoes another's hidden rhythms") appears in the closure zone, dulling immediacy. Template cadence in Theo's backstory: "In my youth…I met Clara" / "Just as your architect…Clara and I" / "See here…she wrote." Combined artifacts in the final third trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack baseline (−0.6 to −1.0 in Q7) and disallow 9+ globally per the cap rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The vineyard-sentinel / traveler frame and the burned letter as talisman are familiar tropes. The core premise—parallel love stories as mutual consolation—closely follows the mentor-stranger-offers-wisdom template without transformation through lived occupational detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Emotional specificity is thin: Elena's quarrel and Theo's lost love are summarized rather than rendered through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The vine/mismatch metaphor is stated ("vines twisting apart," "vines that part to let sunlight kiss") rather than discovered through action, and the closure restates the prompt concept ("destined mismatches") without fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Theo is present throughout (setup, middle, ending) and his dialogue offers the parallel that reframes Elena's quarrel (middle choice involvement, closure participation). However, his choices are recounting rather than decision; he extends a hand, pours wine, produces the fragment, and speaks—gestures that enable Elena's reflection but do not narrow his own options or create a turn. He functions as catalyst, not agent. Present by first third (+0.3 to +0.5), one beat involvement (+0.4), closure participation via dialogue (+0.5), but no causal pressure from his decisions (−0.5 swappability, a wise elder could serve the same role). Band: low-functional, two gates met but minimal agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The burned letter fragment appears in the middle (Theo produces it, places it in Elena's palm) and at the ending (she returns it as "talisman of release"). Two beats, setup waived as pattern is taught by use, middle involvement (she traces it, feeling turmoil), and closure reprise with reweighted meaning (release rather than regret). Early signal via Theo's vest pocket (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.7), specificity (charred edge, ink-blurred script) (+0.4). However, the fragment does not constrain a choice—Elena's realization is told around it, not forced by handling it—so causal pressure is modest (+0.3). Late first appearance (beyond first third) −0.3. Band: solid middle, two-gate lyric reprise with charged specificity but limited causal force.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Destined mismatches" is named repeatedly and discussed by Theo ("fated enigmas," "mismatches teach us to nurture understanding"), shaping the thematic frame. It informs Elena's realization (stakes involvement) and the ending summary ("rediscovered… destined mismatches that sculpted the self"), meeting closure participation. However, it is stated rather than dramatically tested—no on-page choice where Elena must choose between paths because of mismatch logic. Present by middle (+0.4), closure claim (+0.3), but label-only without causal constraint (−0.5), resolves via summary (−0.5). Swappable with "irreconcilable differences" or similar (−0.4). Band: low-functional, ornamental concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Gently persuasive" is labeled twice (paragraph 6 "his voice gently persuasive," paragraph 16 "gently persuasive in unveiling") but not shown constraining an action with cost. Theo's tone enables Elena to listen and open up, which advances plot, but no moment depicts him choosing gentleness over another tactic with visible trade-off. Present by first third (+0.3), one beat (the invitation) (+0.4), closure zone (his final whisper is restrained) (+0.3), but label-only without embodied cost (−0.5), no visible constraint on his choices (−0.4). Introduced late (paragraph 6, past first fifth) −0.2. Band: low-functional, trait stated not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Rediscover" appears in paragraph 16 ("he began to rediscover the tale with her") and paragraph 22 ("Elena began to rediscover her own strength") and the final line ("rediscovered in the night's subtle passion"). The action frames the middle turn (Theo drawing parallels helps Elena see her quarrel anew) and the ending (her departure as newfound clarity). Present by middle (+0.5), two beats (Theo's recounting, Elena's realization) (+0.9), closure participation (final line) (+0.7). However, "rediscover" is interchangeable with "reframe" or "recognize"—the mechanics are Theo's storytelling, not a unique action (−0.6 swappability). Summary-only in key moments (−0.4). Band: mid-functional, present across arc but replaceable method.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"By drawing parallels" is named in paragraph 16 ("by drawing parallels that wove their stories") and paragraph 21 ("By drawing these parallels, Elena began to rediscover"), and the method is demonstrated: Theo recounts his Clara story, matching Elena's architect dilemma. Present by middle (+0.5), two beats (recounting, Elena's recognition) (+0.9), closure setup (+0.5). Yet the method is told ("he began to rediscover… by drawing parallels") rather than shown through a choice where the parallel-drawing itself imposes a cost or constraint (−0.5). Swappable with "by sharing his story" (−0.4). Band: mid-functional, method labeled and used but not uniquely causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The amber pavilion is established early (paragraph 3 "glowing amber pavilion," paragraph 4 latticed walls, lanterns) and remains the sole setting throughout, framing all action. It provides refuge (timeframe pressure: no taxis, nightfall), enables the conversation (bench, mulled wine), and charges the ending (dawn light gilding vines as Elena departs). Setup by first fifth (+0.6), continuous presence across all beats (+1.2), closure participation (dawn on vines) (+0.8), micro-setting (bench, jug) alters comfort and openness (+0.5). However, the pavilion does not constrain a choice—Elena could have this conversation elsewhere—so causal pressure is modest (+0.3). Specificity (latticed walls, honeyed light) adds texture (+0.4). Band: solid middle-upper, strong setup and closure linkage but limited tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the final bus departs" is the inciting constraint (paragraph 1 bus rumbles away, stranding Elena; paragraph 17 Theo recalls "after the last harvest train left"). It forces Elena to the pavilion (setup involvement) and mirrors Theo's past, charging the parallel. The night progresses to dawn (paragraph 26 "dawn's first light"), marking the conversation's span. Setup by opening line (+0.7), middle parallel (+0.4), closure marker (dawn) (+0.5), causal pressure (no bus = no other refuge) (+0.8). However, time does not tighten during the conversation—no countdown or clock that alters tactics within the scene (−0.4). The frame is static once established. Band: mid-solid, strong setup and closure but passive internal tracking.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To nurture intersubjective understanding" is named in paragraph 20 ("his motivation clear—to nurture intersubjective understanding") and echoed in the ending summary ("nurture understanding beyond possession"). The desire informs Theo's recounting and Elena's receptiveness (middle involvement), and the ending claims it as achieved. Present by middle (+0.4), closure claim (+0.3). However, the motivation is told as abstract label, never dramatized through a choice where Theo sacrifices another goal to foster understanding (−0.6 label-only, −0.5 no on-page cost). Academic register clashes with scene texture (−0.3). Resolves via summary (−0.4). Band: low-functional, ornamental motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Passionate subtlety" is labeled in the opening ("subtle passion of one who had tamed wild seasons") and closing ("rediscovered in the night's subtle passion") and demonstrated throughout: Theo's restrained fervor, Elena's quiet tears, the understated ending. Tone is coherent across beats (no jarring shifts) and modulates with pressure (intimate at the bench, reflective during backstory, resolute at dawn). Present throughout (+0.8), closure participation (final phrase) (+0.7), modulation under pressure (+0.6). However, the label is stated twice rather than sustained purely through diction and rhythm (−0.4), and the final summary ("passionate subtlety") tells the tone rather than enacting it in image (−0.3). Band: mid-solid, coherent and charged but partially told.</comment>
