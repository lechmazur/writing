<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Harl's motivation (salvaging stories, seeking purpose after loss) is present and drives the final decision to authenticate and create a memorial, but his internal experience relies heavily on label-speak ("longing," "purpose") rather than embodied contradiction. The appraisal ritual ("Composition: 60% cotton...") successfully externalizes his coping mechanism, yet the climactic pivot feels more declared than earned through on-page struggle. The phrase "confidently uncertain" recurs as a tag rather than manifesting in genuinely conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the first paragraph. The piece follows a causal lens: discovery of scrap → appraisal ritual → decision to authenticate and fund memorial. Closure is a Decisive Change (stepping from hiding into action), but the cost—emotional weight lifting, "chapter closed"—is asserted more than shown in a concrete forfeiture or tactical narrowing. The final drive-away sequence extends the ending without deepening the price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The quarry trailer, dust motes, and blast echoes establish atmosphere and recur purposefully. The scrap itself functions as micro-setting, but spatial choreography grows vague in the second half: "descended toward the foreman's rig," "climbed into his truck" lack grounding in prior layout. Sensory detail (grimy windows, scarred Formica, golden dust) is vivid early but becomes generic in the closing sequence. The quarry's physical constraint does not visibly alter Harl's tactics at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find purpose after public failure and Jax's loss) is signaled early. The scrap's discovery provides one tightening moment, but the escalation is internal reflection rather than a live decision under opposing pressure. Harl's choice to authenticate and fund a memorial arrives without a visible tradeoff or foreclosed alternative; the trailer "chapter closed" and weight "lifting" describe relief, not cost. No antagonist or complicating force tests the commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of salvaging meaning from loss emerges through the scrap and appraisal ritual, and "after the applause" recurs to frame the arc. However, the final paragraph strings together abstract declarations ("Facts and heart aligned at last," "forever forward") that state the theme rather than embodying it in a resonant image. The scrap's "weaves intertwining like fate" is on-the-nose symbolism. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into tidy affirmation without lingering ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable, and free indirect style is mostly clean. Diction wobbles between roadie idiom ("wresting meaning from the fabric as if it were a stubborn knot of cable") and elevated metaphor ("Valley longing softened to horizon pull"). The appraisal ritual passages are strong and voice-specific, but the closing sequence lapses into generic inspirational cadence ("The road unspooled, infinite as memory"). Perceptual signature is strongest in the technical notation, weaker in the abstract emotional summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops: "confidently uncertain" appears four times; "wresting" recurs mechanically; "echoes" proliferates without fresh meaning. Template cadence dominates the final third: "He'd wrested... He climbed... Echoes faded... Harl drove... Valley longing softened... Tomorrow, he'd appraise... Facts and heart aligned... The road unspooled... Harl pressed..." The fragment-sentence run at the end reads like a checklist rather than purposeful compression. Figurative language in mid-story (silver threads, feedback whine, valley longing) is vivid, but the closing abstractions ("horizon pull," "infinite as memory") muddle clarity. Apply −1.2 for loops and template cadence touching closure, plus −0.3 for scaffold density in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ex-roadie/appraiser hybrid and the quarry-as-emotional-archaeology premise offer a specific angle, but the emotional arc (grief → discovery → purpose) follows a familiar template. The appraisal ritual is the story's freshest element, grounding technical detail in character need. The climax—deciding to authenticate and fund a memorial—resolves predictably without a non-obvious turn. Risk-taking is modest; the piece retreats to affirmation rather than pressing the moral calculus of clinging to the past.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Harl's occupational dual identity (ex-roadie, appraiser) is signaled early and frames his internal conflict. His choice to authenticate the scrap and fund a memorial is the story's pivotal turn, directly shaped by his background. The appraisal ritual in the middle beat uses his expertise to "insulate" and then pivot. Two distinct beats (discovery/appraisal, decision to act) plus closure participation. Causal pressure is moderate; the choice feels inevitable rather than fraught. No visible cost attached to the character trait itself at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The speaker grille cloth scrap appears in the opening box, is handled and examined in the appraisal ritual, and is pocketed in the closing sequence ("scrap safe in his breast pocket"). Three beats. Its properties (weave, threads, carbon-date proxy) are scrutinized on the page, and the duplicate nature drives Harl's realization. The ending invokes it but does not reweight its meaning beyond the mid-story insight. Removing it would break the causal chain, but the closure image does not transform its significance further.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the applause" is invoked in the opening context (band's final gig, Jax's death), recurs in the middle ("after the applause of his past"), and frames the penultimate line ("After the applause, life played on"). It shapes the dominant stake (finding purpose post-loss) and is woven into the thematic closure. Two clear beats plus closure participation. However, it functions more as thematic coloring than as a tactical constraint; Harl's choices are not visibly altered by the "after" condition on the page. Lyric reprise with moderate reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" is named four times as a label: "That was Harl's hallmark," then recurs in the final sequence. It does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The appraisal ritual demonstrates methodical precision, and the climactic decision is declarative rather than hedged. The attribute is told rather than embodied in a tradeoff or hesitation that alters tactics. Ornamental recurrence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears in "wresting meaning," "wrested the cloth free," and "wrested a decision." The middle instance (freeing the cloth from wire scraps) is the most concrete physical action, but it does not create a turn; the cloth was already discovered. The decision to authenticate is framed as "wresting" in metaphor only. The verb is used to color effort rather than to define a pivotal act. Swappable with "pulled," "drew," "decided" without structural loss. No beat where "wrest" mechanics matter to the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method—insulating emotionally with facts—is dramatized in the appraisal ritual: Harl recites composition, weave density, carbon dating as a "mantra" to "buffer the ache." This middle beat is the story's strongest integration of the method, showing how he uses technical language to manage grief. The opening references "appraiser's precision," and the ending declares "Facts had insulated him long enough; emotion fueled the next verse," framing the shift. Two beats plus closure participation. The mechanics shape one key sequence and are named at the transition, but the final action (driving away, planning the memorial) does not demonstrate a new method replacing the old.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer is established early with vivid detail (grimy windows, scarred Formica, thin walls amplifying blasts). It recurs in the middle ("trailer groaned with an echoing blast") and the ending ("trailer door clanging shut," "trailer receded in the mirror"). Three touches. However, the setting does not constrain Harl's choices or supply a resource that alters outcome; he could appraise the scrap anywhere. The blasts provide auditory atmosphere but do not pressure tactics. Functional backdrop, not a crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Three weeks after his public humiliation" anchors the timeframe early and establishes emotional recency. The phrase "after failing publicly" recurs to frame motivation. However, the time pressure does not tighten decisions on the page; Harl's appraisal and choice unfold at a reflective pace without a deadline or clock. The "after" condition is emotional context, not a tactical constraint. Setup and thematic presence, but no middle or closure involvement where time alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The desire to discover purpose after loss is named early ("sought purpose amid the ruins"), dramatized in the appraisal ritual where he "wrested meaning," and resolved in the climactic decision to fund a memorial and "salvag[e] stories from silence." Three beats. The friction between hiding (trailer refuge) and acting (stepping forward) is present but largely reflected upon rather than tested by an external force. The want is visible; the cost of pursuing it (ending isolation, risking another failure) is implied but not shown in a tangible forfeiture. Strong thematic presence, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Echo valley longing" appears in the phrase "valley longing swelling like feedback whine," "valley longing softened to horizon pull," and implicitly in "Echo Valley watched him go." The tone—melancholy nostalgia for lost glory—is coherent through the first two-thirds and modulates to tentative resolve at the end. However, "longing" is named rather than embodied in perception and rhythm; the closing sequence shifts to generic uplift ("Jax would approve. Facts and heart aligned at last") that undercuts the established mood. Setup, middle coloring, and closure mention, but the final image does not charge the tone with cost.</comment>
