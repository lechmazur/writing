<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias remains a label-only summoner; his interior world consists of abstract declarations ("tranquil blaze…a calm fire kindling within his chest") rather than embodied contradiction. The piece asserts motivation—"to hush this prophecy"—but never dramatizes competing impulses or a hierarchy of values under pressure. No micro-choices reveal character; the ritual unfolds as choreographed exposition with no friction, mistake, or visible cost that forecloses a path. The ending dissolves into summarized triumph without dramatizing the toll or endurance required.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who and where by the second paragraph, satisfying the Orientation Test. However, causality is purely mechanical: Elias decides to perform the ritual, performs it, and succeeds without complication, reversal, or cost. The closure unit—"prophecy forever silenced"—is asserted rather than shown; no on-page moment demonstrates a decisive change, reconfigured options, or felt price. The inferred lens is Causal, but because/therefore linkage is absent; events proceed as outline steps. Apply −0.8 for closure absence and −0.4 for outline-sequencing that lacks pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven and brook are described vividly ("moonlight wove silver threads," "velvet glide") and recur throughout, but remain postcard scenery. The setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; the brook's response is ornamental, not causal. Spatial choreography is clear, sensory detail is purposeful, and the micro-setting (mossy stone, damp earth) is present. The setting does not reach the 9+ gate because it does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—silencing the prophecy—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Elias initiates the ritual and it succeeds without complication or trade-off. The piece asserts escalation ("Flow accelerated, silence surging") but dramatizes none; no on-page moment narrows options or imposes a visible price. Coincidence does not resolve because no obstacle appears. The inferred lens is Causal, yet no because/therefore linkage shapes the ritual's outcome.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme—balance between chaos and peace, earthly and cosmic—is stated repeatedly ("terrestrially cosmic," "tranquil blaze") rather than emergent from events. The ending summarizes thematic victory ("prophecy forever silenced") without offering a resonant, non-literal answer; the final image is a declaration, not a reconfiguration. "Smoothed hush" and "flow" are mentioned as concepts but never charged with subtext or ambiguity. No counter-reading is invited; the resolution is tidy and affirming.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distance is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("terrestrially cosmic," "smoothed hush," "velvet glide") that reads ornamental rather than character-specific. Perceptual signature is generic; no micro-filter reveals how this summoner notices differently under stress. Sentence stems recur ("The…," "Elias…," "He…") without purposeful variation. No dialogue is present. The voice lacks a distinct texture that would survive a name swap.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "whispered secrets" appears three times, "tranquil blaze" five times, "smoothed hush" twice, "terrestrially cosmic" twice—all without reweighted meaning. Template cadence runs: "The brook responded…," "The prophecy's code stirred…," "The crane's origami wing trembled…" in succession. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "silver threads," "forgotten stars," "liquid starlight," "phosphorescent ripples" cluster in non-peak beats, diluting clarity. Apply −1.0 for loops and template stems, −0.4 for figurative muddle, totaling −1.4. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("luminous motes," "smoothed veil"), triggering the −1.7 cap and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—summoner performing a ritual to silence a prophecy—is a stock fantasy template without transformation. Particulars (origami crane, mapping silence, brook as conduit) are present but ornamental; swap them for candle and chalk circle and the arc remains unchanged. No fresh inflection: the ritual succeeds as planned, no irony or cost complicates the victory. Diction ("tranquil blaze," "terrestrially cosmic") reads as quirky ornament rather than organic synthesis. The piece hedges toward abstraction and avoids bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elias is named and on the page throughout. He decides to perform the ritual (setup), executes steps mid-story (development), and the final paragraph asserts his departure (payoff). However, his choices are declarative rather than turn-creating; no on-page decision narrows options or alters tactics. The ritual unfolds as scripted exposition. He is present in all three gates but causal pressure is absent. Apply: setup +0.3, three beats +1.4, but subtract ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.6, and late-breaking summary at closure −0.6. Band ~2.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The origami wing appears in paragraph two (setup), is traced on earth and pressed into soil mid-story (development), and dissolves into motes in the final third (payoff). It is handled across three beats (+1.4) and its geometry dictates ritual steps, providing modest causal pressure (+0.6). However, its dissolution resolves a problem it did not help create (the prophecy was external), capping the score at 3.0. The wing's unique properties (indigo dye, folds) are mentioned but do not impose a visible trade-off. Closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.4, minus cap. Band ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Smoothed hush" is named in paragraph seven as the goal concept (late first appearance, −0.4). It recurs as a thematic label ("smoothed into contours," "layers of smoothed hush," "smoothed veil") but never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The concept is told, not dramatized; Elias does not face a trade-off between smoothing and another method. Ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.6 (could be "perfect stillness" with minor edits). Band ~2.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" appears in paragraph ten as a descriptor of the prophecy's scope and recurs in paragraph twenty-four as a sensed vibration. It is mentioned but does not enable or constrain an action; no on-page moment shows Elias choosing one tactic over another because of this attribute. Label-only trait −0.3, ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.6 (could be "earthly and celestial" with no plot change). Band ~2.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Flow" is introduced in paragraph twelve as the method's result and enacted in paragraphs twenty-six through twenty-eight. It appears in the closure third (late −0.2) and drives the ritual's climax (+0.9 for two beats). However, it is easily swappable: "release silence" or "channel stillness" would serve identically with minor edits (−0.7). The flow does not impose a visible cost or create friction. Band ~3.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"By mapping silence" is named in paragraph thirteen (setup) and dramatized in paragraphs fifteen through seventeen and twenty-four (development). Elias traces rings and presses the wing, using geometry to channel silence—two distinct beats (+0.9) with modest causal pressure (+0.6). The method shapes attempts but does not impose a trade-off or visible cost. Swappability −0.6 (could be "drawing wards" or "inscribing runes"). Band ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven and brook are anchored in the opening (setup +0.5) and recur throughout (three beats +1.4). The brook "responds" by slowing and glowing, participating in the ritual's development and closure (+1.2 closure linkage). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource Elias must work around; it is a passive stage. Ornamental use −0.6, swappability −0.5 (any quiet natural site would serve). Band ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" appears as an atmospheric phrase in paragraphs two and eighteen but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. No clock or deadline pressures Elias; the ritual proceeds at a pace set by narration, not urgency. The phrase is ornamental. Ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.7 ("under starlight" or "in night's embrace" would serve identically). Band ~1.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation—to hush the prophecy—is declared in paragraph seven (setup +0.4) and drives the ritual sequence (two beats +0.9). Elias's desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices; no on-page moment shows friction between this want and a competing cost. The prophecy is an external threat with no internal hook (e.g., personal loss, moral doubt). Summary-only use −0.6, no cost connection −0.4. Band ~4.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is introduced in paragraph four (setup +0.5) and recurs five times, including in the final paragraph (closure linkage +0.9). Tone is asserted ("calm fire," "serene luminosity," "tranquil peace") but does not modulate with pressure; the mood remains static across the ritual's climax. The phrase charges the final image nominally but without dramatized cost. Ornamental use −0.6, synonym churn −0.3. Band ~3.4.</comment>
