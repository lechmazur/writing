<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is given clear motivation and competence (map-folding, walk-reading), but his interior life remains surface-level—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The peak choice (aligning the zodiac wheel) feels more puzzle-solving than earned character transformation with visible cost. Harlan is a one-note foil whose defeat doesn't weigh on Elias or alter his stance. The ending gesture ("coin warm in his fist") asserts legend without dramatizing what path was foreclosed or what internal price was paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive quickly (maintenance worker, container labyrinth, storm). The causal lens holds: Elias uses whispers because low frequencies survive geomagnetic interference, he mimics Harlan's walk to predict turns, and the zodiac-coin pattern unlocks the door. However, the closure itself—claiming the coin and refolding the map—lacks on-page cost; Harlan's surrender is told ("pride shattered") rather than shown as a decisive change that forecloses a path for Elias. The final paragraph's abstract victory ("legend echoed softly, eternally") replaces concrete consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly rendered with storm-induced static, groaning steel, and auroral smear. Spatial choreography remains coherent across Elias's climb, whisper-navigation, and arrival at the Heart. The geomagnetic storm constrains tactics (compasses spin, electronics fail, sound warps) and charges the whisper-versus-shout test. The zodiac wheel and storm-induced magnetic resonance offer micro-setting that shapes the unlock method, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment constrains choice or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving whispers outlast shouts—is signaled early and tested on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when Harlan's shouts scatter while Elias's whispers arrive intact, narrowing the race. Yet the escalation is largely environmental (storm effects) rather than protagonist-driven trade-offs; Elias encounters no credible loss or tactical cost. The unlock at the Heart feels like applying prior knowledge rather than a high-stakes choice with visible price. Harlan's forfeit is recounted, not dramatized as a felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The whisper-versus-shout motif emerges concretely through the storm's physics and Elias's tactical choices, avoiding overt moralizing until the final lines. The theme of subtlety conquering chaos is embodied in the map-folding and low-frequency navigation. However, the ending tips into thematic echo ("whispers had won, as they always would") and label-speak ("calculated spontaneity"), replacing scene pressure with summary. The coin and map reprise charge the final image but don't reweight prior material with ambiguity or complexity; the resolution is tidy rather than resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady with Elias as focalizer; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (identifies walks, notices storm effects on sound) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("geomagnetic frenzy," "calculated spontaneity") that sits uneasily with a maintenance worker's interior voice. Dialogue from Harlan ("Bet this Aries-tailed relic on a challenge") feels stage-managed rather than natural. The final paragraph's meta-commentary ("his legend echoed softly, eternally") breaks the established close distance, summarizing triumph rather than trusting the dramatization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally strong, but overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "containers looming like titans," "words slithered along the container walls," "pride shattered" stack figurative language without pattern-teaching. Paraphrase loops appear ("whispers of victory humming farther than any roar" echoes the premise without adding pressure). Template cadence runs in the opening ("Lightning flickered... compasses... spinning... auroras smeared") and the ending sequence. The final third summarizes rather than dramatizes, diluting propulsion. Apply −0.6 for density overload and −0.4 for loops, total −1.0 in Q7; artifacts touch closure, so disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of geomagnetic-storm physics, whisper propagation, and labyrinth navigation is specific and non-obvious, elevating the premise beyond "maze race." The zodiac-coin unlock and walk-identification add fresh inflections. However, the emotional arc (underdog craftsman defeats arrogant rival) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or moral calculus. The ending's "legend" framing and the protagonist's flawless execution reduce risk and complexity. The core feels more clever than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's role as maintenance worker seeds his map expertise and labyrinth knowledge early, enabling his whisper-navigation tactic and the walk-mimicry move. His choices drive two key beats (whisper-versus-shout test, zodiac unlock). The occupation supplies tactical resources but isn't stressed under pressure; no on-page moment where his maintenance skills force a trade-off or reveal a cost. Present in closure (refolding map, claiming coin) but more as backdrop than causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The zodiac coin appears in three beats: Harlan's opening taunt, the unlock (Aries-to-Scorpio alignment), and Elias's final claim. The coin's pattern unlocks the Heart's seal, constraining the method. However, the coin's arrival is late (after setup) and its thematic weight ("Aries-tailed relic," final glow) is told rather than dramatized with cost. Swappable with any puzzle-key token; the zodiac specificity doesn't alter Elias's internal stakes or tactics beyond the mechanical unlock.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Folded maps are signaled early as Elias's secret, used mid-stride to guide gait and predict turns, and refolded in the final image to embody mastery. The concept shapes tactics (origami folds reveal shortcuts) and charges the closure unit. The map constrains Elias's navigation method and differentiates him from Harlan. However, the "prophecy" framing is more metaphorical than causal; the map doesn't impose a visible cost or force a trade-off on the page. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage lift it into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Walk-identification is seeded early ("identifies people's walks like signatures") and used once to recognize Harlan's approach and predict turns via mimicry. Label-only mention in the ending ("his stride unique, identifiable only to masters") asserts mastery without demonstrating cost. The trait enables one tactical beat but is swappable with any pattern-recognition skill. No visible trade-off or constraint; ornamental rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The challenge crystallizes the core conflict (whisper vs. shout, race to the Heart, forfeit maps and coin) and drives all subsequent beats. The action redefines options, forcing Elias to abandon electronics and rely on paper and low-frequency sound. Harlan's participation tests the premise under storm conditions. The challenge is present in closure (coin claimed, Harlan's maps surrendered). Not easily swappable; removing it collapses the plot. Strong causal pressure and beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The serpentine-groove key is introduced mid-story, examined ("no teeth for any lock Elias knew"), and used at the Heart to align the zodiac wheel via magnetic resonance. The method shapes one key beat (the unlock) and is conceptually tied to the storm. However, its mechanics are explained rather than discovered through failed attempts, and the late arrival (after the 40% mark) limits integration. Functional in one pivotal turn but swappable with any conceptual-lock device; no middle development or tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The container labyrinth pressures every beat: groaning steel channels whispers, dead ends trap Harlan, vertical climbs test stamina, and the Heart's static-pulse encodes the unlock. The setting supplies resources (steel walls, crane marks, scorpion bend) that alter tactics and is present in the closure image (Elias climbs out, containers receding). Spatial choreography remains clear across multiple moves. The setting is indispensable; removing the labyrinth collapses both navigation logic and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The geomagnetic storm is signaled in the opening line, scrambles electronics throughout, warps Harlan's shouts, preserves Elias's whispers, and reveals the zodiac-unlock method via magnetic resonance. The storm tightens every decision and alters tactics on the page. However, the "storm peaked" in the final third is told rather than tracked; no live clock counts down minutes or raises cost. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, but the timeframe remains atmospheric rather than a visible constraint that forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias's desire to prove whispers outlast shouts is stated early and tested on the page through the challenge. His whispered taunts and navigation demonstrate the motive in action. However, the "deeper motive" is asserted ("burned with a deeper motive") without dramatization; no friction between the stated goal and a competing want or cost. The motive shapes tactics but doesn't evolve or face internal conflict. Present in closure ("whispers had won") but summarized rather than reweighted with ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tone label "calculated spontaneity" appears as meta-commentary in the ending ("pondered the night's calculated leap—spontaneous proof") rather than emerging from rhythm and diction. Early beats (map-unfolding, walk-mimicry) do blend preparation with improvisation, modulating tone with pressure. However, the final third shifts into static legend-building ("his legend echoed softly, eternally") that flattens rather than charges the closure image. Tone coherence is present but not integral; the ending's declarative mood contradicts the improvisational charge.</comment>
