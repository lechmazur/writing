<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her internal conflict—mother in 1,203 versus the discarded—generates genuine pressure. The scene dramatizes contradictory impulses ("loved this silence...now it felt like complicity") and her final choice costs her security with eyes open. Minor slip: Vance's sudden appearance and his knowledge that "he knew" edges toward convenient positioning, though it does not break the choice's earned quality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Mira uploads the letter, a Decisive Change with immediate cost (Vance's grip, threats of imprisonment). The causal lens holds—letter discovered → network repair → confrontation → upload—with one meaningful tightening when Vance arrives. Orientation anchors quickly (archivist, Archive, snow, silence). The piece sits comfortably in Track A defaults with a single continuous scene and coherent escalation to an on-page act that forecloses return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Archive's cold, the snow muffling sound, and the dormant terminal all constrain and enable Mira's choice; she has spent six months repairing infrastructure, a detail that makes the upload tactically credible. Spatial choreography is clean (Vance in doorway, Mira at terminal). The "dizzying quiet" charges the ending when "the silence had finally broken," linking setting to stakes. Selective sensory detail (breath visible, snow on skylights) supports pressure without touring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to broadcast the letter—is signaled early and tightens when Vance appears, narrowing options to "within the blink that follows surprise." The upload is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost (grip, threats, unknown consequences). One clear reversal: Mira's finger hovers → Vance enters → she acts anyway, escalating from hesitation to irreversible commitment. The price (exile, retaliation against her mother) is legible and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—who decides which lives deserve preservation, silence as complicity—emerges through the letter's names and Mira's lived tension, not assertion. The ending offers a resonant answer: "I've started a conversation" reweights the opening's "silence...found peace" without moralizing. Subtext operates in "the silence was not peace. It was permission" and the final "she felt awake," both grounded in prior choice. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the screens lighting up provides image, not thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; Mira's perceptual signature filters the Archive through curatorial care ("cataloging the dead-but-dreaming") and moral pressure. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven: Vance's "Working late" and Mira's "I understand that silence is a choice" carry subtext and advance plot. Diction remains consistent (no register drift). Minor penalty: "bravely conflicted in a way that made her chest ache" edges toward label-speak where embodied contradiction would sharpen, though it does not collapse voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high ("three thousand frozen consciousnesses," "bribes...dissidents...thawed and discarded"). No paraphrase loops. Minor issues: "dangerous liaison letter" repeated verbatim; "dizzying quiet that pressed against her eardrums" mixes metaphor slightly (quiet pressing is tactile, eardrums auditory). "The echoing library stretched around her" front-loads description mid-crisis where tighter syntax would propel. Clarity remains intact and no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cryogenic-archivist protagonist and contraband-truths premise offer a non-obvious synthesis. Mira's choice to repair networks over six months and her mother's preservation (Chamber 1,203) add specificity that resists template plots. The letter as physical object and Vance's in-person arrival raise stakes concretely. Moderate penalty: the brave-whistleblower-versus-surveillance frame is familiar; transformation through the Archive's silence motif and the "dead-but-dreaming" particular lifts it but does not fully escape known territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's role as cryogenic archivist drives every key turn: her access enables six months of network repair, her care for the frozen generates the mother-versus-discarded conflict, and her curatorial knowledge (chamber numbers, equipment logs) makes the letter's evidence credible. The occupation is indispensable to escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The letter appears early (slips from manual), is read seven times with named details (dates, chamber 2,847, predecessor), burns in Mira's pocket during the hover moment, and she uploads it as the climactic act. Vance's authorship charges the confrontation. The object's specificity (handwriting, yellowed paper, contraband truths) and its reweighted meaning at closure (from hidden evidence to broadcast scandal) earn high integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Contraband truths shape the dominant stake: the letter's dangerous content (bribes, discarded dissidents) creates the upload-or-silence choice. The concept alters tactics (Mira's six-month covert repair) and charges the ending ("screens lighting up with contraband truths"). It is present in setup, middle choice, and closure. Minor cap: while integral, the concept could be replaced with "forbidden evidence" or "suppressed records" without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Bravely conflicted" is labeled once ("bravely conflicted in a way that made her chest ache") and dramatized when Mira's finger hovers while she weighs her mother's safety against the discarded. The trait enables the hesitation and the final upload despite fear, with visible cost (Vance's grip, threats). Present in setup (trembling hands) and payoff (acts despite consequences), but middle development is thin; the conflict is more told than shown through micro-choices mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Scandalize" drives the climax: uploading the letter to "every connected library, university, and news outlet" is the irreversible act that Vance lunges to stop and that fulfills Mira's goal to "provoke the unspoken conversation." The action is specific (not merely "expose"), redefines all options (Vance's grip, her wakefulness), and the final paragraph confirms the scandal spreading. Removing this exact verb would require rewriting the entire closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dormant networks are signaled early (offline three years, six months of quiet repair) and their mechanics matter: the activation key, blinking green indicators, fragmentation across channels. Mira's prior work makes the upload tactically credible. The method constrains her choice (requires physical terminal access) and shapes Vance's arrival timing. The networks hum to life as closure unfolds, charging the final image of screens across territories.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Archive's cold keeps consciousnesses viable (micro-setting constraint), the snow muffles sound and accumulates pressure ("dizzying quiet"), and the terminal's offline status creates the repair-then-upload tactic. The "great windows" and "skylights" frame Mira's isolation. The setting returns with reweighted meaning: "inside the Archive, the silence had finally broken." The library's scale ("three thousand...shelves rising like monuments") charges the stakes and the ending image of humming networks.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is named explicitly ("within the blink that follows surprise, before he could act") and tightens the decision: Vance's entrance collapses hesitation into immediate choice. The compressed window makes Mira's upload feel urgent and irreversible. Present in the climax and shaping her tactics (no time for negotiation), but the frame is declared more than tracked; the "blink" functions as metaphor rather than a live clock measuring lines.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira's desire to "provoke the unspoken conversation" is dramatized early ("questions about who decided which lives deserved eternity") and conflicts with her mother's safety in 1,203. The motivation drives her six-month network repair and the final upload despite Vance's threats. Friction between want (truth) and cost (retaliation, exile) is visible on the page. The ending confirms the provocation succeeded ("journalists were reading...families...learning"), linking motive to outcome.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Dizzying quiet" appears early ("dizzying quiet that pressed against her eardrums"), modulates under pressure ("silence...felt like complicity"), and charges the ending: "the silence had finally broken." The tone coheres through snow, cold, and the Archive's hush, then shifts when networks hum to life. The final image ("she felt awake") contrasts the opening's peace-in-silence, reweighting the tone with conceptual cost. Present across setup, escalation, and closure with purposeful evolution.</comment>
