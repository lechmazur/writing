<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Martha's interiority shows good specificity in embodied memory work ("carried history in her pockets"), and her renunciation of the heroic-father narrative carries cost. However, the pivotal realization—"He left"—arrives via discovered photographs rather than internal contradiction acting in scene, which flattens agency at the turn. The final choice to share the truth is motivated but lands as summary rather than pressured micro-decision. Emotional embodiment is strong in places ("mirrored hush of the valley held her") but dips into label-speak at the climax ("precisely humane in her willingness").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly (Martha, ridgeway, October evening, reservoir town). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: photographs accumulate to reweight Martha's narrative about her father, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid) when she decides to tell the true story. The closure lands on the page with felt cost ("let the past be complicated"), and the lens holds. However, the photographs function more as revelatory props than as a causal chain that narrows options—she discovers rather than chooses her way through the sequence—which slightly blunts escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ridgeway at twilight, exposed reservoir streets, and dripping ruins supply vivid, purpose-driven detail filtered through Martha's professional and personal attention. The wind chime's silence frames the opening, and the emerging town constrains her movement through ghost streets, charging the final descent. Sensory hierarchy (sight, sound, tactile drip) supports urgency. The micro-setting (boulder, ticket window, photographs spread) participates in the closure tableau, meeting the 9+ gate condition, but does not force a harder choice—she sits, reflects, then descends—so the score stays in the strong 7-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Martha confronting her father's abandonment vs. the protective lie) is clear. The photograph trail supplies one meaningful deepening: each image tightens the noose of evidence until the Chicago platform shot forecloses her prior narrative. However, this deepening is discovery-driven rather than protagonist-driven; Martha follows clues rather than making choices that narrow her options. The closure decision—to share the true story—carries visible cost (community upheaval, personal grief), but it arrives after the turn rather than precipitating it. No major reversal tests commitment; the escalation is textural accumulation rather than pressured agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (the boundary between hidden and revealed, the cost of honest memory) emerges organically from Martha's warden role and the resurfacing town. The piece resists moralizing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("let Clearwater rise again as it truly was") without thesis statement. Backstory interleaves purposefully with present perception. However, "precisely humane" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic echo, declaring the quality the text has been dramatizing. The wind chime motif bookends effectively, and subtext operates well in silence and drip, but the final gesture leans slightly expository rather than purely image-driven.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable; perceptual signature (levee warden's attention to water levels, structural details) is distinct and consistent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and wider valley vista. However, several lines slip into elevated register incongruent with a warden's lexicon: "liminal hour," "violet grip," "ancient earth," "mirrored hush" (repeated). The phrase "precisely humane" at closure reads as authorial intrusion rather than Martha's internal idiom. Voice is strong overall but shows seams under peak emotional pressure where diction should tighten to character texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong concrete images (copper tubes, cobblestone streets, sapphire-hued label). However, multiple figurative phrases cluster without pattern payoff: "bones from ancient earth," "violet grip," "mirrored hush" (used twice), "spin all these fragmented images into shared meaning." The phrase "precisely humane" recurs as a thematic flag rather than organic narration. Two adjacent paragraphs beginning "The" create minor template cadence. Stock metaphor "breath before the first word" in the penultimate paragraph dulls momentum. Overwriting in high-pressure beats (the revelation moment) applies −0.5; recurring elevated diction adds −0.3; total deduction ~−0.8 from a baseline ~7.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise (reservoir town resurfacing, protagonist forced to confront a rewritten past) is well-executed but familiar in structure: discovery-driven revelation leading to acceptance and truth-telling. The levee warden angle and photograph trail offer specific texture, and the sapphire liqueur label is a nice particular. However, the emotional arc (protective lie → discovered truth → sharing complexity) follows a conventional template without a non-obvious turn. The ending's "precisely humane" framing and wind-chime silence bookend feel competent rather than startling. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece executes its premise cleanly but does not transform it into something unexpected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Martha's role as levee warden frames her vigilance and metaphorical boundary-keeping but does not drive key turns through levee-specific decisions. She walks the ridge, discovers photographs, and decides to share them—actions any resident could perform. The warden identity enriches setting detail (water levels, station) and thematic resonance (guardian of hidden/revealed) but remains more metaphorical than causal. Present in setup and thematically at closure, but middle development lacks warden-specific choices that alter tactics. Two-gate participation with strong thematic linkage, but no distinct causal pressure tied to the role itself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sapphire liqueur label appears twice: discovered in the tavern (triggers memory of father's promise) and carried in her pocket to the ridge, where it completes the photograph trail. It ties directly to the father's abandonment (the night he promised to return) and charges the climax with personal, lived detail. However, it does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure—it functions as evidentiary artifact rather than active pressure. Present in setup (first third), shapes one beat (discovery), participates in closure tableau (in her pocket), but remains static after initial emotional charge. Three-gate participation with good specificity, but no evolving use or tactical impact.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The resurfacing reservoir town is the engine of the entire narrative: it reveals the photographs, forces Martha's confrontation, and provides the spatial/temporal frame for all action. The town's emergence drives stakes (what will be revealed?), shapes tactics (she follows the trail through exposed buildings), and supplies the dominant metaphor for memory and truth. The concept is present in setup (opening paragraph), governs middle beats (photograph discoveries in church, library, schoolhouse, tavern, station), and charges the closure image ("empty streets… waited in mirrored hush"). Indispensable: remove the resurfacing and the story's logic collapses. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Precisely humane" appears twice: once as narratorial summary of Martha's prior lie ("It was precisely humane, this version") and once in the penultimate paragraph describing her willingness to accept complexity. Neither instance shows the trait constraining or enabling an on-page action with cost—it is asserted as label rather than dramatized through a choice. The concept aligns thematically with her decision to share the true story, but the decision itself is motivated by accumulated evidence, not by this specific attribute shaping a tradeoff. Label-only integration; no visible cost tied to the trait's exercise. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Expunge" appears once, describing Martha's decades-long effort to erase memories. The word frames her prior stance but does not generate a major turn; the photographs (external discovery) drive the reversal, not an on-page action of expunging or its failure. The action is past-completed, referenced in summary rather than dramatized. It sets up the central conflict (buried truth vs. resurfacing evidence) and shapes the thematic stakes, but the pivotal on-page action is "gathering the photographs" and deciding to share them—"expunge" is the backstory condition, not the turning verb. Functional setup, no middle beat involvement, thematic linkage at closure but no causal driver of the climax. One-gate participation (setup via summary).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The photograph trail structures the entire middle: each image leads to the next (grandmother's store → library album → schoolhouse → pharmacy → tavern label → train station platform). The method is signaled early (hiker leaves first photo), governs Martha's tactics (she follows the sequence through ghost streets), and delivers the climactic evidence (Chicago platform photo). However, the trail is discovered rather than constructed by Martha—she is recipient, not agent—which limits causal pressure. The method shapes all major beats and closure (evidence in hand, she decides to share), meeting three gates with strong beat involvement, but the mechanics are passive discovery rather than active problem-solving. Essential across beats, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The midnight ridgeway at twilight anchors the entire frame: Martha walks it at the opening, pauses at the highest point for the central revelation, and descends at closure. The ridgeway supplies spatial vantage (she can see the exposed town below), metaphorical boundary (warden guarding the line between hidden and revealed), and physical staging for her decision tableau (sits on a boulder, spreads photographs). The setting enables observation and reflection but does not constrain her choice—she could make the same decision anywhere with the photographs. Three-gate participation (setup, middle vantage, closure descent) with strong atmospheric and thematic charge, but no tactical constraint. Micro-setting (boulder, photographs spread) participates in closure but does not alter options.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The wind chime's silence opens the narrative and signals the reservoir's surrender; the piece then moves to "that October evening" and "twilight," but time does not tighten decisions. Martha's walk and discoveries unfold in vague sequence ("first the church steeple, then the rooftops," "for thirty-seven years") without a live clock. The timeframe provides atmospheric framing (endings and beginnings in twilight, silence before new story starts) but does not pressure tactics—Martha could take hours or days to follow the photograph trail. Setup signal (wind chime falls silent), thematic reprise at closure ("silence… the breath before the first word"), but no middle escalation or urgency driven by time. Two-gate lyric integration with thematic charge, but no tactical impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Martha's desire "to spin stories into shared meaning" is declared explicitly near the end ("she would… spin all these fragmented images into shared meaning"). The motivation aligns with her final decision (bring photos to historical society, tell the true story) and her prior role as narrative guardian (constructing the heroic-father version). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—she decides to share after the truth is revealed, not through a pressured tradeoff between competing narrative goals. The motivation frames closure thematically but does not generate visible friction or cost in the decision itself; the cost is social (community upheaval) rather than internal struggle over narrative control. Setup (implicit in warden role), thematic closure linkage, but no middle beat where narrative desire conflicts with another want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" appears three times: describing the valley's silence after revelation, as a repeated phrase, and in the final line. The tone is coherent and atmospheric throughout (quiet, reflective, elegiac), modulates subtly with emotional pressure (soft laugh, spoken aloud, tears), and charges the final image ("empty streets… waited in mirrored hush, patient as memory"). However, the tone remains largely static—contemplative throughout—without a sharp cadence shift at the turn. The repetition of "mirrored hush" risks becoming a verbal tic rather than purposeful pattern. Strong thematic integration and closure charge, but single-register mood limits dynamic range. Three-gate participation with closure linkage, moderate modulation under pressure.</comment>
