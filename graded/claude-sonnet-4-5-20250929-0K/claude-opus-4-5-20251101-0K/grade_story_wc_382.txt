<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The narrator's interiority is specific and embodied ("the building told me you were ready"), with clear motivation progression from curiosity to teaching role. The arc from student to teacher is earned through concrete micro-choices (accepting the seal, learning the building's language). Minor deduction: Professor Voss's motivations remain somewhat abstract—her need to pass on knowledge is told more than shown through contradictory impulses. The final choice to teach carries visible cost (solitude, waiting, inhabiting the liminal role).</comment>

<comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational undertones. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the narrator inhabits the teacher role with the same opening line, reweighting the sugar motif and cycle. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two (rooftop, narrator below Professor Voss). Cost is legible: the narrator trades active life for custodial waiting, tending a garden and stockpiling sugar for uncertain arrivals. One meaningful deepening occurs as the narrator learns to read buildings, culminating in accepting the teaching mantle.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The rooftop garden and building itself function as active setting, constraining choices (the narrator must learn to "read" architecture) and charging the closure (tending roses, waiting for students). Sensory details are purposeful: "silver hair catching starlight," "brass surface warm despite autumn chill," "old bones settling." Spatial choreography is clean across the fire escape, rooftop, and implied apartment positions. The desk seal operates as micro-setting object that enables the teaching transfer.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake (learning the dead language of buildings) is signaled early and tightens through monthly progression. The narrator's agency drives escalation: seeking sugar → attending tea → learning building language → accepting the seal → becoming teacher. One meaningful turn: Professor Voss fading forces the narrator into the custodial role with visible cost (isolation, perpetual waiting). The price is legible but could be sharper—we see the narrator stockpiling sugar and waiting, but the emotional or opportunity cost of this solitary vigil remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme (preservation of dying knowledge through chosen succession) emerges organically from the sugar-tea-teaching cycle without stated morals. The desk seal and sugar motif recur with shifted meaning, and the final parallel ("You're here about the sugar") reweights the opening. The "agreed upon lies" concept integrates smoothly as both characters maintain the fiction of normalcy. Subtext operates in gesture and silence: "some questions honor the agreed upon lies we need to survive." The ending offers a resonant answer—language survives through careful selection of speakers—without preaching.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: elevated but not overwrought ("like heirlooms, like secrets, like the borrowed sweetness"), with consistent metaphoric texture tied to architecture and archaeology. POV distance is stable; the retrospective first-person allows reflection without breaking present-scene pressure. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext ("Everyone starts with sugar"). Professor Voss's speech has a slightly more formal cadence than the narrator's internal voice, maintaining distinction. Minor slip: "mysterious familiarity she wore like a second face" edges toward precious phrasing in an otherwise grounded passage.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer contemplative sentences balanced by short declaratives ("The building hummed its goodbye"). Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or the teaching relationship. Two minor artifacts: "She had been a tutor of dead languages in life, Sanskrit and Sumerian and tongues that had crumbled" reads slightly list-like, and "like heirlooms, like secrets, like the borrowed sweetness" triple-stacks similes at closure. Otherwise no loops or scaffolding; clarity and momentum remain strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The ghost-as-teacher frame is familiar, but the story transforms it through specificity: buildings as sentient texts, the desk seal as certification, sugar as initiatory currency. The cyclical structure (student becomes teacher, repeating the opening line) feels earned rather than clever. The meteor showers and rooftop garden anchor the premise in concrete detail. Risk: the piece commits fully to its metaphysical premise without hedging or explaining. Minor limitation: the emotional arc follows a recognizable mentorship-succession template, elevated by execution but not fundamentally reimagined.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Professor Voss appears early, teaches across multiple tea sessions (setup, development), and her fading creates the key turn that forces the narrator into the teaching role (payoff). Her decisions—choosing the narrator, giving the seal, timing her departure with the meteor shower—drive the arc. Specific cost: she must fade to complete the transfer. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The desk seal appears twice: first as paperweight while Professor Voss explains ("fingers tracing its worn inscription"), then pressed into the narrator's hand as "certificate of enrollment." It's present in the final paragraph implicitly (the narrator now teaches, holding the seal's authority). Setup and payoff clear; middle development is weaker—it's described more than used. It enables the teaching transfer but could constrain or shape a choice more actively between the two appearances.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>"Agreed upon lies" shapes stakes and tactics on every page: the narrator and Professor Voss maintain the fiction that she's alive, that tea is ordinary, that their time isn't borrowed. It constrains choices (the narrator doesn't interrogate Voss's nature) and charges the closure (the new student accepts the same lie). The concept isn't just thematic—it's the operational framework that allows the teaching to occur. Cost: perpetuating the lie requires the narrator to inhabit a liminal, solitary existence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>"Patiently nimble" modifies Professor Voss's hands once ("her hands moved with patient nimbleness across an antique desk seal"). It's embodied in that moment but doesn't constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. The trait fits her character (ancient, careful, precise) but remains largely descriptive. Setup is present; development and payoff are absent. It could be replaced with another descriptive phrase without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>"Interrogate" appears twice: the narrator is taught "to interrogate the building's secrets with gentleness," and later wants to "interrogate her about what comes next" but refrains. The first use shapes the learning method; the second refrains from using it on Voss, honoring the agreed lies. Setup and development present; moderate causal role. Not indispensable—"question," "examine," or "read" could substitute with minor tonal shifts, but the forensic connotation (archaeology, dead languages) adds thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The sugar-to-tea progression is the story's spine. Sugar opens both teaching relationships (narrator knocking, young architect arriving), tea sessions become the teaching venue ("our second tea session," "final tea session"), and the narrator now stocks sugar "in quantities no reasonable person needs" to perpetuate the cycle. Setup, development, and payoff all present with strong causal pressure. The method shapes every encounter and charges the closure. Removing it would collapse the story's logic and ritual structure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The rooftop garden is the primary teaching venue and meteor showers mark temporal beats: September opening, October ritual established, rare January shower signals the final session. The garden constrains access (fire escape climb), provides the roses that "somehow bloom despite the frost" as proof of supernatural persistence, and must be tended by the narrator at closure. Setup, development, and payoff all strong. The meteors "measuring out borrowed time" directly tie setting to stakes. High specificity and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The desire to learn building language is dramatized through weekly sessions, monthly progression markers, and specific learned skills (reading cracks, interpreting pipes). It drives every choice: climbing the fire escape, attending tea, accepting the seal, ultimately taking the teaching role. Friction emerges between learning and the cost of accepting succession (solitude, waiting). The motivation shapes setup, development, and payoff, with visible cost in the narrator's new isolated existence. Strong causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is embodied consistently: Professor Voss knows the narrator is coming, the building "told" her, the narrator accepts impossibilities without questioning. The tone modulates subtly—warmer during teaching, elegiac at parting, then repeats with the new student. It charges the final image by allowing the cycle to feel both uncanny and inevitable. The tone is coherent through all turns and integral to making the supernatural premise work without explanation. Present across all three gates with moderate pressure contribution.</comment>
