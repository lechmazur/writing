<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Margaret's motivation is clear and her interior work is strong—the contradiction setup ("assume the opposite") and the discovery of her father's calculations build genuine pressure. The embodied moments with the rosewood nib and her final decision show character-specific texture. However, the father remains a ghost; no second on-page character applies immediate pressure, so relationship dynamics and status work are absent. The final choice feels earned but slightly undercooked—seventeen thousand kilometers removes urgency from the withholding decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative coloring. Orientation is clean by ~80 words. The journalist's call incites investigation; Margaret's proof-by-contradiction method structures her inquiry; discovery of the near-miss asteroid tightens stakes; and her final decision to suppress the truth (with the caveat that the miss was safe) closes with visible cost—she inherits her father's guilt and isolation. The causal chain holds, and closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (she becomes him). One meaningful tightening suffices at this length. A micro-penalty for the convenience that the asteroid will miss by exactly enough to make her choice less agonizing—removes some teeth from the stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory is vivid and purposeful: "copper dome tarnished green," "acoustics returned her words in ghostly echo," the view through clouds. The rosewood nib functions as micro-setting, handled twice and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting constrains Margaret's isolation and mirrors her father's solitude, directly supporting theme. The nib's burgundy stain recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, qualifying for the 9+ gate. Minor dock: some description ("star charts covered the walls like wallpaper chosen by a madman") leans decorative without pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: whether to reveal or suppress the asteroid data. The journalist's call initiates pressure, the discovery escalates it, and Margaret's final decision to write "something in between" narrows options. However, the asteroid's safe passage by seventeen thousand kilometers drains urgency—her father carried real weight; Margaret's burden is lighter. Agency is present (she chooses suppression with a story), but the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral. One meaningful tightening occurs; no multiple reversals required at this length. Escalation is present but muted by the lowered stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the father's silence and Margaret's inheritance of that burden: truth versus mercy, isolation as the price of foreknowledge. "Orbits of regret" and "correction fluid for the universe" resonate without over-stating. The rosewood nib's burgundy ink—used for corrections—becomes a charged symbol of suppression. The final image (her writing "something in between") offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The piece resists tidy binaries and earns its quiet wisdom through particulars. No thematic echo or lecture mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly; no head-hopping. POV modesty is strong—Margaret infers her father's motives from evidence, not omniscience. Diction is controlled and consistent: "splinter," "burgundy stains," "circuits" and "veins" for cities. Perceptual signature is clear (she notices calculations, star charts, the nib). One line wobbles into slight elevation: "correction fluid for the universe" reads writerly but stays just within bounds. Psychic distance shifts are intentional. No dialogue present, so those bullets don't apply. Strong rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence openings, purposeful rhythm, high information density. "Star charts covered the walls like wallpaper chosen by a madman" and "cities like circuits, roads like veins" are vivid without overwriting. One paraphrase loop: "What she wanted was understanding—specifically, understanding why" restates within two clauses. Minor filter-verb cluster in the opening third ("had inherited," "had been," "had dismissed") but not at peak beats. No major artifacts touch closure. Clarity and propulsion are solid throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The frame—daughter inheriting father's secret, discovering his suppressed data—is familiar but executed with specificity: the rosewood nib, the burgundy ink, the proof-by-contradiction method, the seventeen-iteration calculation. "Orbits of regret" and the observatory-as-crown image add fresh texture. The twist that the asteroid will miss safely is both clever and deflating—it lowers stakes rather than sharpening them. The emotional core (inheriting isolation) resonates. Not derivative, but the premise doesn't fully transform its template into something irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Margaret ("newsprint heiress") is the protagonist; her discovery and final decision to write "something in between" drive the key turns. She appears early, makes active choices in the middle (tracing the calculations), and her stance at closure determines the story's resolution. The heiress detail matters: the newspaper empire is the "mechanism of control" her father used to suppress news. Her inherited power enables her final choice. Causal pressure is clear, and the element shapes at least two beats (inheritance established, newspaper control revealed, final suppression decision).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rosewood pen nib is introduced early ("resting in an antique inkwell"), handled physically ("She picked it up, turning it"), and its burgundy stain is noted and reweighted. It recurs in the middle ("corrections") and at closure ("With the rosewood nib, she began to write"). The nib's history (editorials repurposed for astronomical corrections) and color (burgundy = corrections/suppression) charge the final image. It appears in three distinct beats and its specificity matters—"correction fluid for the universe." Closure linkage is strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Orbits of regret" is seeded early as a phrase and enacted through the father's repeated calculations ("repeated seventeen times") and Margaret's realization that he "charted not just asteroids but the orbits of his own guilt, circling back again and again." The concept shapes her understanding of his choices and informs her final decision to keep "some orbits…invisible." It reweights the story's stakes (personal guilt vs. cosmic mechanics) and appears in the closure paragraph. Not causal in a narrow sense, but it deepens thematic resonance and constrains her final choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Devotedly observant" is signaled in the line "devotedly observant of every detail he had left behind" and enacted through Margaret's methodical examination of star charts, notebooks, and the nib. It enables her discovery (she notices the burgundy ink, traces the calculations seventeen times) and shapes her tactical approach (proof by contradiction). However, it doesn't create visible cost or friction—observation here is competence without tradeoff. Present in setup and middle, but not charged at closure. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Intervene" is the story's hinge: "The question now was whether to intervene." Margaret's discovery forces this choice explicitly. The journalist's impending callback creates urgency, and her final decision to "intervene" by writing a controlled story (rather than full revelation or full suppression) defines closure. The action is not physical intervention but editorial—consistent with her inheritance. Present in middle deliberation and closure execution. The verb's ambiguity (intervene how?) is resolved on the page. Essential to the final turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Proof by contradiction" is named and explained early: "Assume the opposite of what you want to prove, then follow the logic until it breaks." Margaret applies it (assume her father was dishonest, then trace his work for errors), and the method structures her inquiry. However, it functions as flavor rather than mechanics—she could have investigated without this framing. The method doesn't constrain tactics or create cost; it's present in setup but doesn't shape the ending. Functional but swappable with "systematic investigation."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "echoing observatory above clouds" is vivid and present throughout: copper dome, acoustics that return her words, the observation slit, the view of clouds and cities below. The setting isolates Margaret and mirrors her father's solitude. The echo effect is used purposefully ("the dome whispered back"). The observatory's height and isolation enable her final choice—she can see "millions of lives proceeding in ignorant contentment" and choose to protect them. Setting pressure is subtle but real; it shapes her perspective at closure. Strong setup, middle presence, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"After the journalist called" frames the inciting incident and creates urgency: "The journalist would call again—she was certain of it." The timeframe anchors the present action and tightens the decision window. However, the asteroid's arrival "tomorrow" should escalate pressure but doesn't—Margaret knows it will miss safely, so the clock is more conceptual than tactical. Time is tracked but doesn't constrain her moves in the final beat. Present in setup and middle, mentioned at closure, but not indispensable to the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"To discover hidden truths" is Margaret's explicit motivation from the opening: "What she wanted was understanding—specifically, understanding why he had spent his final years here." The desire drives her investigation, is tested by the discovery (truth vs. mercy), and is reframed at closure—she finds truth but chooses selective revelation. Desire is dramatized through her physical search, complicated by the conflicting pull of protecting people, and resolved with visible cost (she inherits her father's isolation). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the motivation shapes all three acts.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Solemn playfulness" is most visible in "Margaret laughed, the sound carrying a solemn playfulness that surprised her." The tone blends gravity (asteroid, suppression) with lightness ("correction fluid for the universe," "forgotten crown"). The mix is coherent and purposeful, though it doesn't modulate sharply under pressure—solemnity dominates the ending. The tone charges the middle turn (her laughter at the contradiction) but is less present in the final image, which reads purely solemn. Present in setup and middle; glancing presence at closure. Contributes but doesn't define the ending's charge.</comment>
