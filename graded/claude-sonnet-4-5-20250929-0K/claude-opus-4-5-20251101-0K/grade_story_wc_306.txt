<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation—"to welcome nuance into certainty"—is enacted through her counsel to Sera, and the "sincerely insincere" attribute is articulated on-page with some specificity. However, interiority remains largely abstract and declarative ("This was her protected vulnerability: wearing other people's doubts like borrowed coats") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Sera's arc from guilt to "different shoulders" reads cleanly but lacks the messy internal friction that would elevate characterization into the high 8s. The keeper's final micro-choice to turn back to her chimes feels like a closure ritual rather than a choice under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is swift and clear (keeper, lighthouse, dawn, Sera arrives). The story operates under a Situational lens: Sera's doubt is crystallized and her stance shifts from desperate search to acceptance, with the keeper's counsel applying pressure. Closure arrives via Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): Sera wraps the shard and descends with altered posture, and the keeper returns to waiting—both stances have visible cost (Sera accepts her sister's absence; the keeper remains professionally isolated). The cost is felt rather than sharply decisive, but the final image reweights prior material and the lens holds. One meaningful deepening occurs when the keeper reframes the hollow mirror, narrowing Sera's options from endless searching to intentional release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is vivid and purposeful: seventeen wind chimes function diagnostically, the spiral staircase frames ascent to counsel, and the glass crown creates atmosphere. The copper and bone chimes constrain the keeper's reading (doubt, grief, relief) and charge the method, lifting setting beyond postcard description. Spatial choreography is clean, and sensory detail (amber light, pooled shadows, sea stretching endlessly) reflects the keeper's professional calm. The setting does not directly constrain a pivotal choice at closure—Sera's decision is interpersonal rather than environmental—capping Q3 shy of the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Sera's guilt over stopping the search, signaled early and maintained. Pressure tightens through the keeper's question ("You've already searched…what you want now is permission to stop") and the reframing of the hollow mirror, which narrows Sera's live options from compulsive searching to acceptance. The cost is legible: Sera must bear the ambiguity of her sister's choice, and the keeper continues her isolating work. Under the Situational lens, the stance crystallization is sufficient, though escalation is modest—one meaningful turn rather than layered reversals. Agency belongs to Sera's acceptance and the keeper's counsel, both enacted on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through the keeper's method and Sera's arc: uncertainty is a condition to be held, not resolved. The hollow mirror shard reweights from absence to "space waiting to be filled differently," a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the keeper's detachment ("sincerely insincere") and her closing solitude, which underscores the cost of her work. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("This was her protected vulnerability…") rather than letting the image stand alone. The piece resists moralizing overall, but the articulation of complexity is somewhat over-explained rather than fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on the keeper with clean access to her interiority. Voice carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("thin as sea glass," "cathedral of wind and glass") that suits the keeper's professional mystique. Dialogue is purposeful and advances the counsel, with the keeper's lines carrying subtext (permission-granting disguised as insight). Minor slips: the keeper's internal phrasing occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("to unhook her clients from the desperate need for clean answers") that reads more like authorial summary than her lived thought under pressure. Perceptual signature is present but could be more idiosyncratic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean and rhythmically varied, with strong images (hollow mirror, wind chimes, spiral staircase). However, several decorative loops appear: "sincerely insincere in the way all professionals of moral commerce must be" is followed by a near-paraphrase two paragraphs later; "This was her method" and "This was her protected vulnerability" use template stems. Filter verbs ("recognized," "observed") stack in dialogue beats without voice motivation. The final third contains figurative density ("ribbons of cloud," "tide through sand") that does not obscure closure but slows momentum slightly. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence, −0.3 for filter-verb stack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "conscience for hire" frame and wind-chime divination offer a fresh angle on the counsel-seeker archetype. The hollow mirror as deliberate emptiness is a strong, non-obvious image. However, the emotional arc—bereaved sibling seeking permission to stop searching—is familiar, and the resolution (acceptance via reframing) follows a well-worn path. The keeper's detachment and the lighthouse setting add texture but do not fundamentally transform the template. Specificity in the chimes and the keeper's method elevates originality into the solid mid-7s, but the piece does not take bold structural or perspectival risks that would push higher.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "conscience for hire" character is introduced in the opening line, frames the keeper's method across multiple beats (listening to chimes, offering counsel, reframing the mirror), and her decision to remain at the lighthouse waiting for the next client closes the story. Her choices shape Sera's arc and the closure unit, but the keeper herself does not face a high-stakes personal decision—she enacts her role without visible internal conflict or cost at the level of her own doubt. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is moderate (she enables Sera's shift but is not transformed by it); closure linkage is clean but passive (she watches Sera leave, then returns to waiting). Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8, minus swappability −0.4 (another mystical counselor archetype could perform similarly).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hollow mirror shard is introduced early (Sera unwraps it), examined by the keeper in the crown, reframed ("She removed her reflection from it before she left"), and Sera lifts it to the light before wrapping it again at closure. It appears in three distinct beats and drives the keeper's key insight, narrowing Sera's options from searching to acceptance. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is strong (the shard's emptiness enables the reframe); closure linkage is solid (Sera wraps it with altered understanding). Score: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, minus minor ornamental description −0.3 (the shard is described more than used in the middle beat). Irreplaceability is high—another object would not carry the same hollow/absence logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "cloak of doubt" appears mid-story as the keeper's internal metaphor: "Doubt. The cloak of doubt wrapped itself around this girl so completely she had forgotten she was wearing it." It names Sera's condition and motivates the keeper's counsel, but it functions more as thematic label than dramatized constraint—Sera does not wrestle with the cloak on-page; the keeper simply identifies it. Setup gate is missed (introduced past the first third); development is present (the keeper's reading of the chimes); payoff is oblique (Sera's altered posture implies the cloak is loosened, but the image is not reprised). Score: one beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.6 (enables the keeper's counsel), closure linkage +0.5 (implied, not explicit), minus late appearance −0.4, minus ornamental metaphor −0.5 (could be replaced with "burden of guilt" or similar). Swappability is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "sincerely insincere" attribute is introduced early ("smiled, sincerely insincere in the way all professionals of moral commerce must be") and is reprised in the penultimate paragraph ("She was sincerely insincere because sincerity alone would break her…"). It characterizes the keeper's professional stance and motivates her detachment, but it does not constrain a specific on-page choice—her counsel to Sera would read identically if she were described as "compassionately distant" or "professionally warm." Setup and payoff gates are met; development is weak (the trait is asserted, not tested). Score: setup +0.5, closure linkage +0.8 (reprised with cost in final reflection), minus swappability −0.6 (label could be replaced), minus label-only use −0.3 (no moment where the trait forces a visible tradeoff). Cost connection is thin.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The action "unhook" appears twice: mid-story ("to unhook her clients from the desperate need for clean answers") and near closure ("I can unhook you from this guilt"). It names the keeper's method and is enacted when she reframes the mirror, enabling Sera's shift from guilt to acceptance. Setup is late (past the first third); development and payoff are present (the keeper's offer and Sera's acceptance). Score: setup +0.3 (late), two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0 (the unhooking reframes Sera's stance), closure linkage +1.2, minus swappability −0.5 ("release," "free," "absolve" would function similarly without major edits). The action is more metaphorical than physical, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The method "deciphering wind chime selections" is introduced early ("This was her method: deciphering wind chime selections to read the questions clients couldn't bring themselves to ask aloud") and is enacted when the keeper listens to the copper and bone chimes and identifies Sera's doubt and grief. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; the chimes enable the keeper's counsel and shape her reading. Score: setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.1 (the chimes' "chorus" informs the keeper's insight), closure linkage +0.6 (chimes settle into silence, framing the keeper's return to waiting), specificity +0.7 (seventeen chimes of distinct materials is vivid and irreplaceable). Minus minor ornamental description −0.4 (the chimes are described more than they mechanically constrain the keeper's choices). The method is signaled and matters but could be slightly more integral.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "breezy lighthouse at dawn" is established in the opening paragraph and frames the entire scene. The lighthouse's crown with wind chimes is the keeper's "office" and the setting for counsel; the spiral staircase marks Sera's ascent and descent. The breeze activates the chimes, enabling the method. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; the setting shapes the keeper's method and provides atmospheric charge. Score: setup +0.8, two beats +0.9 (arrival, counsel in the crown, descent), causal pressure +0.9 (the breeze and chimes enable the reading), closure linkage +0.8 (Sera descends; the keeper remains above), specificity +0.6. Minus micro-setting limitation −0.3 (the lighthouse does not directly constrain a pivotal choice—the counsel could occur in another liminal, elevated space). The setting is vivid and purposeful but not indispensable to the story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the campfire's last spark dies somewhere on the beach below" is introduced early as the keeper's "preferred hour for appointments" and establishes the liminal dawn setting. It creates atmosphere but does not function as a live clock—no urgency or ticking deadline shapes the counsel or Sera's decision. Setup gate is met; development and payoff are absent (the timeframe is mentioned once and does not reappear or tighten choices). Score: setup +0.5, ornamental use −0.7 (description without action pressure), swappability −0.5 (could be replaced with "at dawn" or "early morning" without structural change). The timeframe is poetic but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to welcome nuance into certainty" is the keeper's "true motivation in this work," stated mid-story, and is dramatized when she counsels Sera to "hold two truths at once" and reframes the hollow mirror. Setup is late; development and payoff are present (the keeper enacts the motivation through her counsel, and it shapes the closure advice). Score: setup +0.3 (late), two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.3 (the motivation drives the keeper's method and Sera's shift), closure linkage +1.0, minus told-only −0.4 (the motivation is stated in exposition rather than shown through conflicted choice), minus swappability −0.4 ("to offer perspective" or "to embrace ambiguity" would function similarly). The motivation is coherent but could be more internally dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tone "protected vulnerability" is named explicitly in the penultimate paragraph ("This was her protected vulnerability: wearing other people's doubts like borrowed coats") and is enacted through the keeper's detachment and her return to waiting at closure. The tone is coherent across the piece: the keeper is professionally warm yet emotionally guarded, and the final image (wind chimes stirring, someone approaching) charges the isolation and cyclical nature of her work. Setup is late (articulated near the end); development is present (the keeper's counsel demonstrates the balance of vulnerability and protection); payoff is strong (the tone modulates the closure image with cost). Score: setup +0.3 (late articulation), two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.5 (the tone charges the final waiting), coherence +0.8, minus label-only in one beat −0.3. The tone is consistent and purposeful, elevating the ending.</comment>
