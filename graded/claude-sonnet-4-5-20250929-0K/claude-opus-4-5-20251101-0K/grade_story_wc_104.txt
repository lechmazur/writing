<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her strategic patience shows in the key-decoding sequence, but her internal contradiction is thin—she moves through beats with competence that rarely wavers or costs her emotionally. The scout's reversal feels convenient rather than earned by prior friction; his war is told ("duty against desperation") rather than dramatized through contradictory micro-choices. The chains as "familiar as her own heartbeat" recur but function more as atmospheric motif than a constraint that shapes her tactics with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a causal chain: Mira decodes keys → descends into vault → scout chooses mercy → Mira escapes with seeds. Closure arrives on the page as a Decisive Change (she leaves with the seeds, the wall falls, resilience work begins) with visible cost (chains remain, work ahead is hard). The drive lens reads Causal with light Situational pressure from the scout encounter. One friction: the scout's reversal lacks sufficient prior setup, making the turn feel slightly unmotivated, though the ending image does reweight the premise with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The carnival prize center is vividly rendered—dust motes, button-eyed toys, yellowed piano keys—and the vault's "cool darkness" contrasts effectively. Spatial choreography is clean (piano, bench, ticket counter, descent). The setting enables the key-puzzle and provides the vault resource, shaping the core choice. The arrow placed on the counter is a nice spatial anchor for the scout's decision. However, the environment doesn't constrain Mira's movement or tactics with friction; she navigates freely, so it stops short of the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—securing seeds before demolition—is signaled early and tightens once through the scout's arrival, which forces Mira to persuade rather than simply retrieve. The timeframe ("two hours," "distant rumbles") creates urgency. Agency is present in her decoding and persuasion, and the ending forecloses the path of waiting for official approval with visible cost (chains, hard work ahead). One gap: the scout's reversal isn't driven by Mira's choices but by his off-page village hunger, so protagonist agency at the turn is partial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars: chains/freedom paradox, seeds as encoded hope, mercy as unexpected rupture. The final image—Mira walking toward dead zones, pockets heavy with seeds, chains still on—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the resilience question without moralizing. The arrow as "reminder that chains could bind bodies but never the human capacity for unexpected mercy" skirts explicit statement but stays anchored in image. One soft spot: "resilience grew best in impossible conditions" in the penultimate line borders on thesis-speak, though it's tied to concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira; distance is controlled. Perceptual signature is present ("liberator in chains," "negative space between obvious things") and diction reflects her mix of tactical focus and poetic framing. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the scout's "You're a terrorist" and Mira's reply carry subtext and goal. One friction: "staggering grace she didn't feel" in dialogue tag is a mild filter that asserts interior state the scene already shows, and some phrasing ("war behind his face") leans slightly ornamental. Under pressure, voice remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing image recharges the chains motif with new weight. Figurative language is controlled ("keys yellowed like old teeth," "held breath finally released") and serves pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor artifact: "staggering grace she didn't feel" is a weak filter, and "war behind his face" + "finger hovered near the trigger" are stock gestures, but these don't touch closure. High clarity and momentum throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The chained-liberator paradox and keys-as-music puzzle offer fresh angles on the resistance-leader trope. The carnival setting and seed-vault premise feel specific rather than generic. However, the scout's last-minute mercy and the clean escape follow a familiar template: sympathetic guard lets hero go after brief appeal. The synthesis is solid but stops short of the non-obvious, earned-in-hindsight reversals that reach higher bands. Risk-taking is moderate; no bold structural or perspectival moves that heighten stakes beyond the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira as chained liberator is seeded early (opening line), drives the key-decoding beat, the persuasion turn with the scout, and the vault descent. Her chains constrain her physically (shackled hands) and thematically charge the ending image. The element is essential across setup, middle choice, and closure; removing it would collapse the paradox at the story's heart.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The arrow with strange fletching appears when the scout enters, is identified as a signal device (raising stakes), is set down in the reversal beat, and reappears in the ending as a "reminder." It touches three beats and carries symbolic weight at closure. However, its "strange fletching" detail (synthetic, whistling) doesn't mechanically shape a choice—it functions more as stake-marker than tactical constraint. Solid integration, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The clandestine seed vault is the story's engine: it defines Mira's goal, necessitates the decoding puzzle, triggers the time pressure (demolition), and provides the seeds she carries in the ending. Setup, middle action, and closure all hinge on it. The vault's "cool darkness" and "packets of dormant miracles" ground it concretely. Removing it would erase the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Patiently strategic" is seeded in the opening exposition ("three years learning to see patterns") and demonstrated in the key-decoding sequence, where Mira "hummed the melody under her breath as she decoded it." It enables one key beat but doesn't create visible friction or cost—her patience succeeds without trade-off. Present in setup and one middle action, but doesn't constrain or charge the ending. Functional, not essential.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Impede" is verbalized when Mira asks the scout to "Let me impede them," framing her persuasion tactic. It captures her goal in that beat and ties to the broader delay against demolition. However, the word itself is somewhat generic—"delay," "slow," "stop" could substitute with minor edits. It shapes one turn but isn't irreplaceable. Mid-band for purposeful use without high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Decoding the arrangement of keys in the piano bench is seeded early (contact's hidden code), executed in a distinct beat with concrete mechanics (each key type = note, positions = staff, humming the melody), and yields the vault access that drives the ending. The method is specific, irreplaceable (removing it breaks the puzzle logic), and causally essential. Appears in setup and middle; enables closure indirectly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival prize redemption center is anchored in the opening paragraph with vivid particulars (dusty toys, rotted ceiling, piano, ticket counter) and provides the vault's hidden entrance beneath the counter. It supplies resources (piano puzzle) and pressures Mira with the demolition timeline. The irony ("prizes no one had claimed") enriches theme. Removing the carnival would require substantial rewrites. Setup, middle use, and thematic charge all present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"When the wall comes down" is introduced in paragraph 4 as the demolition trigger, quantified ("two hours"), and tracked with "distant rumbles" and "dust clouds rose where the wall collapsed" at the ending. The timeframe creates urgency and tightens the scout encounter. However, the clock isn't felt beat-by-beat—Mira's actions don't visibly speed up or trade accuracy for time. Functional pressure, not razor-edge tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To plant resilience in dry soil" is named explicitly in paragraph 4 ("her religion") and dramatized through her choices: decoding keys, descending into the vault, persuading the scout by appealing to village hunger, and walking toward the dead zones with seeds. The ending image—stride steady, pockets heavy, work ahead hard—embodies the motivation with visible cost. Setup, middle conflict, and closure all hinge on it. Nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Staggering grace" appears once in dialogue tag ("her voice carrying a staggering grace she didn't feel") and is echoed in the final image's "stride steady despite the weight of iron." The tone modulates from tactical focus (key-decoding) to persuasive urgency (scout encounter) to quiet resolve (ending walk). Coherent across turns but not deeply charged at closure; the phrase itself is somewhat ornamental. Present in two beats, purposeful but not essential.</comment>
