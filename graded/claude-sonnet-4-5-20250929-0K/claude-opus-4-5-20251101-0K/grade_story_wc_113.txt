<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clara's motivation is clear and her obsession well-established, but her interior remains somewhat abstract—we get "insomnia and obsession" as labels rather than embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to retrieve the documents feels inevitable but lacks a visible on-page cost or internal friction; she simply completes the task she came to do. Emotional progression is steady but doesn't degrade or layer under stress in ways that reveal hierarchy of values. The ghost relationship is evocative but one-sided, limiting relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: water stains accrue meaning, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Clara retrieves vindication and the ghost's face softens into peace—Charged Poise qualifies as closure. Orientation anchors promptly (flooded opera house, Clara, present night). The cost is somewhat implied (years of invisible labor now repurposed, a career pivot awaiting) but not sharply dramatized on the page; the final image reweights her marginality positively without a felt price in the moment. One meaningful deepening occurs when she finds the hidden panel and documents, narrowing her path to public action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The flooded pit, flickering lanterns, and water-stained walls create vivid atmosphere and constrain Clara's movements (wading, holding case overhead). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through a musician's POV. The antique program and hidden panel function as micro-setting that drives plot. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting actively shapes the climactic discovery and charges the final image of water damage becoming message.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—vindicating Maestro Voss—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Clara decodes the stains and locates the hidden evidence, narrowing her options to public disclosure. Agency is present (she chooses to return, decode, retrieve, and commit to revealing the truth) but coincidence does much work: the flood conveniently reveals what decades of occupancy did not. The cost of her choice (career pivot, exposure, possible backlash) is gestured toward ("tomorrow, she would contact historians") but not dramatized on the page, weakening escalation's felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of invisibility as power and marginality as vantage emerges organically from Clara's role and final realization. The water-damage motif recurs purposefully, shifting from random pattern to deliberate code to peace, charging the closure. Subtext operates well in the wordless ghost exchange and the closing image. However, the final paragraph edges toward overt thematic statement ("invisibility was its own kind of power") rather than trusting the dramatized arc to carry the insight, and the line "truth waited to surface at last" borders on moralizing summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable, voice distinct with musicianly specificity ("counting rests and watching conductors' batons"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Clara notices in-between spaces, margins, patterns. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("romantic gloom," "disrupt the accepted history") that feels slightly authorial rather than a pit musician's idiom under stress. No dialogue present. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates appropriately with emotional beats. Compression at peak moments (finding the documents) maintains voice without clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence structure supports atmosphere well. Information density is high; most lines advance character or plot. Minor scaffold appears: "She understood now" and "She had spent her life invisible" are slightly tell-heavy where action could show. The phrase "dead notes" in paragraph one and "dead forty years" in the next creates inadvertent echo. Figurative language ("music was born but never seen," "chord finally struck after forty years of silence") enriches texture but occasionally stacks without advancing pressure. No major loops or clarity issues; prose is clean and propulsive overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ghost-leaves-code-in-building premise is familiar from multiple mystery templates, but the water-damage-as-medium twist and Clara's pit-musician marginality add specificity. Emotional truth (invisible labor, vindication of the wronged) feels authentic. The transformation test is borderline: swap musician for archivist and opera for library and the arc holds with minimal change, indicating moderate swappability. One fresh inflection: the ghost's face softening in water stains at closure. Risk-taking is modest; the piece commits to its premise but plays it safely without bold structural or perspectival choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clara's role as pit musician frames her POV (noticing margins, invisible labor) and motivates her return. She makes the key choice to retrieve and publicize the evidence. Her occupational lens shapes perception throughout. Present in setup, drives middle action (decoding, locating panel), and anchors closure decision. Specific cost tied to musician identity is implied but not sharp on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The antique opera program appears once, floating intact where it should have dissolved—a physical impossibility that signals the ghost's agency. Clara lifts it and photographs annotations, advancing the decoding plot. Present in setup and middle beat but absent from closure; no reprise or reweighting at the end. Functional but not indispensable; another artifact (a score, a letter) could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"In between spaces" is signaled early (pit musician "existing in the in between spaces where music was born but never seen") and explicitly tied to Clara's ability to decode Voss's hidden truth ("only someone who knew its secret rhythms could find what he had buried"). The concept shapes her tactics (searching margins, decoding stains) and is reprised thematically at closure ("invisibility was its own kind of power, that those who dwelt in margins could see what others missed"). Cost is implied—her marginality becomes her vindication tool—but the thematic overlay in the final paragraph slightly dilutes causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Lately inspired by insomnia and obsession" appears mid-story as a summary label explaining her decoding work. It does not constrain an on-page choice or create visible friction; it tells us she has been studying but does not dramatize the cost (sleeplessness, social withdrawal) in a way that alters present action. Label-only, introduced after the 40% mark, ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Disrupt" is gestured toward ("someone who understood in between spaces, to disrupt the accepted history") and actualized when Clara retrieves the confession and commits to contacting historians. The action occurs at closure and redefines her path forward. However, the disruption itself happens off-page (tomorrow); on-page we see retrieval and intent, not the disruptive act. Present in middle (decoding disrupts her assumptions) and shapes ending choice, but the word feels somewhat thematic rather than a dramatized turn with immediate cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Water damage creating images is introduced early (paragraph two: stains reveal musical notations, figures, Voss's face) and drives the entire investigation. Clara photographs new stains in the pit (paragraph five), which spell coordinates and a treble-clef map, directly enabling her to locate the hidden panel. The mechanism's impossibility (water stains that form legible code) is accepted as the story's central conceit and consistently applied. Present in setup, middle decoding beats, and closure (Voss's face softens in the stain, then vanishes). Indispensable: without this exact method, the plot collapses.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The flooded opera house lit by flickering lanterns is established in the opening line and sustained throughout. Water level (knee-deep, then waist-deep) constrains Clara's movement (holding cello case overhead, wading, prying panel "beneath the waterline"). Lanterns provide light for reading stains and flicker in unison at the ghost moment, charging atmosphere. The pit's back wall and hidden panel are spatially specific and essential to plot. Setting pressures every choice and charges the closure image. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Amid the hush of unstruck chords" functions as lyric metaphor (musicians waiting to play, silence before sound) rather than a literal timeframe constraint. The story unfolds over one night with vague duration; no clock tightens tactics. The phrase appears once thematically ("in the space between performance and silence, amid the hush of unstruck chords") and does not recur or shape decisions. Ornamental, late setup, no development or closure use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clara's desire to unravel Voss's code and vindicate him is signaled early ("she returned not for performance but for answers") and sustained across beats: studying cipher, photographing stains, locating the panel, retrieving documents. Friction exists between her invisible past role and her coming public role, and the cost of exposure is implied ("tomorrow, she would contact historians, journalists, anyone who would listen"). The motivation drives all major choices and shapes closure. However, the conflict is mostly external (solving the puzzle) rather than internal (wanting versus fearing consequences), slightly lowering friction intensity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Wordless conversation" is introduced mid-story ("She did not speak to him. She never had to. Their wordless conversation had begun...") and demonstrated through Clara's nod and Voss's face softening in the stain. Tone is quiet, meditative, and elegiac throughout, modulating subtly with discovery beats (lanterns flicker, warmth despite cold water). The tone supports the ghost exchange and charges the final image ("Only water damage remained, beautiful and meaningless to anyone else"). Coherent and purposeful, though the explicit phrase "wordless conversation" tells rather than purely showing.</comment>
