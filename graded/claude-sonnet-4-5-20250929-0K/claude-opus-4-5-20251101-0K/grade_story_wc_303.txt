<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is embodied through concrete sensory engagement (warm velvet, ice crystal burn) and her choices escalate under pressure—choosing cultural preservation over personal safety. Internal contradiction emerges in the "mulberry ache of choosing loss over surrender," showing simultaneous grief and resolve. The ferns' counsel and her coffee-stain divination anchor her perceptual particularity, though the final renunciation could carry sharper visible cost in tactics or immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered images (coffee stains, fern whispers, ice violin) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira chooses to be forsworn, propagating the song rather than surrendering the artifact. Closure lands on the page with visible cost: she shatters the violin, accepts being "marked, hunted," and transforms the empire's grasp into cultural dispersal. The before/after is legible: empire claim → song everywhere, ownership → impossibility of silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The velvet observatory is grounded early (bruised-plum dome, acoustic focus, transparent apex) and the dome's acoustic properties enable the climactic act—amplifying and propagating the song. Midsummer's "longest light" and the three-day timeframe anchor temporal pressure. The ferns function as micro-setting, their roots holding memory and their presence constraining Mira's choice by offering counsel rooted in place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled immediately: return the violin and validate empire, or refuse and face war. Pressure tightens through the promise's fading glow and Mira's discovery of a "perforation" in destiny. The final choice—playing the violin to propagate the song—narrows options with visible cost: the instrument shatters, she becomes forsworn and hunted. The decision is hers, driven by accumulated knowledge (coffee stains, fern counsel) and the renunciation forecloses the path of compliance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: empire erases, culture persists through propagation. The perforated-destiny concept charges the ending—Mira finds the gap in fate and acts through it. The coffee stains, ferns, and ice violin accumulate meaning without didactic summary; the final image ("songs that outlast the empires that try to bury them") reweights prior material as conceptual answer rather than moral. "Mulberry ache" and the violin's self-destruction embody cost without explaining it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Mira's perceptual signature: she reads coffee stains, hears ferns, feels ice burn. Diction remains controlled and voice-particular ("bruised plums," "green ribbons," "frozen heart"). The ferns' dialogue-substitute ("Propagate") carries purposeful compression. One brief register slip: "the convenient erasure of the mountain people" edges toward essay tone, but the surrounding specificity (ice caverns, glacier carving) grounds the voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; imagery is vivid and dense ("dark liquid settle," "ice dust," "mulberry ache"). Minor scaffold appears: "They answered in the language of growth and patient seasons" is abstract where a concrete image would sharpen. "Propagate across distances that should have been impossible" tells mechanism rather than showing propagation's effects. Figurative language is heavy but mostly coherent; no major loops or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—provenance researcher using telepathic ferns and coffee-stain prophecy to subvert empire through sound propagation—is specific and non-obvious. The perforated-destiny concept transforms a familiar resist-the-empire premise into a choice-gap framework. Risk-taking is present (fern telepathy, ice violin, velvet acoustics) without gimmickry. The emotional calculus (forsworn freedom vs. compliant survival) avoids safety-middle hedging, though the ice-crystal violin and magical-promise glow lean toward high-concept ornament.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's role as provenance researcher frames her understanding of the violin's cultural stakes and drives her decision to propagate rather than return. Her expertise in tracing "impossible objects" and reading ownership histories is causally active in the opening conflict and informs her final choice to spread knowledge rather than preserve the artifact. Present in setup, conflict, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ice crystal violin appears in setup (observation table, glacier origin), middle development (Mira lifts it, feels its cold burn, understands it will shatter when played), and drives the climactic action—she plays it beneath the acoustic dome, shattering it to propagate the song. Its physical properties (fragility, frozen heart) create the irreversible cost. Removal would collapse the closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Perforated destiny is signaled early ("holes in fate where choice could slip through") and shapes Mira's tactics: she seeks and finds the "perforation" in the coffee stains, enabling her refusal. The concept reappears in the final line ("Some destinies were meant to be perforated"), charging the closure image. It functions more as thematic lens than plot mechanic, but the gap it names is the one Mira acts through.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mira's plant telepathy is present (ferns "murmur," "remember," "suggest") and enables middle counsel that tilts her choice toward propagation. The trait constrains her epistemic access—she gains knowledge unavailable to others—but no visible cost or tradeoff is dramatized on the page. The ferns weep at closure, reprising the link, but the telepathy itself remains convenience rather than complication.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Propagate" is the ferns' counsel, Mira's tactical choice, and the story's resolution. She propagates the song (not the violin) by playing it once, spreading the mountain people's music "everywhere, impossible to own, impossible to silence." The action is irreplaceable: returning, hiding, or destroying the violin would not achieve the same cultural dispersal. It drives the climax and redefines the empire's threat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Coffee-stain reading is introduced early (Mira pours coffee, "stains...told stories to those who knew how to read them") and used in the middle beat: she studies the stains, sees prophecy, and identifies the "perforation" that enables her choice. The method shapes her tactical knowledge. Its mechanics are gestural rather than detailed, and it does not reappear at closure, capping upper range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The velvet observatory is anchored immediately (suspended, domed, bruised-plum fabric) and its acoustic properties are causally active: the dome "caught it, amplified it, sent it spiraling upward." Midsummer's light pulses through the weave, marking the timeframe. The transparent apex allows the song to escape. The setting enables the climactic propagation; removal would require a different mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The three-day countdown ("before the promise loses its glow") is signaled in the opening and mentioned again before the climax ("When it died completely, she would be forsworn"). The timeframe tightens Mira's decision window and charges her choice with temporal urgency. The promise's fading luminescence tracks the cost of delay, though exact elapsed time within the scene is not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Weigh a dream against an empire" is dramatized throughout: Mira's dream (preserving cultural knowledge) conflicts with the empire's demand and the war it threatens. The friction surfaces in her internal calculation ("validation of empire...versus war") and final choice—she privileges the dream, accepting the cost of being forsworn. The motivation drives setup, middle reflection, and closure action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Mulberry ache" appears twice: as embodied emotion ("that mulberry ache of choosing loss over surrender") and in the final image ("tasting mulberry and morning on her lips"). The tone—bittersweet grief mixed with resolve—modulates through reflection and sharpens at closure. It charges the ending without dominating every beat. Coherent and purposeful, though the exact phrase risks becoming ornamental label rather than sensory anchor.</comment>
