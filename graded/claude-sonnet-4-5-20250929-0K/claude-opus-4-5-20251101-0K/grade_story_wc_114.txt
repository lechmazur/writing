<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cassandra's interior is well-rendered with embodied contradiction ("truth in her chest shifted, demanding acknowledgment") and her choice to withhold the vision rather than report it is motivated by consistent self-preservation. The fault-tolerant oracle design provides compelling internal logic for her hedging behavior. Minor weakness: the reflection on her survival strategy ("by occupying margins") drifts slightly abstract in the middle third without immediate micro-choices. The final decision to carry the weight privately feels earned by the fever-driven setup and her established pattern of distribution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (mountain station, post-fever, oracle protagonist). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (frost crystals, smudged illustration, auroras) and reflections that cohere at closure when Cassandra chooses silence over prophecy. The closure is Earned Stasis—she withholds the vision, forecloses loyalty to the Consortium, and accepts the private weight—with conceptual cost legible in "some fault-tolerant oracles learned to fail in exactly the right way." One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from fevered confusion to deliberate choice. Cost is visible in her acceptance of complicity and isolation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mountain weather station provides concrete setting details (barometers, anemometers, frost patterns) and the narrow cot grounds the recovery physically. The smudged illustration functions as micro-setting that charges the final image and constrains her thinking about imperfection. Mira's presence and the auroras add atmospheric specificity. Minor gap: the station's instruments measure but do not directly constrain a tactical choice on the page; the setting enriches theme more than it alters options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: whether to speak or withhold the certain vision of the Consortium's end. The tightening occurs when Cassandra moves from fevered confusion to conscious decision: "She would give them nothing." Agency is decision and renunciation with visible cost—she accepts complicity and isolation. The escalation is textural rather than causal, accumulating through reflection and image until the final beat crystallizes her stance. One clear pressure point; no second reversal needed at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the smudged illustration ("imperfections made things more real"), the contrast between fault-tolerant design and absolute truth, and the ethics of silence. The final image—"some fault-tolerant oracles learned to fail in exactly the right way"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether silence is protection or betrayal without stating a moral. The auroral sorrow metaphor charges the ending. Minor slip: "truth has mass" is slightly on-the-nose in Mira's dialogue, though it remains character-voiced rather than authorial.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with clean access to Cassandra's interiority. Perceptual signature is distinct: she notices margins, blurs, probabilities. Diction ("auroral sorrow, beautiful and brief and cold") is controlled and lyric without obscuring clarity. Mira's dialogue carries distinct warmth and metaphorical ease that contrasts with Cassandra's more guarded internal register. Minor weakness: "fault-tolerant oracle" terminology repeats five times, risking slight technical echo, but remains voice-motivated given her training.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Opening and closing images are strong. Two minor artifacts: "borrowed by" should be "borne by" in the auroral sorrow line (likely a homophone slip), and "swaying now, tilting" is a near-paraphrase within one sentence. Template cadence appears briefly in the reflection paragraphs ("She had seen... Seen the towers... And she had swallowed") but does not obscure causality. No loops touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The fault-tolerant oracle premise is fresh and well-integrated with the weather-station setting and the smudged-illustration motif. The choice to withhold prophecy rather than speak it transforms the typical oracle trope. Specificity (barometers, alpine gentians, edelweiss) anchors the voice. Minor limitation: the Consortium's end as stakes is declared rather than shown, relying on summary ("seen the towers fall") which reduces immediacy. The synthesis of oracle-as-margin-dweller with the ethical question of complicit silence feels earned and non-obvious.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cassandra's choice to withhold the vision rather than report it is the story's central decision, forecloses her loyalty to the Consortium, and shapes the closure. Early signal via "fault-tolerant" design; beat involvement in fever reflection, conversation with Mira, and final stance. Causal pressure: her training to "never quite certain" enables the withholding choice. Closure linkage strong: "some fault-tolerant oracles learned to fail in exactly the right way." Cost visible in accepted complicity. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The illustration appears in three beats: bedside description, reflection on the smudged edge, and final pocket placement. The smudge inflects her thinking about imperfection and margins, priming the closure choice. Causal pressure moderate: it reweights her understanding but does not directly enable the withholding decision. Closure linkage present via the final tactile moment. Swappability risk: another heirloom object (letter, map) could serve similar thematic work with minor edits. Specificity (grandmother's brushstrokes, alpine gentians) adds texture.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept shapes stakes on the page: Cassandra's certainties "sway" between speaking and withholding, loyalty and liberation. It appears early ("never standing fully in any single truth") and governs the middle reflection on margins. The final choice to "occupy the margins between loyalty and liberation" directly enacts the concept. Moderate causal pressure: the concept frames her internal calculus rather than altering external options. Closure linkage strong. Could be more irreplaceable; "ambiguity" might substitute with edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cassandra is "peripherally aware of the instruments humming" in the opening beat, establishing her sensory stance post-fever. The trait does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost; it enriches her recovering perception without altering her choices. Present in setup, absent in middle development and closure participation. Swappable: "dimly aware" or "half-conscious of" would serve similar descriptive work. No causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The smudge appears in two beats: Cassandra's thumb blurred the illustration "during her delirious nights," and she studies the imperfection, concluding it "made the flower seem more real." This action primes her acceptance of margins and imperfection, which supports the closure choice to occupy margins. Causal pressure moderate: it inflects her thinking but does not directly turn the plot. Closure linkage indirect via thematic resonance. Swappability risk: another accidental mark (tear, stain) might serve similarly. Early signal strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("by occupying margins, by never standing fully in any single truth") and returns at closure ("occupy the margins between loyalty and liberation"). It shapes her survival tactics across the story and is enacted in the final withholding decision. Moderate causal pressure: the method frames her calculus rather than enabling a specific physical action. Closure linkage strong. Swappability moderate: "hedging" or "staying ambiguous" might substitute with edits, though "margins" ties more tightly to the illustration motif.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The weather station provides concrete anchoring (barometers, anemometers, narrow cot, access road) and thematic parallel (probabilistic forecasts match her oracle design). It enables the isolation necessary for her decision and Mira's presence. Causal pressure light: the setting does not directly constrain tactics; it enriches atmosphere. Early signal strong. Closure participation weak: the station's instruments are mentioned in the penultimate paragraph but do not charge the final image. Swappability moderate: another remote outpost might serve with minor adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The fever breaking at dawn opens the story and establishes the transition from delirium to clarity, framing Cassandra's conscious choice. The timeframe does not create urgency or tighten decisions on the page; it functions as backstory delimiter. Early signal strong. Middle development absent: no clock pressure during the conversation or reflection. Closure participation weak: time is not tracked in the final beats. Swappability high: "after illness" or "upon waking" would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cassandra's stated need to "find the weight of something I can't unsee and won't speak" is dramatized through her conversation with Mira, the reflection on truth's mass, and the final decision to carry the weight privately. Early signal strong; beat involvement across setup, dialogue, and closure. Causal pressure: the motivation drives her stance crystallization. Closure linkage strong: the withholding enacts the motivation. Cost visible in accepted isolation. Minor swappability: "measure the cost of silence" might substitute with edits.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone is established early ("hollow as a struck bell," "auroral sorrow, beautiful and brief and cold") and modulates through the reflective middle beats, maintaining melancholy lyricism. It charges the final image: "some silences spoke louder than prophecy." Coherent through turns without static flatness. Causal pressure light: tone enriches rather than constrains choice. Closure linkage strong. Irreplaceability moderate: another sorrowful register (twilight grief, winter resignation) might serve with adjustments, though "auroral" ties to the on-page auroras and adds specificity.</comment>
