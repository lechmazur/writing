<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (climbing to the roof at 4 AM, weeks of failed attempts). Her transformation from obsessive grief to acceptance is earned through the photography experiments, though the final emotional state—"luminous absence transformed into something Miriam could hold"—edges toward abstraction. The shift to teaching others feels slightly unmotivated; no prior beat establishes this impulse. Minor: the mother's cupped hands appear only in summary, weakening the specificity of what Miriam gains.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through repeated failed attempts, then delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance of luminous absence as presence) with visible cost—she continues the ritual, her mother remains "distant, remained gone." Orientation is clean by paragraph two. The fog-breakthrough beat provides a meaningful tightening that reweights prior material. One structural concern: the epilogue section (visitors arriving, teaching others) feels like a second, softer ending that slightly diffuses the photograph-reveal closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archipelago's "seventeen islands" and "wind carrying sounds across impossible distances" establish atmosphere early, though these details don't constrain choices. The palette itself functions as micro-setting, its "empty wells" and light-scattering properties directly enabling the climactic photograph. The rooftop and fog are purposefully deployed at the key moment. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting charges the final image effectively but doesn't pressure tactics in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing the vanishing dream—is signaled immediately and tightens through escalating loss ("could no longer remember if her mother's hair had been dark or gray"). The fog morning provides a meaningful turn: Miriam almost doesn't climb, then chooses to despite conditions. The photograph's success forecloses her obsessive chase with visible cost: she continues the ritual, her mother remains incomplete. Agency is present in repeated attempts under worsening conditions. One reversal (fog breakthrough) is sufficient for this length and accumulative design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—what is lost can be held through its absence—emerges organically from the photography experiments and Elara's "cipher of longing" without thesis statements. The final image "luminous gift she can almost, almost name" resists closure in service of resonance. "Light itself carries memory if you know how to read it" walks the edge of platitude but is grounded in the specific palette mechanics. The teaching epilogue risks didacticism ("helps them position their own cameras") but stops short of moralizing. Subtext operates cleanly in the mother's cupped hands—never fully revealed, properly mysterious.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third limited throughout; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during the roof scenes, slightly wider in the framing paragraphs). Perceptual signature: "The dream kept running" and "The luminous absence of her grew heavier than presence ever had" show character-specific processing. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("vitalize the fading images," "frequencies invisible to ordinary sight") but remains within a literary librarian's register. Rhythm varies purposefully, tightening during the fog breakthrough. No dialogue to evaluate. The epilogue's shift to present tense ("still keeps her post") is intentional but slightly disrupts established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is generally strong, but several lines loop conceptually: "remained distant, remained gone" and "almost, almost name" repeat structure for effect, which succeeds. Minor scaffold: "The dream kept running, and she kept losing pieces" and "earning strange refractions, beautiful but meaningless" use template stems. "Luminous" appears seven times, risking overuse but remaining coherent to the central metaphor. The fog-breakthrough paragraph delivers high density without clutter. Figurative language is controlled except "blade of gold cutting the mist," which verges on stock. Copy is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief photography, ancestral messages, and found journals is competently executed but draws from familiar templates (dead parent, magical realism artifact, artist's journal as key). Transformation occurs through specificity: the palette's empty wells, sunrise timing, fog as obstacle. The "cipher of longing" concept adds freshness, though "wavelengths of dawn light" leans toward pseudo-science without full commitment. The teaching epilogue is a familiar closure pattern for this premise. Emotional truth in the "luminous absence" paradox elevates the familiar frame. No close proximity to famous works detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Miriam's role as odd-hour librarian enables discovery of the palette in "restricted archives" and provides solitude for roof experiments. Her choice to climb despite fog creates the key turn. The profession shapes two distinct beats (archive discovery, midnight-to-dawn experiments) and her decision to teach others. However, the "odd-hour" specificity (midnight to dawn) is established but not constraining—experiments could occur at any quiet time. Present in setup, development, and closure; drives two beats; causal but partially swappable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The palette appears in three distinct beats: discovery with Elara's journal, weeks of failed experiments ("positioning her camera behind the palette"), and the fog-morning success. Its specific property—empty wells that scatter light into "impossible colors"—directly enables the photograph that captures Miriam's mother. Returns with reweighted meaning in the teaching epilogue. The mechanics matter: light passes *through* the wells. Removal would break the story's central mechanism. Strong setup, development, and closure linkage with visible specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Cipher of longing" is named explicitly via Elara's journal and shapes Miriam's understanding: "not a code to be cracked but a language to be learned." It frames her approach (learning vs. solving) and the teaching epilogue ("she shows them Elara's journal, teaches them to read the cipher"). However, it functions more as thematic label than on-page constraint—Miriam's tactics don't meaningfully differ because of cipher vs. other metaphors. Present in setup and closure; inflects interpretation but doesn't alter concrete choices. Lyric reprise with modest causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Paints with light" describes Elara's historical practice and extends metaphorically to Miriam's photography. Established early ("said to paint with light itself") and echoed at closure ("woman who paints with light and photographs the shapes of what is lost"). However, it's primarily descriptive—the actual method is *photography through the palette*, not painting. The attribute doesn't constrain or enable a distinct choice; "photographs with light" would be more accurate and equally functional. Present but ornamental; swappable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Vitalize" appears once in narration ("to vitalize the fading images in her mind") describing Miriam's intent drawn from Elara's theory that dawn light could "pull memories forward, fixing them in visible form." This verb choice captures the core action—giving dying memories tangible form—and the photograph's success demonstrates it on the page. It shapes the stakes (not just recording but restoring) and differentiates this from ordinary photography. Removal would flatten the story's conceptual mechanism. Present in setup and development; charges the closure metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sunrise photography is established method early ("She began her own experiments...positioning her camera behind the palette as the first light crept over the eastern islands") and repeated across "weeks" of attempts. The mechanics matter: specific timing (4 AM climbs), specific tool (camera behind palette), specific light (eastern sunrise through fog). The fog-breakthrough depends on dawn's "sudden blade of gold." Method shapes multiple attempts and the successful capture. Present in setup, developed through failed repetitions, and essential to closure. Irreplaceable specificity with causal weight across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The Whispering Archipelago is established with vivid specificity ("seventeen islands," "wind moved between") in the opening line and provides the dawn geography ("eastern islands") for the photography. However, it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop—the key action occurs on the library roof, and any coastal/island location with sunrise would serve. The wind-carrying-sounds detail is evocative but doesn't return or constrain choices. Early setup and present at closure, but the archipelago's unique properties don't alter tactics. Lyric presence without strong causal grip.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"In the hush of improbable beginnings" appears in the opening and returns at closure ("in the hush of improbable beginnings, when darkness yields to the first impossible gold"). It frames the liminal dawn moment as the operative timeframe and signals that early-morning threshold matters. However, it's more tonal than constraining—no ticking clock tightens decisions, and the timeframe is atmospheric rather than pressuring. Miriam's three-year tenure and "weeks" of attempts show duration but not urgency. Purposeful lyric reprise that reweights the ending image; modest causal function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Capturing the runaway dream is the explicit, dramatized motivation from paragraph two forward. It drives Miriam's initial attempts ("journals, sleeping pills, hypnosis"), the palette experiments, and the decision to climb despite fog. Friction between desire and cost is visible: "Some mornings Miriam could no longer remember if her mother's hair had been dark or gray." The resolution transforms but doesn't erase the motivation—she continues photographing, the dream no longer runs but remains incomplete. Present in setup, drives three beats (initial failures, palette discovery, fog breakthrough), and shapes closure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" appears explicitly near midpoint ("The luminous absence of her grew heavier than presence ever had") and charges the ending ("luminous absence transformed into something Miriam could hold"). The tone—paradoxical light within loss—modulates across beats: obsessive in early attempts, desperate during failures, breakthrough awe at the photograph, then settled acceptance in the epilogue. Diction sustains it: "luminous" recurs seven times, "light" as both literal and metaphorical carrier. Coherent through turns; the final image fulfills the tonal promise without stating it. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>
