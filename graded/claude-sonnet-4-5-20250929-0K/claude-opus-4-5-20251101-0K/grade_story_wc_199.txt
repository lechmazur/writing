<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Wren's interiority is dense and particular ("seeds were potential, leaves were completion"), and her dedication to sorting and monument-building feels lived-in. However, the transformation itself—moonstone dissolving into skin, sudden ability to read leaves—bypasses internal contradiction or struggle; she moves from longing to fulfillment without cost or renunciation visible on the page. The final return to sorting feels like thematic satisfaction rather than a character-driven choice that forecloses a meaningful alternative. Embodied emotion is strong in the middle ("mossy delight"), but the peak beat remains abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean: who, where, what by the first beat. The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds through layered images (seeds, leaves, monuments, dust speck) that converge in the hush. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: Wren's perceptual shift reweights her life's work, and the final monument marks the transformation. Cost is felt (she is no longer "ordinary") but remains oblique; the forfeit of her former self is asserted more than dramatized. One meaningful deepening occurs when the leaf's patterns rearrange, narrowing her understanding and opening transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor—trees rooted in volcanic soot, mist-drunk—is vivid and consistent. Micro-setting excels: the moonstone probe, the sorting tray, the suspended walkways with tiny monuments all recur and constrain action. The arbor's grey expanse shifts to vibrant at closure, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective ("mossy and sweet," "green scent of things growing") and filtered through Wren's devotion. The environment subtly guides choice: the hush is both temporal and spatial pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the leaves' messages—is signaled early and maintained. The hush provides one meaningful deepening: the leaf's patterns rearrange, revealing transformation instructions rather than prophecy. However, escalation is driven more by revelation than protagonist agency; Wren observes and receives rather than choosing under competing pressures. The cost at closure (becoming "more fully herself") is asserted but not tested against a visible trade-off or renunciation on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—transformation as bridge between potential and completion—emerges organically from seeds, leaves, and monuments without overt statement. The final monument (woven leaf-veins and seed hulls) offers a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in prior particulars. Subtext operates in the shifting meaning of sorting: maintenance becomes translation. "Mossy delight" blooms without sentimentality. The piece resists easy moralizing; Wren's transformation is neither wholly triumphant nor tragic, and the arbor's secrets remain infinite.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: elevated diction ("perpetually overcast realm," "slender probe tipped with a moonstone cabochon dust speck") matches Wren's devotional focus without slipping into clinical detachment. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, peak-beat phrasing leans abstract: "feeling mossy delight bloom in her chest like something long dormant finally finding sun" is figuratively dense but borders on generic uplift. Perceptual signature is clear—Wren notices weight, shell, vein-patterns—but under peak stress (the hush, the dissolution) the prose does not compress or fracture; it remains lyrically steady.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are strong; information density is high (each line advances atmosphere or stakes). Figurative language is purposeful but occasionally stacks: "edges blur, certainties soften" and "mossy delight bloom...like something long dormant finally finding sun" in close proximity. Template cadence appears twice: "She had sorted..." / "She had learned..." / "She used it to prod..." / "She understood, finally..." Each beat starts with subject-verb, flattening rhythm. No paraphrase loops, but the scaffold "She [verb]" recurs enough to trigger mild monotony. Sentence variety improves in the hush section. Opening and closing lines anchor well.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor and the sorting-as-devotion premise offer a fresh synthesis; the monument-building is specific and memorable. The twist—leaves encode transformation, not prophecy—grows from established pattern rather than late invention. However, the emotional arc (lonely sorter finds meaning) maps closely to template "hidden calling revealed" structures. The moonstone dissolution and instant perceptual upgrade feel convenient; transformation lacks friction or ambiguity that would deepen originality. Risk-taking in setting and voice elevates, but the resolution plays safe.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Wren is present throughout. Her choice to retrieve the probe and prod the leaf triggers the hush deepening. The final return to sorting with new sight is a decision, but it confirms rather than conflicts. Two beats (retrieve probe, build final monument) are driven by her action. Setup clear; middle and closure participation present; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The moonstone cabochon dust speck appears early (tool retrieval), is used to prod leaves (middle beat), and dissolves into her skin at closure, enabling transformation. Three beats, clear progression. However, its properties feel assigned for convenience (catches light "from sources that shouldn't exist," then grants vision). Irreplaceability moderate; cost tied to it (dissolution) is visible. Setup, development, closure all met.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Regional folklore frames Wren's belief and stakes early. It shapes her devotion and justifies her life's work. The twist—First Gardeners encoded transformation, not prophecy—directly alters her understanding and enables closure. Two beats (initial framing, hush revelation). Setup and closure clear; middle development implicit. Causal pressure moderate; the concept reweights but does not constrain tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Emerges transformed always" is asserted thematically and literalized in Wren's transformation. The trait manifests in the final third: she becomes "more fully herself" with moonstone eyes and leaf-reading touch. Closure hinges on it. However, it appears as destination rather than constraint during prior action; no visible tradeoff or cost tied to the trait until the hush. Setup implicit; closure participation strong; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prodding the leaf with the moonstone probe is the pivot: it triggers the hush deepening, reveals the transformation instructions, and leads directly to dissolution and change. Two distinct beats (prodding crimson-gold leaf, earlier use to trace vein-patterns). Causal pressure high; the action cannot be swapped without losing the mechanism of revelation. Setup, development, closure all present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Monument-building is seeded early (hundreds already built), demonstrated in examples (cairn of seeds, spiral of bark, tower of sap), and pays off in the final monument marking transformation. Three beats. The method grounds Wren's devotion and charges the closure image. However, it does not constrain tactics or create friction; it functions more as motif than mechanism. Setup and closure strong; middle presence static.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is anchored immediately and recurs: sorting tray, suspended walkways, monuments, volcanic soot, mist-fed roots. It supplies the hush (timeframe tied to place), the moonstone light, and the grey-to-vibrant shift at closure. The setting pressures Wren's isolation and enables her transformation. Setup, development (provides tools and conditions), and closure (reweighted perception) all clear. Irreplaceability high; cost tied to setting's constraints.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"The hush where past meets prophecy" is named early, dramatized in the middle (leaves fall slower, time pauses), and enables the transformation. Two beats. It tightens decision by creating the conditions for revelation. However, it functions more as atmospheric permission than tactical constraint; Wren does not race or choose against the clock. Setup and closure met; development moderate. Cost oblique.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Wren's desire to decode leaf messages is stated early, underlies her life's work, and drives the probe action. The hush scene dramatizes fulfillment. Two beats (initial framing, hush revelation and transformation). Friction is present: "she had to believe it, because otherwise...her life was just sorting." Cost of prior doubt visible; new understanding forecloses ignorance. Setup, development (shapes tool use), closure all clear.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Mossy delight" is named once late ("feeling mossy delight bloom in her chest") and echoed in "mossy and sweet" scent earlier. Tone is consistent—reverent, patient, luminous—but does not modulate sharply under the hush's pressure; it remains steady rather than charged. The final smile and "so much more" sustain the tone. Closure participation present but static. Setup moderate; middle implicit; payoff consistent but not transformative of prior material.</comment>
