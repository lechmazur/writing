<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal journey from designing permanent bonds to creating dissolving scaffolds shows clear motivation rooted in grief. The shift feels earned through concrete observation at the ravine. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract conceptual language ("translation from one state to another," "divergent path curving back toward meaning") that distances us from embodied emotional experience. The final choice to file the patent reads more as summary of transformation than a dramatized decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes clear orientation (polymer chemist at ravine, two years post-loss) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira moves from fighting loss to honoring connection, designing a dissolving membrane that embodies this shift. The cost is legible—she abandons fifteen years of pursuing permanent bonds. However, the three-month ellipsis to "first successful test" compresses the core struggle into summary, and the closure unit relies heavily on told realization rather than a final dramatized beat that tests the new stance. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the chrysalis and foam patterns braiding through, but the ending drifts toward explanation rather than charged image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The braided ravine is vividly rendered with functional detail: foam patterns traced for hours, three streams converging and separating, dark water and white lines in fractal geometries. The chrysalis structure's "architecture" directly informs the polymer design, making the object constrain her professional choice. The laboratory setting in the second half remains generic, but the ravine micro-setting charges both the insight and the final return, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment constrain choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding meaning after Elena's death through her work—is clear early. The ravine observation provides one meaningful tightening: Mira shifts from designing materials that "never let go" to creating temporary scaffolds. However, the three-month work montage and the successful test arrival feel summarized rather than pressure-tested on the page. No on-page obstacle or failed attempt forces a trade-off; the insight leads directly to success. The escalation reads more as conceptual deepening than contested agency under the Accumulative lens, meeting baseline but not high-band pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the chrysalis/foam/membrane braid: transformation rather than permanence, connection through separation. The piece resists overt moralizing until the final paragraphs, where "translated into every polymer bond that would help strangers heal" and "the braided ravine would be there tomorrow" tip toward thematic summary. The chrysalis shifts meaning across the story (mockery → evidence of translation → scaffold for the new design), providing non-literal resonance. However, "atone—not for causing Elena's death, which she hadn't" feels like authorial clarification rather than earned subtext, and the closing peace arrives without sufficient friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narration maintains stable third-person limited throughout with a distinct scientific-contemplative register: "molecules that had touched still resonating with that contact," "polymer chains she designed linked and released." Psychic distance modulates appropriately between the ravine reflection and lab precision. The prose occasionally drifts into workshop idiom ("symphonically minded," "divergent path," "generative") that reads more crafted than character-specific, but the overall texture remains coherent and the perceptual filter—noticing molecular patterns in natural phenomena—is consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "Separation was not erasure. Connection persisted in ways that transcended physical proximity" restates the same insight without added pressure. The phrase "divergent path" appears three times with similar framing. Template cadence emerges in the final section: "She had created something… She understood now… She had finally learned…" The figurative language mostly lands cleanly, though "loosened grief" and "grief loosens its grip finger by finger" feel slightly labored. Applying −0.6 for loops and template stems, though they don't obscure the closure effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The polymer-chemist-finds-insight-in-nature frame is familiar, and the grief-to-healing arc follows recognizable beats. The chrysalis as transformation symbol reads conventional. The specific synthesis—dissolving neural scaffold inspired by foam patterns and chrysalis architecture—offers a fresh technical angle, and the shift from permanent to temporary bonds provides non-obvious moral weight. However, the "symphonically minded daughter" and "fifteen years designing materials that bonded" feel like prompt-template particulars rather than lived detail that transforms the premise. The story executes its concept competently but doesn't take bold structural or perspectival risks.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's profession is integral: her fifteen-year focus on permanent bonds sets up the ironic reversal, the ravine observation translates directly into polymer design vocabulary, and the dissolving membrane embodies her professional and personal shift. The character drives the middle insight and the final patent filing. Early signal, two distinct beats (ravine + lab), closure participation, and cost (abandoning prior approach) all present. High causal pressure and irreplaceability push toward 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chrysalis appears in three beats: carried at the ravine as "mockery," studied on the workbench as "perfect record of transformation," and sits on the desk at closure "no longer empty but full." Its architecture directly informs the membrane design, constraining her professional choice. Early signal, development, and closure participation all satisfied. The shift from "empty" to "full" reweights meaning. However, the middle beat involves studying rather than a choice under pressure, and the final presence is more symbolic bookend than causal force. Strong integration but not indispensable—she could reach the same insight from foam alone.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Divergent path" is named three times and frames the emotional arc: Mira "had walked for two years was curving back toward meaning." It shapes the dominant stake—reconciling separation. However, it functions primarily as thematic label rather than on-page constraint. The insight doesn't hinge on the concept of divergence specifically; she could equally frame it as "wrong approach" or "blocked path." Present across beats and at closure, but the mechanics are metaphorical rather than tactical. Lyric reprise with thematic reweighting places it in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Symphonically minded" characterizes Elena and contrasts with Mira's data focus, priming the insight that merges their perspectives. It's referenced twice: initial description and the closing realization that "daughter's symphonically minded approach… was a gift." However, it never constrains an on-page choice or creates visible cost. The trait remains label-only, establishing backstory color but not driving action. Functional setup that enables thematic closure without middle development or tactical pressure. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development, adjusted slightly up for closure participation in the "merged" realization.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Atone" is named once explicitly in the final quarter: "This was how she would atone—not for causing Elena's death, which she hadn't, but for the years she had spent trying to design materials that defied loss." The membrane project enacts the atonement. However, the concept arrives late (past 40% mark) and resolves a guilt the story didn't dramatize as active obstacle earlier. The "not for causing" clause clarifies rather than complicates. Present at closure with thematic weight, but introduced too late and lacking mid-story pressure. Late arrival cap of 4.6 applies, lifted slightly for clear closure articulation and connection to the membrane's healing purpose.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The river-foam observation is the story's hinge: Mira watches "for hours," notices molecules "that had touched still resonating," and this generates the insight that "separation was not erasure." The method is signaled early (first scene at ravine), dramatized on the page with specific sensory detail (foam splitting/rejoining, fractal geometries), and directly enables the polymer design shift. The foam's "dance of contact and release" echoes in the polymer chains. Setup, development (the watching itself is the method), and payoff all present with high causal pressure and specificity. The mechanics matter and are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The braided ravine is named, described with functional detail (three streams converging, foam patterns, stone islands), and Mira returns to it in thought at closure: "The braided ravine would be there tomorrow, the foam still dancing." It supplies the core insight and its specific geometry (braiding, separation-with-trace) shapes the polymer design. Early signal, causal middle role, and closure reprise. However, the final mention is reflective rather than tactical—she's not there making a choice. Strong integration across all three gates with clear causal work, though the ending invocation is more thematic echo than active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"As the pieces fall into place" is used once as a transitional phrase marking Mira's multi-hour observation: "Mira watched for hours as the pieces fell into place—not all at once, but gradually." The phrase captures the accumulative insight process but doesn't function as live timeframe pressure. The three-month ellipsis to the successful test is the actual duration, but "as the pieces fall" doesn't track or tighten decisions—it's a metaphor for cognitive assembly. Single mention, no tactical constraint, ornamental rather than structural. Present but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The desire "to translate separation into connection" is Mira's articulated goal in the second half: "translating separation into connection rather than fighting against it." It drives the membrane design (temporary bridge allowing natural healing), shapes the emotional arc (accepting Elena's presence through rather than despite loss), and charges the closure ("translated into every polymer bond"). The motivation is dramatized through the ravine insight and the design work, with clear cost (abandoning permanent-bond research). Early framing as inability to "hold together," development through foam observation, and closure participation. High causal pressure and specificity, though the phrasing occasionally tips into thematic summary rather than lived friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Loosened grief" is named twice: "the way grief loosens its grip finger by finger" at the ravine and "her grief loosened into something that felt almost like peace" at closure. The tone modulates from "rational mind understood but her heart refused" to "not the absence of pain but its transformation into something generative." Coherent tonal arc that charges the final image and reflects accumulative pressure. However, the middle work section lacks embodied grief—it reads more as productive focus. The tone is present and purposeful but doesn't inflect every beat with equal pressure. Setup and payoff strong; middle development thinner. Lyric reprise with clear reweighting earns mid-6s.</comment>
