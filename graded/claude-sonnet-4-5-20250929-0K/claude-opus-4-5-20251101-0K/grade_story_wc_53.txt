<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and consistently filtered through scavenger pragmatism versus lost ambition. The ghost conversation dramatizes internal conflict through embodied opposition rather than summary. The final shift—"stop pretending I never was"—earns its weight through accumulated particulars (camera wheel, overheard fragment). Minor slip: the ghost's accusatory tone could have shown one more micro-contradiction before softening to avoid neat reversal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira reconfigures her stance toward ambition with visible cost (acknowledging fear rather than choice). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (kinetic lagoon, scavenger role, ghost). Causal lens holds: overheard fragment → new negotiation tactic → ghost's dissolution. One meaningful deepening (regret reframed from wisdom to fear) tightens options and forecloses pretense with felt cost in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon is vivid and purposeful: luminescent waters, phosphorescent spray, perpetual motion above cloudline. The camera wheel as micro-setting object charges the final image and constrains the negotiation (serrated edge worn smooth by circulation mirrors Mira's erosion). Spatial choreography is clean (edge of lagoon, ghost beside her, debris caught in currents). Minor cap: the frozen carousel horses receive descriptive attention but don't alter a present tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconcile with lost ambition/ghost) is signaled early and tightens once through the overheard-fragment tactic that shifts negotiation terms. The final acknowledgment forecloses pretense with visible cost: Mira can't become the ghost again but must own the past. Agency is decision (speak regret differently) that narrows options under accumulative pressure. One credible reversal (ghost smiles, dissolves) earned by protagonist choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: camera wheel's worn teeth, lagoon's perpetual motion, collected story fragments. The ending offers a resonant answer (broken wheels turn given the right current) without stating a moral, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in the ghost's shifting tone and Mira's pocket gesture. The overheard wisdom (person you stopped being) earns its deployment by altering tactics. Slight proximity risk: "ambition doesn't erode from wisdom, it erodes from fear" flirts with thesis statement but stays anchored in Mira's scavenger logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature (scavenger's eye for debris, temporal slippage). Dialogue feels natural, carries subtext, and advances the negotiation; the ghost's lines pursue accusation then release. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during memory, wider during lagoon description). Diction stays within Mira's pragmatic register. Minor slip: "chronologically confused" is asserted in narration; one more on-page temporal slip would have embodied it under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (camera wheel description does three jobs). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Clarity is consistent. Slight overwriting in the ghost's first line: "eyes that still believed the carousel would spin forever" is elevated but stays voice-coherent. The "fractured stillness" phrase in paragraph ~10 reads slightly purple against surrounding pragmatic texture but doesn't obscure causality. Propulsion is strong through dialogue beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon above cloudline and negotiation-with-ghost frame offer a fresh synthesis. The camera wheel as ambition token avoids cliché through specific detail (serrated teeth worn smooth). Emotional truth (fear masked as choice) feels earned rather than template. Slight derivative pressure: the "ghost of former self" and "collecting fragments" motifs are widely used; transformation through scavenger pragmatism and overheard-story mechanics adds specificity but doesn't fully escape the archetype.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present early (scavenger willing to wade into lagoon), drives two beats (collecting fragments, final decision to stop pretending), and shapes closure (decides to use collected words differently). Causal pressure: scavenger role enables fragment-collection method and final stance shift. Specific cost: acknowledges fear, pockets wheel, commits to movement. Strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph ~3), handled twice (turned in palm, pocketed at end), and charged at closure ("even broken wheels turn"). Specificity matters: serrated edge worn smooth by lagoon mirrors Mira's erosion. Missing middle development: between discovery and pocketing, the wheel is discussed but not physically used to enable a tactic. Reaches 6.4 via early signal, closure charge, and irreplaceability but capped by lack of middle causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Frames the story (carousel stopped, ambitions erode), shapes stakes (regret versus survival), and drives the negotiation tactic (acknowledge erosion came from fear not wisdom). Causal pressure: concept narrows options (can't become ghost again) and forecloses pretense path with cost. Closure linkage strong: final stance depends on this exact concept. Present in three beats (setup, negotiation, resolution). High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Label appears twice ("chronologically confused" narration, "time moved strangely" lagoon description) and primes the temporal slippage in memory ("three days ago, or perhaps three years"). Does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost; remains atmospheric rather than causal. Reaches mid-band via setup and thematic echo but capped by lack of middle choice pressure or closure participation where the trait alters a tactic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drives the major turn: Mira's reframed regret ("not that I stopped being you... pretended stopping was a choice") shifts negotiation terms and earns the ghost's dissolution. Causal pressure high: this exact action enables closure. Present in three beats (prior failed negotiations mentioned, new attempt, resolution). Cost is visible (acknowledgment forecloses pretense). Irreplaceable: no other action would produce this ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Signaled early (collecting fragments for months), enables the tactic (overheard old man's words about regret), and shapes the climax (assembled something else entirely). Mechanics matter: fragments give Mira new negotiation language. Present in three beats (setup, old man's quote deployment, final realization about assembly). Causal pressure: method enables the turn. Slight swappability: another collection method could work with edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Present early and throughout (edge, luminescent waters, debris, spray). Shapes two choices: scavenger role depends on lagoon's perpetual motion; final decision mirrors lagoon's movement ("never stopped moving"). Supplies the core resource (debris/fragments). Charges closure image strongly (waters churn, Mira decides to move). Micro-setting (camera wheel in lagoon) alters tactics. High specificity (kinetic, above cloudline) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Frames the story (carousel stopped three days/years ago) and establishes the present pressure (after ambition ended). Shapes one choice: the halt created scavenger necessity. Appears in setup and closure (carousel remains still, but lagoon/Mira won't stop). Reaches upper-mid via framing and closure reprise but capped by lack of live clock that tightens a middle decision. Time is more backdrop than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Frames the story, drives all three negotiation beats (prior failures, new attempt with regret, ghost's dissolution), and owns the closure. Desire is dramatized through dialogue and micro-choices (holding camera wheel, speaking slowly, pocketing wheel). Friction between want (reconcile) and cost (acknowledge fear) is visible. Irreplaceable: no other motivation produces this ending. Strong causal pressure and closure integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Coherent through turns: quiet philosophical dialogue, kinetic lagoon imagery, ghost's translucence. Modulates with pressure (colder during ghost approach, phosphorescent spray during turn, dissolution at release). Charges the final image (still carousel versus moving lagoon and Mira). Diction supports tone ("fractured stillness between them grew wider"). Reaches 7.3 via coherence and closure charge but lacks one more distinct modulation beat to reach higher band.</comment>
