<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is established early and her perceptual gift drives the discovery sequence. However, her choices feel more observational than decisive—she follows the silo's memory, finds the tapestry, and understands her purpose without significant internal conflict or competing impulses. The final "understood her purpose with sudden clarity" moment reads as epiphany rather than earned contradiction. Embodiment is thin; we see her trailing fingers and pressing palms but little visceral interiority under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers discoveries (diary fragments → tapestry → axis revelation) to reweight the premise. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the displaced axis shifts from consequence to cause, and Maren's role crystallizes from collector to restorer. The cost is conceptual (the weight of restoring an axis) and felt in "the weight of an axis waiting to be restored," though the price remains more atmospheric than viscerally limiting. Orientation anchors quickly (silo library, Maren, post-Silence world). One meaningful deepening occurs when the tapestry reveals the axis predates the Silence, reconfiguring the stakes from preservation to correction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The silo is vividly particular—bronze quiet, curved concrete walls, spiral staircase, storage alcoves—and its history (grain, missiles, Archive) roots the setting in lived use. The tapestry fragment constrains the final choice by providing "the first physical proof," making Maren's eastward walk causally tied to this discovery. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered: "bronze quiet," "particular bronze of ancient gold thread," "permanent twilight." The micro-setting (alcove behind crates) delivers the pivotal object, charging the closure image with spatial memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Maren collects wall-stories to "reconstruct a map" toward correcting the displaced axis. Pressure accumulates through layered discoveries—diary, tapestry, axis revelation—culminating in her understanding that "the axis could be corrected." The tightening is meaningful: the tapestry proves the axis is ancient and locatable, narrowing her mission from vague collection to targeted search. However, the escalation is cumulative rather than agonistic; no live opposition or trade-off forces a difficult choice. The cost is more existential weight than visible forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the world's tilt, dreams ending, weavers encoding warnings, historians as mapmakers. The tapestry's dragons "guarding" the displacement avoid overt symbolism by functioning as encoded data rather than metaphor. The final image—"Maren carried the weight of an axis waiting to be restored"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the premise without moralizing. However, "She collected the stories walls had heard not to preserve history but to reconstruct a map" edges toward thesis statement. The piece resists tidy resolution while maintaining clarity; the "bronze quiet" motif subtly charges the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "sensitively perceptive in ways that made destruction unnecessary," "the walls of the silo began to hum with recognition." Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "bronze quiet," "the particular bronze of ancient gold thread," "permanent twilight." Free indirect style is clean—Maren's interiority filters all observations. However, "She was an odd historian, even by the standards of those who remained" reads slightly external for deep limited. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: close during the tapestry discovery, broader for world-building context. No dialogue present to evaluate. Compression during the discovery sequence maintains momentum without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with purposeful rhythm: "The silo library stood in bronze quiet" anchors voice and stakes efficiently. Information density is high—each paragraph advances discovery or world-logic. However, mild scaffold appears: "She descended to the lower levels, following the silo's memory like a thread through a labyrinth" restates pursuit already implied. "The tapestry fragment was smaller than her forearm" is precise, but "the particular bronze of ancient gold thread" repeats "bronze" from the opening without reweighting. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but some lines lean expository: "The displaced axis wasn't a consequence of the Silence—it was the cause" tells rather than dramatizing the realization. Final image "In the bronze quiet of a world without dreams, Maren carried the weight of an axis waiting to be restored" effectively recharges the opening motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—historian who reads wall-memories in a post-dream world—offers a fresh synthesis of psychometry and apocalyptic setting. The displaced axis as pre-existing cause rather than consequence is a non-obvious reversal. However, the execution follows a familiar discovery arc: clue (diary) → artifact (tapestry) → revelation → quest continuation. The "odd historian" and "stories walls had heard" risk quirky ornament, though they're tied to stakes. Elise as prior scholar who also discovered the pattern adds depth but remains functional. The dragons-as-guardians trope is transformed by making them data encoders rather than literal creatures. Risk-taking is moderate; the structure is safe, the closure clear but not bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout and her perceptual gift enables every discovery. She makes two on-page choices: probing the silo's memory (middle) and walking east with the tapestry (end). However, both choices feel determined by accumulated knowledge rather than competing desires. She "understood her purpose with sudden clarity" but does not weigh alternatives or pay visible cost for her decision. The character drives beats but does not face meaningful friction or trade-offs that would demonstrate agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tapestry appears in setup (Elise's diary mentions it), is discovered and handled mid-story ("smaller than her forearm," sensory detail), and directly enables the closure (first physical proof, packed into satchel, shapes her eastward walk). It constrains the ending by validating the axis is real and locatable. The dragons' positioning "around something. A pattern. An axis that shouldn't exist" provides unique data that no other object could. Causal work is strong across three beats; cost connection is implicit (the weight of carrying proof).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The displaced axis is signaled early ("the world operated on a tilted premise") and reweighted at closure (cause, not consequence; can be corrected). It shapes Maren's dominant stake—reconstructing a map to find and restore it. However, it remains conceptual; the axis does not alter tactics or impose physical constraint on the page. The revelation that it predates the Silence is a meaningful turn, but the axis itself is more thematic frame than active pressure. Present across beats but primarily as premise rather than as obstacle or resource that changes choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Maren's sensitivity is shown enabling multiple actions: listening to paper's memory (she "simply listened to what the paper remembered"), pressing her palm to concrete to feel Elise's voice echo, and detecting the tapestry's location via the silo's hum. It constrains her method (she doesn't read text; she listens to objects) and enables the discovery sequence. However, no visible cost or trade-off is tied to the trait on the page—she doesn't exhaust herself, misread signals, or suffer from sensory overload. The trait shapes beats but lacks friction or price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Probe" is established as Maren's core method early ("learning to probe its particular resonance") and recurs: she probes the silo's memory, the paper, the concrete walls. The action drives the middle discovery beat (finding the tapestry) and enables the closure realization. The verb is specific and irreplaceable—"search" or "examine" would not capture the psychometric method. However, the action itself is smooth and frictionless; we never see a failed probe or a moment where probing costs her something, limiting the causal pressure it can generate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries are introduced early in the second paragraph ("a previous archivist had abandoned half-burned diaries found in a fireplace") and Maren listens to them to learn about Elise and the tapestry. This method shapes one key beat—accessing Elise's discovery—and the fire damage justifies why Maren's perceptual gift is necessary. However, the diaries function as exposition delivery; their burned state doesn't constrain Maren or create friction, and they could be replaced with another damaged artifact. Present and functional but not causally essential beyond setup.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The silo is present from the opening line, its concrete curves hold memories "differently than brick or wood," and its storage alcove supplies the tapestry. The setting enables Maren's method (probing the silo's absorbed stories) and directly shapes the middle beat (following memory to the alcove). The bronze quiet motif recurs at closure, recharging the opening image. The silo's history (grain, missiles, Archive) roots the space in lived use. However, the setting does not constrain Maren's choices—she moves freely through it without obstacle. It functions as resource and atmospheric anchor more than crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The post-Silence timeframe is established in the opening ("when the last human dream was dreamt") and colors the atmosphere ("permanent twilight"). It provides conceptual stakes—Maren's work aims to reverse this condition. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Maren "spent three seasons learning" and now walks east without deadline. The ending's "bronze quiet of a world without dreams" reprises the frame, but the timeframe itself is backdrop rather than clock. Present and thematically coherent but does not pressure tactics or choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Maren's desire to collect wall-stories is stated early and demonstrated throughout: she listens to the silo, the paper, the walls. The closure reframes this motivation—she collects "not to preserve history but to reconstruct a map"—adding depth and purpose. However, the motivation is never conflicted; no moment shows Maren tempted to abandon the work, doubting her method, or choosing this goal over a competing desire. It drives the plot but lacks friction or visible cost tied to the wanting itself. The realization at closure elevates the motivation but does not dramatize internal struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" appears in the opening line, recurs as sensory anchor ("bronze of ancient gold thread"), and returns in the final paragraph to close the frame. The tone is contemplative and elegiac, coherent across discovery beats, and modulates subtly—intimate during the tapestry handling, expansive when describing the world's tilt. It charges the final image by linking the silo's metal hush to the larger post-dream stillness. However, the tone remains relatively static; no sharp modulation under pressure or dissonance that then resolves. Strong thematic integration but limited dynamic range.</comment>
