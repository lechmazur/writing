<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's interior is sharply rendered through embodied contradiction—performing trauma for money while mourning authentic loss, carving pawns by firelight as a benevolent-ruthless gesture. The final choice to walk out spelling "remember" and leave the pawns behind is earned by her winter's work and felt accumulation of grief. Minor slip: the camps backstory is told efficiently but remains slightly expository rather than filtering all present perception through that lens. The micro-choices (placing each pawn, naming them) credibly alter her stance from purgatory-dweller to historian-complete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (footstep-spelling, missing pawns, carved replacements) and a cadence shift at the end when Vera walks out rather than circles again. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): she unbinds from the performance loop, restores the board, and begins her true work; cost is legible in the forfeited drill income and the solitary winter of carving. Orientation anchors cleanly (whispering gallery, interregnum, Vera alone) by the second paragraph. One tightening deepens when she walks her own name, signaling the turn from memorial-keeper to self-liberator.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The whispering gallery's acoustic property (amplifying absence, catching footsteps) constrains Vera's ritual and charges the final departure when her steps spell "remember" across the threshold. The chessboard's missing pawns function as micro-setting, pressuring her carving project and the thematic reconfiguration at closure. Sensory detail is selective—marble, light fragments, winter cold implied through firelight carving—without tourist excess. Spatial choreography is clean: curved walls, center table, main arch exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: unbind from performed grief and document the small gestures that official histories erase. One meaningful tightening when Vera walks her own name, narrowing options from endless memorial circuits to authorship and departure. The carved pawns are a visible cost (winter labor, solitary focus) that alters the game-state and her stance. Agency is renunciation and endurance—she survives the drill economy, then foreclosed that path by leaving the palace with her true work begun. No antagonist required; pressure accumulates through her internal contradiction and the acoustic void.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: footstep-spelling, teacup angles, wall-tapping, embroidered messages, and the pawns themselves embody "historian of small gestures" without stating a thesis. The chessboard shifts from benevolent-ruthless symbol to restored memorial, reweighting the opening image. The final departure and carved names offer a non-literal answer to whether the expendable masses can be remembered when power erases them. Subtext operates in "luminous absence," "nomadic penumbra," and the irony of performing real suffering; no sermonizing intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited with tight interiority; Vera's perceptual signature is consistent—she reads gestures (teacup angle, pawn absence) as communicative acts, filtering the palace through survivor's lens. Diction is controlled and purposeful: "benevolently ruthless," "nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence" feel voice-motivated rather than ornamental. No dialogue present (correctly, given the empty gallery). Psychic distance is stable; the shift to naming herself is motivated by accumulation, not arbitrary. One minor register slip: "authentic trauma made the simulations more convincing" reads slightly expository in an otherwise embodied paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high—most sentences layer setting, character history, and thematic image without padding. Rhythm varies purposefully: longer accumulative paragraphs for backstory, shorter beats for the pawn-placement and exit. One paraphrase loop: "She had been benevolently ruthless with herself" in the penultimate paragraph restates the chessboard observation without fresh pressure, costing ~−0.3. "Nomadic penumbra" and "luminous absence" are elevated but voice-coherent; no mixed metaphors. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence runs. Minor scaffold in "This was why she came. This was why she had petitioned…" (anaphora that flirts with redundancy but serves emphasis).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of crisis-actor survivor + footstep-spelling + pawns-as-memorial is specific and non-obvious, transforming the "unremembered war victim" trope through embodied ritual and the interregnum frame. The benevolently-ruthless chessboard and Vera's profession create fresh moral calculus. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure (heavy reflection, delayed micro-turn) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the ending feels inevitable in hindsight. One friction: the "historian of small gestures" framing occasionally abstracts into thesis ("the ways ordinary people had signaled love and resistance") rather than staying purely in image, lowering the band ceiling slightly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's dual role (crisis actor + real survivor) is signaled early, pressures her winter carving project (she performs grief for money to fund her true documentation), and the irony charges her final unbinding when she walks out. Present in setup (paragraph 3), development (the purgatory loop she must break), and payoff (she stops performing, begins writing). Causal: the profession funds her palace access and her skill makes the simulations "invaluable," but her choice to leave forecloses that income with visible cost. Two beats (drill work, final departure) plus closure linkage; irreplaceable—no generic "survivor" would carry the performing-pain irony.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The chessboard appears in paragraph 4 (setup within first third), is handled at the climax when Vera places sixteen carved pawns one by one (development and payoff), and its restored state is the final memorial image that testifies after she leaves. Three beats: initial observation of missing pawns, her winter carving motivated by their absence, and the placement that transforms the board into monument. Causally indispensable—removing it collapses the historian project and the benevolent-ruthless paradox. The object's missing pawns constrain her carving goal and the final image reweights the opening symbol. Cost: winter labor, naming each piece, the risk that the new monarch may discard them.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Nomadic penumbra" is named once in the penultimate paragraph as label-only summary of her drill-to-drill existence "following the catastrophe," then claimed as resolved ("had found its home"). Not signaled in setup; does not constrain tactics or shape mid-story choices. Functional as thematic echo but swappable with "wandering in grief's shadow" or similar. The actual narrative work is done by the crisis-actor profession and the footstep ritual, not the penumbra concept itself. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Benevolently ruthless" is applied to the king's pawn-removal (paragraph 4) as "a kindness wrapped in cruelty, or perhaps the reverse," then reprised in the penultimate paragraph when Vera applies it to herself ("surviving by whatever means necessary, performing pain to pay for the privilege of documenting it"). Setup and payoff present; it reweights her own choices as mirroring the monarch's paradox. Development is weak—the trait does not constrain an on-page mid-story action with visible cost, only frames retrospective self-assessment. Lyric reprise without causal pressure in the middle; eligible for low-6s but capped by the missing development beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Unbind" is named explicitly when Vera walks her own name ("It was time to unbind herself from the performance of grief"), drives the departure action, and the final paragraph confirms she has stopped performing to write the real history. Present in setup as implicit stake (the purgatory loop), crystallized at the turn, and completed at payoff. Two beats (recognition, execution) and closure participation. Causal necessity: removing "unbind" would require rewriting the climax, but the concept itself is slightly abstract—"stop performing and leave" would convey the same turn. High-7s for strong closure linkage but not fully irreplaceable in mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Footstep-spelling is introduced in paragraph 2 (learned in the camps, traced in frozen mud), used throughout her gallery walks (spelling "Miriam," "Josef," "little Anya"), and pays off when she walks "Vera" then "remember" at the exit. Three beats (camp origin, daily ritual, climactic self-naming and threshold message) across setup, development, and payoff. Mechanics matter: the method connects her survival skill to her present memorial work and charges the final departure. One friction: the reader never sees her correct the path mid-step or deal with interruption—it functions smoothly without cost, slightly lowering irreplaceability. Still, removing it would lose the embodied communication theme and the camps-to-palace continuity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The whispering gallery's acoustic curve is essential: it amplifies her footsteps (enabling the spelling ritual), amplifies absence (thematic), and the dome's light scatter marks the turn when she completes her circuit and places the pawns. Present in title and paragraph 1 (setup), the acoustics enable her daily practice (development), and the architecture witnesses her departure (payoff). Micro-setting constraint: the curved walls give the footstep-spelling its spatial logic. Removal would break the story's central ritual. One limitation: the gallery's emptiness during the interregnum is convenient—no one interrupts, lowering felt cost slightly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The interregnum (three months of empty palace during succession deliberations) is signaled in the opening line, explains Vera's access to the abandoned wing, and the penultimate paragraph notes "The interregnum would end eventually. Power would settle into new hands." Setup and payoff present; frames the window of opportunity. Development weak: the succession crisis does not tighten her timeline or force a mid-story choice with cost. The timeframe enables rather than pressures—she could have stayed longer or left earlier without on-page consequence. Functional but replaceable with "palace renovation" or similar access-granting excuse.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To become the historian of small gestures" is stated in paragraph 5, drives her notebooks and carving project (development), and the final paragraph confirms she will "write the history that mattered: not of kings and councils, but of teacups and tapped walls and wooden pawns." Setup, development (winter carving, notebook work), and payoff across three beats. Desire is dramatized through the pawn restoration and contested by the drill income she must forfeit. Cost is visible: solitary winter labor, leaving paid work, uncertain reception by the new monarch. Causal pressure high—the motivation generates the core action and closure image. One friction: the phrase "historian of small gestures" itself is slightly abstract; the notebooks and pawns do the real work.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" appears twice: paragraph 6 ("the luminous absence of all those voices the war had silenced, somehow present in their very negation") and the penultimate paragraph ("And in that luminous absence, Vera finally began"). The tone is coherent—elegiac, charged with paradox (presence-in-void, kindness-wrapped-cruelty)—and modulates appropriately when Vera shifts from circling to departing. Setup (the whispering gallery amplifies absence), development (the missing pawns as luminous void), payoff (she begins in that space). The oxymoron charges the final image by reweighting loss as foundation. One friction: the phrase risks ornamental lyricism; the chessboard and acoustic void do the tonal work, "luminous absence" labels it. Still, the reprise at closure and the consistent paradox-structure (benevolently ruthless, nomadic penumbra) justify mid-to-high 6s.</comment>
