<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mirelle's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with her net-mending philosophy and seventeen years of observation grounding motivation. Her choice to remain silent about her discoveries reflects a coherent value hierarchy ("wanted only to appreciate hidden effort"), and the grandmother's whisk provides embodied emotional depth. However, the protagonist remains primarily observational; the final descent with the whisk pressed to her heart is more gesture than choice that forecloses a path with felt cost, limiting the grade despite strong sensory embodiment and consistent internal logic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with layered patterns (firefly rhythms, net-mending, grandmother's legacy) and maintains spatial coherence on the parapet. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration through the charged final image of descent with the whisk, but the cost remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The orientation is clean by the first paragraph, and the firefly-whistle communion provides a meaningful deepening, yet the ending's reconfiguration feels more meditative than decisive, and the cost of her silence never becomes urgent or painful enough to fully charge the final moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The whispering parapet is vividly realized through concrete sensory detail (gargoyles dripping in rhythm, wind through crenellations) and the setting constrains action—Mirelle must climb to observe, the rain's aftermath creates visible air currents. The bamboo whisk functions as micro-setting, its silhouette revealing invisible currents and enabling the firefly interaction. The final rain returning "softly" as she descends charges the closure image with purposeful atmosphere, and the coastal village context grounds her occupation without excess exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mirelle's desire to witness and appreciate hidden effort—is signaled early and sustained. The firefly's response to her whistle provides one meaningful deepening that validates seventeen years of observation. However, the pressure remains largely internal and contemplative; there is no moment where her choice to remain silent costs her something immediate or where external forces test her commitment. The piece accumulates texture rather than escalating conflict, and while this fits the Accumulative lens, the lack of visible trade-off or foreclosed path limits the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the grandmother's fifty years of unacknowledged tea preparation, spiders' webs informing net techniques, mathematical sequences woven into fishing nets. The final image of carrying forward "the hidden effort of all those who labor in beautiful obscurity" answers the thematic question without stating a moral. The phrase "demure audacity" slightly edges toward abstraction, and the rain's final understanding ("as if it too understood") risks minor sentimentality, but the accumulation of specific workers and unwitnessed grace creates genuine resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains stable distance with strong perceptual signature—Mirelle notices patterns, rhythms, and mathematics where others see randomness. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("scintillatingly somber," "infinitesimal lanterns"), and the prose modulates appropriately from technical observation to emotional weight. Minor register drift appears in phrases like "universe's tendency toward both entropy and elegant repair" which reads slightly elevated for moment-to-moment narration, and the voice occasionally tips toward essay-like meditation rather than immediate experience under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentences vary in rhythm and structure, information density is high (the whisk serves memory, measurement, and communion), and no paraphrase loops appear. The opening gargoyle image anchors voice immediately. However, "scintillatingly somber" and "infinitesimal lanterns" push toward purple territory without clear voice motivation, and the phrase "beauty that ached because it acknowledged how much of the world's grace went unwitnessed" edges into abstraction during a high-pressure beat. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly throughout the ascent, observation, and descent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of net-mending, firefly communication, and intergenerational memory feels specific and earned, avoiding template plots. The idea that Mirelle weaves mathematical sequences into nets to attract bioluminescent fish species transforms the observer role into subtle agency. The framing around "hidden effort" and unwitnessed labor offers a fresh angle on solitude and discovery. Risk is present in the quiet, observational structure, and the choice to publish nothing avoids the conventional recognition arc, though the premise of patient solitary observation has some kinship with contemplative-scientist narratives.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mirelle appears throughout and her seventeen years of tracking set up the climactic whistle-firefly communion. Her choice to remain silent and "let the mystery remain mysterious" shapes the ending's stance. However, her role is primarily observational; the key turn (firefly responding) happens to her rather than through a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She conducts the fireflies with the whisk and descends, but these are ritual gestures rather than choices under pressure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The bamboo tea whisk appears in the satchel, is held against firefly lights to reveal air currents, receives a firefly landing, conducts the insects during the moon-path tracing, and is pressed to her heart during descent—five distinct touches across setup, middle use, and closure. Its silhouette enables the air-current discovery, and the grandmother's legacy charges it emotionally. However, it could be replaced with another inherited object with minor edits; its specific properties (tines worn smooth, bamboo material) do not uniquely enable the plot turn.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Hidden patterns shape the entire premise: Mirelle maps firefly illuminations against moon phases, recognizes their response to vibrations, weaves mathematical sequences into nets. The concept drives her seventeen-year observation and the climactic firefly-whistle communion, where the firefly "adjusted its rhythm to match her whistle" validates the hidden communication. The nets holding her secrets and the fishermen's unaware benefit demonstrate consequences. The concept is integral to stakes and tactics, not merely thematic decoration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Scintillatingly somber" appears once during the whistle moment: "a beauty that ached because it acknowledged how much of the world's grace went unwitnessed." The trait describes the emotional tone but does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost. It functions as atmospheric coloring rather than a decision point or tactical element. The phrase itself edges toward abstraction without visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The whistle is prepared (grandmother's melody), executed at the key turn ("began to whistle, soft and low"), and directly causes the firefly to "adjust its rhythm to match her whistle," validating seventeen years of theory. She whistles "one final note" before descent, watched by responsive fireflies. Removing the whistle would collapse the communion and proof. However, another sound-based method (humming, singing) could serve with minor adjustments; the whistle itself is not irreplaceable, though the action is central.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Moon paths are signaled early ("following moon paths through the night sky to predict where the swarms would gather") and used actively when "the moon emerged" and Mirelle "traced its path with her grandmother's whisk, conducting the fireflies." The method connects tracking to present action. However, the mechanics are somewhat vague—how moon paths guide firefly behavior is asserted rather than demonstrated with consequence. The method appears in setup and closure but does not visibly constrain a middle choice or create a failure that must be worked around.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The whispering parapet is introduced in the title phrase, earned its name from wind through crenellations, provides elevation necessary for observation, and its wet stone and broken structure create the acoustic and visual conditions for the firefly experiment. The setting's moisture and whispers merge with Mirelle's whistle to create the "scintillatingly somber" moment. The tower stairs frame descent, and the parapet "whispered something that sounded almost like gratitude" at a key beat. The setting is integral to action and atmosphere, shaping where and how the communion occurs.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Firefly season frames the entire narrative ("she had been tracking their patterns for seventeen years," "every night until the firefly season ended"), provides the recurring observation window, and the insects' presence enables the climactic test. The timeframe creates a rhythm of return ("tomorrow night...and the night after") and signals an ending boundary. However, the season does not tighten a decision within this specific night; no countdown or deadline forces a choice. It establishes context and will recur, but does not create urgency on this page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to "appreciate hidden effort" is dramatized through grandmother's fifty unacknowledged years, Mirelle's choice to publish nothing, speaking theories to nets, and weaving sequences fishermen won't notice. The firefly communion fulfills the desire to "be the one witness who noticed what the world did when it thought no one was watching." The ending's choice to "let the mystery remain mysterious" enacts the motivation with visible cost—forgoing recognition. Friction between wanting validation and choosing obscurity creates texture, though the cost could press harder.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Demure audacity" is named once ("smiled with demure audacity, the expression of someone who knew she had discovered something profound and chose to keep it gentle") and informs the tonal balance throughout: bold seventeen-year tracking and net-weaving experiments paired with silence and self-effacement. The tone modulates appropriately—technical observation, emotional weight during whistle, quiet satisfaction at closure. However, the explicit label in the final third tells rather than embodies, and the tone could be inferred without the phrase, suggesting it decorates more than it constrains.</comment>
