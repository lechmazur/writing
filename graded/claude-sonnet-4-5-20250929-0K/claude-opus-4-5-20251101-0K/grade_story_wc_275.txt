<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal contradiction between inherited violence and chosen pacifism shows through the knife-reach moment, but the transformation feels asserted more than earned—we see her father's training surface, then watch her "choose differently" in a single gesture without sustained pressure testing that choice. The soldier's arrival provides an opportunity but his characterization ("frightened boy by his eyes") leans toward label rather than embodied complexity. Backstory anchors present choices adequately (father's execution, the insignia underfoot), but the reflective density approaches the upper BRR limit without always tilting present stance through micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered images (roses, dome, sandbag scrap) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira's practice absorbs the fleeing soldier, reweighting "hunt" from violence to hope. Orientation is clear by the opening lines. The cost is conceptual and relational—she extends mercy to a Sovereignty soldier—but the price feels more thematic than viscerally tested on the page; the soldier weeps and sleeps without resistance or complication that would sharpen the stakes of her choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass dome functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: it filters harsh light, creates the "tranquil blaze," and houses the practice that defines Mira's stance. Sensory detail is purposeful (copper-tinted soil, rosewater, smoke curling from distant ruins) and the spatial choreography remains coherent. The dome's enclosure charges the final image—sanctuary against chaos—meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice or charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sustaining pacifist practice amid post-tower chaos—is signaled early and deepens when the soldier arrives, forcing Mira to enact her values under pressure. The knife-reach moment provides a micro-reversal that narrows options (violence vs. mercy), and her choice to tend him reweights the opening premise. However, the soldier's compliance is frictionless; he weeps and accepts care without resistance, so the tightening lacks a visible cost that would elevate escalation into the high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—growth without conquest, radical tending—emerges organically from Mira's actions and the dome's function rather than assertion. The sandbag scrap's transformation (ballast → seed pouch) and the final pivot ("what she hunted was hope") offer a resonant answer to the premise without moralizing. The "tranquil blaze" paradox charges the thematic question throughout. Minor slip: "what she hunted was hope" edges toward thematic echo, but it lands as a reprise of "bounty hunter's daughter" logic rather than a prompt-label, so the cost is minimal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly; Mira's perceptual signature (sensing "subtle tremors of emotion in living things") colors description and choice. Diction remains character-bound with purposeful elevation ("engraved quiet," "inculcating plants with values") that feels voice-motivated rather than authorial intrusion. Minor slips: "senselessly perceptive" and "tranquil blaze" are named too directly rather than dramatized through perception alone, and a few filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") appear where immediacy could be tighter under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop conceptually: "continuity through chaos" appears twice in near-identical form, and "patient as petals, steady as roots" at the close feels decorative rather than propulsive. Template cadence in backstory paragraphs ("He'd wanted... Instead, she'd inherited...") and minor filter-verb stacks ("seemed," "felt," "understanding that") in the soldier sequence dull immediacy. The final paragraph's stacked metaphors ("patient as petals, steady as roots, drinking deep from hidden wells") border on purple without adding causal weight. These artifacts don't obscure closure but prevent high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pacifist-daughter-of-bounty-hunter premise is familiar, but the glass-dome rose farm and "inculcating plants with values" provide a fresh inflection that avoids generic execution. The sandbag-scrap transformation (weight released → seed vessel) and "tranquil blaze" paradox synthesize the core tension inventively. However, the fallen-tower backdrop and fleeing-soldier arrival feel like stock post-dystopia beats; swapping the Sovereignty Tower for any oppressive regime would require only minor edits, suggesting the world particulars are not fully irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout, frames the opening, and her pacifist stance is tested when the soldier arrives. Her choice to sheathe the knife and tend him (rather than threaten or turn him away) creates the story's key turn and shapes the closure image (soldier sleeping among roses). She appears in three functional beats: the opening meditation, the knife moment, and the tending sequence. The cost—extending mercy to a Sovereignty soldier after her father's execution—is conceptual but legible. However, the choice feels inevitable rather than genuinely conflicted; no competing option is given weight on the page, so the turn is clean but not surprising.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sandbag scrap appears in two beats: the backstory reflection where Mira recalls its arrival with her father's effects, and again in the penultimate paragraph when she touches it while thinking of "weight released, of seeds waiting to become gardens." Its transformation (ballast → seed pouch) reweights the father's legacy and supports the theme, but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page—it functions as a symbolic anchor rather than a causal agent. Present in setup and reprise but absent from the middle escalation; the lyric-resonance allowance applies, placing it in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Engraved quiet" is named once in the soldier sequence ("The engraved quiet of the dome wrapped around them both") but does not shape stakes or tactics—it describes atmosphere rather than constraining action. The concept echoes thematically (the dome as sanctuary, the practice of tending), but the exact phrase is ornamental, not causal. Late first appearance (past midpoint) and label-only use trigger the missing-middle cap of 3.4; the thematic echo lifts it slightly but cannot escape the mid-4s without demonstrated pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Senselessly perceptive" is named early and linked to Mira's ability to "feel the subtle tremors of emotion in living things." It enables her to read the soldier's "exhaustion, his shame, his desperate hope" and informs her choice to offer care. However, the trait is asserted more than demonstrated—we are told she senses emotions, but the narration does not show misreadings, ambiguity, or cost tied to hyper-perception (e.g., overwhelm, misjudgment). Present in setup and applied in one beat (the soldier's arrival), but no visible tradeoff, placing it in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sheathe action is the story's clearest on-page turn: Mira's hand moves instinctively toward the knife, then she stops and sheathes it instead, "a deliberate rejection of the impulse." This micro-reversal redefines her options (violence vs. mercy) and directly shapes the ending, where the soldier sleeps among the roses. The action is irreplaceable—swapping it for another gesture would dilute the inherited-violence motif. Present in setup (knife at her belt), middle turn (the sheathe), and implicit in closure (the soldier's safety). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage place it solidly in the 7–8.4 band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Inculcating plants with values" is introduced early (Mira "channeling that gift deliberately, inculcating plants with values she wished the world would learn") and frames her practice, but the mechanics are vague and the method does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure. The roses' thorns "softened slightly beneath her touch, or perhaps she only imagined it"—the uncertainty undercuts causal weight. The method recurs thematically (teaching roses compassion) but does not shape the soldier encounter or the ending. Present in setup, absent from middle escalation, and only echoed at closure; functional but replaceable, mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm is introduced in the opening lines, anchors all action, and supplies the story's central resource: filtered light that creates the "tranquil blaze," a controlled environment that allows Mira's practice, and a physical sanctuary that the fleeing soldier seeks. The dome's entrance grinding open triggers the story's key turn, and the final image (soldier sleeping among roses, dome "blazing tranquilly in the desert light") charges closure. The setting is irreplaceable—the glass, the roses, the desert context all constrain and enable Mira's choices. Strong setup, middle involvement, and closure participation with high specificity place it in the upper 7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the tower falls" frames the entire story: the tower fell on Tuesday, Mira began teaching roses by Wednesday, smoke still curls from the ruins, survivors are fleeing. The timeframe creates urgency (the world is in flux, refugees will arrive) and the soldier's arrival dramatizes that pressure. However, the time window is loose—no ticking clock tightens decisions within the scene itself. Present in setup, implied in the soldier's arrival, and echoed in the closing meditation ("the tower had fallen"). The time reweights the stakes but does not alter tactics beat-to-beat, placing it in the low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To weave continuity through chaos" is named explicitly ("the practice centered her, weaving continuity through chaos in the only way she knew how") and dramatized through Mira's tending, her choice to welcome the soldier, and the closing image of the dome standing amid the burning world. The desire is coherent and shapes her actions, but it is told more than tested—no moment forces Mira to choose between continuity and another competing want (e.g., safety, revenge). Present in setup and closure, with one middle beat (the soldier) that enacts it, but the friction is low. Mid-6s for coherent dramatization without strong conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is named explicitly ("what she called the tranquil blaze, that paradox of fire and peace") and realized through the dome's filtered light, which "burned without consuming, illuminated without destroying." The tone is coherent throughout—calm tending punctuated by latent violence (the knife, the tower's fall)—and charges the final image ("blazing tranquilly in the desert light"). The paradox modulates appropriately: reflective in the opening, sharpened when the soldier arrives, resolved in the close. The tone shapes the ending's resonance and is irreplaceable; swapping it would flatten the thematic charge. Strong closure linkage and specificity place it in the low-7s.</comment>
