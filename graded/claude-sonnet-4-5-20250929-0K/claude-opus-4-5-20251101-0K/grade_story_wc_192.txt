<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior contradictions are well-embodied: she polishes a doorknocker knowing no one will come, builds thresholds yet teaches Sera—contradictory impulses that act in scene rather than toggle sequentially. The burns-scars metaphor for shared wounds is concretely realized through Sera's bandaged hand and the "linking through scars" mechanism. Minor voice convergence at closure ("We start with emptiness") reads more thematic than distinct, and Sera's motivational arc is compressed but legible. The final choice to let Sera in forecloses isolation with visible cost: the sanctuary's dust patterns disturbed, the threshold rebuilt but thinner.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira's realization that "some bridges...could only be transformed into doorways" crystallizes her stance and reweights the sanctuary's purpose, with the cost legible in the disturbed emptiness and the rebuilt, thinner threshold. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered images (charred sanctuary, doorknocker unused for three years, fading threshold, scars as map) and the final image reweights the dominant stake. Orientation is anchored early (Mira, sanctuary, tonight). One meaningful tightening: the threshold fades, Sera arrives, Mira opens the door—each beat narrows options under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ashen charcoal sanctuary, doorknocker ring, and starlight canopy are vivid and purposeful. The doorknocker functions as micro-setting: Mira's weekly polishing embodies "loaded emptiness," and lifting it in the climax dissolves the threshold—it constrains her choice and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (Sera at edge, Mira at door, both seated inside). Minor cap per Q2 orientation waiver: no penalty applied, so Q3 is not artificially limited. The sanctuary's dust patterns register Sera's encroachment, integrating setting with conflict.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Mira's cultivated isolation vs. connection) is signaled early and tightens once: the fading threshold forces the choice to teach Sera or maintain solitude. Agency is clear—Mira lifts the doorknocker, a deliberate act that forecloses her three-year emptiness. The cost is visible: the sanctuary "holds only one," yet she steps aside and begins teaching. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure deepens through the scars-linking revelation and Sera's suffocating need, culminating in the doorways-not-bridges insight. No antagonist required; internal conflict (protection of emptiness vs. shared wounds) drives escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (isolation as protection vs. connection through shared wounds) emerges from concrete particulars: polished unused doorknocker, scars that glow and link, the sanctuary built from "burned letters and severed connections." The final image—"doorways, unlike bridges, allowed passage in both directions"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (Sera does not knock, Mira lifts the ring). "Loaded emptiness" and "pregnant pause" risk abstraction but are anchored in the polishing ritual and the dust-pattern disturbance. Minor slip: "teach suffocating to breathe" edges toward prompt language but is offset by the embodied scars and the rebuilding threshold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single third-person close POV on Mira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong: "ritual of loaded emptiness," "pregnant pause between connection and isolation." Dialogue is minimal, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("You found me" / "Your scars called to mine"). Minor register drift: "tender shadow keeper" and "shadow keeper arts" read slightly elevated for the intimate voice, but remain legible within the conceptual frame. Psychic distance is stable; the prose reflects Mira's careful, ritualized mindset. Under peak pressure (lifting the doorknocker), syntax compresses appropriately without obscuring interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings differ; information density is high ("the boundary between her sanctuary and the world beyond had grown thin as smoke, permeable as grief"). Minor loop: "burned bridges carefully, never in anger, always with the precision of a surgeon" and "teach suffocating to breathe" echo prompt language without transformation. Filter verbs ("she felt it," "she understood") are present but not stacked. Metaphor coherence is strong ("threshold," "bridges," "doorways"). Figurative density in the opening paragraph is high but establishes the lyric mode. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The "shadow keeper" frame and scars-as-linking-threads offer a specific synthesis that feels purposeful rather than generic. The transformation of bridges into doorways is earned by prior particulars (weekly polishing, fading threshold, shared burns). Minor derivative note: mentor-teaches-student in a sanctuary reads familiar, but the "burned letters," "charcoal sanctuary," and two-way passage angle add freshness. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat. Risk-taking is present but moderate: the lyric mode and conceptual language elevate without obscuring clarity. The "loaded emptiness" motif charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira (tender shadow keeper) makes the key turn: she lifts the doorknocker and steps aside, choosing to teach Sera despite the sanctuary's one-person design. This choice forecloses her three-year isolation with visible cost. Present in all three gates (setup, middle choice, closure participation). Two distinct beats: polishing ritual establishes her keeper role, lifting the ring enacts it under pressure. The trait "tender shadow keeper" is embodied through her weekly polishing and her final teaching stance, not merely labeled.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The doorknocker ring appears in setup (introduced paragraph 4, "she had installed it knowing no one would come, yet she polished it weekly"), constrains the middle choice (Mira's hand "finding" it signals readiness), and drives closure (lifting it dissolves the threshold). Three beats: installation/polishing ritual, Mira's hand on the ring as Sera waits, the lift that sounds "a tone that had never sounded in three years." The ring's cold, heavy weight and the "singing against the wood" charge the final image. Irreplaceable: the unused ring embodies "loaded emptiness" and transforms into passage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fading threshold shapes stakes (Mira must decide whether to dissolve the boundary) and tactics (Sera waits without knocking, respecting the threshold). Setup paragraph 2 ("the threshold was fading"), middle beat (it "pulsed between them"), and closure (it "dissolved entirely" when Mira lifts the ring, then rebuilds "thinner now"). The threshold's permeability is not merely thematic—it's the mechanism by which Sera can reach Mira and the cost Mira pays (it rebuilds more permeable). Irreplaceable: no other element could serve this role.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Burns bridges carefully" is dramatized once: Sera observes "you burned bridges carefully, never in anger, always with the precision of a surgeon removing what could not be saved." The trait constrains Mira's past (she "cut off all contact") and primes the closure choice (she must now choose connection). However, the trait is largely told rather than shown in a second on-page beat. Present in setup (backstory paragraph 1) and echoed at closure (doorways vs. bridges insight), but middle development is weak. The precision metaphor is vivid, but the trait does not visibly alter tactics during the Sera encounter.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Encroach" drives two beats: Sera's presence "beginning to encroach upon the careful emptiness" (paragraph 2) and her entry "encroaching upon every carefully arranged absence, disturbing the dust patterns" (paragraph 15). The action redefines options: Mira must either permit encroachment or defend isolation. Setup early, middle pressure (the word recurs), and closure participation (the disturbance "felt less like invasion and more like breathing"). The specificity of "disturbing the dust patterns" makes the encroachment concrete. Swappability test: "intrude" or "invade" could replace it, but "encroach" carries the gradual, permeable quality that mirrors the fading threshold. Score reflects solid but not indispensable integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Linking through scars" is signaled early (Sera explains, "I followed the pain like a map") and its mechanics matter: shared wounds create "invisible threads" immune to severance. The method enables Sera's arrival (she traces Mira despite three years' silence) and primes closure (Mira recognizes they "survived the same fire"). However, it does not shape a middle choice or alter tactics—it functions as backstory explanation rather than on-page constraint. Present in setup and closure resonance (their scars "mirroring" at the end), but middle development is absent. The method is specific and irreplaceable for how Sera finds Mira, but its causal work is front-loaded.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight pressures every choice: it "holds only one" (Mira's stated rule), forcing her to warn Sera "you cannot stay." Setup paragraph 1 ("walls built from the remains of burned letters"), middle constraint (the sanctuary's one-person design creates the cost of teaching Sera), and closure participation (the sanctuary's dust patterns disturbed, "gaps in the roof" let starlight through as they sit). The charcoal and starlight recur across all three gates. The setting is irreplaceable: no generic "isolated cabin" could carry the same thematic and physical weight. Visible cost: Mira's "carefully arranged absence" is disrupted.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after cutting off all contact" anchors backstory (three silent years) and signals the cost of Mira's isolation. It tightens the decision slightly: Mira has cultivated this emptiness for three years, so opening the door forecloses that investment. However, the timeframe does not create a live clock or alter tactics beat-by-beat—"tonight, the threshold was fading" is the immediate pressure, not the three-year span. Present in setup and closure resonance (the doorknocker "had never sounded in three years"), but the middle tactical pressure comes from the fading threshold, not the duration. Functional but not driving escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"To teach suffocating to breathe" is Sera's stated motivation and is dramatized through her physical state: bandaged hand, burns, voice breaking, "every breath feels like drowning in ash." The desire creates friction: Sera needs what Mira has learned, but Mira's sanctuary "holds only one." Setup (Sera's plea paragraph 8), middle choice (Mira weighs the cost, "you cannot stay"), and closure participation (Mira begins teaching, "the slow work of teaching lungs to welcome air"). The motivation is embodied in Sera's scars and suffocating metaphor, not merely declared. Swappability test: "to learn solitude" or "to heal" could replace it, but "teach suffocating to breathe" is specific to the ash/fire imagery. Cost is visible: Mira's sanctuary is disrupted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Loaded emptiness" is coherent through all turns: the polished unused doorknocker, "pregnant pause between connection and isolation," "careful emptiness she had cultivated," and the final threshold "thinner now, more permeable." The tone modulates with pressure: calm ritual (polishing weekly) → charged stillness (Sera waits without knocking) → disrupted emptiness (dust patterns disturbed) → transformed emptiness (doorways allow passage both ways). Setup paragraph 3 ("ritual of loaded emptiness"), middle beats (the threshold pulses, Mira's voice "unused and cracking"), and closure (the tone shifts to "breathing: an expansion, a contraction"). The tone charges the final image by transforming emptiness from isolation into shared space. Irreplaceable tonal signature.</comment>
