<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is consistent and embodied through concrete details (worn satchel, silent bell, crocodile's tooth). Her arc from existential opacity to purpose-restored healer is earned through the harp encounter, and the spirits' confessions dramatize her unconscious gift. Internal contradiction appears in her simultaneous fearlessness and apprehension, and her final choice to continue is foreclosed by visible cost (the ache that "glowed"). Minor issue: the epiphany moment leans slightly expository ("She had been healing them… offering levity as a bridge") rather than fully dramatized, though the spirits' testimony provides concrete grounding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the harp's distorted notes trigger a pattern of spectral confessions that reweight Maren's understanding of her centuries of work. Orientation anchors (lost soul collector, Echo Gorge, dawn) arrive by the opening paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (purpose restored through reweighted meaning) with visible cost: "The ache remained, but now it glowed." One meaningful deepening occurs when the spirits reveal her forgotten gift, narrowing her search inward and foreclosing the path of self-doubt. Causality is clean; the harp encounter motivates the revelation, which motivates the decision to continue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is anchored with selective sensory detail (pale light, striated stone throat, ghostly echo repetitions) that constrains Maren's descent and frames the harp discovery. The crocodile's tooth functions as micro-setting, charged at both opening (Vasilis's lesson) and closure (warm against her chest). The harp itself—bone-white wood, slack strings—constrains the confession mechanism. Spatial choreography is clean (descent, canyon heart, climb out). The hidden sunrise timeframe brackets the piece and charges the final image, though "hidden" remains slightly vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Maren's restoration of purpose, signaled in paragraph one ("misplaced herself"). The harp discovery and spirits' confessions create one meaningful tightening: her work was always healing through laughter, but she never recognized it. Agency appears in her choice to strike the harp again and laugh, foreclosing the path of self-doubt with visible cost (tears, the ache that now glows). The spirits apply immediate pressure by revealing forgotten memories. No coincidence resolves; Maren's decision to continue is earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—joy as companion to sorrow, not its absence—emerges through concrete particulars: the drowned child laughing, the soldier's forty-year silence broken, Vasilis's dying laughter. The crocodile's tooth accumulates meaning from ancient laughter to final lesson. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "She was a healer. She had always been." The harp's "beautifully wrong" notes provide a governing image of productive distortion. Minor issue: "Joy was not the absence of sorrow but its companion" borders on direct statement, though it's embedded in Maren's realization and grounded by prior dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: "modestly fearless" filters her apprehension, the tooth's warmth registers physically, echoes carry "fragments" that accumulate. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("opaque as river fog," "throat of striated stone"). The spirits' brief dialogue is distinct and purposeful. Minor slip: "Tears streamed down her face, luminous in the growing light" slightly externalizes the emotional peak rather than filtering it through her perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most lines advancing character or atmosphere. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor issues: "She was a healer. She had always been. And there were more souls waiting, more laughter to offer against the dark" employs short declarative stems that read slightly template-like at the climax. "The ache she had carried for so long began to shift, transforming from weight into warmth" paraphrases the shift rather than embodying it through image. No major loops or clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—soul collector discovers her healing gift through distorted confessions—offers a fresh angle on psychopomp narratives. The harp as misalignment device and laughter as medicine provide specific, non-obvious synthesis. The emotional truth of forgotten purpose feels earned. Minor derivative element: the mentor's object-as-talisman (Vasilis's tooth) and the journey-to-canyon-artifact structure echo familiar quest frames without fully transforming them. The luminous-ache tone and spectral-testimony mechanism elevate freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lost soul collector is signaled in the opening line, frames Maren's three-century backstory, and motivates her descent. Her decision to strike the harp and laugh is the key closure turn. The role appears across all three gates (setup, middle choice at the harp, ending decision to continue) and drives two beats. Solid causal pressure and closure linkage, though the collector function itself (guiding souls) is more told than shown on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Crocodile's tooth appears in paragraph two (Vasilis's lesson), is gripped during Maren's realization, and returns warm at closure. Three touches across setup, middle, and ending. The tooth carries thematic meaning (ancient laughter, joy cutting darkness) that reweights at closure, but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Lyric reprise with charged meaning qualifies for mid-6s, but lack of causal pressure limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Spectral confessions are signaled in paragraph three, constitute the middle beat when spirits materialize and speak impossible truths through the harp, and shape the closure by revealing Maren's forgotten gift. The concept drives two beats and provides the mechanism for her realization. The distorted-truth frame is specific and irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the story's logic. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Modestly fearless is defined in paragraph four and filters Maren's descent (apprehension without retreat). The trait enables her approach to the harp but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. It shapes one beat (the descent) and reflects her internal stance, but remains more characterological color than a pressure point that alters tactics. Functional but replaceable with "cautious courage" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Pursue is signaled in paragraph three (drawn to the gorge by whispers), motivates the descent and harp discovery, and reframes at closure when she climbs out to continue her work. The action drives the structure and shapes two beats (arrival, departure). The pursuit of understanding turns into pursuit of purpose. Removing "pursue" would require major edits; the quest frame is essential. Strong integration with closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Misaligned harp is mentioned in paragraph three, discovered at the canyon's heart, and its distorted notes enable the spectral confessions in the middle beat. Maren strikes it twice, and the second strike (with laughter) charges the closure. The harp's mechanics—crooked strings, wrong notes—are specific and irreplaceable; it is the mechanism that makes spectral truths possible. Appears across all three gates, drives two beats, and shapes closure. High causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is named in the opening line, provides spatial constraint (descent to canyon's heart, striated throat, climb out), and brackets the action with the descent/ascent structure. The gorge's echoes reinforce the confessions motif. It shapes two beats (arrival, departure) and supplies resources (the harp's location). Solid integration, though the setting is more container than active pressure; a cave or temple could substitute with minor edits. Mid-6s for structural participation without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Hidden sunrise appears in the opening line, recurs during the confession beat ("luminous in the growing light"), and closes the piece ("as dawn broke fully"). Three touches across setup, middle, and ending create a time bracket. The sunrise charges the final image with symbolic weight (emergence, illumination). Lyric reprise is purposeful, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; removing it would weaken atmosphere but not break causality. Mid-5s for thematic resonance without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Laughter as healing is seeded in Vasilis's dying laugh (paragraph two), dramatized in the spirits' confessions (drowned child laughing, soldier's joke), and enacted when Maren laughs at closure. The motivation drives two beats and is conflicted: she never recognized her gift, and the realization costs her tears and transforms her ache. The desire is shown through action (humming, jokes, final laughter) rather than told. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, though the motivation itself is revealed rather than pursued from the start.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Luminous ache tone is established in the opening (uncertainty, borrowed name), embodied in the tears that are "luminous in the growing light," and crystallized in the closing line: "The ache remained, but now it glowed." The tone modulates from opacity to warmth under pressure, remains coherent through the confession beat, and charges the final image. The oxymoron (ache/luminous, pain/glow) is specific, sustained, and irreplaceable. High integration with closure.</comment>
