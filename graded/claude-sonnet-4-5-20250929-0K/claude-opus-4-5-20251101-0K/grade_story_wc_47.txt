<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular—watchful observation, notebook sketching, the amber pendant's meaning shifting from "hope trapped in time" to preservation. Her quietly proactive nature drives micro-choices (returning to study the moss, offering the pendant) that foreclose distance with visible cost. Thea remains somewhat thin—present mainly as a foil—but her acceptance of the pendant earns the final reconciliation. Minor: the therapy suggestion feels slightly explanatory rather than fully dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (Mira in data center, three weeks post-viral confession). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (moss patterns, drip lines, intertwined ferns) and the confession's public weight, culminating in the pendant offering—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the sisters' options reweight without full resolution. Cost is felt in Mira's relinquishment and Thea's tearful acceptance. One tightening deepens the reconciliation stakes sufficiently for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The data-center-turned-garden is vividly particular (cooling towers wrapped in ferns, raised floor tiles channeling water, server racks blooming) and constrains the sisters' confrontation—the "honeyed hush" absorbs their words, the reclaimed space models forgiveness. The moss pattern (drip lines from melting icicles) charges the final image of growth following invisible patterns. Micro-setting (body, pendant, bench of intertwined ferns) all serve the closure. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—healing the rift after Thea's viral confession—is signaled early and tightens through Mira's return to the garden and Thea's shadowing presence. The pendant offering is a meaningful turn that narrows options (reconciliation or continued estrangement) with visible cost (Mira relinquishes her mother's keepsake). Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift rather than causal reversal, which fits. One deepening suffices for this length, though the resolution leans slightly gentle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—growth over wholeness, patterns left by loss—emerges organically from moss imagery, the moth in amber reweighted from "trapped" to "preserved," and the intertwined ferns. The final exchange ("You're here now") and closing line ("growth, like moss, like memory, like love, followed its own patient patterns toward light") risk slight over-articulation but avoid sermon. The pendant transfer and honeyed-hush motif charge the ending without stating a moral. No token recurrence; each image constrains or deepens.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtered through Mira's watchful-dreamer lens: "honeyed hush," "She'd always been a watchful dreamer," selective attention to drip patterns. Dialogue is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext—Thea's "I should have been there" and Mira's "You're here now" advance reconciliation without exposition. Perceptual signature is consistent (observation, sketching, patience). Brief dip: "the kind of person who noticed things others missed" leans slightly tell-y, though the notebook work demonstrates it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high (moss pattern explained via drip lines, pendant symbolism reweighted, setting interwoven with reflection). Sentence openings vary. Minor scaffold: "This was how she worked: quietly proactive" could be cut; "honeyed hush" recurs three times with slight redundancy. The phrase "protected vulnerability" in the final third feels slightly imposed rather than emergent. No loops or major artifacts touch closure, so non-closure cap applies (−0.4 for minor tell/redundancy).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Data-center-turned-moss-garden is a fresh frame for grief/reconciliation, avoiding generic memorial settings. The moss-drip-pattern method and amber-pendant shift from trapped to preserved offer specific angles. Emotional truth (Mira's quiet proactivity vs. Thea's public confession) feels particular. Risk: the extended reflection on moss and transformation, while purposeful, leans slightly safe—grief via nature reclamation is not uncommon. Still, the specific execution (icicle drip lines, intertwined ferns at closure) elevates above template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's "watchful dreamer" trait drives her return to the garden, notebook documentation, and the pendant offering—all key beats. The trait constrains her processing style (attention over announcement) and enables the final reconciliation. Present in setup, middle (sketching moss), and closure (offering). Causal pressure moderate; the trait shapes how she acts but isn't irreplaceable—another introspective type could substitute with edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Amber pendant with moth appears early (throat touch, mother's keepsake), mid-story (Mira examines it, reweighting "trapped" to "preserved"), and at closure (unclasped, offered to Thea with both hands). Three distinct beats. The pendant's shift in meaning charges the reconciliation and ties to the preservation-vs.-growth theme. Removal would break the sisters' final exchange. Strong integration, though the object itself is somewhat conventional (heirloom keepsake).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Honeyed hush" is introduced early, recurs three times, and frames the tone of protected vulnerability. It shapes the atmosphere that allows the sisters' exchange but doesn't constrain tactics or alter decisions—it's more textural than causal. The concept charges the closure scene (the hush "absorbed their words"), establishing a lyric reprise, but doesn't drive plot. Mid-band for purposeful texture without mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Quietly proactive" is explicitly labeled ("This was how she worked") and demonstrated through Mira's return visits, notebook sketching, and the pendant offering without announcement. The trait enables the reconciliation and contrasts with Thea's public confession. Present in setup and closure, with visible cost (Mira sacrifices the pendant). Swappability moderate—"thoughtful" or "deliberate" could substitute with minor edits. Solid mid-band for causal participation without full irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "proffer" (pendant offered with both hands, "the way their mother used to offer them hot chocolate after nightmares") is the story's pivotal turn, enabling Thea's acceptance and the reconciliation. Setup (pendant established early), middle (meaning reweighted), closure (offered and accepted). Removal would collapse the ending. The gesture's specificity (both hands, ritual echo) and cost (relinquishment of mother's keepsake) make it near-indispensable. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "pattern left by drip of thawing icicles" is discovered mid-story, explained causally (cold snap → icicles → drip lines → moss follows), and thematically charged ("A pattern left by the thaw, invisible now but preserved in green"). The method seeds the growth-pattern metaphor that frames closure but doesn't mechanically drive plot choices. Present in setup (noticed last week) and development (sketched), with thematic payoff. Mid-to-upper band for resonance without plot necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned data center turned moss garden is established early, provides the "honeyed hush" atmosphere, supplies tactile details (server racks, ferns, drip lines), and houses the final reconciliation (bench of intertwined ferns). The setting models transformation and reclamation, directly paralleling the sisters' arc. Removal would eliminate the story's central metaphor and spatial logic. Strong integration across setup, middle, and closure, though the metaphor leans slightly heavy.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the confession goes viral" (three weeks ago) anchors the story's inciting pressure and Mira's need to process. The timeframe is mentioned early but doesn't tighten decisions—no live clock or urgency. The viral aspect adds social weight (strangers dissecting their grief) but remains background. Present in setup, minimal middle development, thematic presence at closure. Functional but largely replaceable; "after a family rupture" would work with edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to graft new meaning onto old wounds" is stated explicitly ("To graft new meaning onto old wounds required finding where the new growth wanted to go") and dramatized through her moss study, notebook documentation, and pendant reweighting. The desire drives her return visits and the final offering. Present in setup (therapist's suggestion rejected), middle (sketching patterns), and closure (offering as grafting). Cost visible (relinquishment). Solid integration, though the label-speak slightly undermines drama.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is coherent throughout—the data center as refuge, Mira's observation without announcement, the honeyed hush that holds the sisters' words gently. Tone modulates subtly (reflective in moss study, charged at pendant offering) without breaking. The final image ("protected vulnerability of this reclaimed space") risks slight over-articulation but charges closure. Tone shapes atmosphere and enables the reconciliation; removal would flatten the ending. Upper-mid band for tonal coherence with minor tell.</comment>
