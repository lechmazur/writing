<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Corwin's motivation is clear and rooted in apprenticeship to wonder, but his internal experience remains fairly smooth—no genuine contradictions act simultaneously in scene. The letter reveal provides emotional payoff, yet the weeping-then-laughing beat reads as performed rather than embodied with specific physical sensation. The final transformation into "keeper of wonders who had never forgotten how to steal" is declared more than earned through on-page friction between old thief habits and new keeper duties.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal support. Orientation anchors clearly (violet sky, Spire, dying master) by the second paragraph. The chess-puzzle structure provides a meaningful tightening that narrows options, and the letter reweights Corwin's entire apprenticeship with conceptual cost (he was never a prisoner). Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost on the page—yet the cost remains largely emotional rather than forfeiting a live tactical option, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Icebound Spire, violet sky, and cloud-ice chess pieces are vivid and purposeful. The sky-wrong phenomenon constrains the vault opening (temporal fold allows past secrets to occupy the present moment), directly enabling the climactic choice. Spatial choreography across tower levels remains clean, and the frozen environment charges the final descent with the healing draught, qualifying for mid-7s integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save the master) is signaled early and drives the vault sequence. The chess-puzzle provides one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens—Corwin must match secrets correctly or fail—and the letter reveal deepens emotional cost. However, no live tactical option is visibly foreclosed; the master's survival was never genuinely in doubt on the page, capping escalation below 7.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (embracing wonder, the unknown as gift rather than problem) emerges organically from the chess puzzle, sky-wrong, and the letter's revelation. The final image—Corwin learning duties with "sacred playfulness"—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the piece resists tidy binaries and allows wonder to remain both joyful and costly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Corwin; perceptual signature is consistent (wonder-focused, chivalrous). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sacredly playful reverence," "cautious abandon") that feels authorial rather than character-particular under stress. No dialogue present to evaluate. Free indirect thought is clean, and psychic distance modulates purposefully during the letter-reading beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop conceptually: "embrace the unknown with open arms" appears twice, "sacredly playful" echoes across beats, and "wonder demanded both" in the weeping-laughing line reads as thematic summary rather than embodied action. Stock metaphor "morning frost" and elevated diction in peak beats (vault opening, letter reading) reduce immediacy by −0.6. No severe artifacts touch closure, preventing deeper penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sky-wrong temporal fold and secrets-in-chess-pieces offer fresh specificity, and the chivalrous-thief-turned-wonder-keeper arc avoids pure template. However, the mentor-dying-apprentice-finds-cure frame and the "you were always my heir" letter beat are familiar genre moves executed competently but not transformed. Emotional particulars (bottled children's tears, poems of apology) add texture without fundamentally altering the arc's predictability, keeping the piece in the solid-but-not-bold range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Corwin's chivalrous thief identity is established early (stole only from cruel/corrupt, left poems of apology) and shapes his willingness to reclaim the sundial lid. The past theft decision enables the present vault quest. However, no on-page thief action occurs in the present scene—his chivalry informs backstory and colors the decision to save his master, but the middle puzzle-solving does not require thief skills. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff via past enabling present) with moderate causal link, capped by lack of middle development beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The pocket sundial lid appears in three beats: Corwin pulls it from his coat, reflects on its origin (merchant trafficking children's tears), and uses its symbols to unlock the Vault. It shapes one key turn (vault access) and is present at closure via the letter's revelation that it was never truly confiscated. Swappability: any carved key-object with symbols could serve the same function with minor edits, and the lid's unique history (children's tears merchant) does not constrain tactics or reweight the ending image beyond providing backstory color.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Apprentice of wonder" frames Corwin's seven-year training and informs his approach to the chess puzzle ("sacredly playful reverence"). The concept appears in setup, colors middle tactics (treating mysteries with wonder), and echoes at closure ("keeper of wonders"). However, it operates largely as thematic lens rather than constraining specific choices—Corwin's actions (listening to secrets, placing pieces) could proceed identically if he were an apprentice locksmith with different framing. Lyric reprise present but causal pressure on tactics is modest.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Sacredly playful" appears twice as a descriptor of Corwin's approach (chess puzzle, final duties learning) but remains label-only without constraining a specific choice or imposing visible cost. The trait colors tone but does not alter tactics—Corwin's reverent, patient puzzle-solving could be reframed as "focused" or "methodical" without structural change. Setup and closure reprise present, yet no middle beat where the trait enables or forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Amend" appears in Corwin's thief backstory (poems promising to amend), returns in the penultimate paragraph ("ready to amend what could be healed and accept what could not"), and threads through his motivation to save the master as restitution. The action shapes the quest's emotional stakes and charges the ending image with earned weight. However, the vault puzzle-solving mechanics do not hinge on amendment—Corwin listens and places pieces without needing to atone mid-scene. Three-gate presence with strong closure linkage but moderate causal pressure on middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chess-piece swapping method is signaled early (crystalline doors, cloud-ice pieces with secrets), dominates the middle sequence (Corwin listens to knight, queen, pawn, matching secrets to positions), and its completion opens the vault to enable closure. The method's mechanics matter: matching secrets correctly is the gate to the cure. Removing this exact puzzle structure would break the story's causal spine. Specificity and beat involvement push the score into the 7–8 range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The Icebound Spire is present in setup, middle (tower peak vault location), and ending (frozen stairs descent). The setting constrains access (vault at peak) and the frozen environment colors atmosphere. The sky-wrong pressing against tower windows ties timeframe to place. However, the spire's "above the clouds" isolation does not force a tactical trade-off or alter Corwin's approach—the vault puzzle could occur in a basement with similar mechanics. Setting pressure is atmospheric rather than causal, capping the score below 7.0, but closure participation and three-gate presence lift it to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "sky-wrong" (violet sky for three days) is established in the opening line, explicitly enables the vault opening ("time folded differently… allowing past secrets and present needs to occupy the same moment"), and brackets the ending ("dawn finally returned three days later"). The timeframe provides the essential window for the quest and tightens urgency—Corwin must act during this rare phenomenon. Removing the sky-wrong would break the vault-access logic. Strong causal pressure across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to embrace the unknown with open arms" appears in the master's pawn-secret, shapes Corwin's willingness to reclaim the sundial and enter the vault, and echoes in the final paragraph's framing. However, it is told-only via the letter rather than dramatized through on-page friction—Corwin does not wrestle between clinging to certainty versus leaping into mystery during the puzzle. The motivation colors theme but lacks a visible cost or contradictory impulse acting in scene. Three-gate presence with lyric reprise but modest conflict integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Cautious abandon" appears as a label when Corwin opens the letter and is implied in "sacredly playful reverence" at the chess table. The tone modulates between reverent puzzle-solving and the weeping-then-laughing beat, showing emotional range. However, the oxymoron itself remains largely decorative—neither caution nor abandon visibly constrains a choice or imposes cost. The final image of learning duties "with sacred playfulness" reprises the tone but does not charge it with new pressure. Setup and closure reprise without middle constraint caps the score at mid-6s.</comment>
