<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and concrete: she seeks to understand the veil's failure through direct confrontation with the past via the flute. Her internal state—grief, survivor's guilt, purpose-driven defiance—is embodied through trembling fingers, bone-deep memory, and the weight of disobedience against Master Verren's deathbed oath. The moment of insight (harmony vs. counterpoint) arrives through dramatized vision rather than assertion, and her final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she has broken her vow and walks down alone, armed with forbidden knowledge. Minor issue: the phrase "avalanchingly quiet" feels more decorative than psychological, and the insight itself could have been seeded earlier to deepen her internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors promptly (Mira, Thunder-echo Range, post-guardianship era, climbing toward Keeper's Hollow). The causal chain is clean: Mira witnessed the veil tear → seeks understanding → uses the flute to step sideways into the past → discovers the flaw (harmony vs. counterpoint) → returns with actionable knowledge. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she has broken her oath and now possesses the wisdom to sing discord when the veil weakens again; the cost is solitude, disobedience, and the weight of being the sole bearer of this dangerous knowledge. The lens is Causal with lyric texture; the final image reweights "silence" from emptiness to potential, charging the ending without requiring a decisive physical act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Thunder-echo Range and Keeper's Hollow are rendered with purposeful specificity: stone worn smooth by generations, air tasting of copper and rain, walls that absorb sound like deep water. The driftwood markers function as both micro-setting object and navigational constraint, anchoring the weaving's risk. The hollow's "avalanchingly quiet" atmosphere pressures Mira's perception and primes the flute's vibratory effect. Spatial choreography remains clear (path junction, altar center, long walk down), and the setting's silence shifts meaning at closure—from absence to potential—charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—harvesting insight from catastrophic failure to prepare for the next veil breach—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens through Mira's choice to uncase the forbidden relic, defying Master Verren's deathbed oath; the flute use forces her into the moment of collapse, where she witnesses the critical flaw. The reversal is subtle but decisive: understanding shifts from "harmony failed" to "discord is required," which narrows her future options and charges her solitude with purpose. The cost is legible: broken vow, isolation, and the burden of dangerous knowledge. Agency drives escalation; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action and image: the necessity of discord over harmony, wisdom born from failure, and solitude as both cost and condition of guardianship. The flute's vision dramatizes the insight without overt moralizing; the shift from "emptiness" to "potential" in the final beat reweights the premise without stating a thesis. The driftwood markers and the gilded flute recur with shifting resonance, and Mira's disobedience earns thematic weight through her survivor's grief. Minor slip: "the wisdom that only failure could teach" edges toward platitude, though it remains grounded in the specific flaw she witnessed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly bound to Mira's perception. The prose carries a distinct texture: "avalanchingly quiet," "canyon hush," "smoke and whisper," lexicon that reads character-specific and maintains elevated diction without slipping into corporate register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the oath-breaking moment, slightly wider during the vision). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The perceptual signature—attention to acoustic void, memory encoded in bone, tactile relation to driftwood and bronze—remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or causality. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor issues: "avalanchingly quiet" is a strained coinage that momentarily obscures sense, and the phrase "the beautiful discord that held worlds apart" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward elevated abstraction during a key moment. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly; the final image ("potential") recharges the earlier silence motif. Proofreading is clean, and spatial choreography tracks without error.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—relic keeper using forbidden instrument to witness past failure and extract tactical insight—offers a fresh angle on the "lone survivor seeks redemption" template by emphasizing epistemological correction (harmony→discord) over emotional catharsis. The gilded flute as a device for "weaving between worlds" combines sensory ritual with temporal revision in a non-obvious synthesis. Minor weaknesses: the Thunder-echo Range and guardianship lore remain lightly sketched, trending toward generic fantasy infrastructure, and the final insight ("discord holds worlds apart") feels conceptually familiar despite strong execution. The bold choice to center the story on a learning beat rather than action elevates originality within the band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's choice to uncase the flute drives the inciting turn, her agency shapes the vision beat, and her decision to descend with newfound knowledge closes the arc. Removing her would collapse the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gilded reed flute appears in setup (the case), is uncased and played to open the vision, and its return to the case bookends the arc. Its unique property—weaving between worlds via melody—enables the central insight and charges the closure. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds governs the flute's mechanics, enables the temporal vision, and defines the guardians' lost practice. It shapes the central tactic (stepping sideways into the past) and the thematic insight (discord as structural necessity). Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Avalanchingly quiet" describes the hollow's atmosphere and primes the flute's first note as sensation rather than sound. It contributes mood but does not constrain a visible on-page choice or cost; the attribute could be swapped for another descriptor of intense stillness without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Uncasing the relic is the inciting action that breaks Mira's oath, initiates the vision sequence, and enables the insight. The act is irreversible and charges the closure with the weight of disobedience. Swapping it would require rewriting the entire causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Driftwood arrangement appears in setup, serves as navigational failsafe, and is mentioned again at the walk-down ("purpose fulfilled"). It enables safe return if weaving fails, constraining risk, but does not drive a middle beat or close-out image. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Thunder-echo Range frames the setting, signals the guardianship's acoustic heritage, and closes with the shift from silence to potential. The Keeper's Hollow provides the ritual stage. The setting pressures through isolation and history but does not alter tactics in a visible middle beat; a strong lyric reprise lifts the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The post-guardianship timeframe establishes Mira's isolation, motivates her forbidden research, and defines the stakes (preparing for the next breach). The three-year gap since the veil's tearing anchors her survivor's burden. The temporal frame tightens the dramatic question and shapes her final resolve.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The drive to harvest insights from failure is signaled early, dramatized through the oath-breaking choice, tested in the vision, and satisfied by the discord insight. The motivation forces the key turn and charges the ending with purposeful solitude. High causal integration and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Canyon hush" and its variants ("avalanchingly quiet," silence that "pressed against her eardrums") establish tone, modulate through the flute's vibration, and shift meaning at closure (emptiness→potential). Tone coheres across beats and charges the final image, though the coinage "avalanchingly" slightly strains the effect.</comment>
