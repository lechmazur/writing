<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The painter lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene; her work unfolds smoothly without internal friction or meaningful choice under pressure. Interiority leans heavily on atmospheric description rather than embodied emotion—"perceptive calm" remains a label without dramatized cost. The borrowed-heartbeat mechanism is told rather than felt, and the protagonist's solitary action gives no relationship crucible to test motive. The ending renunciation (leaving unsigned) carries no visible price that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive within the opening paragraphs (terrace, rain, spring, vespers timeframe). The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: atmosphere and reflection build toward a final image rather than causal turns. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the painting's shimmer and the painter's departure, but cost remains abstract—no on-page action or forfeiture makes the price undeniable. The "borrowed heartbeat" backstory and the coded lullabies are told in reflective summary, weakening the sense of stakes tested on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prism parapet after rain anchors the scene vividly and returns in the closure beat, refracting light onto the finished work. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric; the terrace's crystalline surfaces and "dusky harmony" color charge the final image. The body and brushes remain underdeveloped as micro-setting—handles are mentioned but do not constrain a choice. Still, the parapet's refracted light directly shapes the painting's embedded colors, giving it moderate causal presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing the painting before the bells ring—is signaled early and provides a timeframe constraint. However, urgency remains asserted rather than tested; no reversal or complication arises to force a tactical shift. The painter works without friction, and the bells' arrival after completion removes rather than tightens pressure. The borrowed heartbeat and coded lullabies operate as backstory rather than present escalation, leaving the page action static.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—reflection as transformation, possibility over fixed identity—emerges through the mirror imagery and the painting's subject. The "borrowed heartbeat" and the granddaughter's future suggest legacy and worth, avoiding overt thesis. Yet the final paragraph edges toward moralizing ("what we might become matters more than what we are"), and the mirage painter's mission is stated rather than interrogated. The piece invites reflection but stops short of a non-literal, resonant answer earned by scene particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct, elevated diction ("dusky harmony," "borrowed heartbeats," "revolution of reflection"). Psychic distance is consistent, though the register occasionally drifts into abstract lyricism that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. No dialogue appears. The narrative voice is textured but uniform across emotional beats, lacking modulation under pressure. Filter verbs ("She understood," "She knew") appear frequently, dulling immediacy in a few high-importance moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful, but several beats loop conceptually: the painter's elusiveness is restated in paragraph one, and "borrowed heartbeats" and "persuasion of mirrors" recur without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third ("She worked with borrowed heartbeats. This was her secret…" / "She understood mirrors…"). Minor filter-verb stacks ("She understood," "She knew") cluster in reflective passages. Closure image is vivid, but the final paragraph's moralizing summary ("what we might become matters more than what we are") deflates propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "mirage painter" and "borrowed heartbeat" conceit offer a fresh premise, and the prism parapet anchors the scene in specific sensory logic. However, the artist-as-mysterious-wanderer frame and the mirror-as-transformation metaphor trend familiar; the story does not transform these tropes through grounded conflict or surprising moral calculus. The coded lullabies and the unnamed painter evade depth, reading as atmospheric ornament. Emotional truth—legacy, self-worth—is earnest but stated rather than earned through tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The mirage painter is present throughout and frames the action, but her choices do not create turns—she arrives, paints, and leaves without complication. Setup and closure presence are strong, yet middle development lacks a decision under pressure. Swappable with "wandering artist" or similar archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prism parapet after rain appears early, returns in the closure beat, and its refracted light directly charges the painting's embedded colors. It supplies sensory detail and a causal contribution (rainbows bless the work). However, it does not constrain a choice or narrow options; its role is atmospheric enhancement rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Borrowed heartbeat is introduced late (midpoint backstory) and explained rather than dramatized. It does not shape present tactics or choices on the page; the painter simply carries it as lore. Appears in the final image obliquely (the painting "shimmers"), but its mechanics remain told-only and easily swappable with "borrowed memory" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" is mentioned once as a label without dramatized cost or enabling action. It does not constrain a beat or alter tactics. Static descriptor, not an active trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Grace appears in one sentence ("She added the final strokes with grace") as a descriptor of wrist movement. Present at closure but ornamental; easily replaced with "precision" or "care." No prior setup or middle beats; no cost or choice tied to it.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Coded lullabies are signaled early (paragraph two) and tied to the painter's mission, but their mechanics remain vague and their effect is told in summary ("those who listened closely learned to look twice"). They do not shape an on-page attempt or complicate action. Present in setup and thematically at closure, but development is absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The echoing terrace in spring anchors the scene throughout, provides atmosphere (children's voices, memory, vespers timeframe), and the prism parapet's refracted light contributes causally to the painting. Spring softness is noted but does not pressure a choice. Setup, development (setting details interweave with action), and closure presence all met, though the setting does not tighten options or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The hush before bells ring is signaled early and frames the painter's sacred window. Time is tracked ("by the time the bells finished their song, she had vanished"), and the bells' approach provides mild urgency. However, no complication tests the timeframe; she finishes before they ring, removing pressure rather than tightening it. Setup and closure met; middle development present but passive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>To persuade mirrors to show possibilities is stated as the painter's life's work and subtly illustrated through the painting's mirror-figure. Desire is told rather than dramatized in friction; no scene tests this want against a cost. Setup and closure thematic presence met, but middle development lacks a conflicted choice. The goal shapes the premise but not tactics.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dusky harmony appears in one vivid phrase ("clouds the color of dusky harmony") and the overall tone—elegiac, lyric, soft—remains coherent. The tone does not modulate meaningfully under pressure (no pressure shifts occur), but it charges the final image through sensory atmosphere. Setup implicit, closure contribution clear, middle constancy rather than dynamic shift.</comment>
