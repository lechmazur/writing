<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is specific and embodied—her measuring tape habit, her data-collection impulse—and her stance toward Marcus evolves from professional distance to confiding curiosity. Marcus's hollow expression and trembling hands are well-observed, though his arc remains thin; he functions primarily as data point rather than co-protagonist. The piece avoids therapy-speak and grants Vera contradictory impulses (profiting from desperation while genuinely curious). Minor slip: Marcus's motivation for choosing the Moon at the end feels slightly unmotivated given his prior control orientation, though it serves the thematic turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors quickly (loft, rain, Vera's practice). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Marcus's unsolicited reach for the Moon reweights both his stance and Vera's project, crystallizing the question she's "trying to find out" with visible cost (his surrender of control, herMap gaining a new data point). The piece coheres under accumulative pressure: each card choice and Vera's confiding build density until the final reversal. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight is a persistent atmospheric anchor that charges the opening and returns at closure ("the rain kept falling"). The onyx cards, measuring tape, and worn Persian rug supply tactile micro-setting that Vera handles across beats. Spatial choreography is clean (cushion, door, spread). The loft's post-crash affordability subtly contextualizes Vera's position without exposition. The rain functions as ambient pressure rather than direct constraint, sufficient at this length but not indispensable to the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Vera's project to map cultural mythology through card readings. Marcus's arrival provides immediate pressure (a high-profile skeptic now desperate), and Vera's decision to confide her true method is the key tightening—she risks exposure to gain insight. The final beat, Marcus reaching for the Moon, narrows options: his shift from control-myths to surrender-myths is the data Vera seeks, and she measures it. Cost is legible on the page (his vulnerability, her mapping him as specimen). One meaningful escalation under the accumulative lens, sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—what stories people cling to when constructed realities collapse—emerges organically from Vera's project and Marcus's card choices without moralizing. The grandmother's inheritance and the cryptocurrency crash function as paired collapses across generations. The Moon card's final appearance offers a resonant, non-literal answer: true surrender looks like reaching for intuition and illusion, the opposite of control. The onyx cards as "secrets to anyone patient enough to listen" charges the closure without stating a thesis. Subtext operates cleanly in Vera's measured responses and Marcus's body language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, Vera's perceptual signature is clear (measuring, cataloging, watching for "the crack in the armor"). Dialogue is sparse, functional, and distinct: Marcus's defensive "I don't actually believe in this" versus Vera's calm "I know." The narration employs purposeful compression ("This was data too") and filters appropriately through Vera's analytical lens. Minor slip: "the cards whispering against each other like secrets" edges toward stock phrasing, though the voice recovers quickly. No head-hopping, tense is stable, psychic distance modulates purposefully.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively ("rain-beaded skylight loft had become Vera's sanctuary" / "the onyx cards whispered their secrets"). Information density is high; most lines do double duty (setting + character, action + theme). Two minor artifacts: "steadily curious" in paragraph four reads slightly label-like rather than dramatized, and "the body's confession before the mouth spoke a word" is near-cliché. "Onyx-ink" and "onyx deck" repeat within close proximity without reweighting. No loops or scaffold otherwise; clarity and momentum hold throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—fortune-teller as cultural anthropologist reverse-engineering belief systems post-crash—is a fresh synthesis that avoids template plotting. Vera's measuring tape and data journal transform the tarot-reading trope into ethnographic fieldwork. The specific pairing of cryptocurrency collapse with inherited divination practice offers non-obvious thematic traction. Marcus's arc from dismissive VC to Moon-chooser feels earned in hindsight. Minor constraint: the "hundreds of desperate clients" setup risks generic disaster-backdrop, though the piece mitigates this through Vera's specificity and Marcus's individuated choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's choices drive the key turns: she decides to confide her true method (middle beat), she measures Marcus's Moon choice and records it (closure). Setup in opening paragraph, development when she explains her project, payoff when she "smiled, shuffling the deck again" and measures the final card. Her analytical stance shapes every beat. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the story would collapse without her active data-gathering and confiding decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The measuring tape appears in paragraph three (Vera measures card distances), is named as "her grandmother's" (thematic link to inheritance), and implicitly returns at closure when Vera "measured its position from the others and wrote the number down." Two beats, purposeful early signal, charged by the grandmother connection. However, the tape does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure—it records rather than enables. Mid-band: present and thematically resonant but not indispensable to the closure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Reverse engineering is signaled early ("reverse engineering the cultural patterns"), shapes Vera's tactics throughout (tracking "every hesitation, every instinctive reach"), and appears at closure ("another data point in her growing map... slowly, steadily, curiously unraveling"). It defines her methodology and stakes. The concept enables her confiding choice (she reveals her true work to gain better data). Strong setup, development, and payoff; the story's logic depends on this exact analytical frame.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Steadily curious" appears once as a label in paragraph four ("She was steadily curious about what would emerge"). It colors Vera's patience and data-gathering across beats, but the trait is told rather than dramatized through a specific constrained choice. The curiosity motivates her project broadly but does not force a visible tradeoff on the page. Functional but closer to ornamental trait than a pressure point that alters tactics with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vera's confiding is the story's hinge: "she began to confide in him—not about his future, but about her project." This disclosure risks exposure ("You're analyzing us?") and shifts Marcus from client to subject, enabling his final vulnerable choice. Setup (her hidden true work), development (the confession scene), payoff (his unguarded Moon reach is the data she sought). The action redefines their interaction and makes the closure possible. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"By multiplying paths—tracking every possible choice against every actual choice" is explained in the confiding beat and visualized through Vera's journal diagrams ("branching trees of decisions, probability maps"). The method defines her analytical approach and appears in her recording of Marcus's choices. Present across setup and development, but the mechanics do not constrain a specific on-page tactic or visibly shape the ending—Vera's measuring and recording could proceed without the reader grasping the multiplication metaphor. Solid thematic presence, moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is anchored in the opening line, returns at closure ("the rain kept falling"), and supplies tactile micro-setting (worn Persian rug, iron door, water-spotted glass). The space's affordability "after the cryptocurrency crashes" contextualizes Vera's position. The setting provides atmosphere and a concrete anchor for action but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome. Early signal, purposeful reprise, but the scene could unfold in another intimate space with minor edits. Mid-band integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The cryptocurrency crashes are signaled in the opening line, contextualize Marcus's desperation, and supply the dataset Vera exploits ("hundreds of desperate clients"). The timeframe shapes the stakes (why Marcus appears now, why Vera has abundant data) but does not function as a live clock that tightens tactics beat-to-beat. The crashes are backdrop rather than active pressure. Present in setup and thematically relevant, but swappable with another financial or social collapse. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vera's desire to map cultural patterns is dramatized through her measuring, her journal, her three-year project, and her confiding choice. The motivation drives her decision to reveal her work to Marcus (risk vs. insight tradeoff) and charges the ending when she gains the exact data point she seeks. Setup, development, and payoff are clear; the goal shapes on-page tactics with visible cost (professional exposure). Strong causal integration; the story exists to pursue this question.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tone is consistent: measured, patient, tinged with rain and aftermath. The "inherited mystery" is signaled through the grandmother's measuring tape and the parallel crashes, and it modulates subtly when Marcus cracks ("the moment—the crack in the armor she had seen so many times"). The tone supports the accumulative structure and charges the final image ("the onyx cards whispered their secrets to anyone patient enough to listen"). Present across the arc and coherent through turns, though it does not undergo a decisive shift that reweights pressure. Solid tonal control, mid-to-upper band.</comment>
