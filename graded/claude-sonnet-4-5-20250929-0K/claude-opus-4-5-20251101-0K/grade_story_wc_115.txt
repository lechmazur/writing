<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is sustained and particularized through concrete micro-choices (touching the amber bead, photographing evidence, sitting against the wall in exhaustion). The discovery process dramatizes his internal shift from skeptical explorer to someone accepting the weight of evidence. Interior monologue avoids therapy-speak and stays embodied ("understanding settling into his bones with terrible weight"). Minor weakness: the seventeen-year carrying of "swallowed truths" reads slightly abstract and the final resolve ("He would make them count") edges toward declaration rather than embodied choice, but the prior tactile engagement with the beads earns the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus's understanding crystallizes in the valve room, reweighting his seventeen-year search with visible cost (the weight "heavier but somehow easier to carry"). The causal chain holds—radio calls lead to valve room, beads confirm Daniela's presence, and the decision to drag the ghost shift into daylight forecloses his private grief. Orientation anchors early (tunnel, factory, three AM). One meaningful deepening occurs when physical discovery (amber bead) converts skepticism into testimonial duty. Cost is legible on the page in both his exhaustion and the shift from personal excavation to public witness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The valve room operates as micro-setting that constrains and charges the closure: the wheel with beads becomes both memorial and evidence, forcing Marcus's realization. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("dust-thick air," "pipes that snaked toward the ceiling like frozen serpents"), filtered through Marcus's professional explorer lens. The three AM timeframe and underground loading dock anchor spatial choreography cleanly. The amber bead's scratched surface provides tactile specificity that charges the final touch. Minor gap: the tunnel itself remains somewhat generic beyond "gravel" and "rusted track switches," but the valve room's particularity compensates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding Daniela's truth) is signaled early and tightens decisively when the amber bead confirms her presence, narrowing Marcus's options from private excavation to public testimony. The discovery escalates pressure through concrete objects: radio calls → valve room → beaded wheel → amber bead. Agency crystallizes in his decision to "make them count," which forecloses the option of private closure. The cost is visible (seventeen years resolved, new burden accepted) and the final choice grows organically from prior causality. One strong tightening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars without thesis statement: thirty-seven beads become both erasure and commemoration, the ghost shift literalizes economic invisibility, and Marcus's shift from skeptic to witness enacts the piece's central question about belief and evidence. The valve wheel memorial—placed by "someone with no other power to mark her passing"—offers a resonant answer about how the powerless bear witness. Clara's repeated call ("someone needs to count them properly") refracts through Marcus's final counting without becoming didactic. The amber bead's return charges the ending with non-literal weight, reweighting his skepticism as a form of preparation for this reckoning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries distinct texture ("religiously skeptical," "parsing the desperation for geographical details") and Marcus's professional explorer lens shapes what he notices. The metaphor density is high but mostly controlled ("confession waiting to spill," "frozen serpents," "drowsy alertness"). Minor slip: "ghost shift" as both literal (illegal workers) and metaphorical (unseen labor) creates slight register tension, and "excavated them or died trying" in paragraph three edges toward elevated diction that doesn't fully match the grounded explorer voice established elsewhere. Clara's radio voice is texturally distinct from Marcus's interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (each beat advances discovery or understanding). Clarity remains strong through complex revelation. Minor deductions: "that peculiar drowsy alertness of three in the morning" is somewhat abstract for a professional explorer's perception; "the tunnel seemed to hold its breath" and "that hush that follows a sudden confession" create light metaphoric stacking in adjacent paragraphs; "religious skeptical" and later "skeptics like himself" repeat the concept without added pressure. The final sequence avoids loops and propels cleanly. No pronoun drift or spatial confusion. Overallcraft is strong with small texture redundancies that don't obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ghost shift concept transforms familiar "abandoned factory" territory through specific historical detail (recession-era illegal shifts, foster-care girls, memorial beads). The valve wheel as secret monument is a fresh synthesis that avoids the obvious (hidden bodies, direct confession). Marcus's occupation (reckless explorer) particularizes the search beyond generic detective work. Minor limitation: the "urban explorer finds sister's trace" premise remains within recognizable territory and the seventeen-year timeline is conventional. The radio-psychic intermediary (Clara) adds texture but the core emotional arc—skeptic accepts evidence, vows to tell the truth—follows expected beats. Specific execution elevates familiar elements without fully transcending the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's reckless explorer trait appears early (asbestos, collapsing floors) and shapes his decision to enter the tunnel alone at 3 AM, advancing the inciting action. His professional lens filters setting perception (maintenance carts, valve room recognition). The trait enables the discovery but doesn't constrain a later choice with visible cost—his shift to careful photographer at the end reverses the recklessness without friction. Present in setup and development; payoff is present but the trait doesn't create a late tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel is discovered mid-story, drives the climactic realization (thirty-seven girls counted), and charges the final image when Marcus touches the amber bead before leaving. Each bead's color and the wheel's physical presence (rusted spokes, central pipe mounting) provide irreplaceable specificity. The object transforms from setting detail to memorial to evidence across three beats, narrowing Marcus's interpretive options and crystallizing his testimonial duty. Removing this exact object would collapse the closure. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ghost shift concept is seeded through Clara's radio calls, shapes Marcus's search method (coded panic, uncounted girls), and delivers the story's central revelation when the valve room confirms illegal night workers. The concept redefines the factory from simple abandonment to site of systemic erasure, altering both Marcus's understanding and his forward commitment. It operates as premise, investigative lens, and thematic spine. The term appears early, middle, and at closure. Irreplaceable: the story's logic depends on this specific labor exploitation rather than generic disappearance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Religiously skeptical" is stated early and frames Marcus's approach (dismisses miracles, hunts personal ghosts, doesn't believe in spirits). It explains why he listens to psychic calls as data rather than mysticism, enabling his interpretive method. However, the trait doesn't constrain a peak choice with visible cost—his acceptance of the beads as evidence doesn't dramatize a skeptic's resistance being overcome. The attribute contextualizes but remains largely label-level; no moment where his skepticism costs him or must be visibly sacrificed. Functional but not transformative.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Appraise" governs the climactic beat: Marcus counts thirty-seven beads with "trembling fingers," finding the amber one that confirms Daniela. The action is irreplaceable (counting/appraising versus simply seeing) because it literalizes making the girls count and dramatizes his shift from searcher to witness. The verb appears twice, charging both the enumeration and the final understanding. Removing this specific action would weaken the thematic closure (someone needs to count them properly). Strong causal and thematic integration; drives the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method (interpreting Clara's frantic radio calls) is seeded early, shapes Marcus's six-month research, and provides the roadmap (valve room, beaded wheel, tunnel) that enables discovery. He listens in earbuds throughout, and Clara's voice loops at the end, bracketing the revelation. The calls function as both clue delivery and thematic echo (desperation, the need to be heard). Swappability test: any encoded witness could substitute, but the talk-radio specificity adds period texture. Present across setup, development, and payoff; drives two beats and constrains his search path.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel is the story's sole location, frames all action, and provides the valve room where closure occurs. It supplies the underground access that makes the ghost shift spatially plausible (loading dock, hidden entrance) and its abandonment enables Marcus's solo exploration. The setting's physical properties (gravel, track switches, piping) ground each beat and the tunnel mouth bookends the narrative (enters, will exit). Removing this exact setting would break the story's logic. Strong integration: early anchor, shapes tactics, charges final image (leaving the tunnel equals bringing Daniela out).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "drowsy alertness of three in the morning" and "hush that follows a sudden confession" appear as tonal descriptors and metaphoric frames. Three AM is mentioned once to establish atmosphere; the confession metaphor opens and returns at the valve room discovery. The timeframe doesn't create urgency or constrain choices (no ticking clock), functioning more as mood. The "hush" imagery charges the final silence when Marcus sits in realization, adding emotional weight. Present in setup and payoff; reweights the dominant stake lyrically but doesn't tighten tactics. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-band scoring.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Finding "the weight of a swallowed truth" drives every beat: Marcus enters the tunnel to excavate what lodged in his chest at fifteen, interprets Clara's calls as scripture, and the discovery makes the weight "heavier but somehow easier to carry." The motivation is dramatized through physical search, embodied in his trembling fingers and exhaustion, and transforms at closure when private truth becomes public testimony. The phrasing recurs purposefully (swallowed at fifteen, dissolving at the valve room, resettling as testimonial duty). Irreplaceable: the story is this excavation. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Drowsy alertness is introduced as "that peculiar drowsy alertness of three in the morning" and modulates through the discovery: dust-thick air, slow movements, then sharpening "into something clearer" at the valve room. The tone supports the piece's liminal quality (between sleep/waking, past/present, ghost/evidence) and charges the final sitting-in-exhaustion beat. It remains coherent across the single scene without static repetition. The tone's sleepwalking quality makes the sudden clarity of counting feel earned. Present early, modulates under pressure, contributes to final image's weight. Strong tonal control that serves closure.</comment>
