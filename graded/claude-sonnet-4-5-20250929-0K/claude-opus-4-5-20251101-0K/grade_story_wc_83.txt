<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Yara's interiority is specific and embodied—"intangibly tangible now, a physical object that somehow felt like holding smoke" grounds her survivor's state in concrete sensation. Her motivation (hunting unused potential as a way to prove deaths weren't inevitable) drives every choice from calculations to recording coordinates. The therapist's "survivor's guilt" diagnosis is credibly rejected in favor of "incompleteness," showing self-aware contradiction. Minor slip: the phrase "unfiltered awakening in the worst possible way" edges toward label-speak, though it's quickly grounded in the rubble scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Yara's isolation, the geode's shifting weight from intangible to real, and the spike on the readout deepen her obsessive hunt without requiring a causal reversal. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image reweights "unused potential" as "not the same as wasted hope" and the geode becomes "impossibly, unbearably real," crystallizing her endurance with felt cost. The middle deepens but doesn't tighten options as sharply as the high band requires; the coordinates are recorded with trembling fingers, but no tactical shift follows on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating observatory is vividly particular—"clouds below churned in patterns that resembled brain tissue, folds and valleys of gray matter contemplating nothing"—and the viewport, console, and geode anchor micro-setting throughout. The observatory's groan when wind shifts and the breakers' cooling cycle create spatial and temporal texture. The geode's purple light scattering across walls charges the final image. The setting constrains Yara's choices (twenty-minute wait, isolation miles above earth) and the final sentence ties "floating observatory, suspended between stars and storms" directly to her stance, meeting the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving deaths weren't inevitable by charting unused potential—is signaled early and sustained. The spike on the readout provides one meaningful tightening that narrows Yara's search and validates her method, raising the cost of failure. The breakers' reset functions as a micro turn, but the escalation is more accumulative than decisive; Yara records coordinates and continues the hunt without a visible tradeoff that forecloses a path. The final paragraph confirms endurance with cost ("sustained by nothing but bleak exhilaration"), but the price isn't dramatized as a foreclosed option on the page—she will "continue the hunt tomorrow" without visible constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the geode's transformation from intangible to real, the perturbation equations seeking unresolved futures, and the final assertion that "unused potential was not the same as wasted hope." The wedding-fire imagery and the hunt for "blueprints for a different world" ground the theme in specific loss rather than abstraction. The ending offers a resonant answer—Yara's calculations won't resurrect the dead but might prove alternatives to cruelty existed—without moralizing. Minor slip: "bleak exhilaration" is named twice in identical phrasing, and "stubborn conviction" edges toward platitude, though the surrounding particulars (geode warmth, clouds' slow rotation) anchor it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature—Yara notices "breath fog the glass where stars should have been visible" and interprets clouds as "brain tissue...contemplating nothing," filtering setting through her scientific lens and survivor's consciousness. Diction stays controlled ("perturbation theory," "wave functions") without slipping into lecture. The prose modulates from clinical calculation to sensory immediacy ("copper and ash") under pressure. Very minor slip: "the sensation of being half-awake in a world that demanded full consciousness" is slightly over-articulated for peak stress, though it remains character-plausible given Yara's analytical bent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high—most sentences advance character, setting, or theme simultaneously. Rhythm varies purposefully: short declarative "Breakers cooled. Systems online" accelerates the tempo, while longer sentences ("Now she sought another awakening, one she could control") breathe with Yara's reflection. No loops or scaffold. Minor density issue: "She would continue the hunt tomorrow, and the day after, for as long as the station remained aloft" is a future-tense summary that slightly deflates the charged present of the closure moment, and "Not for vengeance, not for closure" uses negation where positive assertion would be tighter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—survivor using quantum perturbation theory to map unused potential—synthesizes grief narrative with speculative physics in a non-obvious way. The floating observatory and geode as recurring anchor are specific. The transformation of "intangibly tangible" to "impossibly, unbearably real" feels earned rather than clever. Risk: the scientific frame could have been generic, but "pools of possibility that the universe had somehow forgotten to spend" particularizes it. Modest limitation: the hunt-for-meaning-after-trauma arc is structurally familiar, and while the quantum lens refreshes it, the emotional trajectory (isolation → mapping loss → stubborn conviction) follows a recognizable template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: present in paragraph 2 (brother Tariq, wedding, fire). Development: the "unfiltered awakening" flashback (adjusting veil → rubble) shapes her need for "another awakening, one she could control." Closure: her continued hunt is framed by the conviction that deaths "had not been inevitable," directly linking survivor identity to stakes. The character's choices (recording coordinates, returning to equations) flow from this identity. Two gates clearly met; closure linkage is strong but the middle choice (recording the spike) doesn't foreclose a path, so causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: introduced paragraph 2. Development: handled twice—once when she studies its amethyst interior while waiting, again when it catches the screen's glow and scatters purple light. Closure: "the geode warm now in her palm, no longer intangible but impossibly, unbearably real" transforms its meaning and charges the final image. The shift from intangible to real mirrors Yara's emotional arc and constrains her perception (beauty in hollow spaces). Three gates met; the specificity (hollow interior, amethyst, purple light) and thematic repricing elevate the score, though it doesn't enable a tactical choice mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: "unfiltered awakening" introduced in paragraph 5. Development: the brutal awakening (veil → rubble) is contrasted with "another awakening, one she could control," shaping her method choice. Closure: the concept returns implicitly in "stubborn conviction" and the quest to prove alternatives existed. Two gates met. The concept shapes her motivation but doesn't constrain a specific on-page choice with cost; it functions more as thematic frame than tactical pressure. The lyric reprise (seeking controlled awakening vs. suffering unfiltered one) reweights the stake enough to reach mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 2, "intangibly tangible now, a physical object that somehow felt like holding smoke." Development: the attribute colors her perception throughout (holding memory that slips through fingers). Closure: inverted to "no longer intangible but impossibly, unbearably real." The trait constrains her emotional state but doesn't enable or block a physical action with cost. Two gates met via lyric reprise, but the attribute remains descriptive rather than causal. The transformation is purposeful and charges the ending, lifting it into mid-5s; lack of middle action choice prevents higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: introduced end of paragraph 3, "she sought...to hunt for the places where unused potential pools." Development: the hunt drives the middle beat—loading data, calculations scrolling, spike appearing, recording coordinates. Closure: "she calculated her way toward an answer that might never come" and commits to continuing "the hunt tomorrow." Three gates met. The action is indispensable; removing it collapses the plot. The hunt doesn't foreclose a visible path on the page (she will continue identically tomorrow), so causal irreplaceability is strong but cost-linkage is moderate, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 4, "Through perturbation theory, she had developed a method." Development: the method is executed—"perturbation equations scrolled across her screen, each variable representing a tiny deviation"—and produces the spike. Closure: "she calculated her way toward an answer" confirms the method's ongoing use. Three gates met. The mechanics matter (equations detect unresolved quantum states, third pocket this month), but the theory could be swapped for another speculative detection method with minor edits. Specificity (small disturbances, wave functions) and the spike's payoff lift it into mid-6s, but the method is more explanatory than tactically constraining.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 1, "floating observatory...suspended above clouds." Development: the observatory's groan, the viewport, console, and clouds anchor every beat; isolation "miles above a world" shapes her bleak exhilaration. Closure: "In the silence of the floating observatory, suspended between stars and storms" charges the final sentence. Three gates met. The setting constrains choice (circuit breakers force waiting, isolation enables obsessive focus) and the final image depends on this exact suspension. Spatial irreplaceability and closure charge are strong; removing the observatory would require fundamental rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 1, "perhaps twenty minutes while they cooled." Development: "Two more minutes" and "The console chirped. Breakers cooled. Systems online." track the window. Closure: no reference to time in the ending. Two gates met (setup, middle), but closure participation is absent. The timeframe creates mild urgency mid-story but doesn't tighten the final choice or alter Yara's stance. The twenty-minute window is swappable (could be ten or thirty) without changing tactics. Functional but not essential; missing closure gate caps the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 4, "to hunt for the places where unused potential pools." Development: the motivation is dramatized—trembling fingers recording coordinates, "heart accelerating" at the spike—and creates friction when she admits the hunt "might never come" yet she persists. Closure: "sustained by nothing but bleak exhilaration and the stubborn conviction that unused potential was not the same as wasted hope" crystallizes the motivation with visible cost (endurance against futility). Three gates met. The want (prove deaths weren't inevitable) conflicts with the fear (answer may never come), and her choice to continue forecloses rest. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 6, "a bleak exhilaration in this isolation." Development: the tone modulates—clinical calculation, visceral flashback ("copper and ash"), then the "bleak exhilaration" returns when Yara finds the spike. Closure: "sustained by nothing but bleak exhilaration" charges the final image, pairing despair with relentless drive. Three gates met. The tone is coherent through turns and shaped by pressure, though the exact phrase "bleak exhilaration" is repeated identically twice, reducing variation. The oxymoron fits the ending's charge (futility + stubborn action), but minor repetition and the tone's static naming prevent higher placement.</comment>
