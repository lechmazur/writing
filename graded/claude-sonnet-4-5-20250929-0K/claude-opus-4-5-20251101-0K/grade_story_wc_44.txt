<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior life has specificity—her relearning process and grandmother's legacy ground her choices. However, the key character decision (activating the automaton, then accepting its teaching) arrives without visible internal contradiction or cost; she moves from question to solution too smoothly. The automaton's arrival deflates her agency into passive instruction-receiving. Emotional embodiment is thin: "her heart raced" is the only physiological marker in a scene that should carry high stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Causal. Orientation anchors (floating isle, observatory, Mira) arrive cleanly in the opening. The closure unit—shadows beginning their return as Mira completes sealing runes—registers as a Decisive Change, but the cost is conceptual and diffuse ("ready to face whatever came next") rather than felt on the page. The automaton's awakening provides answers that Mira accepts without friction, flattening causality into exposition. The "loops" metaphor in the final line gestures at thematic resonance but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating isle, twilight clouds, and brass dome create a vivid sensory frame anchored early. The observatory's telescopes "pointed not at stars, but at the spaces between them" is a strong, specific detail that supports the concept. However, the environment remains largely decorative after the opening; spatial choreography (where the key slot is, how the automaton rises, Mira's position relative to the telescope) is vague during the critical middle beats. The setting does not constrain her choices or supply obstacles.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring noon-shadows—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal: Mira inserts the key, the automaton explains the problem, and she begins the solution without a reversal or tightening that narrows her options. The automaton's correction of her rune angles is told rather than dramatized, so we never see her struggle or pay a visible price. The ending promises future stakes ("whatever came next") but does not deliver on-page cost tied to this closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—rebuilding knowledge in a bent reality, closing loops versus beginning them—emerges organically from Mira's relearning and the automaton's guidance. The recurring "loops" motif (spoons curling, closing cracks, final paradox) ties image to concept without overt moralizing. However, the final line's epigram ("Some loops, she realized, were meant to be closed. Others were meant to begin") leans toward a stated thesis rather than letting the image resonate. The piece invites reflection but tips into summarizing its own theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Mira's perceptual signature—tracing runes, noting bent spoons, focusing on mechanical precision—is consistent and character-specific. The automaton's dialogue ("voice like chimes in distant wind") carries distinct texture. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("borrowed starlight," "flower remembering spring") that feels more authorial than character-filtered. Psychic distance is well-controlled; the narrative stays close to Mira's knowledge state without leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the opening hook ("spoons had bent three days ago, curling in on themselves like dying leaves") is strong. Clarity is generally high, though "relearn" in "She had spent weeks learning to relearn" is awkward phrasing. Minor template cadence in the automaton sequence: "From the floor rose…Its eyes were dark glass…Something that remembered…" uses parallel inversion that reads slightly mechanical. No major loops or scaffold, but information density could be tighter—several beats (automaton unfolding, Mira's practice weeks) are told where dramatization would add pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The bent-reality premise and "where do shadows go at noon?" are fresh angles on a fantasy scholar-mystery. The automaton as guide and the "closing loops" mechanic integrate concept and plot. However, the core structure—novice scholar awakens ancient guide, receives instruction, begins solution—follows a familiar template without transforming it through unexpected cost or complication. The spoons, key, and runes feel purposeful but not irreplaceable; near-synonyms (coins bend, ancient staff, sigils) could substitute with minor edits. Emotional specificity in Mira's journey toward mastery is underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira (budding rune scholar) is present throughout and her relearning process is central. She makes two key choices: inserting the key and accepting the automaton's teaching. However, these are low-friction decisions; she does not face a dilemma or trade-off. The "budding" aspect is told more than shown—we hear she's learning but see little struggle. She appears in all three gates but her scholar status does not constrain her in a way that creates visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The clockwork automaton key is introduced early (setup gate), used functionally when Mira inserts it (development gate), and mentioned in the final paragraph as "warm in her pocket" (closure gate). It appears in three distinct beats and its specific property (inscribed symbols matching nothing in beginner's texts) matters. However, it does not return with reweighted meaning; the final mention is a static reprise. The key enables the solution but does not constrain Mira's choices or create friction. Its irreplaceability is moderate—any heirloom unlock could serve.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Sealed awakenings" is embodied in the automaton locked behind wards and Mira's act of unsealing it. The concept appears in setup (sealed automaton), development (key insertion and awakening), and closure (automaton standing sentinel). It shapes the central stake—awakening the guide to solve the shadow problem—and alters tactics by providing knowledge Mira lacked. However, the "sealed" aspect does not create meaningful resistance; the key fits smoothly and the automaton cooperates immediately. Specificity is present but cost is low.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Quietly deliberate" is applied to Mira twice: once at the central mechanism, once when she begins tracing runes. The trait is shown through her careful, methodical movements rather than merely labeled. However, it does not constrain or enable a key choice with visible cost—Mira's deliberateness is a behavioral note, not a force that creates friction or trade-off. The attribute is present and consistent but functionally ornamental; a more impulsive character could follow the same plot beats with minor rephrasing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Relearn" is signaled early ("She had spent weeks learning to relearn") and recurs throughout: relearning runes, the automaton teaching precision, Mira "relearning, rebuilding knowledge." The action shapes her understanding and is causally linked to the closure—she must relearn to close the loops. However, the process is mostly told in summary; we do not see a specific failed attempt followed by correction that would demonstrate the cost of relearning. The major turn (shadows beginning their return) traces to this action but the mechanics remain abstract. Present in all three gates but could be swapped with "master" or "adapt" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Closing loops" as method is introduced midway (the automaton explains that cracks must be sealed and loops closed) and appears at closure (Mira tracing sealing runes, final line about loops). It is causally active—the method determines her technique—and is signaled before the ending. However, it arrives late (past the first third, introduced by the automaton rather than set up earlier) and its mechanics are vague; we do not see how closing a loop differs from simply sealing. The method shapes the ending but its specificity is low; "seal the cracks" or "restore the wards" could substitute. Setup gate is weak, development and closure gates are met.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle is vividly established in the opening and provides the spatial frame for the entire story. It appears in all three gates: Mira climbs the stairs (setup), approaches the central mechanism (development), and works there as false dawn touches the isle's edges (closure). The setting supplies the automaton and telescopes as resources. However, it does not constrain Mira's choices—she faces no environmental obstacle or pressure. The isle's perpetual twilight and drifting motion are atmospheric but do not alter tactics. Strong early signal and causal presence, but limited pressure role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After spoons bend reality" as timeframe is anchored in the opening line ("three days ago") and recurs as context (the bending changed light, runes, and laws). It provides the inciting condition for Mira's quest. However, the "three days ago" marker does not create urgency or tighten decisions; time does not pressure her choices on the page. The ending notes "false dawn" but elapsed time within the scene is untracked. Setup gate is met, but development and closure gates are weak—the timeframe is context rather than a live constraint. Present after the first line but mostly ornamental beyond establishing the altered reality.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—to find where shadows go at noon—is stated early and drives her to the observatory and the automaton. It appears in all three gates: the opening question, her query to the automaton, and the closure as shadows begin their return. The motivation is dramatized through her actions (climbing, inserting the key) but not conflicted; she pursues it without hesitation or competing desire. No visible friction between the want and a cost—she asks, receives an answer, and begins the solution. The motivation is clear and causal but lacks the complexity or trade-off that would lift it into higher bands.</comment>
