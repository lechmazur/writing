<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and philosophically distinct ("to find the beginning in every ending"), grounded in concrete actions: climbing, splicing, tuning. Her interiority shows contradictory impulses—she weeps without knowing why—and her professional competence balances genuine struggle (frequencies "screaming," filters reversed). The Hollywood star fragment embodies her worldview through embodied micro-choices (touching it, feeling its warmth), though the climactic weeping lacks a specific embodied trigger beyond "truth." Internal voice remains consistent under pressure with no significant knowledge leaps.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored by ~40 words (Mira, Spire Nine, gorge, Voxhaven). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the perigee approach, filter removal, and the "shard of hush" descent, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where silence reweights her stance—"endings were not walls but doors"—with conceptual cost felt in her weeping and the decision to return with recordings. The tightening is meaningful: reversing amplification and discarding filters narrows her technical options and charges the final image of towers "ready to receive." One persistent constraint (the moon's proximity as a live clock) shapes the entire attempt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voxhaven's suspended gorge-city is vivid and purposeful: "rusted ladder," "perpetual mist," "cables and platforms" ground the vertical risk and isolation. The console's "dials frozen with corrosion" constrains her splice work, and the moonrise over the gorge's edge times the signal attempt. Sensory detail is selective—"serenely electric" atmosphere, "texture" of cosmic silence, warmth of the star fragment—filtered through Mira's professional priorities. The towers' shift from "abandoned" to "waiting" charges the final image, though spatial choreography of the platform summit could be sharper during the tuning sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (receive celestial signals during perigee) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful reversal: initial static "like screaming" forces her to discard filters and reverse amplification, a decision with immediate cost (abandoning "comfortable notion that communication meant words"). The lunar perigee functions as a live constraint, and her agency—stripping assumptions, removing interference filters—drives the tightening. The closure lands with felt cost: she records "only shadows," will attempt translation tomorrow, but gains "strange peace" that forecloses her prior need for verbal meaning. Coincidence (moon timing) complicates but does not resolve; her technical choices enable reception.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme (endings as beginnings, silence as signal) emerges from concrete actions: reversing the array, hearing death-songs threaded with chemical promise, the fragment warming. The closure offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"nothing truly ended. It only changed frequency"—earned through her technical struggle and the "shard of hush" descent. Subtext operates in the Hollywood star's "anonymous fame, returned to potential" and towers learning to listen after shouting. Minor slip: "that was the practical magic of her work" in the penultimate section edges toward theme statement, though it remains grounded in her occupation. No overt moralizing at closure; the final image reweights prior material without declaring a lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with narrative certainty matching Mira's knowledge and professional lexicon ("celestial signal interpreter," "amplification cascade"). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices corrosion, frequencies, and chemical promises where others would see abandonment. Diction remains controlled—"texture," "shard of hush," "serenely electric"—with purposeful compression in the climax ("what came through was not sound but texture"). Minor register drift: "the willing­ness to hear what others dismissed as noise" in the final section reads slightly instructional rather than fully embodied thought. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally strong with varied syntax and high information density. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Minor scaffold issues: "She was a celestial signal interpreter by trade, one of the few who..." front-loads exposition without immediate pressure; "Her motivation was simple, though others called it paradoxical" tells rather than dramatizes. Paraphrase loop near climax: "what came through was not sound but texture" followed by "Within that silence, she heard everything" restates the paradox without adding pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in middle: "She removed... She reversed... She stripped..." runs three identical stems without taught pattern (−0.4). "Serenely electric" appears twice (platform, dark) without functional shift. No figurative muddle, grammar clean, momentum generally propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Core premise—signal interpreter discarding assumptions to hear cosmic silence—offers a fresh angle on first-contact material through the radio-tower graveyard and the perigee constraint. The Hollywood star fragment as "anonymous fame returned to potential" is a specific, non-obvious synthesis that charges her philosophy. Transformation is partial: the plot structure (climb, struggle, reversal, insight, descent) and emotional arc (professional determination → weeping revelation → peace) could transfer to another setting with similar beats. The "shard of hush" as tactile silence and towers learning to listen show ingenuity, though the closure insight—endings as doors—trends toward familiar wisdom. No close echoes of famous lines; risk-taking in the cosmic-silence conceit heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira (celestial signal interpreter) drives three key beats: climb decision, filter-reversal choice, and recording/descent decision. Setup is immediate (paragraph one occupation). Development: her choice to discard filters and reverse amplification (middle third) narrows options under pressure. Closure: she records and descends with "strange peace," a stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual (accepting "only shadows") and relational (returning to interpreters to "try to translate"). Swappability is moderate—another technical role could substitute with edits—but her specific skill (parsing celestial transmissions) enables the reversal tactic. Score: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4, cost connection +0.4, minus swappability −0.6, minus summary-only descent −0.2 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Hollywood star fragment is introduced early (paragraph four) and returns in two beats: worn name = "anonymous fame, returned to potential" (setup), and grows warm during signal reception (climax). The warmth moment charges the closure by embodying her philosophy, but the fragment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it observes rather than acts. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, specificity (genuine Walk of Fame piece, worn name) +0.5, ornamental in middle beat −0.6, no causal pressure −0.5 = ~5.8. Lyric reprise is purposeful but passive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Shard of hush" appears at climax ("a shard of hush descended") as the signal's form, shaping the reception: Mira experiences cosmic silence with "weight and presence," hears death-songs within it, and this reweights her understanding. Setup is conceptual (title nod, silence theme), development is minimal (not named until climax), closure is strong (the shard embodies the signal and charges her revelation). The phrase's unique properties—silence as fragment, tactile—are irreplaceable. Setup delay −0.3, one major beat +0.4, strong causal pressure (redefines what "signal" means) +1.2, closure centrality +1.4, high specificity +0.7, cost connection (weeping, acceptance) +0.5, late arrival (climax only) −0.6 = ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" appears twice: platform atmosphere (paragraph five) and final dark (late). Both are descriptive labels without constraining action or enabling a choice. The trait does not alter Mira's tactics or create a tradeoff. Setup +0.4, two mentions in separate beats +0.5, ornamental use −0.8, no causal pressure −0.7, no closure action linkage (cameo mention only) −0.3, label-only pattern −0.3 = ~4.8. The attribute colors tone but does not drive plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Tune" is the central action: Mira attempts tuning (paragraph seven), fails (static screaming), then succeeds by reversing the array (paragraph eight). This action drives the major turn and enables closure. Setup +0.6, three beats (attempt, failure, success) +1.4, strong causal pressure (reversal narrows options, changes what she can receive) +1.4, closure linkage (recordings depend on successful tuning) +1.2, irreplaceability (tuning is specific to radio work) +0.6, cost (discarding assumptions, accepting "shadows") +0.5 = ~7.9. The verb is swappable with "calibrate" or "adjust," capping below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"By discarding assumptions" is signaled in paragraph eight: "By discarding assumptions, she could rebuild the logic." Mira removes filters, reverses amplification, and strips the "comfortable notion"—three mechanical steps that embody the method. The means shapes her middle attempt and enables the signal reception. Setup is late (second half) −0.4, one extended beat +0.4, moderate causal pressure (changes approach, not just attitude) +0.9, closure enabler +0.8, specificity (three concrete steps) +0.5, told via summary opener ("By discarding...") −0.4 = ~6.4. The method is enacted but also labeled.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Voxhaven (abandoned radio tower city over gorge) is introduced early, provides the console resource, and supplies vertical isolation that justifies the perigee advantage. The gorge's "perpetual mist" and suspended platforms create risk during the climb. The towers' shift from "abandoned" to "waiting" in the final image recharges the setting. Setup +0.7, two beats (climb, final image) +0.9, moderate causal pressure (provides console, isolation) +0.7, closure linkage (towers reweighted) +1.0, specificity (gorge, cables, radio history) +0.6, no mid-scene constraint −0.3, postcard description in paragraph two −0.4 = ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lunar perigee is signaled early (paragraph two: "tonight, during lunar perigee"), drives the timing (paragraph six: "The moon rose"), and the signal's success depends on it ("moon's proximity amplify signals"). The timeframe creates urgency and a live clock. Setup +0.7, two beats (approach, culmination) +0.9, strong causal pressure (enables the array to resonate, "even the dead towers might") +1.1, closure linkage (dawn arrival marks the window's end) +1.0, specificity (perigee as closest approach) +0.6, cost connection (must climb and work within the window) +0.4, no mid-scene countdown tension −0.4 = ~7.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To find the beginning in every ending" is stated in paragraph three and dramatized in the climax: Mira hears death-songs with "chemical promise of new worlds," a civilization's final message with "formula for hope." Her descent with "strange peace" and the closing reflection ("nothing truly ended. It only changed frequency") enact the motivation. Setup +0.6, two beats (philosophy stated, enacted at climax) +0.9, moderate friction (philosophy vs. technical frustration when static screams) +0.7, closure linkage (peace and return embody the motivation) +1.1, told early rather than shown through choice −0.5, cost connection (acceptance of "shadows") +0.4, summary in final paragraphs −0.3 = ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality" coheres throughout: gorge-city and celestial signals (fantasy) grounded in splicing circuitry, dials, and amplification cascades (practical). Tone modulates from climb determination to frustrated static to reverent reception to pragmatic descent. The line "Fantasy had its place, but machinery demanded respect for physical law" explicitly balances the elements. The closure sustains the tone: Mira's "practical magic" is "patience, equipment, and the willingness to hear." Setup (balanced from paragraph one) +0.7, three phases (climb, tuning, descent) +1.4, coherent modulation under pressure +0.9, closure charge ("practical magic" phrase, towers ready) +1.2, specificity (technical verbs, cosmic imagery) +0.6, stated rather than purely embodied in one line −0.4, slight label redundancy ("practical magic") −0.4 = ~7.0.</comment>
