<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies across tides—collecting erased histories to validate her husband's existence and her own survival. Her interior contradiction between the woman who trusted documents and the one who trusts "texture of memories" is embodied through her method of layering fragments. The final choice to confront the doctor is earned by the overheard conversation that links her false death certificate to a pattern of erasures. Minor weakness: the secondary men in the container scene remain voice-indistinct, but they serve as pressure rather than full characters, so the slip is small.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (unnamed survivor), where (port container maze), and when (low tide, tonight) within the first two paragraphs. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: she layers fragments across tides until the overheard conversation about the Meridian reweights all prior material, narrowing her options to direct confrontation. Closure lands as Charged Poise—"tomorrow she would begin again, collecting new fragments"—with the cost felt in her patient, irreducible stance and the glass-pressed label as monument. One meaningful deepening (the Meridian revelation) tightens her investigation into a named target, satisfying the escalation requirement for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vividly particular: corrugated steel walls, rust and salt, towering eight stories, mud flats at low tide, sodium-orange port lights. Setting constrains her movement (tide cycles force climb/descent) and enables her method (acoustic canyons amplify smugglers' voices). The glass-pressed poison label is a recurring micro-object that charges the closure when she resolves to show it to the doctor. Spatial choreography is clear across vertical and horizontal moves, and the maze's designed erasure mirrors the thematic question without overt symbol.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: prove her husband and the Meridian existed, resist bureaucratic erasure. The overheard men's conversation delivers one meaningful tightening—she learns the same poison notation appears on multiple certificates, linking her case to a pattern—which narrows her options from abstract wandering to direct confrontation. The choice to approach the doctor tomorrow is protagonist-driven and forecloses passive collection. Cost is legible: she risks exposure as someone already "dead," and the label becomes evidence rather than keepsake. One secondary accent (her own survival) braids cleanly without diluting pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges through the container maze (designed to lose things), the glass-pressed label (preserved evidence), and her method of layering fragments into monuments. No thesis statement; the final image—"building monuments to the erased in the only material that mattered: the irreducible weight of remembered lives"—reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the men's casual tone about "cleaning house," her silence as she listens, and the tide's rhythm as both constraint and metaphor. The question of how to prove reality against erasure is answered through her embodied patience and material evidence, not epiphany.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through her altered perception post-death. Perceptual signature is distinct: she sees "spaces between official records," filters reality through "texture of memories," feels the tide "in her bones." Diction remains within her contemplative, precise register; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal (two smugglers) but carries subtext and advances plot by revealing the Meridian and poison pattern. Psychic distance is consistent; the prose reflects her state without therapy-speak. Minor note: the men's voices lack distinct idiom, but they function as overheard fragments rather than full characters, so the slip is small.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Information density is high: "She had no name anymore, not since the hospital issued a death certificate with her photograph and someone else's cause of death" anchors who, what, and stakes in one beat. Figurative language ("breathing with the rhythm of tides," "sediment," "bureaucratic acid") is controlled and purposeful, not stacked. Clarity is excellent; spatial choreography and action order track cleanly. Minor deduction: "filtering reality" and "filtered reality" recur in the final paragraph, edging toward a conceptual loop, but the cost at closure remains sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—survivor of bureaucratic murder investigates erasure from inside the maze of global trade—synthesizes noir investigation with institutional horror in a specific, non-obvious way. The container port as both literal and thematic labyrinth is fresh, and the glass-pressed poison label as talisman feels earned rather than ornamental. Transformation test passes: changing names/places would gut the specificity of shipping bureaucracy and tidal rhythm. Minor hold: the "woman presumed dead investigates" frame has precedent, but the layering method and setting provide sufficient freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The death-certificate-error survivor drives every beat: her altered perception enables the layering method, the overheard conversation reweights her investigation, and the final choice to confront the doctor is hers. Setup by paragraph one, developed through her method and the Meridian revelation, and shapes closure by making her "someone who had already died, who could not be killed again." Causal pressure is high; specificity is undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The poison-bottle label appears in beat one (carried in her coat pocket), beat two (pressed between glass as evidence), and beat three (she resolves to show it to the doctor). It enables her confrontation and charges the closure by transforming from keepsake to proof of pattern. Setup early, middle use establishes its preservation, closure linkage strong. Minor: the label itself does not constrain a middle choice, only primes the final one.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Erased histories shape the dominant stake and tactics throughout: her husband's ship "lost to official records," her own false death, the men's revelation of pattern killings. The concept drives her method (layering fragments to build counter-histories) and the ending reweights it—"monuments to the erased in the only material that mattered." Setup by paragraph two, developed across tides, and closure participation is undeniable. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Filters reality differently" is introduced mid-story ("Her death had changed something in her perception") and enables her method of seeing "spaces between official records." It constrains her tactics by making her trust texture over documents, but the cost is implicit rather than dramatized. Setup delayed to paragraph five; middle and closure participation present. Functional but late signal and modest on-page tradeoff lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Layer" drives the method and the thematic spine: she layers fragments "like sediment," builds "structures of erased histories," and the final image is "layering new fragments to layer upon the old." The action enables the Meridian revelation (layering the men's conversation with her prior knowledge) and charges closure. Setup early, middle use strong, closure participation clear. Causal pressure is solid; specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Collecting fragments of overheard stories is introduced by paragraph four, demonstrated in the smugglers' conversation (beat six), and returns at closure ("collecting new fragments to layer upon the old"). The method shapes her investigation and the Meridian revelation arises directly from it. Setup mid-story; middle beat strong; closure linkage present. Modest cost: eavesdropping limits direct agency but enables pattern recognition.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The towering container labyrinth pressures every move: tide cycles force vertical repositioning, acoustic canyons amplify voices, the maze's erasure logic mirrors theme, and the final climb reveals the pattern from above. Setup paragraph three, developed through navigation and the men's shelter, and closure image (rising tide covering evidence) uses it to charge the ending. High causal pressure, irreplaceability, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tide rhythm anchors the timeframe and constrains tactics: low tide permits descent, rising tide forces ascent, and "tomorrow" sets the confrontation. The tidal clock shapes her method (wandering at ebb, listening at climb) and the final image uses it to cover evidence and mark patience. Setup early, middle beats clear, closure participation strong. Visible cost: the rhythm imposes a tempo she cannot control.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of memories" is stated outright ("She would speak with the voice of someone who had already died") and drives her method, but the phrasing edges toward abstraction. The motivation is present across beats and charges the final monument image, yet the conflict between this want and immediate survival costs is implied rather than dramatized. Setup mid-story, closure linkage strong, but friction between want and cost is subdued.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Nameless identity" is coherent throughout: "She had no name anymore," "she had no name, no identity the world would recognize," and the final stance as "someone who had already died." Tone modulates from contemplative patience to sharpened resolve after the Meridian revelation and charges the closure image. Setup paragraph one, middle beats sustain it, and ending crystallizes the stance. Strong coherence and closure charge.</comment>
