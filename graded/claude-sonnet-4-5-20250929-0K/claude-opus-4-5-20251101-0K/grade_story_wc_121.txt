<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is dense with abstract philosophical musing but lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. The "realization struck like lightning" epiphany arrives without prior dramatized resistance or micro-choices that forecast the shift. The final acceptance of fragmentation reads as declared insight rather than earned through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Motivation remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt through body and action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens with its lyric recursion and pattern-driven structure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) emerge within the first 120 words. The closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: Mira's shift from seeking escape to accepting perpetual construction reweights the premise, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally dramatized on the page. The "for the first time, she felt not fragmented but whole" moment registers as realization but lacks a visible forfeiture or tactical constraint that would charge the final image with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct and rain-slicked stones create vivid micro-setting that recurs across beats. The phosphorescent algae and storm progression anchor spatial coherography clearly. The viaduct's glow intensifies in step with Mira's internal progression, and the final "river of light" image charges the closure moment. The tablet as tactile object (warm, humming, shifted runes) constrains Mira's attention and shapes her retracing action, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting/object must alter tactics or charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self—is signaled early and recurs. Pressure accumulates through Mira's descent and tablet interaction, but escalation reads more as philosophical deepening than tactical narrowing with visible cost. The epiphany that "she could not conquer the labyrinth by reaching its center" shifts her stance, yet the turn lacks an on-page price that forecloses a live option. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift and density increase register, but the cost at closure remains abstract rather than viscerally legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fractured timelines and procedural generation imagery without overt statement. The recurring "darkening brightness" paradox and the tablet's shifting runes build pattern and payoff. The ending offers a resonant reconfiguration—acceptance of perpetual construction rather than escape—without moralizing. The "space between drops and ripples" and the helix of possibility charge the final image with thematic weight, inviting reflection beyond the immediate plot through purposeful ambiguity rooted in particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice remains stable with elevated, lyric diction appropriate to the Accumulative mode. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices paradoxes, shifting runes, and temporal recursion in character-specific ways. However, phrases like "darkening brightness," "procedural generation," and "periodically eternal" recur without evolving meaning, creating a template cadence that dulls immediacy in peak beats. The prose reads as singular and purposeful, but the repetitive philosophical register risks flattening emotional modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully with lyric compression fitting the Accumulative mode. Information density is high: most lines advance image, character state, or thematic pattern. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The runes shifted again" / "runes settled into a final configuration, though she knew they would shift again" restates pattern without added pressure. Stock metaphors cluster in the final third: "dandelion seeds in a hurricane," "lightning finding water," "helix of possibility." These reduce specificity in peak beats and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty. No scaffold or generation tokens present.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravity defiance, procedural generation, and timeline fragmentation creates a coherent speculative frame. The "labyrinth as perpetual construction" insight feels earned in hindsight from the tablet's behavior and Mira's recursive experience. However, the prompt elements (gravity defier, fractured timelines, procedurally generated runes) read as mechanically assembled rather than transformed through lived specificity. The philosophical resolution—acceptance of fragmentation—echoes familiar self-acceptance arcs without a visceral, non-obvious angle that would elevate to high originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Mira's gravity-defying ability appears in the opening and recurs at closure ("Mira rose again, defying gravity"). She descends to touch the tablet mid-story, a micro-choice that enables her epiphany. The trait shapes two beats and participates in the final image but lacks a visible cost or tactical constraint tied to its use. Present across Setup, Development, and Payoff gates, but the trait feels more atmospheric than causally indispensable to the closure's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tablet is handled across multiple beats: Mira clutches it in the opening, traces runes with her finger mid-story, and releases it onto the viaduct near closure. Its procedurally generated runes directly enable her realization that the labyrinth is perpetually constructed. The object's warmth, hum, and shifting configurations constrain her attention and shape her retracing action. Present in Setup, Development, and Payoff with causal pressure and closure linkage, though the final "letting it rest" moment lacks the sharp cost that would push into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fractured timelines frame the premise and recur throughout: seventh and twelfth timeline references, "versions that diverged," "the fractured timelines spiraled around her." The concept shapes Mira's stake (understanding fragmentation) and her final acceptance. However, the timelines function more as thematic backdrop than on-page tactical constraint. They do not narrow her options in a dramatized beat or impose a visible cost. Strong thematic presence but moderate causal pressure; present in Setup and Payoff but thin in middle Development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" is named twice: once as label ("periodically eternal in its cycling") and again late ("She was periodically eternal, dying and reviving"). It functions as metaphor for recursive existence but lacks on-page action cost. The trait does not enable or constrain a specific beat; Mira's experience of recursion is shown through the tablet and timelines, not through a visible death-revival cycle. Present in Setup and thematically reframed at closure, but no middle Development beat and no tactical tradeoff. Ornamental use caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Retracing is named as the method ("She had to retrace her steps, all of them, simultaneously") and appears in the closure ("began to retrace paths she had never taken"). However, the action is more declared than dramatized: we do not see Mira enact specific retracing moves with changing cost. The descent and tablet-tracing beats imply retracing but the swappability is high—similar introspection or analysis could substitute. Present in Setup and Payoff but lacks middle causal pressure and felt cost, capping at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Procedural generation" is named three times and tied to the tablet's rune-shifting mechanism. The method shapes Mira's epiphany that the labyrinth is perpetually constructed through her attention. However, the mechanics remain abstract: we do not see how focusing differently alters rune configurations or what tactical choices follow. Present across Setup, Development (runes shift when she's not looking), and Payoff (tablet responds to her touch), but the method lacks on-page cost or specificity that would make it irreplaceable. Functional but mid-band causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The viaduct anchors all action: Mira hangs above it, descends to its stones, traces the tablet on its surface, and stands in its "river of light" at closure. The setting's glow intensifies with her internal progression, and the phosphorescent algae / rain interaction charges the final image. The wet stones "welcome her weight" when she descends, a micro-constraint that alters her physical stance and enables tablet contact. Present in Setup, Development (descent), and Payoff (river of light) with causal and atmospheric pressure. Strong integration with visible closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Between the drop and the ripple" is introduced early and reprised at closure ("She stood in the space between drops and ripples"). The timeframe is lyric and metaphorical rather than a ticking clock, fitting the Accumulative lens. It reweights the premise—Mira exists in suspended consequence—and the final rain imagery echoes the opening frame. However, the timeframe does not tighten a decision or alter tactics in a middle beat. Strong Setup and Payoff reprise with conceptual resonance, but no middle Development constraint. Lyric resonance allowance applies; score in the 5.5–6.3 band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation to "conquer the labyrinth of self" is named once and recurs thematically. Mira's final realization reframes conquest as acceptance, a meaningful shift. However, the desire is more explained than dramatized through conflicted on-page choices. We see her philosophical progression but not a moment where wanting to conquer conflicts with another impulse (e.g., fear of dissolution, attachment to a favored timeline). Present in Setup and Payoff with thematic weight, but the friction between want and cost is told rather than embodied in a choice beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Darkening brightness" is introduced early, named mid-story, and charged at closure ("The brightness darkened further, or perhaps the darkness brightened"). The paradoxical tone coheres across all beats, modulating from initial hurt to final acceptance. The oxymoron mirrors Mira's internal state—illumination revealing darkness—and the final "She could no longer tell the difference" line reweights the tone with earned ambiguity. Strong Setup, Development (intensifies as storm gathers), and Payoff presence with clear modulation under pressure. The tone charges the final image and is indispensable to the story's conceptual effect.</comment>
