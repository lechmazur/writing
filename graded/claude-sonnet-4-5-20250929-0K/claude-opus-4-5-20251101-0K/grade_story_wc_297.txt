<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to reach the intersection is established, but her root-bound state remains largely symbolic rather than a lived constraint that shapes tactics. The "purposefully curious" trait and her linking-through-scars ability are labeled but not tested under pressure—she reads scars smoothly without friction or cost. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves from anxious elation to the door without competing impulses that complicate the choice. The seven strangers lack individuation beyond their scars, functioning as a collective rather than distinct pressures.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: convergence → glade gathering → scar linking → door manifestation builds through density and pattern. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening. The closure unit is Charged Poise—Mira stands at the threshold, understanding her anchoring role as the bridge, with the seven linked and the door open. Cost is conceptual (she remains root-bound to hold the bridge) but the final image "they would meet it dreaming" asserts rather than dramatizes the price; the reader infers her sacrifice more than sees it reshape options on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cobalt glade at dusk is vividly established with "sky turned the color of bruises and promises" and the overgrown hedges. The topiary clipping grows roots that entangle Mira's feet, but this physical constraint is more atmospheric than tactical—it does not visibly narrow her options or force a trade-off. Spatial choreography of the seven approaching and linking hands is clear, though the maze's miniature recreation and the shadow-door remain abstract. The glade charges the tone but does not materially alter the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reaching the intersection of dreams—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the convergence, the dissolving maze, and the gathering of dreamers, but no reversal or tightening narrows options with visible cost. The topiary grows and the door appears without Mira sacrificing, risking, or losing a live resource; the seven arrive and agree without friction. The ending reconfigures meaning (Mira as anchor rather than traveler) but the shift reads as revelation rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens one tightening suffices, yet the cost at closure remains conceptual and unexpressed in immediate stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of bridging dream and waking emerges through the eclipsed covenant, the scars as maps, and Mira's anchoring role. The topiary clipping recurs and the final image—"finding the intersection not by leaving her roots, but by letting others grow from them"—reweights the root-bound condition. However, the penultimate paragraph delivers an overt thematic statement ("she finally understood why she had been root-bound") that edges toward moralizing. The ending resonates but the articulation of wisdom is slightly too direct for high-band scores.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct, heightened register ("root-bound visionary," "anxious elation," "cobalt glade"). Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices scars, roots, and dream-geography. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("eclipsed covenant," "cartography of their unconscious travels") but remains voice-motivated and legible. Dialogue is minimal and functional. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout. Rhythm and syntax support the lyric-mystical tone, though the explain-everything penultimate paragraph flattens narrative stance slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Opening anchors voice and stakes effectively; final line closes with image. Sentence variety is present, though several paragraphs rely on similar expository stems ("She had spent," "She pressed," "She could see"). The phrase "purposefully curious" appears once as a label without further embodiment. Minor paraphrase loop: "The intersection emerged… Not a place, exactly, but a presence—the point where all their paths crossed" restates the same idea. Information density is solid, but the penultimate paragraph's exposition ("she finally understood why…") is scaffold that tells rather than shows. No major filter-verb stacks or template cadence; clarity and propulsion are maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The convergence-arrives-early frame and root-bound visionary premise offer a fresh angle on portal-fantasy and chosen-one tropes. Linking-through-scars and the topiary maze recreating itself from collective dream-maps show ingenuity. However, the core emotional arc—gifted seer accepts her anchoring role and bridges dream/waking for others—follows a familiar self-sacrifice template without a non-obvious inflection. The seven strangers are ciphers, and the door opens without friction or cost that transforms prior material. Specificity in scars and setting lifts the piece, but the resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through surprising causality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira (root-bound visionary) is present throughout and makes the final choice to anchor the bridge. She interprets scars, plants the clipping, and calls the seven forward—decisions that advance the plot. However, her root-bound state is more symbolic than a lived constraint that shapes tactics; she never tests a workaround or pays a visible cost for staying. The final realization (anchor rather than traveler) is conceptual closure but not a choice that alters tactics mid-scene. Setup and closure participation are clear; middle development is interpretive (scar-reading and planting). Two beats (planting clipping, linking hands) with causal involvement. Late penalty waived (present from start). Closure linkage is strong but cost is conceptual. Swappability: medium (a seer/anchor role is archetypal). Scores ~5.2: shapes two beats and closure, but lacks visible cost and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The maze topiary clipping appears early (Mira clutches it), is used in a decisive beat (planted, grows roots), and recurs at closure (the maze closes around them). Three beats: held in hand, planted and grows, maze reforms. Setup, development (planting enables the door), and payoff (maze as protective shell) all present. Causal pressure: the clipping's roots entangle Mira and recreate the maze, which manifests the intersection. Closure linkage: the maze "closed around them" in the final move. Specificity: it remembers the original maze and rebuilds according to dreamers' minds. Cost connection: Mira's entanglement is physical but not a trade-off that alters later options. Swappability: low (a generic seed would not carry the maze's memory). Scores ~6.8: three-gate, three-beat involvement, strong causal and closure work, but the cost is atmospheric rather than a visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The eclipsed covenant (core concept) is explained in paragraph two as the ancient pact's shattering, causing reality to bleed and making the intersection reachable. It frames the story's premise but does not constrain choices on the page—Mira does not navigate covenant rules or pay a price for its breaking. Setup present (early explanation). Development: the broken covenant enables the seven to arrive and the door to appear, but this is backstory cause rather than a live tactic. Payoff: the door exists because the covenant broke, but the covenant itself is not reweighted or revisited at closure. One beat (enables the gathering). Causal pressure: medium (permits the plot but does not narrow options). Closure linkage: absent (the door is the result, not the covenant's return). Swappability: medium (any world-change rule could serve). Scores ~4.6: setup present, one beat, no closure participation—cap at 4.6 per missing-payoff gate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious" (attribute) is labeled once in paragraph two: "Mira was purposefully curious about what seeped through." It does not constrain or enable a choice with cost—Mira's actions (planting clipping, reading scars, calling the seven) could proceed unchanged if she were determined, desperate, or dutiful. Setup: present (labeled early). Development: absent (no middle choice turns on curiosity vs. caution). Payoff: absent (the trait is not revisited or tested at closure). Zero distinct beats where curiosity shapes action. No causal pressure or cost. Swappability: high (the label could be replaced with "intrigued" or "drawn" without structural change). Scores ~3.8: present and logically consistent but ornamental—cap at 3.8 per swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Heed" (action) appears twice: Mira's grandmother's advice ("You have to heed the signs") and the closing line ("Mira heeded her grandmother's wisdom at last"). Setup: indirect via grandmother's maxim. Development: Mira reads the seven's scars and plants the clipping, arguably heeding the signs, though "heed" is not foregrounded. Payoff: the final line explicitly invokes heeding, reweighting the grandmother's wisdom as fulfilled. Two beats (implicit middle action, explicit closure). Causal pressure: medium (the act of reading signs enables the intersection, but "heed" itself is more thematic echo than unique tactic). Closure linkage: strong (final line). Specificity: low (heeding = following advice, a common verb). Cost: the cost is tied to anchoring, not heeding per se. Scores ~6.4: setup, development interpretive, strong payoff and closure linkage, but swappable with "followed" or "trusted" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Linking through scars (method) is explained in paragraph five ("learned to read others' scars… linking through scars to understand their dream-paths") and enacted in paragraph eleven ("Mira read them all, linking through scars"). Setup: clear explanation. Development: one beat (reading the seven's scars overlays their dream-journeys onto her map). Payoff: "They linked hands, scar to scar, forming a circuit" at closure. Two beats (reading, hand-linking). Causal pressure: the method enables the maze's recreation and the door's emergence. Closure linkage: the hand-linking is the final step before crossing. Specificity: high (scars as maps is unique). Cost: none visible (the linking succeeds without friction). Swappability: low (a generic "sensing" would not carry the physical scar texture). Scores ~5.9: setup, two beats, strong closure linkage and specificity, but no cost or middle complication—just short of 7.0 band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The cobalt glade at dusk (setting) is established vividly in the opening and recurs throughout. Setup: immediate. Development: the glade is where Mira is root-bound, the seven gather, and the topiary grows; it provides the spatial frame but does not constrain a choice (e.g., Mira never weighs leaving vs. staying because her roots prevent departure). Payoff: "The cobalt glade darkened toward true night" in the penultimate paragraph, and the final crossing occurs there. Three beats (opening, gathering, closure). Causal pressure: medium (the glade is necessary but not a live obstacle). Closure linkage: present (the darkening glade sets the threshold moment). Specificity: the "cobalt" color and dusk timing are distinct. Cost: none tied to the setting (Mira's root-bound state is tied to the glade, but the glade itself does not force a sacrifice). Swappability: medium (any sacred grove would serve). Scores ~5.7: three-gate, three beats, closure presence, but lacks tactical constraint or cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the future arrives early" (the convergence three days ago) is explained in paragraph two and frames urgency. Setup: clear. Development: the broken covenant enables the seven to arrive "daily" and tonight's gathering, but the three-day window does not tighten decisions—Mira does not race a deadline or weigh timing trade-offs. Payoff: "The future had arrived early, and they would meet it dreaming" closes the story, echoing the setup. Two beats (setup explanation, closure echo). Causal pressure: low (the early arrival permits the plot but does not create a live clock). Closure linkage: thematic echo but not a reweighted cost. Specificity: medium (early arrival is a twist on prophecy tropes). Cost: none (time does not alter tactics). Swappability: medium (any disruption could serve). Scores ~4.8: setup and payoff present, one middle beat (gathering), but no tactical pressure—misses development gate slightly, trends functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to find the intersection of dreams is signaled early ("purposefully curious about what seeped through") and sustained through her scar-reading and the gathering. Setup: clear. Development: she plants the clipping and reads the seven's scars to manifest the intersection—choices driven by the desire. Payoff: "We go together, or not at all" and the final crossing. Three beats (curiosity, scar-reading/planting, crossing). Causal pressure: strong (the desire drives all key actions). Closure linkage: the crossing is the fulfillment. Friction: minimal—Mira never weighs the cost of anchoring vs. crossing, and the seven agree without conflict. Cost: conceptual (she anchors rather than travels) but not dramatized as a painful trade-off on the page. Specificity: medium (quest for a mythical intersection is archetypal). Scores ~6.1: three-gate, three beats, strong causal work, but lacks on-page friction between want and cost to reach 7+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Anxious elation (tone) is labeled in paragraph seven ("The anxious elation that had gripped her since the convergence intensified") and coheres through the piece: dusk's "bruises and promises," the hedge's hum, the "trembling" voice, and the dawn breaking through the door. Setup: explicit label mid-story (acceptable for tone). Development: the tone modulates with the topiary's growth and the seven's approach, blending anticipation and trepidation. Payoff: the final lines ("The cobalt glade darkened… dawn was breaking… they would meet it dreaming") carry both anxiety (darkening) and elation (dawn, dreaming). Coherence: strong; no tonal ruptures. Closure charge: the tone infuses the threshold image. Cost: the anxious/elation pairing is maintained but not sharpened by a visible trade-off. Swappability: medium (other dual tones could serve). Scores ~6.3: setup, development, strong payoff and closure charge, but the tone is more consistent than dynamically reweighted by cost.</comment>
