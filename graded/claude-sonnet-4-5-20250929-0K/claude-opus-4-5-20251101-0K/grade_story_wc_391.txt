<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's transformation from impatient fire-seeker to patient mapper is told rather than shown; the brother's death and mountain training arrive as summary backstory without on-page friction. Her present choices—calibrating instruments, recording measurements—lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final descent feels like inevitable completion rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, Mira's role by paragraph two). The piece follows an Accumulative lens: measurements accrue, the viaduct discovery deepens understanding, and the final image reweights patience as erosion. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"everything could change" in the earned moment of inattention—but the cost remains conceptual and future-tense rather than felt on the page, keeping it shy of high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Basalt columns, frozen lake, ice-sheathed viaduct, and the brass-and-bone instruments anchor the world with vivid specificity. The viaduct's iron rails concentrate magnetic forces, directly enabling Mira's work and thus constraining her tactics. Sensory detail (ice groaning, breath pluming, stars reflecting) filters through Mira's watchful attention. The micro-setting of instruments and the recurring frozen lake charge the final image of flow beneath ice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing celestial measurements to time the revolution—is signaled early and remains coherent. The viaduct discovery meaningfully deepens the work by amplifying signals. However, no live opposition or trade-off tightens Mira's path; she completes her task without encountering a choice that forecloses an option or demands visible sacrifice. The escalation reads as accumulation rather than a pressure point that narrows tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between Mira's past impatience and learned patience, mountains carving canyons, ice remembering flow. The final image—"even frozen things remembered how to flow"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the revolution's method without moralizing. The piece risks didacticism in lines like "revolution was not a moment but a process," yet roots the insight in the viaduct's glitter and the lake's hidden currents, keeping it grounded in particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Mira's perceptual priorities: celestial arcs, magnetic forces, the restless patience of stone. Diction is elevated and lyric ("leviathan," "inverted sky," "sculpt patience from impatience") but consistent with a contemplative, educated mapper. No dialogue to assess. Some filter verbs ("understood," "knew") appear but do not dull immediacy. Voice modulates subtly from urgent memory (brother's death) to calm resolve (final descent), matching emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density is high in the viaduct discovery and magnetic-storm mechanics. Minor overwriting appears: "softly purposeful" recurs three times, "patient revolution" five times, creating mild semantic churn. The phrase "restless patience" borders on oxymoron without clarifying the tension. No major loops or scaffold, but figurative language (leviathan ribs, pale fire, invisible work) clusters without always advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The patient-revolution premise is familiar from activist literature; the celestial-mapping method and magnetic viaduct add specificity but do not fully transform the template. Mira's arc from fire to patience echoes common growth narratives. The frozen-lake-as-metaphor and "erosion not explosion" satisfy thematic expectations without surprising. The piece commits fully to its contemplative tone and executes competently, yet the synthesis feels more careful than urgent or inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira (vigilant horizon mapper) frames the story, discovers the viaduct (middle choice enabled by her role), and completes measurements that shape the ending. Her role is essential to the mechanics but her choices do not create reversals; the work proceeds without dilemma or trade-off. Present in setup, development, and closure; causal involvement is functional but replaceable with another patient specialist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The magnetic viaduct appears after the setup (paragraph four), amplifies Mira's signals (middle development), and glitters in the final image ("bridge between what was and what would be"). Two distinct beats: discovery and closure reprise. However, it resolves a measurement problem it did not help create and could be replaced by any magnetic anomaly with minor edits. Solid integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Patient revolution shapes stakes (timing the uprising via decades of data), tactics (measuring moon paths, waiting for the magnetic storm), and the thematic spine. It appears early, drives Mira's nightly work, and charges the ending realization ("patience was what she had learned to give"). The concept is causal and present across beats, though the revolution itself remains off-page. Strong integration; removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Softly purposeful" appears as a label in paragraph five and again in the final paragraph, describing Mira's movements. It does not constrain an on-page action or create visible cost; her work proceeds smoothly without friction tied to this trait. The attribute could be replaced with "deliberate" or "unhurried" without altering any beat. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Unyoke" appears once in paragraph nine, describing the revolution's goal during the magnetic storm: villages will "unyoke" from imperial control by erasing records and walking away. It names the climactic consequence but does not drive an on-page turn or alter Mira's tactics. The action is future-tense and could be swapped for "liberate" or "free" with negligible impact. Functional setup but low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tracking moon paths is signaled in paragraph two, explained as the method for predicting magnetic storms (paragraph three), and motivates Mira's nightly work and the viaduct's utility (paragraphs four–five). The method shapes her role, the setting choice (sanctuary's platform), and the measurements that time the uprising. Present across setup, development, and closure; causally essential and irreplaceable. Strong integration; removing it would require a full rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary frames the opening, provides the high platform for Mira's work, and stands as witness in the final image. The frozen lake creates the timing constraint (arrived "after the lake froze over") and supplies the central metaphor (flow beneath ice). Both elements pressure Mira's work: the sanctuary's height and the viaduct's proximity enable the measurements. Setting is causal, recurring, and charges the closure image. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the lake froze over") anchors the opening and sets the seasonal window. Mira counts nights ("seventh night," "following weeks") and projects the storm "in three months." Time creates mild urgency (spring departure) but does not tighten a specific on-page decision or narrow tactics during the action. Present in setup and closure but functions as backdrop rather than live clock. Mid-band integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation to "sculpt patience from impatience" is stated in paragraph eight, rooted in Mira's backstory (brother's death, mountain refuge), and resolved in the final paragraph ("patience was what she had learned to give"). It shapes her arc but is told rather than dramatized through conflicting on-page wants. The past impatience never resurfaces as friction in the present; the sculpting is complete before the story begins. Lyric reprise with thematic weight but low on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Restrained wildness" appears as a phrase in paragraph ten and coheres with the story's controlled yet charged diction: leviathan ribs, pale fire, ice groaning, invisible work. Tone remains contemplative and elevated throughout, modulating slightly during the brother's-death memory (grief, rage) and lifting at the ending (smile, flow). The tone charges the final image and matches the patient-revolution concept. Coherent and purposeful but static rather than escalating under pressure.</comment>
