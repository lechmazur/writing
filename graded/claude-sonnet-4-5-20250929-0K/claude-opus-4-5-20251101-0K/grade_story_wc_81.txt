<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is consistent and character-particular, with her indexer's perceptiveness driving her investigation. The discovery of Celia's ledger and her final choice to authenticate the stamp show agency under pressure. However, the change lacks visible cost—she files the truth without dramatized friction or forfeiture. The emotional arc from isolation to continuity reads clean but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph; the blackout establishes stakes (opportunity to hear the library breathing). The closure—stamping her entry and adding Celia's name—lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: she reclaims stillness and continuity). Cost is present but oblique: she carries forward the gift of stillness, yet no live option is visibly foreclosed. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers the ledger, reweighting the stamp's meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sunken library with bioluminescent kelp constrains Maren's investigation—the blackout's sideways glow reveals the hidden compartment. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered (dripping water, whispering pages). The stamp as micro-object charges the final image when she presses it beside her signature. The kelp dimming as artificial light returns provides purposeful atmosphere that supports closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: trace honest origins of the stamp. The blackout creates opportunity, and discovering the ledger deepens understanding by revealing Celia's truth-marking system. However, escalation remains primarily cognitive—no on-page reversal that narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible price. The resolution (cataloguing Celia's name) feels inevitable rather than earned through protagonist struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: truth requires patient verification, meaning is indexed rather than given, continuity survives across drowned centuries. The stamp motif recurs with reweighted meaning at closure. Maren's arc integrates with the thematic question (how do we preserve truth?) without moralizing. The final image—stamp blooming dark against the page—offers resonant closure. Avoids thematic echo and allows complexity without false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; Maren's perceptual signature (noticing millimeter shifts, spaces between words) is consistent and character-specific. Diction remains controlled—"dappled resolve," "reclaimed stillness"—without register mismatch. No dialogue present; interior texture reflects her indexer's mind. Prose modulates appropriately from anxious chatter (past) to tranquil perception (present). One purposeful compression: "The truth was neither" breaks paragraph rhythm to pivot discovery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high in the ledger discovery beat. However, template cadence appears in the final third: "She returned to her desk, readjusted her lamp, and began the patient work…" echoes earlier "readjust" beats without adding pressure. Minor filter-verb stacking ("feeling the grooves," "understanding now") in reflective passages slightly dulls immediacy. No paraphrase loops; clarity remains intact at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sunken library setting offers a fresh frame for archival mystery. The stamp's true origin—neither royal nor fraudulent but a librarian's truth-mark—transforms the trope of authentication. However, the core arc (scholar discovers hidden ledger during blackout, validates forgotten predecessor) follows familiar mystery-resolution structure. Emotional truth in Maren's quiet continuity with Celia is earned, but the premise does not synthesize into a non-obvious angle that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's indexer trait enables the investigation (noticing the hidden compartment seam, applying alternative hypothesis method). Her choices—walking toward sounds, reading the ledger, drafting the new entry—create key turns. Present in setup, middle discovery, and closure stamping. However, observation dominates over high-stakes decision; the final act (cataloguing Celia's name) alters records but lacks visible personal cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stamp appears in four beats: opening (turning it over), ledger discovery (sigil matching seventeen manuscripts), feeling Celia's hand grooves, and final stamping beside Maren's signature. Its evolving meaning—from mystery to Celia's truth-mark to Maren's continuity tool—drives causality and charges closure. Handles physical detail (worn grooves, deep blue sigil). Removal would collapse the investigation's object and thematic anchor.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" is signaled early (blackout brings "reclaimed stillness"), reappears when Maren feels Celia's presence ("stillness around her no longer felt like absence but like presence reclaimed"), and explicitly carried forward at closure ("carried the stillness with her now, reclaimed and permanent"). Shapes her tactic of listening in darkness. However, it functions more as thematic echo than a constraint altering her options; the concept deepens meaning without narrowing choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" enables Maren to notice the millimeter-shifted book spine, the hidden compartment seam in sideways kelp light, and the library breathing. Mentioned in opening, deployed during blackout investigation, and affirmed in final fish-watching beat ("tranquil perception"). The trait shapes her method but lacks visible tradeoff—her perception succeeds without cost or constraint. Functions as character signature rather than a friction point.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Readjust" appears twice: she readjusts a fallen manuscript (revealing the hidden compartment) and later readjusts her lamp after lights return. The first instance creates the discovery turn; the second closes the frame. However, the action itself is mechanically small and easily swappable (she could "lift," "shift," or "straighten"). Causal role in one major beat earns mid-band placement, but low irreplaceability caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Alternative hypothesis" is named once in the ledger-reading beat: "If the stamp was genuine… if it was a forgery tool…" The method frames her analysis but is not signaled earlier or dramatized as a repeated investigative tactic. It appears at the moment of use rather than shaping prior attempts. Functional in one beat but swappable with "deductive reasoning" or "systematic inquiry" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken library setting is established immediately and pressures every choice: reinforced glass domes, fathoms of water, bioluminescent kelp as sole light source during blackout. The blackout enables the discovery (sideways glow reveals the compartment seam). Eastern stacks, reading desks, and residential domes provide spatial coherence. The setting supplies the resource (altered lighting) that makes the climax possible and charges the final image (fish swimming past indifferent to human meaning). Removal would collapse causality.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blackout begins when generators fail, spans the investigation ("three hours later" lights return), and tightens Maren's window of solitary access. Time pressure is live: scholars have fled, she works alone in darkness, and the return of lights marks closure of her discovery window. The blackout's duration shapes her tactics (listening, moving through darkness) and the final beat acknowledges restoration ("pumps and lights restored"). Clock is tracked and alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To trace honest origins" is stated early ("Maren's motivation was simple") and dramatized through her investigation: turning the stamp over, applying hypothesis, reading the ledger, and cataloguing Celia's name. The motivation drives every beat and is fulfilled at closure when she writes "honest origins" and authenticates with the stamp. Friction is present but mild—no competing desire or visible cost to pursuing truth. Desire shapes all choices but lacks contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears once explicitly in the ledger-reading beat ("her heart steady with dappled resolve"). The tone is coherent—tranquil yet purposeful—and modulates appropriately (anxious scholars' chatter vs. Maren's stillness, blackout's dimness vs. artificial brightness). The final image of tranquil perception watching indifferent fish embodies the tone. However, "dappled" itself remains ornamental; the tone could read as "steady resolve" without structural loss. Present and coherent but not irreplaceable.</comment>
