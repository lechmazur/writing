<comment>Marina's translator background and guilt over the boy's death anchor her interiority well, and her micro-choices—decrypting the cast, softening the boat message—constrain options with visible cost. Internal contradiction appears in the coral fragment paradox (kept as reminder, meaning unclear to her) and in her fear of "remembering things wrong" while actively altering a translation. The renunciation at the end (throwing the coral into the harbor) feels earned by the scene's work. Minor slip: the girl's "shrewdly innocent" trait remains more told than shown in Marina's perception rather than demonstrated through the child's contradictory impulses.</comment>

<comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The dominant stake—Marina seeking release from carried trauma—tightens when she encounters the smudged cast and decides to decrypt it, narrowing her options from passive waiting to active translation with a mercy-driven alteration. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marina's decision to discard the coral is crystallized on the page, the final image reweights "healing was just another form of translation," and the cost (relinquishing the calcified reminder) is felt. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered reflection, the cast-decryption beat, and the final coral decision, with cadence shift at the ending reweighting the dominant stake.</comment>

<comment>The mist-clad atrium with fogged ceiling panels at twilight grounds early and the recurring mist frames emotional beats ("cocoon separate from the hospital's fluorescent reality"). The plastic chair and the girl's cast function as micro-setting that constrains Marina's decryption action. Spatial choreography (girl crossing atrium, mother's departure/return) tracks cleanly. The atrium's liminal quality charges the final image as Marina walks toward surgery, but the environment does not directly constrain the peak choice to reinterpret the coral; it remains more backdrop than tactical shaper.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—release from carried shrapnel and its metaphorical weight—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: Marina's decision to soften "the boats are coming" into "the boats brought help" narrows her translator ethic (accuracy vs. mercy) and forecloses the option of pure fidelity with on-page cost (she grafts mercy onto trauma). The anesthetic's dulling effect and the girl's trust create pressure without requiring an antagonist. Agency is clear in the translation choice and the coral decision. The cost is visible (altering truth, discarding the coral) and scales appropriately for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—language as bridge/blade, healing as translation—emerges from the cast-decryption beat and the coral's structural permanence after death without overt statement. The brain coral motif (holding structure after life is gone) recurs with shifted meaning: Marina decides to let tides "take it somewhere it could mean something else," answering the central question of whether she can release calcified guilt. Subtext operates in Marina's mercy-edit of the boat message and the unspoken bond with the girl. Minor slip: "lotus-hearted ache" in the final paragraph tilts slightly ornamental rather than fully embodied in scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Single-POV distance is stable; Marina's perceptual signature (translator's lens, "unknotting language," coral-as-metaphor) is distinct and consistent. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the girl's "You understand it" and Marina's "I'm scared of remembering things wrong" carry subtext. Free indirect style is clean. Minor deductions: the phrase "lotus-hearted ache" in the final line introduces a poetic register slightly elevated beyond Marina's prior diction under anesthetic haze, and the anesthetic's effect on voice could be more granular—her thoughts "drift" but syntax remains fully controlled without compression or fragment.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; the opening grounds atmosphere and stakes efficiently. The coral motif's layered deployment (Pacific conflict, salvaged fragment, bleaching, kept anyway, closure decision) does multiple jobs. Minor deductions: "tanched together like fishing nets" (likely "tangled") reads as a typo or neologism without clear voice motivation; the phrase "lotus-hearted ache" in the final line mixes registers (elevated poetic + embodied) and slightly muddles the closure image's clarity. No paraphrase loops or template cadence present; propulsion is steady.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of Pacific translator guilt, cast-decryption as active translation work, and coral-as-calcium metaphor feels specific and non-obvious. The mercy-edit of the boat message transforms the translator's dilemma from abstract to immediate with on-page cost. The atrium-as-liminal-space and anesthetic timing frame the encounter without gimmickry. Minor limitation: the coral fragment as metaphor for "holding structure after living part is gone" is vivid but not entirely fresh in trauma literature, and the final disposal decision (harbor, tides, new meaning) follows a recognizable arc of letting-go symbolism. Still, the combination of elements and the cast-decryption method feel inventive enough to avoid derivative templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Marina's translator background shapes her recognition of Tausug on the cast, drives the decryption action, and motivates the mercy-edit of "the boats are coming" into "brought help"—a choice that alters tactics (grafting new meaning) and ties to closure (discarding the coral). Her guilt over translating the boy's last words anchors the dominant stake. She is present in setup, drives the middle beat, and her profession's ethical dilemma charges the ending decision. The element is indispensable to the story's logic and emotional arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The coral fragment appears in two beats: Marina reflects on it mid-scene ("salvaged from a reef destroyed during a naval skirmish… kept it anyway") and decides at closure to "throw it into the harbor." Its meaning shifts from unresolved reminder to something she can release, and the metaphor ("living things hold their structure even after the living part is gone") charges the grafting theme. Setup and closure gates are met; middle development is reflective rather than enacted. The object enables the final decision but could be replaced with another charged keepsake (shrapnel piece, photo) with moderate rewriting. Score: functional with strong lyric reprise, not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Shared anxieties—forgetting vs. remembering wrong—are dramatized in dialogue ("Are you scared?" / "Of forgetting things" / "I'm scared of remembering things wrong") and shape the decryption beat by creating the girl's trust and Marina's urgency. The concept appears in setup (girl's smudged notes) and middle (the exchange), but at closure Marina's coral decision pivots on release rather than shared anxiety. The concept enables one key turn (the trust that allows decryption) but does not constrain the final choice as directly as the translator role does. Swappable with "mutual recognition of loss" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is mentioned once as Marina's recognition label ("that particular brightness Marina recognized… knowing that children develop when they've seen too much") but does not constrain an on-page action by the girl. The girl's trust and her question "Are you scared?" reflect the trait thematically, yet the trait could be replaced with "wary trust" or "old-young eyes" with no edit to her behavior. Present and functional, but ornamental—no visible tradeoff or enabling choice tied to the specific duality of shrewd + innocent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Unknotting (decrypting the cast's smudged notes) is the story's central action: it enables Marina's encounter with the girl, surfaces the Tausug boat message, and forces the mercy-edit choice that grafts new meaning. The metaphor recurs ("unknotting language") and ties to closure (untangling her own carried knot). Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is strong (the untangling enables the decision to release the coral). Swapping "unknot" for "translate" would weaken the tactile metaphor but not break the plot. Score: essential across beats, but one synonym away from full indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Decrypting smudged notes on the child's cast is the method that structures the middle beat: Marina sounds out letters, recovers the grandmother's name and phone number, and encounters the Tausug warning that she softens. The method is signaled early (girl shows the cast, "I wrote them wrong, and now I can't read them"), drives the middle action, and shapes the mercy-choice. Closure linkage is indirect—the cast work enables the grafting insight that leads to the coral decision. The method could be replaced with "reading a torn letter" or "translating a recorded message" with moderate rewriting, but the cast's physicality (plaster, marker bleed, child's body) adds specificity. Score: drives two beats and contributes to ending logic, not fully irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is established early, recurs in the "cocoon separate from the hospital's fluorescent reality," and frames the final image ("The mist held its lotus-hearted ache around her"). The setting's liminal quality (twilight, mist, transition to surgery) charges atmosphere and tone. However, it does not constrain a choice—the decryption and mercy-edit could occur in any waiting area. The setting shapes mood and the lyric frame but does not alter tactics or the ending's causal logic. Score: strong atmospheric presence with purposeful early–final reprise, but swappable for another liminal medical space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.7</grade>
<comment>The anesthetic kicking in is mentioned early ("feeling the anesthetic spread through her arm like warm honey") and frames Marina's drifting thoughts and the girl's approach. At closure, "The surgeon came for her then" signals time's forward press. The timeframe shapes interiority (drug-loosened reflection) but does not tighten tactics—there is no countdown or urgency tied to the anesthetic's duration. The element is present in setup and closure but does not constrain middle choices. Functional but replaceable with "while waiting for surgery" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Marina's motivation—"grafting new meaning onto old wounds, she understood now—the girl's and her own"—is dramatized in the mercy-edit of the boat message and the decision to discard the coral. The desire is conflicted (translator's accuracy vs. mercy, holding structure vs. release) and drives the peak choice. Setup is implicit (carrying shrapnel, guilt over the boy's death), development is enacted (the cast decryption), and closure directly articulates the graft metaphor. The motivation could be rephrased as "seeking forgiveness" or "reinterpreting trauma" with moderate rewriting, and the explicit statement "grafting new meaning" in the penultimate paragraph tilts slightly tell-heavy. Score: shapes two beats and closure, not fully indispensable in its exact phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Tone—"lotus-hearted ache"—appears explicitly only in the final line ("The mist held its lotus-hearted ache around her"), yet the ache quality (tender grief, beauty in ruin) runs through the mist imagery, the coral's bleaching, and Marina's "chest tighten" moment. The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure (warm anesthetic → tightening recognition → release). The phrase "lotus-hearted" introduces a poetic register slightly elevated beyond prior diction and could be replaced with "tender" or "aching beauty" without altering the emotional arc. Score: coherent atmospheric charge with a strong final reprise, but the exact phrase is not indispensable and slightly ornamental.</comment>
