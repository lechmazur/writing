<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and purposeful—the chess-piece fidgeting, thread-sorting hands—embodying guilt through action rather than declaration. His arc from self-blame to renunciation ("he had taught chess, not murder") is earned by the physical act of releasing the knight into the labyrinth's center. Internal conflict is present but somewhat abstract; the contradiction between his agency (teaching) and his culpability could have been dramatized more sharply in a micro-choice that tests his hierarchy of values. The final letting-go feels motivated and closes a path, but the emotional progression tilts slightly toward articulated insight rather than messy contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: Marcus, village square, post-exile, with backstory woven through present perception. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting into release): dropping the knight reweights his guilt, and time resuming confirms the cost—his three-year exile resolved by acceptance rather than erasure. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through sensory hush, thread-decoding, and the labyrinth's metaphoric density, then releases in the mirrored centerpiece. One meaningful deepening occurs when Marcus stops running and looks up, and the final image (flour drifting, swing creaking) reconfigures the frozen village's meaning. Cost is oblique but felt: he walks away "no longer exiled from himself," having traded his need for external absolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth and frayed tapestry anchor tactile pressure: narrow paths, border threads separated by color and twist, the mirror at center. Sensory selection shifts appropriately—frozen flour cloud, silent open mouths, thunder's unchanging pulse—filtering urgency through Marcus's guilt-lens. The time-frozen village constrains his choice by offering stillness rather than escape, and the labyrinth's geometry mirrors his exile's wandering, charging the closure image when time resumes. Spatial choreography is clean, and the woven hush functions as both atmosphere and conceptual setting, though the occupational detail (chess tutor) remains lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus kneels to decode the tapestry, then deepens at the mirrored center where he must confront his reflection. Agency is clear in the release of the knight, a renunciation that forecloses his need to undo the past. The tightening is meaningful but gentle: the labyrinth offers a mirror rather than an obstacle, so escalation reads as internal accumulation rather than external resistance. One reversal occurs (realization that the village was preserved, not cursed), and the cost—accepting that the prince's choices were his own—lands on the page, though the price feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from image and action: guilt as labyrinth, stillness as necessary before motion, the knight as both student and burden. The woven hush recurs with shifting valence—suspension, then fierce repose—avoiding overt statement. Marcus's epiphany ("he had taught chess, not murder") is earned by the physical decoding and mirrored confrontation, not asserted; the final line ("no longer exiled from himself") resonates without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (turning the knight, releasing it) and the tapestry's color-coded sequence. The ending reweights the opening's frozen tableau, offering a non-literal answer to whether Marcus can stop running.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable and close, filtering setting through Marcus's guilt: "productive in their restlessness," "the woven hush deepened around him." Diction stays consistent—elevated but never diagnostic—and psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer at the mirror, wider at the village's resumption). Perceptual signature is present: he notices threads, geometry, the chess piece's weight. No dialogue appears, so voice relies on narrative rhythm, which accelerates at the labyrinth's center and breathes at closure. One minor slip: "fierce repose" in the penultimate paragraph feels slightly authorial rather than Marcus's lexicon, though it echoes the final required tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies well ("The thunder rolled…never arrived and never faded" vs. "Thread by thread, Marcus decoded the pattern"), and information density is high—each line advances atmosphere, motive, or closure setup. Minor loop: "The woven hush" recurs three times with slight variation, and "hands never stopped moving" / "hands finally still" feels template-balanced rather than organic contrast. Figurative density is controlled except in one beat: "knowledge like water, carrying weight, something unknotted" stacks three metaphors in quick succession without full integration. Clarity remains strong, and the final image (flour drifting, swing creaking, clock striking) propels without summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess-tutor guilt, time-frozen village, and thread-decoding feels specific and non-obvious; the labyrinth-as-mirror turn and the platinum absorbing the knight avoid stock redemption arcs. The village's preservation ("waiting for someone who needed its stillness") transforms the curse trope. Risk is present in the quiet, accumulative structure and the reliance on subtext over confrontation. One proximity note: the "labyrinth with no exit until one stopped walking and simply looked up" leans close to self-help idiom, though the surrounding particulars (threads, mirror, knight) anchor it. The emotional specificity (guilt over teaching vs. committing the act) elevates familiar atonement material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's choices drive all key turns: kneeling to decode (first third), following the labyrinth path with his eyes (middle), releasing the knight (closure). His exile status frames the stakes, and his teaching background motivates both guilt and the decoding skill. Present in setup, middle development, and payoff; causal pressure is strong, and the final act (dropping the knight) is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth appears early (village square, first third), is traced visually in the middle beat (following the border's geometry), and absorbs the knight at closure, reweighting Marcus's burden into release. Three distinct beats; the mirror at its center charges the final image. Removing it would collapse the resolution's spatial and symbolic logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Woven hush" is named three times and functions thematically as the village's suspension and Marcus's needed stillness, but its mechanics remain atmospheric rather than tactical. It shapes the dominant stake (need for stillness to forgive) and charges the tone, yet does not constrain a specific choice the way the labyrinth or threads do. Present in setup and payoff with thematic resonance, but mid-development use is descriptive.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus fidgets with the knight throughout (turning it in his pocket, releasing it at center), and his hands "never stopped moving" while decoding threads. The trait is visible in two beats and enables the closure action (letting go), but the productivity aspect—that restlessness aids rather than hinders—could be sharper. The cost (finally stilling his hands) is present but light.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Winnow" appears explicitly ("winnow truth from silence") and structures the middle beat: Marcus separates threads by color, age, and twist to decode the border sequence. The action is signaled, executed on-page, and essential to unlocking the labyrinth's route. Removing it would require a different unlock mechanism. Two beats (decoding, realization), clear cost in time and focus.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The method is introduced early (tapestry at labyrinth's base, first third), executed in the middle (separating threads, reading color code: red/blue/gold/black), and its result (the mirrored path) shapes the closure. Mechanics matter: the border's geometry matches the labyrinth's route, and Marcus must decode before progressing. Three beats, causal pressure, irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The time-frozen village is anchored immediately (baker mid-stride, children on swing) and pressures Marcus by offering stillness rather than escape, forcing the internal reckoning. The village's resumption (flour drifting, swing creaking) confirms the closure's cost and success. Three beats (arrival, realization of preservation, time's return), and the setting's constraint (no external movement) shapes Marcus's inward turn.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Thunder appears in the opening line ("never arrived and never faded"), pulses once in the middle ("patient as grief"), and fades in the closure paragraph. It establishes the lull and charges atmosphere, but does not tighten a decision or impose a deadline. The timeframe is more tonal than tactical; removing it would soften mood but not break causality. Early signal and closure reprise earn mid-band, but middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Self-forgiveness is the explicit dominant stake: Marcus cannot forgive himself for the weapon he crafted, kneels to decode the village's stillness, and reaches the epiphany that "he had taught chess, not murder." The motive drives every beat, is dramatized through the knight's release (visible cost: accepting the prince's agency), and shapes the closure image (walking away "no longer exiled from himself"). Friction between guilt and release is sustained across all three structural anchors.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Fierce repose" is named once (penultimate paragraph: "the quiet of fierce repose") and enacted in the closure (stillness after release, time resuming its patient march). Tone is coherent—contemplative pressure without panic—and modulates from restless guilt (fidgeting, hands moving) to earned calm (hands finally still). The phrase charges the final image but arrives late; earlier sensory cues (woven hush, unchanging thunder) carry the work. Two anchors (middle naming, closure embodiment), strong coherence, but lighter setup.</comment>
