<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to understand Elena's hidden research is established clearly and drives his descent into the library. His interior contradictions emerge through his realization that Elena "hid behind truth," and the final choice to carry her secret creates visible cost—he now sees lies painted in muddy brown, bearing knowledge too luminous for unprepared eyes. The micro-choices (uncorking the vial, watching the lanterns) are embodied and concrete. However, the backstory about Elena's synesthetic research dominates the middle third without sufficient interleaved present-tense micro-decisions that alter Marcus's tactics in the library itself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: descent through the ship, discovery of the journal, uncorking the vial, and the chromatic revelation build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. Marcus's final stance—carrying Elena's secret and seeing the color of grief—reweights the opening image of dark piers and hidden research with conceptual cost (he now bears unbearable knowledge). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first two paragraphs. The closure lands on the page with felt cost: "too luminous for unprepared eyes" is made concrete through his new perception of lies and the lanterns' chromatic signature, and the phrase "carrying his wife's secret like a lantern in his chest" charges the final image without solving the loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The drowned library's "impossible angles," bioluminescent algae whisper-light, and "meteor hush" silence create a distinct sensory signature filtered through Marcus's lamplighter's eye. The hotel key tag's physical interaction (fitting into the journal's spine slot) constrains the discovery beat and charges the closure when Marcus emerges with new sight. The vial's shifting pigments function as micro-setting that enables the climactic choice. Spatial choreography through the tilted passageways and the contrast between submerged dark and the surface lantern festival remain coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what Elena hid—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Marcus finds the journal and uncorks the vial, narrowing his options to either remain ignorant or bear unbearable knowledge. The uncorking is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost: he now sees every lie and every truth painted in color, a burden made explicit in "too luminous for unprepared eyes." The escalation is meaningful but operates through accumulation and discovery rather than a second reversal; one deepening suffices at this length. The memorial festival provides situational pressure (he should be with his daughter) that heightens the personal cost of his choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the specific discovery: some truths are hidden not from shame but from their luminosity, and the story resists moralizing by showing Marcus bearing the cost rather than celebrating the knowledge. The vial's liquid colors, the hotel key tag, and the sky lanterns form a constellation of images that reweight at closure—Marcus finally sees the chromatic signature of grief ascending. The phrase "hides behind truth" transforms from a character observation into a thematic principle without overt statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: carrying unbearable light is both burden and inheritance, and the story trusts particulars (synesthetic pigments, wedding vows, deathbed promises) over abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Marcus's perceptions throughout; the lamplighter's practical vocabulary and the quiet, deliberate pacing match his character. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: closer during the vial moment ("impossible pigments bleeding into one another"), wider during the reflective passages about Elena's methods. The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature—Marcus notices light, angles, and atmospheric details through a lamplighter's lens. Minor filter-verb density in the middle third ("he'd found," "she'd hidden," "she'd always done") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure the POV or closure effect. No head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively; the opening's compressed syntax ("Tonight, the pier stood dark. Tonight, he had a different purpose.") contrasts with the longer, layered sentences in the library. Information density is high: most lines advance discovery, memory, or atmosphere without redundancy. The phrase "meteor hush" and "luminous vows" carry specificity without strain. However, a minor paraphrase loop appears in paragraph five: "She'd always done that" immediately follows the prior paragraph's revelation about hiding behind truth, restating rather than advancing. The scaffold phrase "he realized" recurs twice in close proximity. These issues are contained to the middle third and do not touch the closure beats, so penalties remain modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthetic research, a drowned library, and a lamplighter protagonist offers a non-obvious angle on the "hidden knowledge" premise. The hotel key tag functioning as a literal unlock mechanism for hidden research reads fresh in execution, and the image of wedding vows and deathbed promises distilled into pigment carries emotional specificity. The story commits fully to its logic without retreat. However, the core frame—protagonist discovers deceased spouse's secret research in a fantastical archive—echoes familiar genre templates; transformation is achieved through the sensory particulars (color of sound, bioluminescent library) and the moral calculus (carrying unbearable knowledge), lifting the score into the 7.5–7.9 band but not higher.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus the lamplighter is present from the opening sentence and his professional identity (igniting gas flames, carrying the pole, tending Pier Seventeen) shapes his perceptual filter and the story's tactile atmosphere. His choice to leave the pier dark tonight and descend into the library creates the inciting turn. The final beat—standing at the boundary between loss and remainder, seeing the lanterns' chromatic signature—would collapse without his acquired sight and the pole strapped to his back as a returning anchor. His decisions (to follow the coordinates, uncork the vial, carry the secret) alter tactics and drive closure. All three gates satisfied with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hotel skeleton key tag appears in paragraph three as a concrete mystery ("Room 714... sewn into her coat lining"), is physically handled and examined mid-story, and functions causally when it "fit perfectly into a slot cut into the journal's spine, releasing a hidden compartment." The tag enables the climactic discovery and its meaning is reweighted at closure: what seemed arbitrary (a demolished hotel room) becomes the key to unbearable knowledge. Three beats (setup, mechanical use, thematic reprise), strong causal pressure, and closure participation. The specificity (brass worn smooth, numbered tag) matters to the logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Luminous vows are introduced early ("luminous vows she'd made in a drowned cathedral of books"), detailed in the journal's hidden vial ("distilled synesthetic resonance, captured from the voices of those who spoke luminous vows"), and dramatized when Marcus uncorks the vial and hears the chorus of wedding oaths and deathbed promises painted in impossible colors. The concept directly shapes the stakes (what Elena hid, why it matters) and the final image (Marcus's own vows emerge as "deep violet streaked with gold"). The vows drive closure by making the cost of knowledge visible: every sincere word blazes, every lie is muddy brown. Setup, development, and payoff gates all satisfied with strong specificity and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Hides behind truth" is introduced in paragraph five as Marcus's realization about Elena's method: offering overwhelming facts to bury deeper secrets. The trait is demonstrated through concrete examples (legitimate acoustics research masking obsessive synesthetic work) and constrains Marcus's present understanding—he must decode what was hidden. The phrase returns thematically at closure ("some truths hide not because they are shameful, but because they are too luminous"), reweighting the attribute as protective rather than deceptive. Setup and payoff gates satisfied; the attribute shapes interpretation and charges the final image, though it does not constrain a physical on-page choice in the library beats. Mid-high band due to thematic resonance and closure linkage without middle-beat tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Signify" appears once in the climax paragraph: "Some discoveries signify too much, carry weight that could crush the unprepared." The action is thematic rather than physical, describing the effect of Elena's discovery rather than driving a turn. The concept charges Marcus's decision to carry the secret forward, but the verb itself is not repeated, dramatized across beats, or made causally essential—Marcus could reach the same realization through alternate phrasing. Setup gate missed (not seeded early); payoff gate met (present at closure). Functional but swappable, landing in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Wandering purposefully" is stated once in paragraph four: "he wandered purposefully through the tilted passageways, each step a deliberate choice." The method is asserted rather than demonstrated through multiple navigation beats, and the mechanics (how purposeful wandering differs from searching or following a map) do not shape his discovery—the coordinates and key tag drive the find, not the wandering method. Setup gate missed (not signaled early enough to frame expectation); no middle development or tactical constraint. The phrase charges the moment's tone but remains ornamental to plot mechanics. Mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside the sunken Meridian is established in the opening paragraph, anchors the entire middle act, and supplies the resources that enable closure: the preserved books, the air pocket's impossibility, the bioluminescent light. The setting's "impossible angles" and "strange dry atmosphere" create the conditions for Elena's hidden research to survive forty years underwater. Marcus's descent through rusted corridors and emergence into dark water bracket the discovery. The library's existence is the story's central premise; removing it collapses all logic. All three gates strongly satisfied with high irreplaceability and closure dependence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sky lantern memorial festival is introduced in paragraph four ("Above the waves, Marcus knew the townspeople were releasing sky lanterns"), recurs as situational pressure (he should be with his daughter), and returns in the final two paragraphs where Marcus sees the lanterns' chromatic signatures for the first time. The timeframe tightens emotional stakes (he is absent from the memorial) and the lanterns' ascent provides the closure image. However, the festival does not impose a ticking clock that alters Marcus's tactics in the library—he moves at his own pace. Setup, thematic development, and payoff gates satisfied; the timeframe charges the ending but does not constrain middle choices. Lyric resonance lifts the score into the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The motivation to discover the color of sound is seeded in paragraph two (Elena "believed sound possessed color... searched her whole life to prove it") and drives Marcus's descent to retrieve her hidden research. The motivation is tested when he uncorks the vial and chooses to experience the synesthetic revelation despite the cost: "beautiful and terrible and true." The desire faces friction (he should be at the festival; the knowledge is unbearable) and the cost is dramatized (he now sees lies and truths painted in color). Setup, development, and payoff gates satisfied with visible cost and closure linkage. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is introduced in paragraph four ("The silence here felt like meteor hush, the breathless pause after something brilliant has fallen") and establishes the library's tonal signature: reverent, suspended, charged with aftermath. The tone modulates under pressure—quiet wonder during the descent, intensity at the vial moment, subdued awe at closure—without breaking into incongruent registers. The final image ("carrying his wife's secret like a lantern in his chest, its light visible only to those who had learned to see") sustains the tone's luminous quiet and charges the ending. The metaphor is specific, voice-consistent, and integral to the story's atmosphere. Setup, coherence under pressure, and closure charge all satisfied.</comment>
