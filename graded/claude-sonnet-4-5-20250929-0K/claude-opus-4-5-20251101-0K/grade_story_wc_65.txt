<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's core trait—comfort with ignorance as honest cartography—is established early and drives her approach to the commission. The internal conflict between terror and humility shapes her stance at the desk, though the choice to write never faces a meaningful counter-pressure that would force her to risk abandoning her professional philosophy. The reflective blocks anchor in present stimuli (the spire, the quill, the frozen lake) and tilt her present stance, but the final act reads as implementation of a pre-formed philosophy rather than a decision that forecloses a live option with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but muted; most interiority operates at a meta-cognitive level ("she understood," "Mira suspected") rather than through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph: who (Mira), where (obsidian spire above frozen lake), and the commission (map time itself). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story accrues pressure through layered reflection and image—the spire, the feather quill, the frozen Engine below—culminating in the act of writing maps labeled as conjecture. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira completes the maps and descends with humility intact, crystallizing the distinction between invitation and command. The cost is conceptual and felt—she has dared to write the future while acknowledging uncertainty—but the story does not show a live tactical choice where writing risks her livelihood, reputation, or internal philosophy in a way that she might plausibly refuse. The final image reweights prior material, but the stakes remain stable rather than narrowed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vivid and purposeful, establishing a tone of coldness and lost knowledge. The kingfisher feather quill nib appears twice (requested, then lifted) and charges the final third by embodying the contrast between sharpness and hope. Spatial choreography inside the spire is clean; the writing chamber and tools are anchored with economy. The frozen lake functions as both literal setting and thematic mirror, constraining Mira's approach by reminding her of the ancients' failure, and the spire's apex isolates her in a way that sharpens the liminal moment before creation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—map time without falling into the ancients' certainty—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through reflection and image (the liminal space before the pen meets the page, the frozen Engine below) rather than through external opposition or a tightening choice. Mira's agency is a stance crystallization: she chooses to write invitations rather than prophecy, but the story does not dramatize a moment where she is tempted to claim certainty or where writing itself risks a concrete, on-page consequence (client rejection, guild censure, personal crisis). The resolution is earned by her philosophy, but the escalation reads as deepening rather than narrowing options with a felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—mapping the future as invitation rather than command—emerges organically from Mira's profession, the commission, and the buried Engine's cautionary presence. The kingfisher feather quill nib and the frozen lake recur with reweighted meaning: the quill embodies sharp ambition tempered by humility, the ice preserves the ancients' mistake. The final image offers a non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral: Mira descends with pages that "show a kingdom frozen in fear that the future was not fixed." The piece resists tidy resolution and invites reflection on the ethics of prediction. Minor penalty for "She had simply made space for it to begin," which edges toward thematic summary rather than trusting the image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled throughout; psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("Mira was terrified") to wider reflection. Diction is elevated and consistent with Mira's profession and temperament—"groundedly imaginative," "ignorance cartographer"—though some phrases ("sustaining transformation," "prevail against the blankness") feel prompt-adjacent rather than character-specific. Perceptual signature is clear: she notices in cartographic terms (coastlines, trade routes, patterns). No dialogue is present; the story's rhythm supports the reflective, solitary stance. Minor penalty for filter-verb density ("Mira understood," "Mira suspected") in several high-pressure beats, which dulls immediacy slightly but does not collapse voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high across most beats. The opening image—"obsidian spire rose from the frozen lake like a black tooth"—anchors voice and stakes effectively. Two patterns generate minor debt: (1) paragraph-opening stems recur ("She did not," "She would not," "She approached"), creating template cadence across the middle third; (2) several reflective blocks restate core concepts with slight variation ("ignorance cartographer," "admitting uncertainty," "honest way to work") without advancing pressure. The closure paragraph is clean and propulsive. No loops obscure causality or dull the final image, so deductions remain within-band. Clarity and concision are strong overall, with occasional scaffolding in the reflective mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—cartographer of ignorance commissioned to map time—offers a fresh synthesis of familiar elements (mapmaking, lost knowledge, prediction). The transformation of tropes through Mira's philosophy (humility as professional ethic, uncertainty as honesty) reads specific rather than generic. The piece commits fully to its conceptual frame and follows implications without retreat. However, the emotional arc and stakes remain largely static; Mira's final stance is her opening stance made explicit rather than a risky synthesis arrived at through on-page conflict. The story reads as a meditation on a theme more than a narrative that earns its conclusion through character pressure and cost, which limits ingenuity in the plotting dimension.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her professional philosophy (comfort with ignorance) frames the commission and shapes her final maps. She makes a clear choice at the climax: to write invitations rather than prophecy. However, her decision feels like implementation of a pre-existing stance rather than a turn under pressure that narrows live options. Early signal (+0.6), two beats (request scene, writing scene +0.9), causal pressure moderate (+0.8), closure linkage strong (+1.2), specificity good (+0.5). Swappability penalty (another cartographer could occupy this role with minor edits, −0.5). Base ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The kingfisher feather quill nib appears in two beats: requested in the commission brief, then lifted at the climactic writing moment. Its blue color and sharpness provide a concrete image that contrasts with the frozen, black setting. Setup present (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage strong (+1.4), specificity moderate (+0.4). Missing middle development (it does not constrain a choice between request and use, −0.3 per missing gate). Lyric reprise quality is solid but not indispensable; another writing instrument could serve with minor rewording. Base ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Writing the future" is the commission's core and drives Mira's stakes throughout: she must decide whether to claim certainty or offer possibility. The concept shapes her tactics (calculating trade routes, sketching harbor expansions) and charges the closure (maps as invitations, not commands). Early signal (+0.7), three beats (commission, preparation, execution +1.4), causal pressure strong (+1.4), closure linkage essential (+1.7), specificity high (+0.7). The entire story logic depends on this concept; removing it collapses the narrative. Base ~7.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Groundedly imaginative" is mentioned once as a label in the opening third ("groundedly imaginative, never letting fantasy overwhelm function") and demonstrated in Mira's approach to the maps (observable pattern + imagination). It does not constrain a specific on-page choice with visible cost. Setup present (+0.5), one beat (the writing scene shows the trait in action +0.4), causal pressure weak (+0.3), closure linkage indirect (+0.4). Label-only mention penalty (−0.3), swappability high (another temperament descriptor could replace it, −0.6). Base ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Prevail" appears explicitly once in the final third ("daring to prevail against the blankness") and implicitly frames the ending: Mira completes the maps and descends, having prevailed over fear and the lure of certainty. The action is more stance than turn; she does not face a dramatized moment of near-failure that tests prevailing. Setup absent (not signaled early, −0.4 per missing gate), one beat (closure paragraph +0.4), causal pressure moderate (+0.7), closure linkage strong (+1.3). Swappability moderate (another verb like "persist" or "succeed" could fit, −0.5). Base ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Predictive modeling is signaled in the commission ("model the future through mathematical pattern"), demonstrated in Mira's work (calculating trade routes, estimating population flows, probability wheels), and shapes the tactics she employs. The mechanics matter: she uses observable patterns to extrapolate possibilities. Early signal (+0.6), two beats (commission, execution +0.9), causal pressure strong (+1.2), closure linkage moderate (+0.8), specificity high (+0.6). Missing middle development (no choice between methods, −0.3 per missing gate). Base ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vividly established and anchor the tone (coldness, lost knowledge). The spire provides spatial isolation that frames the liminal moment; the frozen lake beneath reminds Mira of the ancients' failure, shaping her choice to write with humility. Early signal (+0.8), two beats (ascent, writing chamber +0.9), causal pressure moderate (+0.9), closure linkage indirect (she descends; ice remains unbroken +0.5), specificity strong (+0.6). The setting pressures tone and tactics but does not force a binary choice. Base ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "before the pen meets the blank page" is explicitly named and frames the story's central tension: the liminal space of infinite possibility. It anchors the opening third and the moment Mira lifts the quill. However, it does not create a ticking clock or narrow options through elapsed time; the story operates in a single extended present. Setup strong (+0.7), one beat (the moment of lifting the quill +0.4), causal pressure weak (+0.4), closure linkage indirect (she has moved past that threshold +0.3). The timeframe is more conceptual metaphor than tactical constraint. Base ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to seed innovation within a constraint" is attributed to Lord Varen and frames the commission: he wants maps that show what the kingdom could become to inspire wise choices within a dying economy. Mira internalizes this as her own goal (to show the future as invitation, not command). Early signal (+0.7), two beats (commission framing, execution +0.9), causal pressure strong (+1.3), closure linkage strong (+1.4), specificity good (+0.5). The motivation shapes her tactics and the maps' final form. Minor swappability (another reform-oriented goal could fit, −0.4). Base ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone is solemn, contemplative, and hopeful—consistent with "sustaining transformation." The prose modulates subtly from cold isolation (spire, ice) to warmth (kingfisher blue, dawn) as Mira completes her work. Tone charges the final image (humility, invitation, unbroken ice) and supports the theme. Setup present (+0.6), development across all beats (+1.0), closure linkage strong (+1.3), coherence high (+0.7). The tone does not shift dramatically under pressure but deepens steadily, which fits the Accumulative lens. Minor penalty for static mood across the reflective middle (−0.4). Base ~6.6.</comment>
