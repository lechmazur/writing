<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and layered—professional ambition plus the pursuit of mastery. Her olfactory sensitivity is embodied in decisions (tracking the flower, enduring its stench) and her final choice to leave surprises her, suggesting internal contradiction. The choice to descend with the seed rather than stay feels earned by her realization about serenity, though the epiphany leans slightly abstract. Minor slip: Thessaly remains somewhat static, serving more as guide than dynamic pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece operates under a hybrid lens: causal journey with accumulative texture. Orientation is swift (rope ladder, dawn, village name). The closure—Mira's realization that serenity is in motion, not place—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (conceptual repricing) with visible cost: she leaves the sanctuary. The seed becomes her portable lesson. One tightening: the flower's decay and her acceptance of its lesson narrow her understanding. Cost is legible in her departure and the burden of future cultivation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Canopica is vividly realized: platforms spiraling like frozen dancers, rope bridges, the corpse flower at the center. Sensory detail is POV-filtered (resin, smoke, decay-wrapped sweetness). The village's flower-like geometry discovered through her doodles charges the middle. The seed—dark and heavy as a promise—functions as micro-setting that will constrain future choices. Spatial choreography is clean. The treetop setting pressures her philosophy of motion versus stillness, shaping the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to gain wisdom through the corpse flower, which Mira frames as transforming practitioner into master. One meaningful tightening: the flower's 48-hour lifespan forces immersion in its stench and lesson. Her endurance through two nights, breathing the smell, narrows options to full acceptance or retreat. The final choice—leaving with the seed—forecloses the safer path of staying in serenity. Agency is clear; cost is the burden of cultivation and return to the turbulent world. Secondary accent: professional reputation, understated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wisdom hides in what we reject; death feeds life; serenity is motion, not stasis. The corpse flower's dual nature (repulsion/attraction) anchors the paradox without stating it baldly. Mira's doodles shift from monstrous to geometrically perfect, externalizing her arc. The final image—walking forward, serene within motion—answers the thematic question with a non-literal visual. Minor slip: "undercurrent of wisdom" appears twice as a phrase, risking abstraction, though it's mostly grounded in the flower's lesson. No sermon at the end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited, stable distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: olfactory cataloging ("resin from the walkway bindings, smoke from morning fires") and the burden/gift framing. Diction is controlled—"bark-rough hands," "wildflower hush," "heavy as a promise." Dialogue is spare but purposeful: Thessaly's lines carry subtext and village philosophy. Free indirect thought is clean. The prose reflects Mira's herbalist mind. Filter verbs (e.g., "understood," "recognized") appear but remain voice-motivated. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is controlled—"frozen dancers," "heavy as a promise"—without overwriting. Minor template cadence in the middle: "She recorded... She smelled... She sat..." clusters slightly but does not loop. The final paragraph modulates well. Proofreading is clean. One small hedge: "something darker—decay wrapped in sweetness" could be tighter. No major scaffold or paraphrase loops. Propulsion is steady.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The treetop village and corpse flower premise feel fresh in combination. The geometry discovery (village as flower) is a nice inflection. Mira's rejection of the sanctuary for motion-as-serenity inverts the expected hermit-finds-peace arc. The doodling-on-wrapping-paper custom adds specificity. The piece synthesizes familiar quest-for-wisdom elements but particularizes them through olfactory focus and geometric patterning. Risk is moderate: the philosophical ending could feel abstract, but the seed grounds it. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's choices drive key turns: tracking the flower by scent, sitting with it through two nights despite the stench, deciding to leave rather than stay. Her ambition frames the journey; her realization reshapes her tactic (cultivation at home vs. remaining in Canopica). Present in setup, development (endurance with the flower), and payoff (departure with seed). Causal pressure is clear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The corpse flower seed appears in setup (the bloom's 48-hour window promises it), development (she sits through decay to earn it), and payoff (she carries it against her heart, planning future cultivation). It's handled physically ("dark and heavy as a promise") and reweighted at closure: the seed becomes the portable lesson. Irreplaceable: removing it would collapse the closure's logic. Visible cost: she must cultivate it in seven years.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "undercurrent of wisdom" is named twice and shapes Mira's motivation. It manifests on-page as the flower's paradox (death feeds life, repulsion/attraction share roots). Her realization that wisdom means accepting contradiction without resolving it changes her tactics (leave, don't stay). Present in setup (her stated goal), middle (sitting with the flower's lesson), and payoff (serene motion). Specific enough to avoid pure abstraction, though the phrase itself leans conceptual.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Olfactory sensitivity is seeded early ("her nose already cataloging"), enables discovery (she smells the flower before Thessaly mentions it), constrains choice (markets overwhelm her into migraines), and pressures the climax (forcing herself to breathe the stench for two nights). It's trait-as-tool with visible cost: discomfort in crowds, physical distress during the vigil. Present in setup, development, and payoff. Irreplaceable: removing it would require a different discovery mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Journalizing appears in setup (she begins recording observations that evening) and middle (she journals through two nights with the flower). It pairs with doodling to reveal the village's geometry. The act is present but somewhat passive: it records rather than drives major turns. Removing it would weaken texture but not break causality if doodling alone remained. Mid-band: functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Doodling on wrapping paper is seeded early (family custom, her grandmother and mother), used in the middle to discover the village's flower-like geometry, and reprised at payoff (her doodles will guide cultivation). The custom is specific and tied to lineage. It enables a key insight (village as flower) that reframes her understanding. Two-beat involvement with closure linkage. Specificity (wrapping paper interiors, brown backing of packages) elevates integration. Could trend higher with more direct tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Canopica is established early (platforms, ancient branches, rope ladders), pressures Mira's philosophy (swaying platforms vs. steady hearts), and supplies the corpse flower at its center. The setting's geometry (spiraling platforms) becomes a realization that deepens the theme. Her departure from the village is the closure choice: rejecting sanctuary for motion. The treetop isolation enables the vigil; the village's arrangement mirrors the lesson. Irreplaceable: the village is the crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"At the turning of the tide's thought" is named in Thessaly's greeting and reprised at the very end ("The tide of thought turned again"). It frames the story's temporal window and charges the final image with cyclical resonance. However, it does not tighten tactics or create a ticking clock; the 48-hour flower deadline does that work. Present in setup and payoff but underdeveloped in the middle. Lyric reprise with modest reweighting: mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira's desire to cultivate serenity is stated early, dramatized through her study of the village's motion-within-stillness philosophy, and tested at closure when she realizes serenity is in how she moves, not where she stays. The motivation conflicts with her initial assumption (serenity as place) and the cost is leaving the achieved peace. Setup, development (philosophy lessons with Thessaly, vigil with the flower), and payoff all engage it. The friction between wanting stillness and needing motion drives the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Wildflower hush" is named once as a descriptor for the village days. The tone is contemplative, quiet, and textured (resin, smoke, decay-wrapped sweetness) without overt intensity. It modulates slightly under pressure (the stench assault during the vigil) but remains subdued. The final image ("serene within her motion") echoes the hush. Coherent but not dynamically charged across turns. Present in middle and payoff; could be stronger if the tone shifted more decisively at the climax.</comment>
