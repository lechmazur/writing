<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is concrete and purposeful—her psychometric process is embodied through temple pressure and spatial navigation. The grandmother's past love is vivid but functions as backstory rather than creating contradictory impulses in Vera herself. Vera's final choice to leave the film strip feels contemplative rather than driven by competing desires. The renunciation is present but lacks visible cost that forecloses a path; she achieves what she came for without trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with psychometric discovery building toward the closure realization that unused love needs planting, not retrieval—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid). The cost remains conceptual (accepting love's incompleteness) rather than felt in the body or through sacrifice. The final image reweights the premise but the price Vera pays is oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The projection booth is rendered with sharp sensory particulars—cork walls, the Simplex projector's cool metal, dust motes as snow. The booth functions as micro-setting, its intimacy and history shaping Vera's understanding of incubated stories. The film strip as object constrains her action (threading, loading) and charges the closure image. Environment directly enables the final planting gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and tightens through psychometric revelation. The midpoint turn (realizing this is a place to release, not retrieve) narrows options under the Accumulative lens. The final act of loading the film delivers agency through renunciation, but the price (what Vera loses or risks) remains abstract. No secondary pressure tests her commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the film-as-preservation metaphor and the shift from storage to planting. The goodbye letters' journey from suppressed message to seed avoids thesis statement while reweighting the opening question. The final image—"seeds of feeling pressed into fertile shadow"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: "hushed thunder" and "forgotten lyrics" are named rather than fully embodied in scene texture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is consistent—Vera notices architectures of memory, projectionists' ghosts, film as living medium. Diction occasionally tilts elevated ("luminous jungle," "psychic landscape") but remains voice-motivated and legible. No dialogue present to evaluate. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized") are sparse and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong figurative control—"seats folded shut like sleeping birds," "vines in a luminous jungle." Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor template cadence in the psychometry sequence: "Images came...," "She was preserving...," "The images shifted..." repeats stems across adjacent paragraphs. No loops or scaffold that obscure causality. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—psychometry + unused love storage + film as medium—synthesizes familiar grief/memory material into a specific angle. The turn from retrieval to release is earned rather than clever. Risk-taking in metaphysical architecture (the golden room, film strips as vines) heightens without obscuring. Transformation test passes: plot requires this grandmother, this projector, this medium. Slightly safe in emotional range; Vera's journey lacks friction or doubt.</comment>
