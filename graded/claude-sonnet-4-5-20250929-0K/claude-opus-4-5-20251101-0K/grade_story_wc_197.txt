<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her resourcefulness shows through concrete choices (building the network, triggering the decoy). However, her interior life remains largely abstract—we see capability without genuine struggle or internal contradiction. The three-year preparation collapsing to hours should create panic or sacrifice, but she executes flawlessly without visible cost to her composure or values. The final choice to "reappear" and continue feels more like a plot move than a character-driven necessity that forecloses another path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a causal chain—message arrives, Mira acts, documents are uploaded—but the closure lacks felt cost. She succeeds completely: files distributed, enforcers fooled, job retained, truth spreading. The "holding the line" frame suggests Earned Stasis, but no path is visibly foreclosed; she gains everything without trade-off. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when by the lagoon opening). The lens reads as Causal with light Situational shading, but the ending deflates pressure rather than crystallizing it with undeniable weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The auric lagoon and Pacific Bell logo ground the world in specific, engineered details. The puddle-reflection navigation is vivid and purposeful, shaping her route. However, the underground vault and tunnels remain generic—"shelves," "secondary exit"—without tactile constraint or spatial cost. The lagoon recurs at the end but as postcard atmosphere rather than a charged element that alters her final stance or the reader's understanding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving truth against the Council—is clear, and the midnight raid compresses time. Yet Mira's plan works without hitch: decoy succeeds, escape is clean, network holds. No reversal tests her commitment; the Council's threat evaporates off-page. The ending lists future resistance but offers no on-page tightening or price paid. The escalation is declared (three years reduced to hours) rather than dramatized through a choice that costs her something she values.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of contested history and the "tyranny of indifference" emerges through the vault's evidence and Mira's patient method. The phone booth key as a relic of connection-versus-control carries conceptual weight. However, the final paragraph edges into direct statement ("history isn't written once… acts of coded freedom") rather than trusting the image to resonate. The lagoon's reappearance invites questions but doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; it reads as thematic echo rather than a non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual filter (light-reading, geometric navigation, historical awareness). The prose maintains appropriate distance and interiority. Minor slips: "holding the line against the tyranny of indifference" in both thought and final reflection feels like prompt-language rather than character idiom under stress. Filter verbs ("she heard," "she found") are present but don't flatten immediacy. No dialogue to assess. The narrator's certainty about off-page events (enforcers' report, global truth-surfacing) slightly exceeds POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with varied syntax. Some scaffold and near-loops: "Too quiet, they said. Too compliant" followed immediately by "She had cultivated that perception carefully, resourcefully" restates the underestimation without adding pressure. "Carefully resourceful" recurs as a label in multiple beats without fresh embodiment. The opening "archives said / first history they revised" parallelism is purposeful; the puddle-reflection passage is vivid and concretely rendered. Final paragraphs edge into summary rather than scene density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The underestimated-archivist premise and light-based navigation offer fresh texture, and the phone booth key as obsolete tech is a nice specific. However, the core plot—rebel preserves evidence, outsmarts authoritarian regime, truth spreads—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived cost or non-obvious moral calculus. The ending's "keep fighting… invisible and essential" reads as a restatement of the premise rather than an earned complication. Mira's flawless execution reduces surprise and emotional specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's underestimation is signaled early (quiet, compliant, archivist's assistant) and shapes her tactics (building in shadows, triggering decoy, reappearing at work). Her choices create the key turns: following the map, uploading files, escaping. However, the trait is more strategic advantage than constraint; she is never genuinely doubted on-page in a way that costs her. The element drives two beats (vault discovery, reappearance) and frames the ending, placing it in mid-band with modest causal pressure but limited felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The phone booth key is introduced early (grandmother's deathbed gift), used at the maintenance shaft lock, and returns in the final image as a thematic anchor (connection versus control). It appears in three distinct beats and carries conceptual weight. However, its function is straightforward—unlocks a door—without evolving use or constraint that alters tactics. The ending reprise reweights meaning but doesn't tie to a visible cost. Solidly functional with lyric resonance, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Revised histories frame the opening, drive the vault's contents (evidence contradicting Council narratives), and shape Mira's stakes throughout. The concept alters tactics: her three-year documentation effort, the decoy to protect files, the distributed network. It appears in the closure's consequence (truth surfaces, questions multiply) with clear cost to the Council's control. The element is essential across setup, middle development, and payoff, with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is labeled twice (opening, "she was carefully resourceful") and mentioned in the ending's "patience and precision," but the trait is illustrated rather than constrained. Mira's resourcefulness enables success (network, decoy, tunnels) without visible trade-off or moment where caution costs her speed or boldness. The attribute is present and functional but largely swappable with "clever" or "thorough" without structural loss. Lacks the on-page cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Reappear" anchors a major turn: Mira walks back into the Central Archive after her supposed death and the vault's destruction, maintaining her cover. The action is signaled early (archives said she died in 2087) and pays off in the ending sequence where she files reports and resumes resistance. It shapes two beats (the return, the implication for future work) and ties to the closure's persistence theme. However, the reappearance itself is summarized rather than dramatized with immediate tension or cost, limiting indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The puddle-reflection map is vividly rendered in the middle section, guiding Mira through the marshland with geometric precision and science the Council dismissed. It shapes one key beat (finding the hidden shaft) and is set up early (grandmother taught her this method). The method constrains her route and validates her grandmother's knowledge. However, it does not return at closure or impose cost; once used, it disappears. Functional with strong middle development but no payoff linkage, capping it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The auric lagoon frames the opening and closing, described as engineered distraction whose beauty hides erased meaning. It provides atmosphere and thematic context (what it replaced) but does not constrain Mira's choices or supply tactical resources. The setting is postcard-level description rather than micro-setting that alters her moves. The closing reprise invites questions but does not reweight the dominant stake with visible cost. Present in setup and payoff but without middle causal pressure, landing mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe—plans collapsing from three years to hours, midnight raid deadline—tightens decisions early and drives urgency. Mira works quickly to upload files before the enforcers arrive. However, the clock is largely abstract; we don't track minutes or feel time pressure escalate on the page. The "three hours later" summary deflates urgency rather than sustaining it. The element shapes setup and middle pressure but fades at closure, limiting integration to functional mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Holding the line against the tyranny of indifference" is stated early as her network's shared belief and returns in the ending's summary. The motivation frames her resistance but is told rather than dramatized through a conflicted choice where indifference (her own or others') creates friction. Mira never wrestles with doubt, weariness, or the temptation to let someone else carry the burden. The phrase recurs as label without embodied cost, keeping it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The tone suggests hidden resistance and encrypted meaning (light-reading, "coded freedom" in the final lines, truth surfacing through "cracks"). It modulates from contemplative opening to urgent middle to quiet resolve at the end. However, "coded freedom" arrives late as a thematic label rather than a tonal signature woven through diction and image. The tone is coherent but not charged with sufficient specificity or recurring motif to elevate the final image. Functional with modest payoff linkage.</comment>
