<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation is clear and rooted in her father's legacy, but her interior life leans heavily on repeated invocations of the watch fob without revealing contradictory impulses in action. The market crowd remains undifferentiated and her interactions feel more atmospheric than pressured. The final choice to destroy the cylinder reads as straightforward rather than earned through visible internal conflict—she faces no genuine temptation to use it or sell it. Embodied emotion is present but the peak beat lacks the cost of renunciation that would elevate the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under a Causal lens with clear who/where/when anchors by the opening paragraph. The closure—Eliza securing the cylinder and preserving the truce—lands on the page with a decision that forecloses the deal, though the cost registers more as relief than sacrifice. The watch fob recurs but its symbolic weight doesn't narrow her options in the final beat. One meaningful tightening occurs when she intercepts the handoff, but the escalation from prior failed attempts to success feels more like persistence than a causal reversal that changes her knowledge or tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail—lanterns, eel tanks, copper cylinders—that grounds the action without catalog drift. Spatial choreography remains clear through Eliza's movement and the final beat reuses the pier setting to charge her emergence at dawn. The watch fob functions as micro-setting, constraining her grip and priming the interception moment. Minor slip: the market's "comfortable unease" is asserted more than shown through environmental pressure on her choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the truce by stopping the recording exchange—is signaled early and coheres through the chase. The story delivers one meaningful tightening when Eliza intercepts the cylinder after two prior failures, but the escalation reads as procedural success rather than a choice that trades one live option for another. The courier and assistant offer minimal resistance, and no secondary pressure (e.g., a rival recognizing her, a time crunch forcing a visible sacrifice) raises the cost of success. Agency is present but the final act feels more like execution than a decision under fire.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the truce-of-hush premise and Eliza's role as "keeper of silence," avoiding overt statements until the penultimate paragraph's "guardian of the hush" phrasing edges toward label-speak. The watch fob recurs with shifting weight, though its return at closure doesn't reweight prior material beyond continuity. The story resists simplistic morals and the "sound of trust breaking" concept invites reflection, but the ending's peace-and-pride resolution trends toward tidy emotional satisfaction rather than charged ambiguity. Minor thematic echo in "she felt something like peace" softens the final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and close, with perceptual signature tied to Eliza's smuggler heritage and tactile focus on the watch fob. Diction remains consistent—"salt-thick darkness," "acoustic amber"—and the prose modulates with pressure during the interception beat. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the eel-seller's line carries subtext without clutter. Minor slip: "curiously steadfast" appears as narratorial commentary rather than dramatized trait, and the final paragraph's "her father's ghost was finally proud" leans toward telling the emotional payoff rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in action beats, though the opening paragraph stacks three metaphors in quick succession ("captured stars," "crescents in her skin," "sharks in these underground waters") without clear pattern-teaching. The watch fob anchors recur across beats but edge toward synonym churn—"lucky charm," "tiny anchor," "brass pieces," "prayer"—without each instance adding pressure. No loops or scaffold mar the closure beat, and grammar is clean. Propulsion is steady but the interception sequence compresses key action into summary ("she was already gone") where a micro-beat of evasion would sharpen the stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pirate market and sound-bottling premise offer a fresh genre synthesis, and the truce-of-hush concept provides a non-obvious moral calculus. The watch fob as inherited talisman and Eliza's role as moonshine runner's daughter trend toward familiar beats without full transformation—her arc follows a competent-daughter-avenging-father template. The "sound of trust breaking" conceit is inventive but underutilized; we never learn how it was captured or why it threatens the truce beyond assertion. The story commits to its premise but retreats from the boldest implications—Eliza never considers using the recording herself, and the final image opts for dawn-and-peace closure rather than a charged ambiguity that would elevate risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eliza drives the key turn by intercepting the cylinder, altering the deal's outcome through her shoulder-check and catch. Her prior failed attempts set up the successful move, and her final decision to destroy the recording (stated but not shown) completes the arc. Setup is immediate, middle development includes the interception choice, and closure references her role as keeper of silence. The element is essential across beats but the final image's reliance on told resolution ("she'd destroy it before sunrise") slightly reduces irreplaceability—another smuggler could execute the same plan.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The watch fob appears in five beats: opening anchor, backstory touchstone, interception moment (clicking with cylinder), final grip, and closing prayer image. It enables the catch through physical proximity and charges the closure line, but its mechanics are static—no evolving use or tactical constraint beyond continuity. The "CONSTANT" engraving and frozen time (3:47) seed thematic weight, and the final reprise reweights it as paternal approval rather than mere luck charm. Meets all three gates but swappable with another heirloom keepsake without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The truce of hush shapes the dominant stake on the page—Eliza's goal is to prevent the recording from shattering the peace between smuggling families. It's signaled early, constrains her tactics (she must intercept rather than negotiate), and the closure affirms its survival. The concept drives the interception beat and the final image references her role as its guardian. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, but the truce itself remains abstract—no on-page enforcement mechanism or visible faction representative tests its fragility in scene, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast" is mentioned once as narratorial label and restated as "patience from her father" without constraining an on-page choice. It's invoked to justify her third attempt after two failures, but the attribute doesn't create a visible tradeoff—doggedness enables success without cost. No setup in first third, no middle constraint, and no closure participation beyond thematic assertion. Swappable with "persistent" or "determined" without altering logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Thwart" is the story's spine—Eliza's goal to stop the deal drives every beat from setup through closure. The interception is the key turn, and the final image confirms success. Two prior failed attempts establish the action's difficulty and the third's stakes. The element is signaled early, shapes middle tactics, and delivers the closure effect. High causal pressure and irreplaceability—removing "thwart" leaves no story. Strong integration across all three gates with visible cost (risk of injury, nerve).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Two prior failures are recounted in summary ("she'd approached too directly," "waited too long"), establishing the method before the successful third attempt. The false starts shape her tactical adjustment—this time she uses patience and proximity rather than direct confrontation. Setup is delayed until mid-story, middle development includes the lesson learned, and closure shows the successful application. Functional but the prior attempts are told rather than dramatized, reducing mechanical weight. Swappable with "learning from mistakes" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The pirate market pressures Eliza's tactics through crowd cover, vendor invisibility, and spatial choreography (eel tank as mirror, narrow passages for escape). Setup is immediate and vivid, middle beat uses the tank's reflective surface to track the courier, and closure sends her beneath the pier into dawn. The setting supplies resources (crowd anonymity) and constraints (rotting planks, labyrinthine passages) that affect outcome. Strong across all three gates with causal pressure and closure participation. Removing the specific underground locale would require significant rework of tactics and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sunrise is invoked three times: "until sunrise" in setup, "before sunrise" at the cylinder's planned destruction, and "first gray light of dawn" at closure. The timeframe tightens the stakes and the final image confirms she "made it," but the clock itself doesn't alter her moves—no on-page moment where dwindling time forces a visible sacrifice or tactical shift. All three gates met with moderate causal pressure and closure linkage, but the time element remains more atmospheric than mechanically decisive. A longer or shorter window wouldn't break the interception logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The stated motivation is to prevent the sound from reaching the Hollow Men, but the prompt element—"to capture the sound of trust breaking"—is inverted. Eliza seeks to destroy the recording, not capture it; Madame Vex captured it off-page. The element appears as object and concept but not as Eliza's desire. Setup mentions the sound, middle beat involves intercepting it, closure plans its destruction. Functional as plot device but misaligned with the specified motivation. Label-only friction and no visible friction between wanting the sound and its cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Comforting unease" is named once and demonstrated through vendor behavior ("looking through her rather than at her") and Eliza's felt safety among dangerous people. The tone modulates subtly—tense during interception, relieved at escape, peaceful at closure. It charges the final image's "comfortable unease" callback and "something like peace" resolution. Setup is early, middle beat sustains the atmosphere through market transactions, and closure reprises the phrase with thematic weight. Coherent through turns but static in execution—no tonal shift that intensifies or subverts the initial mood under peak pressure.</comment>
