<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Morrigan's motivation—recovering lost time with her daughter—is clear and rooted in maternal exhaustion, though her interior voice occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("sediment of what was to find what had been lost") that feels authored rather than lived. The ritual actions (spreading cards, unfastening the cord) carry embodied specificity, but the pivotal moment of touching the recovered memories lacks contradictory impulses; she simply accepts them without friction. The ending gesture—tracing her daughter's hands "on a thousand tablecloths"—reads as a tidy resolution rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear anchoring (midnight glade, three years post-birth) and builds through layered image work (cards, saucer, cord). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Morrigan recovers lost moments and commits to presence, reweighting her relationship to motherhood. However, the cost is largely retrospective understanding ("too exhausted... to hold it all") rather than a present forfeiture, and the final image—Iris waiting with grandmother—feels arranged for emotional satisfaction rather than earned through on-page pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the card-door opens, but the stakes never tighten into a trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The midnight glade is vivid and purposeful—jasmine, ozone, cloud sea—filtered through Morrigan's exhausted sensory palette. The cracked saucer functions as micro-setting, anchoring memory and charging the ritual, which satisfies the gate for 9+ eligibility. Spatial choreography (silver ladder, grass, card spread) remains clear throughout. However, the glade's mechanics (why this place accumulates lost time) are asserted rather than demonstrated through environmental constraint, and the final moment places Iris at the ladder's base without prior setup of how she arrived there.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming lost maternal moments—is signaled early and sustained. The ritual structure provides one modest tightening when the leather cord becomes "the lock," but this functions more as revelation than pressure-driven choice. Morrigan faces no competing cost or trade-off; the glade simply restores what was lost without demanding renunciation or endurance. The resolution is received rather than fought for, and while the protagonist's interior shift (understanding her exhaustion) provides thematic closure, it doesn't narrow options or test commitment under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the cracked saucer, the cloudbound glade metaphor, and the hand-tracing custom: maternal presence, the weight of transformation, and the archaeology of lost time. The piece resists moralizing and allows complexity—"time had not been stolen—she had simply been too exhausted"—without tidy redemption. The final image of tracing hands "never forgetting again" reweights prior material with quiet resonance. However, the glade's function as literal reservoir feels convenient, and the piece occasionally drifts toward prompt-label phrasing ("accumulated weight of moments they had squandered").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Morrigan notices through cartomantic metaphor ("divination was not prophecy but archaeology") and maternal exhaustion. Distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the card-door moment. However, elevated diction—"choking beauty," "wounded" stars, "fault line" imagery—occasionally strains against the focalizer's lived-in voice, especially during peak emotional beats. Free indirect style is clean, and the prose rhythm accelerates through the ritual sequence, though the final paragraph's certainty ("never forgetting again") reads as narratorial assurance rather than character-earned stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and image density is high ("jasmine and ozone and something older, something like grief preserved in amber"). However, the piece carries noticeable scaffold: paraphrase loops ("reached for the cards," "withdrew the cracked saucer," "placed the saucer"), metaphor stacking in descriptive passages, and template cadence ("There was... There was... There were") in the moment-recovery sequence. The cracked-porcelain/fault-line pairing is vivid but borders on over-figuration. Propulsion is solid through the ritual beats, yet the final paragraph's summary ("three years of love restored") tells rather than showing the recovery's felt weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cloudbound glade as literal repository for lost time offers a fresh synthesis of memory-recovery and maternal exhaustion, and the cartomancer's divination-as-archaeology frame is specific. However, the core emotional arc—reclaiming lost moments of early motherhood—follows a familiar template, and the magical solution (the glade restores everything without cost) retreats from harder questions about what cannot be recovered. The hand-tracing custom and cracked saucer provide concrete anchors, but the resolution's convenience undercuts the premise's initial risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Morrigan drives all major beats: climbing the ladder, spreading cards, unfastening the cord, and reaching into the recovered moments. Her choices (performing the ritual, releasing the lock) create the closure turn. Present in setup, middle development, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cracked saucer appears in three beats: withdrawal from pack, placement at card-center, and glowing at moment-recovery. It anchors Iris's fleeting presence and charges the ritual, but its crack—the "fault line" Iris wept over—does not constrain choice or shift meaning at closure; it simply glows. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cloudbound repentance frames the glade's function (pilgrims confess to "accumulated weight of moments they had squandered") and shapes Morrigan's stakes: the glade is where lost time pools. It drives her journey and the ritual's logic. Present in setup, development, and ending, though the mechanics remain asserted rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Willingly perplexed" appears once as label ("willingly perplexed by the ritual she was attempting, uncertain whether this was magic or madness") without constraining an on-page choice or introducing cost. It gestures at internal conflict but does not alter tactics or recur. Ornamental mention, late in first third.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Unfastening the leather cord is the decisive action: "the cord was the lock." It triggers the card-door's opening and grants access to lost moments, reshaping the entire closure sequence. Signaled early (cord tied by Iris, sworn never to undo) and its release carries symbolic weight (breaking a vow to recover what was lost). Indispensable to the ending's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Hand-tracing as family custom appears twice: Morrigan traces her hand on the grass mid-ritual (activating the cards), and the closing image promises she'll trace Iris's hands "on a thousand tablecloths, never forgetting again." Signaled, used to enable the ritual, and reprised with reweighted meaning at closure. The method shapes one key turn and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The midnight glade provides essential setup (where lost time accumulates), physical structure (silver ladder, moonlit grass, cloud sea), and atmospheric pressure ("choking beauty," stars "close enough to wound"). Its unique properties—floating above clouds, pooling lost time—enable the entire ritual and constrain Morrigan's approach. Present across all beats and integral to closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The three-year timeframe since Iris's birth establishes urgency and frames the loss Morrigan seeks to recover. It appears in setup, drives the emotional stakes, and the recovered moments span this window. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions during the ritual itself; no clock pressures her choices. Functional across beats but does not escalate tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation—finding where lost time accumulates—is dramatized through Morrigan's three-year search, the climb, and the ritual enactment. It drives every choice and is tested on the page when she reaches into the darkness to reclaim moments. The desire conflicts with prior exhaustion (the cost of new motherhood) and shapes the closure realization. Present in setup, development, and ending with visible friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Choking beauty" modulates through the piece: the glade's "jasmine and ozone and something older, something like grief preserved in amber," the "wounded" stars, and the bittersweet recovery of moments Morrigan "had simply been too exhausted... to hold." Tone tightens during the card-door opening and softens at closure. Coherent, purposeful, and it charges the final image's quiet triumph.</comment>
