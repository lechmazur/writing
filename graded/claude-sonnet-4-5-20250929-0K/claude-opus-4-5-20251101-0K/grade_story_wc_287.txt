<comment>Marina's interiority is concrete and character-specific ("feeling the absence of those crimson blooms like a missing tooth"), and her wistful pragmatism constrains micro-choices throughout. The wave to the stranger and the decision to direct moonlight are earned by her philosophy of "small, persistent" gestures. Internal contradiction exists (mourning the rosebush while accepting endings), though it remains largely reflective rather than acted in scene. The final renunciation—accepting bare branches and planning spring pruning—reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost (foreclosing immediate grief for future tending).</comment>

<comment>Orientation anchors quickly: fire escape garden, midnight, five stories above an alley. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through the rosebush's death, the grandfather's inheritance, the harbor rhythm, and the stranger's face, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Marina commits to future planting with visible cost (accepting loss, holding space for endings). One meaningful deepening occurs when the stranger's face appears and the wave is returned, reweighting Marina's isolation into witnessed connection. Causality is clean; no unmotivated leaps. The closure lands on the page with felt cost: she sits among containers, "holding space for everything that grew and everything that ended."</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The fire escape garden, luminous harbor, condemned building across the alley, and the brass bitting gauge all constrain Marina's choices: she cannot leave tomatoes elsewhere, the moonlight reflection depends on harbor position, and the stranger's window location shapes the gesture. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("garbage and rain," "hammered silver" water, "gaunt" face). The body-as-setting (kneeling, trembling hand) charges the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across five stories, alley, and opposite window. The harbor's rhythm ("oars dipping and rising") recurs to anchor the closure beat, and the environment evolves causally (bare branches at midnight, spring pruning planned).</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Marina's need to "reflect light into dark corners" after the rosebush dies. One meaningful tightening occurs when she directs the reflected moonlight toward the stranger's window, a micro-choice that narrows her solitary mourning into witnessed connection. The stranger's face appearing and hand rising is a reversal that validates her gesture with visible cost (vulnerability, exposure). Agency is renunciation and endurance: she accepts the rosebush's death, plans future planting, and commits to "holding space" with no guarantee of bloom. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; no coincidental resolution. The cost is legible: she trades immediate comfort for long-term tending, embodied in the phrase "sometimes that had to be enough."</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the bitting gauge, the rosebush's cycle, and the stranger's response: "Light found its way into dark corners not through grand gestures but through small, persistent ones." No overt moralizing; the final image (sitting among containers, "keeper of a small green kingdom") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to tend life amid endings. The grandfather's inheritance reweights from literal tool to metaphor for persistence without spelling it out. Emotional truth avoids sentimentality; Marina's pragmatism and grief coexist without resolution. The quivering hush recurs with purpose, charging the stranger's appearance. Subtext operates in the twice-disappeared tomatoes and the stranger's retreat after waving. The ending resists tidy morals, embracing complexity: blooms may return, or they may not, and Marina endures either way.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Single third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Marina notices "rusted coffee cans," "cracked terracotta," and harbor rhythms through a gardener's lens. Diction is controlled and consistent ("wistfully pragmatic," "erosion of her mother's memory," "small green kingdom"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Narrative certainty matches Marina's knowledge; the stranger remains gaunt and uncertain, not diagnosed. Purposeful elision: the grandfather's death and Marina's divorces are compressed to prime the present without flatline exposition. The prose has rhythmic variety ("That was the philosophy… But tonight, something shifted") and modulates under pressure (trembling hand, held breath). No dialogue present to evaluate. The final image reconfigures prior material with syntactic control: "holding space for everything that grew and everything that ended."</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (each line advances setting, memory, or gesture). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent: "hammered silver" harbor, "missing tooth" absence, "small green kingdom." One minor register drift: "instill something in that stranger" reads slightly elevated for Marina's established voice, though it anchors to the grandfather's phrase. Clarity and propulsion are strong; no scaffolding. Grammar and punctuation are clean; pronoun references unambiguous. The opening line anchors stakes and voice; the final line recharges motifs (containers, growth, endings) without overwriting. Stock phrase "protected, vulnerable" recurs three times across the piece, creating minor textural redundancy (−0.3 for pattern-artifact). High information density and zero loops otherwise; no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The fire escape garden premise is familiar, but the combination of rosebush death, lockmaster's inheritance, and illegal stranger across the alley offers specific synthesis. The bitting gauge as light-reflection tool is a fresh inflection, earned by the grandfather's phrase and Marina's gesture. Emotional truth is particular: "feeling the absence of those crimson blooms like a missing tooth" avoids generic grief templates. The turn (stranger's face appearing) feels inevitable in hindsight, rooted in the twice-disappeared tomatoes. However, the "reflect light into dark corners" frame echoes common metaphors for kindness and connection; the piece transforms it through the brass tooth and moonlight mechanics, but the core emotional arc (isolated gardener reaches out to unseen neighbor) follows a recognizable template. Transformation is solid, not exceptional. No proximity to famous lines; idiom and world logic read authentic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Marina (fire escape gardener) is present from the opening line and her choices create key turns: kneeling among containers, withdrawing the brass tooth, directing moonlight, waving to the stranger, and committing to future planting. Setup clear (first paragraph). Development: her decision to reflect light narrows options from solitary mourning to connection attempt. Payoff: she "turned to the bare rosebush" and resolved to prune and plant anew, embodying Earned Stasis. Three distinct beats (mourning, gesture, resolution). Causal pressure: her philosophy of "small, persistent" gestures enables the moonlight tactic. Closure linkage: the final image depends on her stance as "keeper of a small green kingdom." Cost visible: she accepts vulnerability and future uncertainty. Irreplaceable: no other character could anchor this arc. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, cost +0.5, specificity +0.6 = strong high-7 to low-8 range; round to 8.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The lockmaster's bitting gauge tooth appears in two distinct beats: withdrawal with grandfather's memory (middle) and use to reflect moonlight toward the stranger's window (climax). Setup: introduced early (third paragraph). Development: its use to reflect light constrains Marina's gesture (she cannot reach across physically; the brass tooth enables the tactic). Payoff: it charges the stranger's appearance and is then "tucked back into her pocket," bracketing the gesture. Reweighted meaning: literal tool becomes enacted metaphor. Causal role: without it, Marina has no means to signal across the alley. Specificity: "bitting gauge tooth" and "tiny constellations" are irreplaceable details. Cost tied to it: vulnerability of the gesture. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.7, cost +0.4 = mid-to-high 7 range; 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The "quivering hush" appears three times: as descriptor after Marina tilts the brass tooth, again at the ending ("felt the quivering hush settle around her"), and once in the phrase "protected, vulnerable" hush. Setup: mid-story (not first third). Development: the hush frames the moment before the stranger appears, shaping emotional stakes but not altering tactics. Payoff: recurs in the final paragraph, reweighting isolation into "protected" space. Does not constrain choices; it is atmospheric and thematic. Two-gate presence (development as mood anchor, closure recurrence). Lyric reprise reweights the stake: the hush moves from suspense to acceptance. Late signal −0.4, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (thematic reprise) +1.0, swappability (could be "quiet" or "stillness") −0.6, ornamental in middle −0.5 = low-6 range; 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Wistfully pragmatic" is labeled in the second paragraph and demonstrated through Marina's mourning-plus-acceptance stance: she watches the petal fall with sorrow yet plans spring pruning without delay. Setup: early (second paragraph). Development: the trait enables her to leave tomatoes twice (pragmatic kindness) and to reflect moonlight (wistful hope). Payoff: the final commitment to replant embodies both wistfulness (hope for blooms) and pragmatism (acceptance of endings). One visible tradeoff: she cannot indulge prolonged grief; she must act. The trait constrains her emotional arc but is partly label-reliant ("wistfully pragmatic about death" is told). Early signal +0.6, one-to-two beats +0.7, causal enablement +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, cost +0.4, label-heavy −0.6, swappability (could be "resigned optimism") −0.5 = mid-6 range; 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>"Instill" (to reflect light and convey hope to the stranger) drives the central gesture: Marina tilts the brass tooth to send moonlight across the alley, aiming to "instill something in that stranger… Hope, maybe. Or simply the knowledge that someone knew they existed." Setup: stated explicitly mid-story. Development: the action narrows Marina's mourning into outward gesture. Payoff: the stranger's face and returned wave validate the instilling attempt, and Marina's resolve to "hold space" completes it. Major turn traces to this action: without the moonlight gesture, the stranger does not appear. Causal pressure: the method (reflection) and goal (instill hope) are interdependent. Cost: vulnerability and the risk of no response. Swappability concern: "offer" or "give" would convey similar intent with minor edits, lowering irreplaceability. Mid-appearance −0.3, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, cost +0.5, swappability −0.6 = mid-to-high 7 range; 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>"With the rhythm of oars in water" appears as atmospheric description: "boats rocking with the rhythm of oars in water as late fishermen returned" and recurs at closure ("The fishermen's boats continued their slow rhythm below, oars dipping and rising"). Setup: present early (fourth paragraph). Development: does not shape Marina's attempts or constrain her choices; it is metaphorical backdrop. Payoff: recurs in the final paragraph as mood anchor, reinforcing the theme of persistence but not altering tactics. Two-gate presence (early seed, closure reprise). Lyric reprise reweights meaning (ancient pulse connects moment to time), but no causal role. Functional metaphor without mechanical necessity. Early signal +0.4, two touches +0.6, closure linkage (thematic only) +0.6, ornamental in development −0.8, swappability (any natural rhythm) −0.5 = low-to-mid 4 range; 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The "luminous harbor by moonlight" is present throughout: opening line ("luminous harbor, where moonlight turned the water into hammered silver"), enables the brass tooth's reflection, and recurs at closure ("the harbor shimmered"). Setup: immediate (first paragraph). Development: moonlight is the resource Marina uses to reflect toward the stranger's window; without it, the gesture fails. Payoff: harbor imagery bookends the piece, reweighting isolation into connection. Micro-setting (moonlight) constrains the tactic (she needs reflective light). Causal role: the method depends on the setting. Specificity: "hammered silver" and "luminous" are vivid but not irreplaceable (any bright night would suffice). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (descriptive, not unique mechanics) +0.4, swappability (any moonlit setting) −0.6 = high-6 to low-7 range; 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>The timeframe "after the final petal drops from the old rosebush" anchors the opening ("The last petal fell… at exactly midnight") and recurs implicitly throughout (bare branches, spring plans). Setup: immediate. Development: the petal's fall triggers Marina's reflective turn and the decision to use the brass tooth, shaping the emotional stakes. Payoff: the bare rosebush returns at closure ("she turned to the bare rosebush. In the spring, she would prune it back hard"), completing the cycle. The timeframe does not create urgency or tighten tactics (no live clock), but it frames causality (petal drop → mourning → gesture → resolution). Two-to-three beats. Early signal +0.7, causal framing +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, time does not tighten decisions (no countdown pressure) −0.8, swappability (any recent loss) −0.4 = mid-6 range; 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>"To reflect light into dark corners" is Marina's inherited and enacted motivation: the grandfather's phrase ("To reflect light into dark corners… That's all any of us can do"), Marina's realization ("She understood now… He meant the shadows that gathered in the corners of lives"), and her moonlight gesture toward the stranger. Setup: early (third–fourth paragraphs). Development: the desire drives the brass tooth's use and the choice to signal the stranger, creating friction (vulnerability, risk of rejection). Payoff: the motivation is enacted and validated by the stranger's wave, then generalized into future tending. Cost: exposure and uncertainty. Three beats (inheritance, realization, action). Dramatized through the gesture, not merely told. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, friction/cost +0.5, specificity +0.6 = low-to-mid 8 range; 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>"Protected vulnerability" (or "protected, vulnerable" as written) recurs three times as tone descriptor: "a quivering hush… protected, vulnerable, like a held breath before a confession," and twice at closure. Setup: mid-story (after the moonlight gesture). Development: the tone modulates Marina's internal state during the stranger's appearance, charging the risk. Payoff: "Protected. Vulnerable. Alive." closes the piece, embodying the final stance. The tone is coherent across turns and charges the ending image. Two touches (mid-gesture, closure). Causal role: the tone reflects emotional stakes but does not constrain tactics. Specificity: the pairing is distinctive. Mid-appearance −0.3, two beats +0.9, closure charge +1.6, coherence under pressure +1.0, causal role (mood, not tactic) −0.4, repetition as craft choice +0.3 = mid-7 range; 7.3.</comment>
