<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied through the jade cicada and her handling of it, with clear contradictory impulses (studying transitions versus living them). The confession "I had confused studying transitions with living through them" feels earned by prior material. Elena's micro-choices (touching the cicada, softening her voice, offering to learn) create a credible arc. Minor deduction: some therapy-adjacent phrasing ("warmly observant of her own memory") appears but does not dominate peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure—the pause between question and answer accumulates density through layered reflection, then releases into Charged Poise when Elena touches the cicada and offers to learn. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (mother and daughter begin emergence) with felt cost (years of absence acknowledged, path of slow repair). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening tightens the dominant stake (estrangement versus reconnection) through tangential answer that reweights prior material at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto setting is vivid and filtered through Mira's professional lens (mineral deposits, tidal pools as "universes in miniature"). Spatial choreography is coherent: pools at Elena's foot, jade cicada placed "on the stone between them," starlight overhead. The micro-setting (jade cicada held toward starlight) charges the final image when Elena lifts it. Minor gap: the grotto as physical constraint could press a choice more directly; here it functions primarily as atmosphere and symbolic resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciliation or continued estrangement) is signaled by Elena's opening question. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira's tangential answer shifts Elena from "jaw remained tight" to touching the cicada with "voice had lost its sharp edge." The cost is legible: Mira admits failure ("I had confused studying transitions"), foreclosing the path of denial. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through layered reflection that forces Mira's confession. Minor deduction: the turn feels more conversational softening than a high-stakes narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme (time as texture, transition, emergence) arises from concrete particulars: cicadas underground, tide pool rhythms, the pause between question and answer. The jade cicada's meaning deepens from meeting-gift to symbol of patient transformation. The ending offers a resonant image (cicada held to starlight, "slow work of emergence") without a stated moral. Deduction: "warmly observant" and the final paragraph's explicit thematic summary ("some textures of time could only be felt by living through them") edge toward overt commentary rather than letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Mira; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during confession, wider for the grotto's "ancient and patient" reflection). Diction is mostly controlled with a distinct perceptual signature (tidal-pool chronicler's eye). Dialogue carries subtext: Elena's "That doesn't explain anything" softens via line rhythm, and her final "Maybe you could teach me" pursues reconciliation obliquely. Minor deduction: "warmly observant of her own memory" and "warmly observant of this fragile new beginning" are slightly elevated and repeat the same phrase, creating a minor filter-verb echo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean with varied rhythm and high information density. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges "emergence" motif. Figurative language (time as tides, pools as universes, cicadas as transition) is coherent and purposeful. Minor scaffold: "warmly observant" appears twice in identical phrasing; the phrase "ancient and patient" recurs; and the final paragraph's "The tides would continue... The pools would fill..." feels slightly mechanical in its thematic summary. No loops obscure causality, and propulsion remains steady.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of tidal-pool chronicler + estranged daughter reconciliation + cicada-as-emergence is specific and non-generic. The tangential approach to Elena's question (answering via cicada lore and time-texture rather than direct explanation) offers a fresh inflection. Risk-taking in the slow, reflective pacing under situational pressure is purposeful. Deduction: the grotto-under-stars + jade-artifact + parent-child-reconciliation combination, while executed well, follows familiar literary templates (liminal space, symbolic object, confessional conversation). Transformation is present but incremental rather than startling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira as tidal-pool chronicler shapes her perceptual filter (noticing anemones, interpreting time as rhythms) and drives her confession beat: "I was in a grotto like this one when he passed" and "I had confused studying transitions with living through them." The occupation enables the tangential answer via cicada lore. Setup (first paragraph), development (confession), and payoff (final paragraph's "chronicler eventually discovers") are present. The choice to confess and offer the cicada alters tactics (from silence to engagement). Minor gap: the chronicler role could constrain a choice more directly; here it primarily informs voice and thematic lens.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Jade cicada appears in three beats: Mira withdraws it, explains its cicada symbolism, places it between them; Elena touches it; Elena lifts it toward starlight in the final image. Setup (early withdrawal), development (placed as offering), payoff (Elena's acceptance reweights it as shared symbol). The object's meaning evolves from meeting-gift to confession prop to bridge. Causal pressure: the cicada enables Mira's tangential explanation and Elena's tactile engagement. Minor gap: the cicada does not constrain a decision with visible cost; it facilitates rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Transition periods shape stakes (Mira's life work, the pause between question and answer, cicadas emerging, mother-daughter "slow work of emergence") and tactics (the tangential approach itself mirrors transitional thinking). Setup (opening tidal-pool context), development (cicada transition lore, Mira's confession of failing to live through transitions), payoff (final image of "emergence" beginning). The concept is not merely thematic echo; it alters Mira's explanatory method and Elena's path from anger to openness. The pause as transition unit drives the entire scene's pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" appears twice as a descriptor ("warmly observant of her own memory," "warmly observant of this fragile new beginning") but functions primarily as narrative tone rather than a trait that constrains action. Setup (first use anchors her stance), payoff (second use colors the ending). The attribute does not enable or prevent a choice with visible cost; it labels rather than dramatizes. It could be removed without altering Mira's confession or Elena's response.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Foresee" appears once: "I could foresee—not predict, but sense—that something was ending." Setup is late (mid-story), and the action is retrospective summary rather than on-page dramatization. It explains Mira's absence (she sensed transition, traveled to grotto) but does not drive a present turn. The confession turn traces more to Mira's recognition of failure than to her foresight ability. The element is swappable; "intuited" or "felt" would work equally well. No middle development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tangential approach is signaled ("she approached it tangentially, the way light bends through water") and dramatized: Mira answers Elena's direct question via cicada lore and time-texture rather than chronology. Setup (the pause, then cicada withdrawal), development (explanation through metaphor), payoff (Elena accepts the oblique answer and offers to learn Mira's way of seeing). The method shapes tactics (Mira's entire explanatory strategy) and enables reconciliation. The mechanics matter: the indirection softens Elena's resistance. Causal pressure is high; removal would collapse the confession's success.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Ancient grotto under stars is established early (ceiling open to stars, mineral deposits, tidal pools dotting the floor) and present at closure ("beneath stars that had witnessed the birth of oceans"). Setup, development (spatial choreography: pool near Elena's foot, cicada on stone between them), and payoff (starlight charges the final image when Elena lifts the cicada). The setting provides atmosphere and thematic resonance (liminal space for transition conversation). Minor gap: the grotto does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it frames rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the pause in a difficult conversation" is the structural spine: "that pause—that impossible suspension of time between one moment and the next" anchors the entire scene. Setup (Elena's question hangs in the air), development (Mira's answer unfolds within the pause, time "stops entirely in moments like this one"), payoff ("the pause finally breaking like a wave"). The pause tightens decisions: Mira must answer, and her method of filling the pause (cicada story) drives the reconciliation. The time constraint is felt and shapes tactics. Indispensable to the design.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to discover the texture of time" is told ("I have spent my life trying to discover how time actually works... the texture of it") and frames her life's work. Setup (chronicler identity), development (confession: "I had confused studying transitions with living through them"), payoff (realization that "the most important transitions happen within ourselves"). The desire creates friction (study versus living) that drives the confession. Minor gap: the motivation is more thematic backdrop than on-page conflicted choice; Mira reflects on it rather than struggling against it in the present beat.</comment>
