<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist exists as a pure philosophical vessel without embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority remains abstract ("she understood now that unraveling was not destruction but translation") without concrete sensory grounding or competing impulses. The "witness" role is told rather than dramatized through specific dilemmas that force trade-offs. No visible cost accompanies her transformation; she simply becomes "the resolution" through assertion rather than earned causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early enough. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the blank-dictionary image and the protagonist's new stance, but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page—no prior option is visibly foreclosed, no tactical price paid. The spiral-arbitration concept functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a constraint that narrows choices. One meaningful deepening occurs (scrolls "softening" into transparent truth), meeting the minimum for this length, but the Cost proof test fails: no single sentence makes the price undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The temple library is vividly rendered with "shelves curving inward and upward simultaneously" and amber light, creating strong atmospheric specificity. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the protagonist's movement deeper into the stacks. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it serves as backdrop for philosophical revelation rather than a force that shapes decision-making. The dictionary as micro-setting object charges the final image (blank pages), narrowly satisfying the 9+ gate, but the broader setting remains ornamental to conflict.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The scrolls "softening" provides one textural deepening consistent with the Accumulative lens, but no tactical trade-off or foreclosed option accompanies it. Agency is passive observation rather than decision under pressure; the protagonist does not choose between competing goods or pay a visible price. The resolution occurs through her "becoming" rather than through a choice that narrows options. The band guardrail for 8.0+ (tightening that forecloses a live option) is not met.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of unity-within-illusion emerges organically from the library architecture and the protagonist's task. The seven-scrolls image (separation/sequence/ending revealed as one truth in masks) avoids overt moralizing and offers non-literal resonance. However, lines like "she understood now that the end was not termination" edge toward abstract philosophizing rather than concrete embodiment. The blank dictionary reprise charges the ending with purpose, and "synthesis" etymology work adds specificity. Minor thematic echo penalty applied for on-the-nose articulation ("unraveling that was also, always, a weaving together") in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited with consistent perceptual access. Diction carries a formal, elevated register throughout ("resounding hush," "wanderingly exact") that fits the mythic frame. However, the voice lacks character-specific texture; phrases like "journeying inward while walking out" and "spiral arbitration" feel imported rather than filtered through the witness's lived idiom. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she felt") appear frequently without voice motivation. Psychic distance remains uniform rather than modulating with pressure, flattening emotional intensity at key turns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwriting density penalty: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats (scrolls glowing, protagonist transforming) carries figurative language ("dissolution," "synthesis," "transparent," "resounding hush") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.5. Paraphrase loops present: "unraveling was not destruction but translation" / "unraveling that was also, always, a weaving together" restate the same thesis without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence: "She [verb]" stems repeat across multiple beats without rhythmic variation. Stock metaphor strings ("thread," "masks," "veil," "lens") cluster without fresh synthesis. Information density remains high in description but low in causal advancement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The frame—witness in a timeless library unraveling cosmic illusions—follows a recognizable mystical-revelation template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Derivative Premise Guardrail applied (−0.8): core structure echoes widely used "seeker in sacred space achieves unity insight" patterns. The "wanderingly exact" coinage and "universe's hiccup" phrasing offer local freshness, but the emotional arc (confusion → understanding → transcendence) remains generic. No bold structural risk; the piece plays safely within expected lyric-philosophical boundaries. The seven-scrolls device and blank-dictionary reprise show craft but not ingenuity that transforms premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Setup present (introduced paragraph one). Development weak: the witness observes and walks but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses options. Payoff present: she writes "the first word of what comes next," but this act is asserted rather than causally earned by prior choice. The role remains observational; agency is claimed ("her role as witness transforming into something more active") but not dramatized. Swappability moderate: another seeker archetype could fulfill the same function. Late first-third arrival plus ornamental middle use cap at ~4.6; summary-only transformation and lack of causal pressure lower further.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup strong (introduced paragraph one, "final artifact of a language"). Development: dictionary falls open twice to specific words ("reconcile, remember, release" and "synthesis"), guiding her task across two distinct beats. Payoff strong: blank pages in final paragraph reweight its meaning from repository to vessel for new creation. Specificity moderate: the "softcover" and "cracked spine" details are concrete but don't constrain choices differently than any book would. Causal pressure weak: it opens to words but does not narrow options or impose cost. Three-gate presence and charged reprise support mid-band; lack of cost connection and moderate swappability prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setup present (paragraph four: "spiral arbitration, where every contradiction wound toward center"). Development weak: mentioned as the library's "form of justice" but does not constrain the protagonist's choices or alter her tactics on the page. Payoff weak: invoked in final paragraphs ("spiral wound tighter") but functions as metaphorical backdrop rather than active mechanic. The concept is described and echoed thematically but never operationalized—no contradictions are dramatized winding toward resolution with cost. Swappable with "cosmic reconciliation" or similar abstraction. Functional mention without causal work places it in low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Setup present (paragraph six: "her path wanderingly exact"). Development minimal: the attribute is claimed to describe her instinctive movement but does not demonstrably enable or constrain a choice. No visible trade-off shows the cost of this approach versus a direct path. Payoff: echoed in final paragraphs ("wanderingly exact paths converged") as thematic closure but without dramatized mechanics. Label-only trait that exists in narration without altering tactics or options on the page. Late element (appears past 40% mark in functional use) and swappability cap at 4.6; lack of causal pressure prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setup present (paragraph three: "she had come to unravel cosmic illusions"). Development: the scrolls "softening" (paragraph nine) dramatizes partial unification. Payoff present: "she still held the dictionary, but its pages were blank" and she begins writing signal completion of unification. The action shapes two beats and returns at closure. However, causal pressure is weak—unification happens to her rather than through her choices, and no visible cost accompanies it. Swappability moderate: "reconcile" or "integrate" could replace with minor edits. Three-gate presence supports mid-band; lack of protagonist-driven cost and moderate irreplaceability prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setup delayed (paragraph six, ~40% mark: "journeying inward while walking out"). Development: described as the "method" and "secret the ancients had encoded" but mechanics remain abstract—no on-page demonstration of how inward movement produces outward progress or constrains choice. Payoff present: invoked at transformation moment ("journeying inward while walking out, finally emerging somewhere that was everywhere"). The paradox is named repeatedly but never operationalized with visible cost or tactical consequence. Late arrival and label-only use apply caps; thematic presence at closure lifts slightly but ornamental integration dominates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup strong (paragraphs two and four: architecture detailed, "shelves curving inward and upward simultaneously," manuscripts in amber light). Development: the circular reading chamber with seven scrolls provides the site for the key beat (paragraph eight onward). Payoff strong: "The library released her, or she released the library" charges the final image. The setting is specific and irreplaceable (spiral architecture, timeless preservation), and the scrolls' physical presence enables the unraveling action. However, the environment does not constrain tactics—she moves freely without cost or obstacle. Presence across all three gates and specificity support solid mid-band; lack of choice-constraining pressure prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setup present (paragraph two: "across a universe's hiccup, that infinitesimal moment when reality blinked"). Development weak: timeframe is described atmospherically ("time pooled like water") but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. No live clock or countdown alters the protagonist's tactics. Payoff weak: invoked thematically ("pulling history and future into the eternal moment of the hiccup") but remains conceptual. The timelessness removes rather than creates pressure. Functional presence without causal work; swappable with "eternal moment" or "liminal pause." Setup plus ornamental middle and thematic payoff place in low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Setup strong (paragraph three: "she had come to unravel cosmic illusions"). Development: desire guides her movement into the library and her reading aloud (paragraph nine). Payoff present: achieving the unraveling is signaled in blank pages and her smile. The motivation is stated and directs action across multiple beats. However, it is never dramatized as conflicted—no competing want or fear creates friction, no visible cost (relationship, safety, prior belief) must be traded. Told-only desire without embodied struggle or tactical sacrifice. Three-gate presence supports mid-band; lack of friction and cost prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup present (title and opening: "bare feet pressing against stone," "softcover dictionary... soft as moth wings"). Development: tone maintained through "whispered in languages that predated sound," "resounding hush," quiet descriptions of scrolls and transformation. Payoff strong: "In the resounding hush that followed, she smiled" anchors the ending. The hushed, reverent register remains coherent across beats and modulates subtly with pressure (reading aloud breaks silence momentarily, then returns). Distinct perceptual filter (stillness, ancient quiet) charges the final image. Coherent modulation and closure linkage support mid-to-upper band; static mood through middle beats (no sharp tonal shift under pressure) prevents higher.</comment>
