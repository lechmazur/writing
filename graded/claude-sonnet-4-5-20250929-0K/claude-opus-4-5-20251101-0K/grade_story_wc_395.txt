<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Helena's motivation to understand deleted files drives her investigation cleanly, and her transition from passive cataloging to active risk-taking is earned. However, her interiority remains somewhat generic—"heart pounding against her ribs" and similar constructions lack character-particular texture. The final choice to run feels more plot-determined than emerging from contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. Marcus exists only as archival traces, which is appropriate to the premise but limits relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage: Helena notices patterns → investigates Marcus's account → finds shadow profiles → discovers the conspiracy → decides to act. The closure is a Charged Poise moment where she steps into the Nevada night with evidence, reweighting her role from keeper to exposer with the cost of her safety now legible. One issue: the warehouse revelation and "walked away" discovery arrive in summary rather than dramatized scene pressure, weakening the final turn's felt urgency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The missile silo setting is vivid and purposeful—failing drives playing forgotten songs create atmosphere and reinforce the deletion theme. The restricted vault and geolocation data constrain Helena's investigation and force tactical choices (lying to Security). The Artemis-7 patch functions as both motif and clue, charging the final image when Helena pockets it. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Helena's archival focus, though the Nevada night at the end could use one concrete anchor beyond "stars...like distant servers."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering what happened to Marcus and the missing persons—is signaled early and tightens as Helena moves from pattern recognition to active subterfuge to flight. The lie to Security is a meaningful escalation that narrows her options and raises personal cost. However, the warehouse discovery and "walked away" realization happen off-page in her analysis rather than through a confronted obstacle, reducing the visceral pressure at the peak moment. The decision to run feels inevitable but the immediate threat remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central question "where do deleted files go?" and expands to surveillance, erasure, and testimony without didacticism. The recurring motif of fragments persisting—"Nothing truly disappeared from Nexus. It just became harder to find"—gains weight through Helena's discoveries and the Artemis-7 connection. The final image of stars as "distant servers" and files that "waited...accumulated...testified" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution; Helena's understanding deepens but the conspiracy remains alive, lending appropriate complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Helena with controlled distance. Voice carries distinct texture in phrases like "brightly attentive to patterns" and "mechanical ghosts," though some constructions drift toward corporate register ("consolidated, studied") without clear character motivation. The narrative occasionally over-explains what has been shown: "She would find Marcus Chen, or she would find what remained of him" restates the obvious closure stakes. Psychic distance modulates appropriately between archival work and rising urgency, and no unmotivated head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm, and information density is high in the investigation sections. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "deleted files go" / "where deleted files never really went anywhere" and the extended explanation of shadow profiles and surveillance apparatus covers the same ground twice. Template cadence emerges in the final third with repeated "She found/She had/She would" stems across multiple paragraphs. The metaphor "stars...burning like distant servers" works, but "sensed absence that had defined her work here crystallized into certainty" adds abstraction where a concrete image would sharpen the moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes digital archaeology, surveillance conspiracy, and space-mission cover-up in a cohesive way, and the numbers-as-breadcrumbs conceit is well-integrated. The Artemis-7 patch as both memorial object and evidence is a fresh inflection. However, the broader frame—lone archivist discovers corporate conspiracy involving missing persons—follows familiar tech-thriller templates without sufficient transformation through lived archival detail or a non-obvious moral calculus. The connection between space exploration obsession and digital erasure feels thematically apt but remains somewhat abstract rather than grounded in surprising particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Helena's role as corporate memory keeper frames her access and motivation from the opening and drives every major beat: noticing patterns, accessing archives, lying to Security, copying data, fleeing. The job title appears in the first sentence and the final action (running with evidence) directly results from choices enabled by her keeper role. Her specific function—preserving versus discarding—shapes her "brightly attentive" stance and the thematic question about deletion. Removal would collapse the entire investigative logic and her means of discovery.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The Artemis-7 patch appears in Marcus's archived photo, is mentioned as a memorial to a crashed mission, returns when Helena finds it "pressed between archived server manuals like a bookmark," and she pockets it before fleeing. It connects Marcus's space-exploration obsession to the conspiracy backstory (the mission "hadn't crashed by accident"). However, the patch does not constrain an on-page choice or alter Helena's tactics; it functions primarily as clue and thematic echo. The "bookmark" detail is evocative but the patch remains more symbolic than causally active in shaping the closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The missing-persons cold case is the story's engine: Marcus Chen vanished eleven years ago, his case was closed, and Helena's discovery of his final message and the shadow profiles of thousands of other missing persons drives every escalation. The concept shapes stakes (what happened to Marcus?), tactics (searching archives, accessing restricted servers), and the final decision (finding him or his remains). The case's official closure versus Helena's reopening of it creates the central tension, and the revelation that missing persons were "collections" rather than coincidences provides the thematic and plot payoff. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive" appears twice as a descriptor of Helena's stance toward patterns but does not demonstrably constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait supports her character as someone who notices what others miss, but the investigation could proceed identically if described as "meticulous" or "obsessive." No moment shows her brightness creating a tradeoff—missing something else, misreading context, or paying a social price. The phrase functions as character flavor rather than a driver of choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Helena's lie to Security—"told Security she was running a routine integrity check, smiled brightly, kept her voice steady"—is the pivot that enables her access to the restricted vault where she finds the shadow profiles and copies evidence. This deception is the first active rule-breaking that escalates her from passive discovery to criminal risk, narrowing her options (no safe retreat once the data is copied) and directly enabling the conspiracy revelation. The action is brief but irreplaceable; without it, the vault remains closed and the story's climax cannot occur. The subsequent flight traces directly to this breach.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The recurring numbers 7-14 appear in the corrupted timestamp in the opening, surface "in engagement metrics, in server logs," are identified as Marcus's employee ID, and are found "embedded in code he'd written, in deleted messages...in the metadata of photographs." They blink "in the corner of her screen, almost like a warning. Or a blessing" near the end. The numbers guide Helena's investigation and serve as the breadcrumb trail linking disparate data points to Marcus. However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract—how exactly they recur "everywhere" and why they persist is told rather than shown through specific archive interaction. Functional across beats but the method itself could be more concretely dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The social network archive housed in a former missile silo provides both atmosphere and tactical constraint throughout. The "corridors alone most nights," failing drives playing audio fragments, and the sealed vault requiring Security clearance all shape Helena's investigation methods and physical movements. The restricted servers force the lie that escalates stakes, and the geolocation data pointing to "a warehouse fourteen miles from this very silo" directly enables the closure realization. The setting is not merely backdrop; it supplies resources (the preserved archive), obstacles (access restrictions), and spatial logic that the ending depends upon. Nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" appears in the story as both literal phenomenon (audio fragments playing from failing drives) and metaphorical frame ("Across the echo of forgotten songs, she hunted for meaning"). The phrase recurs at the closure: "The forgotten songs played on as she climbed the stairs." However, "timeframe" as a ticking clock or temporal pressure is absent—Helena works "most nights" and finds the message "at 3 AM on a Tuesday," but no deadline tightens decisions. The songs create atmosphere and thematic resonance (testimony of the erased) but do not function as a time constraint that alters tactics or raises urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Helena's motivation "to answer a question that haunted her: where do deleted files go?" is introduced early, drives her attention to persistent fragments, and is directly tested when she discovers files weren't deleted but hidden. The question moves from professional curiosity to personal mission when she realizes the human cost (missing persons as "collections"). Her final thought—"deleted files never really went anywhere. They waited. They accumulated. They testified"—reweights the initial question with stakes now understood. The motivation is dramatized through investigation choices and the lie to Security, though some interiority leans toward summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tone of "sensed absence" permeates the piece through imagery of deleted accounts, vanished people, failing drives, and the "digital fossil" of Marcus's profile. The phrase appears explicitly: "The sensed absence that had defined her work here crystallized into certainty." The atmosphere is consistently elegiac and paranoid, modulating from archival stillness to urgency as Helena moves toward flight. However, the tone occasionally competes with thriller mechanics (conspiracy discovery, data theft, running) without full integration—the ending's breathless escape doesn't quite resolve the haunted-archive mood established earlier. Coherent but not seamlessly modulated through all pressure beats.</comment>
