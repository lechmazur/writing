<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's roguish charm is asserted ("charming smile, the one that had talked him out of three expulsions") rather than shown constraining present choices under pressure. His scholar-rogue duality reads competent but safe; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. Sofia's shift from confusion to understanding feels too smooth—no visible cost or foreclosed path. The final choice to learn the alphabet carries promise but no on-page friction that would earn a higher band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph. Drive lens reads Situational: the Bureau's surveillance creates coherent pressure that forces Marcus and Sofia toward the encoded-garden stance. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the final image ("the seed, the scholar, and the slow patient work") crystallizes their defiant commitment with felt cost (patience, secrecy, long timeline). One meaningful tightening occurs when Sofia reaches for the seed. Minor cost-legibility issue: the conceptual price of discovery or failure remains abstract rather than viscerally on the page, capping the band shy of 8.5+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (sweating glass, clicking mandibles, atlas moth wings). Micro-setting test satisfied: the insects and Dr. Voss's collection charge the atmosphere and underscore the theme of life resisting control. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice or alter tactics—it functions as evocative backdrop rather than active pressure. The gourd seed and notebook are handled but not spatially challenged. Strong descriptive work kept from 8+ by lack of spatial friction on decision-making.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: reclaim free thought against the Bureau's surveillance. One meaningful tightening when Sofia agrees to learn the alphabet, narrowing their options to covert resistance. Agency is present but the on-page cost remains conceptual—"patience" and "slow work" are named, not felt as immediate forfeitures. The piece signals future escalation ("by spring," "by summer") but the present scene lacks a visible price or live tradeoff that would lift escalation into the 8+ band. Coincidence does not resolve; pressure coheres under the Situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of defiance against cognitive commodification emerges organically from the Bureau premise and the garden-code infrastructure. The final image offers a resonant answer—thoughts remain free when encoded in living systems the taxmen can't parse—without stating a moral. Subtext operates cleanly in the insect chorus and Dr. Voss's legacy. Minor slip: "stand guard over your own spark of defiance" edges toward prompt-echo phrasing in the late third, though it's dramatized by the seed exchange. The thematic question lands with complexity but not full non-literal depth, capping shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with Marcus as focalizer; no head-hopping. Voice carries distinct texture ("scholar's mind...rogue's heart," "converging chaos"). Dialogue pursues goals and Sofia's questions feel natural. Minor register drift: "lobotomize their own curiosity" and "cognitive revenue" read slightly elevated for the urgent present scene, though they fit Marcus's scholar idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply specific—Marcus notices in an educated register without unique bias. Clean execution kept from 8+ by modest voice distinction under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character or world. Paraphrase loop at "You're candidly cryptic" / "You told me...but not why...but smiled" restates without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the "By spring...By summer...By fall" triplet functions as intentional parallelism, so no penalty. Stock metaphor "morning glories opening" and "virus of hope" are functional but lack fresh specificity. Figurative density in the insect descriptions ("chorus of tiny conspirators," "moths stirred") works without muddle. Minor scaffold ("Everything was converging now") tells rather than shows convergence. Solid craft with modest line-level slips; no closure-beat artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The taxing-thoughts premise is a recognizable dystopian template; the garden-code twist offers a fresh tactical angle but not full transformation. The gourd rattle as punctuation and the insect-collection framing are specific and purposeful. Emotional truth in the defiance arc is present but familiar—resistance via analog systems against digital surveillance. The piece commits to its premise and follows implications cleanly. Risk-taking is moderate; no bold structural or perspectival gambles. Transformation test: swap "thoughts" for another commodity and the arc largely holds. Within-band freshness in detail (beetles, Dr. Voss) but core synthesis remains in the competent-familiar range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus's charming-rogue-scholar trait is asserted and frames his choice to recruit Sofia. He decides to share Dr. Voss's notebook and teach the code—two functional beats. The trait does not visibly constrain options or force a tradeoff on the page; his charm smooths rather than complicates. Present in setup and closure participation (teaching Sofia), but swappable with "resourceful activist" without structural loss. Mid-band for dual-beat involvement without causal pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The gourd rattle seed appears in three beats: Marcus holds it up, explains its role as punctuation in the code, and Sofia reaches for it at the end. Its specific properties (rare enough to stand out, common enough not to raise suspicion) matter to the covert-message system. The seed enables the final choice and charges the closure image. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; lacks irreplaceability (another plant could serve) and no visible cost tied uniquely to the seed itself, capping shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The Secret Language Club frames the premise and Dr. Voss's legacy. It shapes Marcus's tactic (recruit Sofia to expand the garden network) and the stakes (resurrect the old resistance). Present in setup (rumor mention) and development (notebook diagrams). The concept enables the closure choice (learning the alphabet). Does not constrain options with friction—no competing pressures or tradeoffs tied to the club's existence. Functional causal role across beats but lacks specificity that would make it irreplaceable; "underground code network" would work with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Candidly cryptic" is used once in Sofia's dialogue as a label. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action; Marcus's cryptic smile is described but does not alter tactics or create visible cost. The trait remains ornamental—a verbal tic rather than a force in the plot. Late first appearance (second paragraph, dialogue) and no developmental or closure participation. Functional mention only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Warp" appears once in Marcus's interior thought: "He needed to warp reality, to bend the Bureau's surveillance into a shape they wouldn't recognize." The action frames his intent but does not drive a major turn on the page; the actual moves are recruiting Sofia and teaching the code. "Warp" could be replaced with "subvert" or "disguise" without structural impact. Present thematically but not causally active in beats or closure. Mid-band for framing role without mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Joining community gardens to plant message patterns is signaled early (Sofia's two-year gardening work) and its mechanics are explained via the notebook diagrams. The method drives the recruitment beat (Marcus reveals Sofia has been building infrastructure) and shapes the closure choice (learning the plant alphabet). Present in setup, development, and closure. The method's specifics (aerial-view readability, plant types as letters) matter to the tactic. Strong causal pressure and beat involvement; lacks a visible on-page cost tied uniquely to this method (e.g., garden access risk not dramatized), capping shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The entomologist's greenhouse provides vivid sensory grounding and thematic resonance (insects as uncontrollable life). It houses Dr. Voss's collection and the seed, enabling the handoff scene. Present in setup and throughout; the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Marcus and Sofia could meet elsewhere without changing the plot. The greenhouse charges atmosphere and closure image but lacks mechanical pressure. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-6s; no causal friction keeps it from 7+.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after thoughts become taxable" establishes premise and urgency. Dr. Voss's death "three months now" anchors the present. The Bureau's surveillance tightens decisions (colleagues self-censor, Marcus seeks covert methods). Time shapes stakes but does not create a live clock that alters moves within the scene—no countdown or competing deadline on the page. Present in setup and thematic pressure; functional but not mechanically active in beats. Mid-band for premise-shaping without tactical tightening.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Stand guard over your own spark of defiance" is quoted from Dr. Voss's notebook and frames Marcus's motivation. The desire drives his recruitment of Sofia and teaching the code. Dramatized in the closure choice (Sofia reaching for the seed). Friction is modest—no competing wants or visible cost tied uniquely to this phrasing; the motivation could be rephrased as "resist thought-taxation" without structural loss. Present across beats and closure but lacks irreplaceability and on-page tradeoff, placing it in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Converging chaos" appears explicitly once ("converging chaos of wings and legs") and implicitly in the insect imagery and overlapping pressures (Bureau, resistance, Sofia's infrastructure). Tone modulates with the greenhouse's humid density and the final pivot to patient resolve. The tone charges the atmosphere and final image (life refusing control). Coherent through turns but not deeply active in shaping choices—decorative more than causal. Present in setup and closure; functional resonance without mechanical pressure keeps it mid-6s.</comment>
