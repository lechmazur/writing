<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's involuntary truthfulness generates embodied pressure in the toll-gate encounter, and her final choice to help the woman emerges from established values (preserving wonder, carrying her mother's legacy). Internal contradiction appears when she reveals the tower's secret despite twelve years of solitary guardianship, creating a credible cost. The woman's grief is embodied through trembling hands and silent weeping, though the daughter's backstory arrives via exposition rather than dramatized friction. Minor deduction for the matchbox riddle sequence, which tilts toward convenient wisdom delivery rather than earned discovery under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira returns to her post having shared the tower's secret, foreclosing solitary preservation but affirming communal wonder with visible cost—the matchbox now passes to the next traveler. The causal spine holds: blackout → frozen gate → woman arrives because power failed → Mira's involuntary truth forces revelation → residual charge saves bees → matchbox left behind reweights the opening riddle. Orientation anchors (Mira, tower, amber sky, blackout context) arrive within the first two paragraphs. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira's truth-telling compulsion intersects the woman's need, narrowing options and raising emotional cost. The piece infers as Causal with lyric texture; the lens holds through closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lightning tower's copper spires, frozen toll gate, and phosphorescent moss-lined memory chamber create a coherent micro-setting that constrains the resolution: only the tower's residual charge can save the bees. The "nectar dusk" / "amber sky" / "thick as honey" light registers as a purposeful atmospheric frame that charges the final star-emergence image. Spatial choreography (toll counter, copper door, descent into depths, ancient vents) tracks cleanly. The matchbox and lacquer box function as charged objects within the setting's logic. Minor gap: the city below and storm fields remain abstract backdrops without pressure on Mira's immediate choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to preserve the tower's secret or share it to save the bees—signals early and tightens when Mira's involuntary truth forces the choice. One clear pressure point: "You're lying about something" compels the woman to reveal her daughter's death, which then motivates Mira's decision to help. The bees' midnight deadline provides urgency, though the cost of Mira's revelation (ending twelve years of solitary guardianship, passing the matchbox forward) is more implied than viscerally tested. The woman's arrival "because the power failed" reads as coincidence that complicates rather than resolves, which fits the causal lens. Agency is present but the escalation remains modest: Mira's choice feels generous rather than agonizing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions and recurring images: wonder preserved in routine, memory as residual charge, inheritance passed through loss. The matchbox riddle ("What feeds the lightning but never burns? What keeps the dark but holds no urn?") reweights across the arc—memory as both tower function and emotional inheritance—without overt thesis. The bees' synchronized harmony at restoration and Mira's return to her ledger offer a resonant answer to the central question (how wonder survives loss and darkness) through image rather than statement. The final paragraph risks thematic echo ("preserving the wonder that lived in the space between storms") but stays within Mira's established lexicon and POV. Subtext operates in the woman's silent weeping and Mira's wordless companionship.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Mira's perceptual signature: the light "thick as honey," the "involuntarily truthful in moments that mattered most" self-awareness, the matchbox carried for twelve years. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the truth-telling beats. Dialogue carries goal pursuit and subtext ("You came specifically because the power failed" / "How did you know?"). Minor register drift: "electromagnetic pulse," "navigation protocols," "hive mind" read as exposition rather than Mira's or the woman's natural idiom under grief. The woman's "my daughter's project. Before she—" incompletion works; Mira's interior voice stays consistent. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure, though some late-paragraph phrasing ("ready to guide the next lost traveler through the dark") edges toward summarizing closure rather than letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final image recharges the star-emergence motif. Information density is high in the descent sequence (phosphorescent moss, old terminals, mechanical bees synchronizing). Paraphrase risk: "She preserved wonder in routine, finding meaning in each tally mark" and later "preserving the wonder that lived in the space between storms" loop conceptually. Template-stem cluster in paragraph three: "She had," "She could," "She had been," "She had carried"—four filter-verb frames in close succession flatten immediacy. Stock metaphor: "truth demanded release," "honesty spilling from her like water through broken glass." Minor syntactic monotony in the middle third with repeated "The woman [verb]" / "Mira [verb]" beats. Proofreading clean; no grammar breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of toll keeper + involuntary truth-teller + lightning tower as memory bank offers a non-obvious blend that feels earned rather than assembled. The matchbox riddle device and drone beehive add speculative texture without overwhelming the human stakes. The piece transforms familiar material (guardian at the threshold, grief over a lost child, passing on an inheritance) through specific detail: residual charge in memory banks, mechanical bees' distressed hum, phosphorescent moss. The core emotional arc—sharing a secret to honor communal wonder—reads as authentic rather than prompt-engineered. Risk distinction: the quiet, lyric closure and the involuntary-truth trait elevate without gimmickry. Deduction for the riddle-as-key device, which trends toward convenient puzzle-solving, and for the somewhat templated "lost daughter → sympathetic stranger" frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's candor (involuntary truthfulness) drives two key beats: identifying the woman's lie forces the daughter revelation, and revealing the tower's memory-bank secret enables the resolution. Early signal in paragraph two. Causal pressure high; closure linkage moderate (she returns to her post, but the ending pivots on the matchbox and bees more than her ongoing candor). Cost visible: twelve years of solitary guardianship ends when she shares the secret.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lacquer box appears in paragraph four, hums with distressed bees across three beats (arrival, counter placement, descent/connection), and its synchronized harmony at resolution charges the ending image. Setup, development (placed on counter, carried to depths), and payoff (bees spiral upward) all present. Causal role: without the box and its bees, no stakes exist. Specificity: "lacquer," "gold and crimson," "frantic light through seams." Cap at mid-7s because the box itself is largely a vessel; the bees inside drive the pressure, and the box could be swapped for another container with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Drone beehive failure frames the entire conflict: corrupted navigation protocols require recalibration via the tower's residual charge. Setup by paragraph five, shapes the woman's goal and Mira's decision, and payoff occurs when the bees synchronize and return. Causal necessity high; swappability low (the electromagnetic failure ties directly to the blackout and tower's unique function). Scores in mid-band because the concept is more backdrop stake than on-page constraint—the bees' mechanics are told rather than dramatized, and their "distressed buzzing resolved into harmony" is summary. Two solid beats (arrival problem statement, resolution via connection to terminals) but not three.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira's involuntary truthfulness constrains two on-page actions with visible cost: she cannot withhold her knowledge that the woman came because of the blackout, and she cannot suppress the insight "You're lying about something," which forces the grief revelation. Setup in paragraph two ("involuntarily truthful in moments that mattered most"), development (triggers the daughter disclosure), and payoff (enables the decision to help by making the woman's motive legible). The trait is character-specific and voice-consistent. Deduction: the trait could be replaced with keen perception or deliberate honesty with moderate rewrites; the "involuntary" aspect adds flavor but isn't load-bearing for the closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The reveal (Mira discloses the tower's memory banks and her mother's legacy) is the story's decisive turn: it transforms the woman's despair into hope and forecloses Mira's twelve-year solitary guardianship. Setup via the matchbox riddle, executed on-page in dialogue and action ("There's enough residual charge in the memory banks"), and payoff as the bees synchronize and the woman weeps. High causal necessity; swapping for another action (e.g., Mira offers a tool, shares a map) would require deep rewrite. Cost legible: Mira's secret becomes shared inheritance. Scores high-7s because the reveal itself is brief and the mechanics (connecting the box to terminals) are compressed into one sentence, limiting dramatic friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The matchbox containing the cryptic riddle appears in paragraph eight, is opened and read mid-story, answered on the page ("The answer is memory"), and left behind at closure to "guide the next lost traveler." Setup, development (read and answered), and payoff (passed forward) all present. The riddle itself—"What feeds the lightning but never burns?"—frames the tower's dual function (electrical + memorial). Deduction: the matchbox is more thematic vessel than tactical constraint; Mira could have revealed the memory banks without the riddle prop, and the riddle's solution is told rather than discovered through action. Lyric reprise (opening gift → closing gift) adds resonance but does not overcome the ornamental framing. Mid-band for clear three-gate presence but limited causal grip.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lightning collection tower is load-bearing: its copper door, memory-bank chamber, and residual charge are the sole solution to the bees' failure. Setup in opening line, developed through Mira's explanation of the tower's dual function (collects lightning, stores echoes), and payoff when the bees synchronize in the depths. High irreplaceability: no other setting could deliver this exact resolution without rewriting the core concept. The tower's "phosphorescent moss," "ancient vents," and "old terminals" add textural specificity. Spatial choreography (toll gate, counter, descent, chamber) tracks cleanly. Scores high because the tower shapes tactics (descent required), enables the resolution (residual charge), and charges the final image (bees spiral upward through vents, Mira returns to her post as stars emerge).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The blackout as timeframe creates the story's premise: the frozen toll gate, the woman's arrival ("You came specifically because the power failed"), and the bees' corrupted navigation all stem from the electromagnetic pulse. Setup in opening paragraph, referenced across beats, and implicit at closure (power remains out; Mira marks the passage in her ledger). The bees' midnight deadline adds urgency. Deduction: the blackout is more static backdrop than live clock; no on-page countdown or escalating time pressure shapes Mira's or the woman's tactics. The "after" framing is past-tense situational rather than a ticking constraint. Mid-6s for strong causal setup and consistent presence but limited tactical grip in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—"to preserve wonder in routine"—is stated in paragraph two, dramatized in her choice to stay at the post despite automation failure and to help the woman despite no toll owed, and affirmed at closure when she returns to her ledger "preserving the wonder that lived in the space between storms." Causal role: the desire to preserve wonder drives her revelation of the tower's secret. Friction: sharing the secret forecloses solitary preservation, forcing a trade-off. Deduction: the motivation is more thematic throughline than agonized internal conflict; Mira's choice feels generous rather than torn. The phrase "preserve wonder" recurs slightly mechanically. Solid mid-6s for clear setup, consistent presence, and direct link to the peak choice, but lacks embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Nectar dusk" as tone anchors the opening ("amber sky," "light turned thick as honey"), modulates through the descent (phosphorescent moss, ancient vents filtering dusk), and charges the final image ("nectar dusk," "first stars emerged"). The warm, suspended-between-states quality remains coherent across turns without flattening into static mood. Tone supports the theme (wonder in liminal moments) and integrates with setting (tower silhouette, golden/crimson lacquer box). High specificity: "nectar" is unusual and voice-consistent. Deduction: the phrase "nectar dusk" is reiterated almost identically at open and close, which risks ornamental bookending rather than reweighting. Scores mid-7s for strong coherence, purposeful modulation, and closure linkage, with minor dock for decorative symmetry.</comment>
