<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marguerite's motivations are clear and her arc from unknowing archivist to covenant-renewer is legible. However, the pivotal choice—offering the locket—lacks internal resistance or cost; she moves from discovery to acceptance with euphoric ease rather than contradictory impulses. The Keeper functions as exposition delivery rather than a pressure source, and the grandmother backstory anchors motivation but does not create on-page friction. Embodied emotion appears in "tears on her cheeks, but they came with laughter" yet the moment feels performed rather than wrestled-with.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: discovery of letters → recognition of pattern → covenant renewal. Orientation anchors late (jetty/harbor/twilight established, but "Archive of Minor Histories" and temporal frame emerge across multiple paragraphs). The closure—Marguerite renewing the covenant and returning to write—constitutes Earned Stasis with Charged Poise, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; no visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing occurs. The Keeper's arrival and locket exchange proceed without complication, and the final image ("began to write the covenant anew") restates intent rather than dramatizing a reweighted choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The blooming jetty supplies a charged opening image and returns at closure, and the roses ("bloomed three weeks early") anchor the timeframe of covenant regeneration. Walnut ink, archive, and maritime museum provide occupational texture. Spatial choreography is clean during the jetty scene, though the archive interior remains generic. The setting participates in closure—Marguerite's return to her desk—but the final beat could occur in any workspace without structural loss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renew the covenant to preserve small histories) is signaled by midpoint and deepens through the letter discovery. However, escalation is informational rather than pressure-driven: Marguerite learns the covenant exists, the Keeper appears on schedule, and she accepts without resistance. No live option is foreclosed; the choice to give the locket and continue archiving flows inevitably from setup. The grandmother's prior failure introduces conceptual cost but does not narrow Marguerite's present tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (small moments carry civilization's weight) emerges organically from Marguerite's forty-year practice and is embodied in grocery lists, children's drawings, and faded letters. The covenant structure gives thematic scaffolding without overt moralizing. "Through proximate causes, the great wheel turns" recurs but remains abstract; the piece resists stating a tidy moral, yet the final image—writing the covenant with walnut ink—borders on symbolic closure that names rather than enacts. The locket and roses offer genuine particulars that anchor the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Marguerite's perception. Voice carries a slightly elevated, archival register ("steep the harbor," "stained glass") that fits the archivist frame. The Keeper's dialogue ("Through proximate causes, hope persists") reads as thesis-speak rather than emergent character voice. Psychic distance tightens during the locket moment but remains explanatory ("she had been doing sacred work without knowing it") rather than compressing under pressure. No head-hopping; filter verbs are voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished with purposeful imagery ("mist given form," "pages turning in wind") and varied syntax. However, multiple lines loop thematically without advancing pressure: "weight of small moments" appears three times, "gently thorough" twice, "through proximate causes" three times. The phrase "Add this to your archive" followed by "The woman who believed in small things" recycles the theme stated earlier. Template cadence appears in the Keeper exchange ("You found the records" / "I found everything"). Opening and closing lines frame well, but mid-passage explanation ("All those years cataloguing...she had been doing sacred work") flattens momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The archivist-as-covenant-keeper frame offers a fresh synthesis of preservation work and fantasy metaphysics. However, the core structure—hidden letters reveal a secret pact requiring ritual renewal—is a widely used template, and the piece does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or lived friction. The Keeper's scheduled appearance and Marguerite's immediate acceptance avoid risk; no competing loyalty or doubt complicates the choice. Walnut ink and "gently thorough" supply specific texture, but the emotional arc remains tidy and the resolution affirms rather than challenges.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marguerite's decision to offer the locket and commit to renewal drives the final turn. She is present throughout, but her agency is reactive (responding to discovery) rather than wrestling with conflicting options. Two beats: recognizing her life's work, offering the locket.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The locket appears in the opening line, anchors Marguerite's connection to her grandmother across three beats (opening, exchange with Keeper, absorption into covenant), and its transfer constitutes the story's physical pivot. The photograph's faded state and Marguerite's memory of whose face it holds charge the object with personal cost. However, the locket could be replaced with another heirloom without altering story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The covenant shapes the entire narrative: the letters reveal its terms, the roses signal its regeneration, and the final scene enacts its renewal. Marguerite's forty-year practice gains retroactive meaning as preparation. The concept is inseparable from stakes, structure, and closure. Cost is conceptual (she becomes the bridge) rather than viscerally felt, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Gently thorough" is established early as both professional reputation and thematic touchstone, and it recurs in Marguerite's closing vow. The attribute explains her suitability but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible friction; it is a credential rather than a source of dramatic cost. The trait could be replaced with "meticulous" or "devoted" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Steep" appears once in the opening line as a metaphor for twilight's saturation and does not recur or drive action. The verb choice is poetic but ornamental; the story's turns trace to discovering letters and meeting the Keeper, not to any steeping process. If swapped for "bathed" or "drenched," no beat changes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Through proximate causes" is spoken twice by the Keeper, framed as the covenant's operating principle, and echoed in the closing line. The method—small acts create cascading effects—explains how one archivist inspires a child who becomes the next link. The phrase is thematic scaffold rather than a tactical constraint, but it articulates the story's causal logic and charges the final image of writing "one small truth at a time."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight anchors the opening, supplies the roses as a regeneration signal, and hosts the Keeper's emergence. The setting's timing (twilight, early bloom) is causally tied to the covenant's renewal. The jetty returns implicitly in the final dawn paragraph, bracketing the action. However, the jetty itself does not constrain Marguerite's choice; the encounter could occur in the archive or museum with adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"When context changes" is the timeframe given by fishermen to explain early blooms and appears to govern the Keeper's emergence. The phrase is abstract and does not impose a ticking clock or narrow Marguerite's window. The story moves from twilight through night to dawn, marking passage, but elapsed time does not pressure tactics. The timeframe is thematic (a generational turning point) rather than urgency-driven.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marguerite's forty-year practice embodies the motivation to preserve small moments, and the story's discovery arc reweights that labor as sacred. Her tears and laughter ("haunted euphoria") dramatize the realization. The motivation drives the locket offering and the covenant renewal. Friction is minimal—she accepts rather than wrestles—but the desire is concretely rooted in on-page action (cataloguing, studying the photograph) and shapes the closure choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Haunted euphoria" is named once and fits the moment Marguerite recognizes her life's hidden purpose. The tone of bittersweet validation threads through the Keeper encounter and closing vow. However, the story's register remains steady and elevated rather than modulating between haunted and euphoric poles. The phrase is more a label than a sustained texture; removing it would not collapse the emotional arc.</comment>
