<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is consistent and particular—silence as accumulation, "cupping water" that slips through—but her choices lack meaningful pressure or cost. The piece offers observation and philosophical stance rather than agency under conflict; she witnesses transformation but never confronts a contradiction that forces her to alter tactics or foreclose a path. The origami swan discovery and her return to the refuge are contemplative moves, not choices with visible tradeoffs. Backstory dominates without anchoring to present micro-decisions that change her options on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored early enough; no penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers image and reflection to deepen the thematic register of decay-as-renewal. However, no on-page closure unit lands with visible cost: the final paragraph restates the premise ("she witnessed," "she breathed back") without a decisive change, earned stasis that forecloses a path, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material. The piece offers mood and philosophy but no dramatic tightening or consequence that makes a before/after legible. Closure form is missing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The catacomb setting is richly specific—roots threading shelves, obsidian refuge by the underground river, moss-softened spines—and the environment subtly pressures Maren's witnessing practice. The origami swan and the refuge function as micro-setting that charges her method, and spatial choreography (burrowing deeper, sitting by the river) remains clear throughout. The final image of the catacombs breathing around her ties setting to theme. Strong work; gate for 9+ not met because the setting does not constrain a choice with visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—serving regenerative silence through witnessing—is signaled early but never tested by an on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. Maren's wandering, discovery of the refuge, and contemplation of eventual succession are serene observations without escalation or consequence. No decision or renunciation forecloses a path; no felt price alters tactics. The piece accumulates atmosphere but lacks the one meaningful pressure point required even at this length under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—decay and growth as one gesture, witnessing without judgment—emerges organically from imagery (books becoming soil, philosophers feeding mushrooms, the origami swan's folds) and avoids explicit moralizing. The ending offers a resonant image ("she breathed back") but does not reweigh prior material with a non-literal answer; it restates the thematic premise rather than repricing it. Strong thematic coherence and subtext in the swan as method, but the final paragraph drifts into summary assertion ("the world changed without knowing it was being remembered") instead of a charged particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren's metaphoric compression ("silt gathered," "scales," "geometric prayers") and selective attention to decay and transformation. Voice modulates purposefully—lyric density in reflective passages, concrete sensory anchors when describing the refuge. Brief elision of her past is functional; focalization remains controlled. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. Minor slip: "someone had constructed" shifts briefly to external certainty about the prior keeper's intent without dramatizing the inference, but the effect is negligible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, figurative language is coherent and vivid ("roots threaded through collapsed shelves," "the way light filtered through cracks"), and information density is high in descriptive passages. However, the piece loops conceptually: lines 3–5 in the opening and multiple mid-story paragraphs paraphrase the same thematic assertion (silence = accumulation, decay = growth) without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph ("She witnessed. She burrowed... She let reality slip...") with repetitive "She [verb]" stems across three sentences. Baseline −0.6 for paraphrase loop and template run; no artifact touches closure directly, so high-band entry remains possible but not achieved.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of archive-keeper, obsidian refuge, and origami-as-chronicle is specific and non-obvious, and the piece commits fully to its lyric, contemplative premise. However, the emotional arc and plot structure could transfer to any long-term guardian in a decaying archive with minimal edits; the transformation test reveals limited particularity in tactics or final stance. The premise risks the "silent witness across seasons" template common in literary fantasy; the story does not subvert or complicate it enough to escape mid-band. No bold structural risk elevates the work.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout and her role as keeper frames the narrative, but her choices are observational rather than decisive. She discovers the refuge, learns from the swan, and contemplates succession—setup and thematic development are clear—but no on-page action turns the plot or alters her tactics with visible cost. Missing closure participation as an active agent; the ending restates her stance without change. Functional presence, mid-development work, but replaceable in the closure unit.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The obsidian refuge appears in two distinct beats: discovery mid-story and return when Maren feels her grip loosening. It anchors her method and offers a spatial marker for continuity, satisfying setup and development gates. However, it does not appear in or shape the final image; closure participation is absent. The refuge is specific and purposeful but ultimately swappable with any meditative anchor. Two-gate presence caps eligibility; lyric resonance is present but insufficient to lift the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Regenerative silence is named in the first half and frames Maren's philosophy ("the quiet in which decay and growth wove themselves together"), satisfying setup. It informs her witnessing practice (development) and echoes in the final paragraph's breathing imagery, giving it three-gate presence. However, it remains thematic label rather than on-page constraint: no choice is narrowed or enabled by this concept with visible cost. The piece tells the concept rather than dramatizing its pressure, keeping the score in functional-but-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is stated early ("she held her duties loosely, the way one might cup water") and illustrated via her non-intervention stance and acceptance of transformation. Development is present but label-driven; no scene shows a moment where loose grip enables or costs her a specific tactic. The attribute colors her philosophy but does not constrain an on-page action with tradeoff. Closure participation is ornamental (final paragraph mentions slipping fingers) rather than causal. Functional presence, thematic integration, but no visible cost tied to the trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Burrow" appears in the setup ("Each morning... Maren would burrow deeper") and is repeated in the penultimate paragraph, giving it first-third and closure-adjacent presence. It drives her discovery of the refuge (middle beat involvement) and shapes her exploratory method throughout. However, the action is swappable with "wander," "explore," or "descend" without altering story logic; no unique property of burrowing constrains a choice or charges the ending. Two-gate presence with modest causal work; mid-band ceiling applies.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The origami swan is introduced at the refuge discovery (setup), Maren spends "what might have been years learning to read" its folds (development), and she returns to hold it when her grip loosens, with the final paragraphs referencing it as a future handoff and a reminder that "form was temporary" (closure participation). All three gates are met. The swan teaches method ("how to document without disturbing") and shapes her chronicling practice with modest causal pressure. However, its mechanics remain abstract—"each fold revealed a technique"—without on-page demonstration of a specific constraint or cost. Specificity is high (well-worn, cryptic folds), but beat involvement is summary-heavy. Eligible for mid-6s; causal pressure and closure linkage are present but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The catacomb setting is introduced immediately, appears in every beat (burrowing, discovery, refuge visits, final breathing image), and supplies the underground river, obsidian refuge, and decaying texts that anchor Maren's practice. The environment constrains her movement (collapsed shelves, roots cracking ceilings) and charges the closure image ("the catacombs breathed around her"). Strong setup, continuous development, and clear closure participation. Specificity is high (basalt, moss, filtered light), and the setting is irreplaceable: remove it and the story's logic collapses. Causal pressure is modest (environment informs but does not force a decision), keeping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Across the drift of untold seasons" and "seven seasons, or perhaps it was seventy" are named in the opening, and Maren's decision to stop counting seasons mid-story acknowledges the timeframe's thematic role. The vague, unmeasured passage of time fits the piece's philosophy but does not tighten a decision or alter tactics; no live clock pressures her choices. Setup and thematic development are present, but the element remains ornamental. Closure participation is absent; the ending references future seekers without temporal urgency. Functional label, replaceable with "years" or "ages" without impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation to witness without judgment is stated early ("she watched them transform," "witnessing, not protecting") and drives Maren's non-intervention throughout (development). It appears in the closure unit ("she witnessed... contributing nothing, disturbing nothing"). All three gates are met, and the desire is consistent. However, the motivation is never tested by friction or cost: no scene forces her to choose between witnessing and acting, or challenges her stance with consequence. The element is told and reiterated rather than dramatized under pressure. Setup and closure presence elevate the score, but lack of conflict caps it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tone of crumbling peace is established in the opening ("peace here was always crumbling") and sustained through imagery of collapse, transformation, and acceptance. It modulates subtly—serene in the refuge scenes, more textured during burrowing descriptions—and charges the final image ("gentle, inevitable dissolution"). Coherent across beats with purposeful cadence shifts. The tone is integral to the piece's atmosphere and thematic register, but it does not constrain a choice or drive a turn; it supports rather than shapes the narrative. Strong execution within its role; gate for higher bands not met because tone alone does not create closure pressure.</comment>
