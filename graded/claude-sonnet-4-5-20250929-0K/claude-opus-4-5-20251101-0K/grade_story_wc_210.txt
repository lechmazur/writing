<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and sustained—rejection of the Academy's reductionism drives her journey—but her internal process feels over-articulated and diagnostic ("murder of meaning," the fisherman's wish parsed into meta-commentary). The final choice to create crystallized-memory lanterns arrives smoothly, yet her renunciation of the Academy seventeen years prior lacks on-page friction or visible cost in the present window. Embodied emotion is thin; most interiority operates at the level of philosophical summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure unit—villagers returning, drawn by memory-lanterns—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes the shift from magic-dependence to self-recognition with felt cost (exile ending, the village reimagined). One tightening occurs when Mira accesses the bottle's memories and reframes the fisherman's wish, narrowing her task from restoration to transformation. Cost is conceptual and social (the community's old identity dissolved), legible in the image of people walking back "illuminated by the glow of their own preserved memories," though the price for Mira herself remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cove's bioluminescent algae, empty lanterns, and village square anchor space effectively. The amber bottle—warm, sealed, paradoxical—functions as micro-setting that constrains Mira's method (communion not entry) and charges the final image when its contents become lanterns. Sensory detail is selective (algae glow, swaying cords, warmth against skin) and filtered through Mira's alchemist priorities. The tea house and shrine appear as named waypoints without spatial consequence, but the square and hillside provide coherent choreography for the opening and closing beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reimagining the civilization—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening: Mira's realization that the fisherman's wish was about remembering resilience, not restoring magic, narrows her goal and shifts tactics from preservation to transformation. The accumulative design does not require explicit reversals, but agency is primarily perceptual (accessing memories, crafting lanterns) rather than a choice with visible tradeoff. The villagers' return provides external validation, yet no on-page friction tests Mira's commitment during the work itself—she succeeds without complication once the insight lands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—resilience versus dependence, transformation versus preservation—emerges organically from the bottle's use and the lanterns' shift in meaning. The final image (villagers "illuminated by the glow of their own preserved memories") reweights the premise without stating a moral. The fisherman's rephrased wish elegantly reframes the entire civilization's need. Minor slip: "the opposite of destruction wasn't preservation—it was transformation" and "comfortable position studying the acceptable mysteries" veer toward thesis statement in Mira's interiority, though both are anchored to her past choice and present work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; distance is controlled and fits Mira's reflective, philosophical cast. Perceptual signature is consistent (alchemist's lens on memory, meaning, integrity). Diction elevates appropriately for the fantasy-philosophical register ("communion," "murder of meaning," "crystallized intention"), though some phrases ("paradox of glass," "accumulated weight of ordinary moments") feel slightly over-polished for urgent interiority. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control is steady, though sentence openings recur (multiple "She [verb]" constructions in the middle third).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with strong information density in the memory-access sequence. Minor loop: "sealed bottle" / "amber bottle" / "bottle" recur without tonal shift across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence appears mid-story: "She saw... She felt... She witnessed..." stacks three consecutive stems in the memory flood. Figurative language is purposeful (lanterns as "hollow promises," light through paper) but "the accumulated weight of ordinary moments chosen and cherished" and "fragile bridge between perception and permanence" edge toward elevated abstraction that slightly dulls immediacy. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ghost-town-revival frame is familiar, but the specific synthesis—alchemist using sealed memory-vessel to craft lanterns that embody non-magical resilience—feels purposeful and non-obvious. The fisherman's reinterpreted wish provides a fresh inflection. Risk is moderate: the reflective, philosophical mode and lack of on-page friction during Mira's solution process play safely within genre expectations. Emotional truth (exile, the cost of principled refusal) is present but not deeply embodied. The transformation of "wishing magic" into "self-recognition" is thematically coherent yet arrives without dramatic complication, lowering ingenuity impact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's choices create the key turn (accessing memories, reframing the wish, crafting lanterns) and drive the closure. Present in all three gates (setup, middle realization, ending creation). Her exile and rejection of the Academy frame the stakes; her decision to work through communion rather than opening the bottle shapes the method. Cost is visible in her ongoing exile and the village's transformation. Causal pressure is strong; the story would collapse without her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The amber bottle appears in the opening paragraph, is handled and refused ("opening isn't the answer") in beat two, accessed via working memory in beat three, and remains sealed yet shared in the final image. Its paradox (no opening) directly enables the method and constrains Mira's approach. Charged reprise: "remained sealed in her hands, still containing everything, now shared with everyone." High irreplaceability; removing it breaks the story's logic and the closure's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the engine: the cove's desertion creates the problem, and the villagers' return completes the closure. Shapes stakes (reimagining the community) and tactics (Mira's memory-lanterns). Present in all three gates and integral to the ending image. The specific inflection—revival through self-recognition rather than magic restoration—differentiates it from generic revival plots. High causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Rejects false comfort" is established in the backstory (leaving the Academy) and motivates her seventeen-year exile, but the on-page cost is retrospective. The trait informs her choice to pursue communion over breaking the bottle, though that choice itself is frictionless. Functional across beats but not tested under present pressure; the refusal happened off-page years ago. Mid-development work without a peak-moment tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Conceive" is embedded in Mira's realization ("help these people conceive of themselves as something other than dependents") and operationalized when she crafts the lanterns. Shapes the middle turn and the solution but is interchangeable with similar cognitive verbs (reimagine, understand, reconceive). Present in setup (her life's work) and payoff (villagers reconceive home) but not distinctly constraining. Solid integration, moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through working memory" is named once ("that fragile bridge between perception and permanence") and enables Mira's access method ("pressed her consciousness against the amber surface, not seeking entry but communion"). Signals the how but does not shape multiple attempts or complicate her success. Functional in one beat; could be replaced with another alchemical technique without major restructuring. Present at the method-deployment moment but not stressed earlier or at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Paper-Lantern Cove is named, described (bioluminescent algae, swaying lanterns, village square), and provides the spatial anchor for all action. The setting's emptiness creates urgency; its history (first settlers, Wishing Stone) supplies the memory-substrate Mira uses. The cove's return to life forms the closure image. High necessity: the location's magic-dependence and subsequent desertion drive the entire plot and thematic question.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the last wish is granted" anchors the opening ("three days ago") and establishes the cove's crisis (magic gone, inhabitants fled). The timeframe provides urgency and frames Mira's arrival, but elapsed time during her work is unmarked. No ticking clock pressures her process; the villagers return "by dawn" without constraint. Functional setup and context but does not tighten decisions or tactics during the core action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To reimagine an entire civilization" is declared early, pursued through memory-access and lantern-crafting, and fulfilled in the ending when villagers return with new self-understanding. The motivation drives every beat and shapes the thematic resolution. Cost is visible in Mira's seventeen-year exile and her itinerant future ("seeking the next ghost town"). Desire is slightly over-articulated in interiority but consistently enacted on the page. High integration across all gates.</comment>
