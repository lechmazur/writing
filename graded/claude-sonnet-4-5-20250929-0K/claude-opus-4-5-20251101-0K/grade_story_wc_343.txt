<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity and observational nature are embodied through concrete actions—tracing patterns, cross-referencing charts, working through the night. Her interiority is specific ("constitutionally incapable of leaving mysteries alone") and drives choices under pressure. The talking-to-herself detail adds texture to isolation without therapy-speak. Minor weakness: the final grin beside the hopscotch board feels slightly performed rather than embodied, but the apprentice's transformation from survival to discovery is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (airship, three weeks alone, map apprentice). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery deepens from hopscotch → cipher → coordinates → luminance appearance, culminating in thirty pages of observations that reweight her abandonment into opportunity. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the captain finds her transformed, charts in hand) with conceptual cost legible (isolation became her advantage). One tightening: the luminance's appearance answers the coordinate puzzle. Causality is clean throughout; the because/therefore chain from curiosity → pattern-noting → discovery is motivated and complete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The antique airship is vividly rendered (brass hull, observation windows, creaking language) and constrains Elara's situation—stranded with no descent. The hopscotch board and phrasebook are tactile, recurring objects that gate her discovery. Starling murmurations create atmospheric pressure and mirror her interpretive work. Spatial choreography is clean across decks and the Tessellated Marshlands below. The luminance rising from mist charges the final movement. Minor gap: the playroom's prior use and the ship's explorer history receive summary rather than sensory grounding, but the micro-setting (board, lantern, charts) effectively narrows focus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand the ship's secrets, then chart the luminance) is signaled early and escalates through pattern-solving to live observation. The coordinate revelation narrows options: she must record now or lose the phenomenon. Agency is present in her choice to work through the night with instruments rather than passively wait for rescue. The luminance's appearance is coincidental timing but complicates rather than solves—she still needs rescue, but now possesses transformative data. One meaningful tightening: hopscotch → cipher → coordinates → luminance collapses her isolation into discovery with visible cost (exhaustion, thirty pages, solitary vigil). The final image reweights her abandonment into professional triumph.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (patience and curiosity transform abandonment into opportunity) emerges from concrete actions—the apprentice's methodical charting, cipher-breaking, and night-long observation—without statement. The hopscotch board and starlings recur with shifting meaning: childhood relic becomes explorer's map, birds shift from decoration to pilgrims. "Stranded" reprices from trapped to settled/waiting, a quiet conceptual move. The ending offers resonant answer: her lantern answering the luminance below, solitude becoming discovery rather than mere survival. No thematic echo or moralizing in the final beat. Subtext operates through the ship's "language," the birds' formations, and Elara's narration to absent listeners.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays clean; Elara's perceptual signature (map-reader noting coastlines and details, narrating to absent crew) is consistent and voice-specific. Diction matches her apprentice role: technical terms (coordinates, latitude, cipher) integrate naturally. The talking-to-herself device ("She talked to herself constantly now") anchors her isolation without filter-verb stacks. Distance modulates appropriately—closer during discovery beats, pulling back for the captain's return. Minor slip: "stranded as in beached, settled, waiting to be found" reads slightly over-articulate for real-time realization under excitement, nudging toward helpful narrator, but recovers quickly into action. Psychic distance and narrative stance remain stable throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic variation. Information density is high—most lines advance discovery, setting, or character. Figurative language (starlings "like ink dissolving in water," luminance "like breath from cold lips") is purposeful and spaced. Two minor issues: "The ship creaked and whispered, a constant companion" leans slightly generic; "charts that would change everything explorers thought they knew" tells future impact rather than showing present charge. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Clarity and propulsion remain strong through the accumulative build. Grammar and punctuation are clean; no pronoun drift or tense inconsistency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The combination—map apprentice alone on airship decoding hopscotch clues to chart atmospheric phenomenon—feels specific and non-derivative. The "stranded" repricing (trapped → settled/waiting) offers a fresh etymological angle. Starling murmurations as witness/guide and the polyglot phrasebook cipher are particular details that avoid stock mystery-solving. Emotional specificity in Elara's narration to absent crew and her grin at coincidence personalizes the frame. Minor limitation: the Stranded Luminance as legendary phenomenon and the explorer-ship backstory draw from familiar "lost knowledge" templates; transformation comes through the apprentice's methodical process rather than a bold structural or thematic risk. Still, the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity drives every key turn: discovering the board, tracing patterns against charts, cross-referencing the phrasebook cipher, recognizing coordinates, scrambling for instruments when the luminance appears, working through the night to document it. Her choices (methodical investigation rather than passive waiting) alter tactics and outcome—she transforms abandonment into discovery. Present in setup, development, and closure. The apprentice role is irreplaceable; her map-training enables the coordinate recognition that unlocks the mystery. Cost is visible: exhaustion, solitary vigil, thirty pages of work. Strong integration across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears twice: borrowed weeks ago (setup), then the dog-eared page forty-seven bookmark leads to the cipher key in the margins (development). This use enables the coordinate decode, a key turn. It does not reappear in the closure beat—Elara uses instruments and charts, not the phrasebook, during the luminance observation. Two-beat involvement with causal pressure (unlocks cipher) but missing payoff in the final image. Specific enough (dog-eared corner, margin scrawl, polyglot's book) to avoid easy swap. Scores in mid-band: functional and necessary for the middle turn but not charged at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Stranded Luminance shapes stakes throughout: it is the target of the hopscotch coordinates, the phenomenon Elara seeks to understand, and the entity that appears below the ship, compelling her night-long observation and thirty pages of documentation. Setup (mentioned in legends, then resolved as coordinate target), development (realization that prior explorers charted it, current position matches final coordinate), and payoff (blooms from mist, she records it, transforming her isolation into discovery). The concept's appearance alters options—she now possesses data that "would change everything." Irreplaceable; the entire narrative arc hinges on this exact phenomenon. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Diligently curious" is dramatized on the page: Elara's months cataloging charts, training to note details, three-day investigation of the hopscotch board, cross-referencing notes with phrasebook and charts, and methodical all-night observation. The trait constrains her—she "was constitutionally incapable of leaving mysteries alone"—and enables the discovery. Cost: solitary exhaustion, risk of appearing foolish if wrong. Setup (months of map training), development (tracing patterns, solving cipher), payoff (recording the luminance). The attribute is irreplaceable; a less meticulous character would miss the pattern. Strong integration with visible tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Note/noting appears throughout and drives major turns: apprentice "trained herself to note every detail," "began to note the patterns in her leather journal," the numbers traced and noted against navigation charts, and the final "notes remained—proof" when rescue arrives. The action is the method of discovery and creates the story's stakes—her documentation will chart the next great discovery. Setup (habit established early), development (pattern-noting unlocks cipher and coordinates), payoff (thirty pages of notes are the tangible proof at closure). Irreplaceable; passive observation without recording would not yield the transformative outcome. The action shapes tactics and the final image (surrounded by charts, notes in hand).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The hopscotch board is discovered three days before the story opens, becomes the focus of Elara's investigation, and is present in the final image when the captain finds her "grinning beside a dusty hopscotch board." The method (noting secret patterns in the board) is signaled early, its mechanics matter (faded numbers correspond to coordinates), and it shapes multiple attempts: tracing lines, cross-referencing with charts and phrasebook, solving the cipher. Setup (discovered and described), development (pattern-solving across multiple beats), payoff (she sits beside it at closure, the board's mystery solved and validated by the luminance appearance). The dusty board's specific paint-faded grooves and non-sequential numbers are irreplaceable; a different artifact would require different mechanics. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The antique airship constrains all action: Elara is stranded above the marshlands with no way to descend, forcing her to investigate the ship itself. The vessel's decks, playroom, observation windows, and brass hull provide tactile resources (charts, phrasebook, hopscotch board) and frame her isolation. Setup (established immediately with vivid detail), development (the ship's explorer history and stored clues enable discovery), payoff (the captain returns to find her aboard with transformative charts). The airship is irreplaceable—grounded setting would eliminate the "stranded above" constraint and luminance-from-below geometry. The setting pressures choices (she cannot leave, must work with what's aboard) and charges the final image (alone on ship, lantern answering light below). Strong integration across all gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Starling murmurations frame the story: swirling past windows in the opening, forming spirals and pointing hands mid-story, descending toward the marsh as the luminance appears, then roosting on railings by dawn. The timeframe (amid murmurations) creates atmospheric rhythm and marks the passage from evening through night to dawn. Setup (amber evening sky, starlings present), development (formations guide Elara's attention and mirror her interpretive work), payoff (settled birds at dawn frame her completed observation). The murmurations do not tighten a decision clock but provide temporal and tonal coherence. Functional across beats but replaceable with another dusk-to-dawn marker without structural loss. Mid-band: shapes tone and marks time but does not pressure tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The desire "to chart the next great discovery" is dramatized through Elara's actions: months of apprentice training, methodical investigation of the ship's secrets, solving the cipher, and working through the night with instruments to document the luminance. Setup (apprentice role and detail-noting habit established), development (realization that the ship belonged to explorers seeking the luminance), payoff (thirty pages of observations, "charts that would change everything," transformation from survival to discovery). Friction between survival needs and research ambition is present—she prioritizes documentation over rest. The motivation is irreplaceable; a character seeking only rescue would not pursue the patterns. Cost is visible: exhaustion, solitary vigil, risk of professional embarrassment. Strong integration with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Sociable isolation" is embodied throughout: Elara talks to herself constantly, narrates discoveries to absent crew and starlings, describes the ship as a companion with its own language, and works alone yet "not lonely." The tone is coherent—warm, curious, engaged despite solitude—and modulates appropriately: playful when starlings form a pointing hand, urgent when the luminance appears, triumphant at closure. Setup (three weeks alone, talks to herself, ship as companion), development (narrating to absent listeners, "alone but not lonely"), payoff (grinning at closure, transformation of isolation into opportunity). The tone charges the final image: her lantern answering the vast luminance, solitary but purposeful. Strong tonal control and thematic integration; the oxymoron is lived rather than merely labeled.</comment>
