<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's copper-veined trait and her role as final language-bearer create clear motivation, and the choice to use the diamond is purposeful. However, the decision feels more inevitable than internally conflicted—no competing impulse complicates her resolve. Interiority leans abstract ("texture of grief feels like sand caught in honey") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The ending renunciation (shattered diamond, task ahead) carries conceptual weight but minimal visible cost that alters her immediate stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a final Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands on-page: the language is resurrected, the diamond shatters, and she walks deeper with recovered knowledge—a decisive shift from dying to reviving the tongue. Orientation anchors quickly (canyon, bone towers, her purpose). The accumulation—copper veins hum, birds form phonemes, echoes multiply—tightens toward the climactic speaking, and cost is legible (diamond destroyed, "true work lay ahead"). One structural seam: the birds' algorithmic nature and the copper-channeling mechanism arrive late and feel under-earned, relying on sudden insight rather than prior setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bone towers, canyon of echoes, and copper veins are vivid and integral: the towers amplify her voice, the echoes preserve language, the veins channel the curse. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("frozen screams," "sand caught in honey"). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The white birds and their flight patterns function as micro-setting that constrains her method and charges the climax. Minor gap: the diamond's physical interaction (pressed against throat) could be more tactile to ground the metaphysical mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resurrect the dying language—is signaled early and sustained. The protagonist drives escalation: she chooses to use the cursed diamond, interprets the birds' patterns, and speaks the recovered words. The climax (language resurrection) is earned by her agency. Cost is present but soft: the diamond shatters (no ownership claim made), but we don't see her tactics or options materially narrow before the end—she succeeds on first attempt. One meaningful tightening occurs (diamond channels rather than silences), but the path from problem to solution compresses quickly without visible friction or failure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—preservation and translation across loss—emerges organically from image and action without thesis statements. The copper veins, flawed diamond, bird-phonemes, and bone towers cohere as a system of meaning. The final image ("following the echoes of her own voice") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: resurrection is iterative, not complete. The piece resists neat closure ("true work lay ahead") and allows ambiguity. Minor slip: "texture of grief feels like sand caught in honey" edges toward decorative profundity, and the ease of recovery (one afternoon vs. three centuries) could sharpen the thematic cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; psychic distance is controlled. The protagonist's perceptual signature (texture-to-sound translator) is distinct and consistent. Prose rhythm modulates with pressure, and diction is purposeful ("frozen screams," "tunnel of echoes"). Two slips: "quietly articulate voice" is told rather than shown through speech or cadence, and at peak intensity ("Through the patterns in the flock of birds in flight, the forgotten words began to return") the register smooths into summary rather than embodying her vocal struggle. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence variety is strong, and imagery is vivid ("frozen screams," "dark vein spreading like roots through crystal"). Information density is high in the setup and climax. Two issues: mild paraphrase loop in the middle (birds as algorithms is stated, then restated as "patterns…shapes of forgotten phonemes"); and a subtle template cadence in the resolution paragraph ("The death of the language had taken three centuries. Its resurrection had taken one afternoon. But the true work lay ahead")—three parallel declarations that flatten momentum. No major clarity breaks, but these accumulate to −0.6 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—copper veins as conduits, birds encoding phonemes, cursed diamond as translator—is specific and non-obvious. The "texture into sound" premise integrates well with the world's logic. The piece avoids stock language-death tropes by externalizing the archive into flight patterns. Risk: the lyric-explanatory mode could have deepened pressure with more friction, and the algorithmic-birds concept arrives late without prior grounding. Still, the combination feels unified and memorable, not checklist-driven.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller is present from the opening, her trait (veins) is active across beats (humming with recognition, intercepting the curse, channeling textures as sound), and her final choice (speaking the recovered language) drives the climax. She appears in the ending walking deeper into the canyon. The veins are indispensable to the mechanics and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The flawed diamond is introduced early (paragraph 3), handled physically (raised to study birds, pressed against throat), and its curse is transformed from silencer to translator—a purposeful reversal. It shatters at climax, marking the cost of resurrection. Two beats: interpretation through its facets, then the channeling act. It shapes the central turn and appears in the closure moment, though its final state (shattered, curse dispersed) could carry more visible consequence for her afterward.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tunnel of echoes is introduced early ("echoes never stopped here"), supplies the mechanism for language preservation (words "still traveled"), and the towers amplify her voice to join ancestral echoes. She follows echoes at the end. The concept constrains her method (must speak in this location) and charges the final image. Mid-high band: it's integral but functions more as backdrop than as a source of friction or complication that she must navigate around.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Quietly articulate" appears once as a label ("her voice articulate and precise") but is never dramatized through dialogue, cadence, or a choice where vocal precision enables or costs her something. It does not constrain action or alter tactics. The attribute is told, not shown, and removing it would not break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Harness" is the climactic action: she presses the diamond to her throat, channels textures as frequencies, and the birds respond by forming phonemes. This enables the language resurrection. The action is signaled (she "raised the diamond," understood she must "speak through them") and drives the major turn. Swapping "harness" for another verb would weaken specificity but the mechanics (channeling via copper and diamond) are what matter. Still, the action is indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The birds' flight patterns are introduced early (paragraph 5), reinterpreted as phoneme-shapes (paragraph 7), and then used as the transmission method in the climax. The method shapes her attempt: she thinks textures, copper sings them, birds respond. Two beats (observation, then use) and closure participation. The mechanics arrive somewhat late (algorithmic insight in paragraph 7) but once taught, they drive the resolution and cannot be removed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bone towers are present from paragraph 2, supply resonance that multiplies her voice, and house the birds whose flight she reads. The canyon geography constrains her location and amplifies the echoes. The setting is active across setup, middle (towers catch her sounds), and ending (she walks toward "the oldest towers"). Removing the towers would collapse the story's acoustic logic and symbolic closure. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe ("across the death of a language") is present thematically and in the final paragraph contrast ("three centuries" vs. "one afternoon"). It motivates urgency (she is the final speaker, language "withering") but does not impose a live clock that alters her tactics beat-by-beat. The timeframe is more retrospective framing than active pressure. Mid-band: it primes the stakes but doesn't tighten decisions on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation (translate texture into sound) is introduced early, demonstrated via copper veins that "sang these textures as sound," and drives the climax when she thinks textures and they become bird-frequencies. It is her unique skill and the solution's hinge. Present across setup (her life's work), middle (copper hums with recognition), and ending (the recovered language rests in her blood). The desire is dramatized through action, not merely declared. Integral.</comment>
