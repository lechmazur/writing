<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and her methodical search for recipients demonstrates consistent interiority. However, the daydream sequences substitute for earned internal contradiction—she receives visions rather than wrestling with doubt or cost in real time. The grandmother's language "moving through her fingertips" reads as convenient inheritance rather than a choice under pressure. The final emotional release ("began to cry") lands softly because no live renunciation or competing impulse was dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors WHO/WHERE/WHEN by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maya receives confirmation, cries, and commits to continuing her work with the brush. However, the cost is abstract—no live option is foreclosed, no tactic shifts, and the email arrival is coincidental timing rather than causal pressure. The waxing moon return and methodically hopeful echo charge the final image, but the reconfiguration reweights existing conviction rather than altering Maya's stance or options with felt sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is vividly rendered with condensation-streaked panes, tomato vines, ancient vents, and smog pressing against glass. The brush's glow and moonlight filtering through haze establish a coherent micro-setting. The greenhouse pressures no choice directly, but the moon's apex timing and the laptop tucked between seed trays provide spatial anchors that frame the email arrival. The setting charges the final image sufficiently to enter the 7-band but does not constrain a middle tactic or alter Maya's approach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: prove strangers remember kindness. The email from Budapest provides one meaningful deepening that reweights Maya's project with confirmation. However, escalation is largely internal and reflective; no live resistance or competing cost narrows her options on the page. The daydreams deliver information passively, and the coincidental email timing removes agency from the peak moment. Under the Accumulative lens one tightening suffices, but the lack of visible trade-off or foreclosed path holds this in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—kindness survives in actions, not words—emerges through the painted portraits, cooking recipes, and the moon-tipped brush inheritance without overt moralizing. The final image ("Some languages are never truly lost") answers the central question through concrete particulars: the brush, the portraits, the strangers' responses. However, "methodically hopeful" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic echo, and the waxing moon metaphor is signaled heavily rather than discovered. The resonance is solid but not fully implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV narration is stable with strong perceptual signature: "saffron quiet," "smog-choked city," moonlight "dripped through condensation-streaked panes." Diction remains controlled and lyric throughout. The phrase "rouse within her chest" is filter-heavy but voice-motivated. Minor register drift: "Conceptual repricing" and "consensus reality" do not appear, but "muscle memory that did not belong to her" edges toward passive inheritance rather than active discovery. No head-hopping; distance and tense are consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are distinct. Information density is high in the opening third. Two minor artifacts: "the way her grandmother had been, believing" is a filter stack, and "the familiar drift begin" + "daydreams came only under moonlight" paraphrase adjacent content. The closure paragraph ("Some languages are never truly lost") edges into theme summary but remains imagistic enough to avoid heavy penalty. No loops or scaffold elsewhere; figurative language is coherent and sparse in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The combination of insomnia, inherited calligrapher's brush, and lost language creates a specific synthesis. However, the daydream-as-information-delivery and the coincidental email resolution follow familiar patterns of magical-realist inheritance without transformation. The grandmother-volunteer backstory and the "proving kindness survives" arc read as thoughtful but not structurally surprising. Specificity in the greenhouse setting and the moon-tipped brush's visual texture provide freshness, but the emotional and causal arc could function with generic substitutions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout and makes the decision to paint and to continue her search. She tracks down strangers (off-page) and paints under moonlight (on-page), but the key turn—receiving the email—is not her choice. Setup early, development via painting, payoff at the ending when she picks up the brush again. Two beats (painting, final commitment) with causal involvement, but the email coincidence limits agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The moon-tipped brush is introduced early, appears in multiple beats (waiting beside her, moving through her fingertips, humming faintly, picked up again at the end), and its glow signals the daydream state. It constrains her work to moonlit hours and charges the final image. However, its mechanics are inherited magic rather than a tool Maya masters through cost or error. Three beats, early signal, closure linkage, but swappable for any enchanted heirloom with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Lost languages frame the grandmother's letters and the characters Maya paints. The concept shapes her motivation and the thematic question but does not alter tactics or narrow options on the page. Maya does not struggle to learn or recover the language; it flows automatically through "muscle memory that did not belong to her." Setup early, thematic payoff in the final line, but missing middle development where the concept constrains a choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" is named twice: once describing the grandmother's trait and once in Maya's self-recognition near the end. The trait motivates her two-year search (off-page) and her nightly painting, but no on-page moment shows a trade-off or cost where hope competes with doubt. Label-only use without dramatized friction; the email confirms rather than tests her optimism.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Rouse" appears once in the sentence "Maya felt something rouse within her chest" after reading the email. The action is internal and receptive rather than a turn she initiates. It does not redefine options or drive the closure choice; Maya was already committed before the email arrived. Late appearance, single mention, no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Daydreams sparked by moonlight are introduced early and recur: the drift begins when moonlight catches the brush, visions of Budapest and Beirut, and painting until the moon reaches apex. The mechanism shapes her work schedule and the portraits she creates. However, the daydreams are passive information delivery without cost or error. Two beats, early signal, payoff in the portraits, but the method is convenient rather than contested.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (condensation, vines, smog, vents) and frames the entire scene. The smog outside contrasts the luminous work inside, and the laptop tucked between seed trays supplies the email. The setting atmospherically charges the ending but does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics. Setup, atmospheric presence, closure participation via spatial frame, but no tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The waxing moon is mentioned in the opening, returns when moonlight catches the brush, and reappears in the final paragraphs with the promise "the waxing moon would return, growing fuller each night." Time structures Maya's work (moonlit hours, until the moon reached apex, dawn will end her work) but does not tighten a decision. The timeframe is cyclical rather than a live clock that narrows options. Setup, mid-scene presence, closure lyric reprise, but no urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Maya's motivation—to prove strangers remember kindness—is stated early, drives her two-year search, and is tested by the email from Budapest. The grandmother's death and unfinished conversations anchor the desire. However, the motivation is more quest than conflict; no competing want or fear creates friction. The email confirms rather than complicates. Setup, development via painting, payoff at closure, but minimal dramatized cost or internal resistance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Saffron quiet" appears once near the end and coheres with the lyric, contemplative tone throughout. The greenhouse's filtered moonlight, slow painting, and reflective interiority maintain a meditative register. The tone modulates slightly when Maya cries but does not shift under pressure. Coherent and consistent, charges the final image, but applied as a single late descriptor rather than woven through beats or tested by escalation.</comment>
