<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is concrete and consistent—her observation through physics and light feels character-specific. The decision to rebuild scattered pieces rather than fight demolition shows internal logic under pressure. Minor slip: the "conversation with the bay" and grandmother's superstition feel somewhat ornamental rather than driving contradiction. The final choice carries visible cost (abandoning the atrium, embracing impermanence) and is earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): Elena accepts the atrium's loss and commits to scattered works, reweighting permanence versus transience with visible cost. Orientation is clean by paragraph two. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—the stone-ripple beat, prism-light description, and noctilucent clouds build density toward the final notebook sketch that reweights her seventeen-year investment. One meaningful deepening (demolition forces stance crystallization) is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn is filtered through Elena's glazier priorities—light refraction, mist, glass surfaces. The prism atrium constrains her choice (it will be demolished) and charges the final image (she sketches new scattered installations). Micro-setting via the stone, water, and glass structures all serve the closure. Sensory hierarchy (light dominates, touch secondary) reflects her profession. Strong integration; reaching 8.5+ would require the environment to pressure a mid-scene tactical shift beyond the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: how to preserve her life's work and its purpose when demolition is imminent. The stone-throw beat deepens understanding (value in moments, not objects) and narrows options to distributed installations. The final choice—rebuilding scattered rather than monumental—carries visible cost (abandoning seventeen years' consolidation). Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening is present. Entering 8.8+ would require the tightening to foreclose a live tactical option on the page earlier in the sequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (transience, attention as value-creation) emerges organically from the ripple-observation, atrium-destruction, and final seed-scattering decision. The ending offers a resonant answer—"endings were simply patterns transforming"—without overt moralizing, though the phrase risks abstraction. Noctilucent clouds and stone rings function thematically but border on symbolic convenience. No late thesis statement; the notebook sketch reweights permanence through concrete action. Strong but not flawless.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with tight psychic distance; Elena's perceptual signature (light, pattern, physics metaphors) is consistent. Reflection dominates but anchors to present stimuli (stone throw, mist thinning, captain's reaction). No head-hopping. Minor diction elevations ("noctilucent reckonings," "theater of light") occasionally drift above a working glazier's likely interior lexicon under pressure, though they remain legible. No dialogue to evaluate. Rhythm modulates appropriately with emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with good information density. Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Minor scaffold: "she had learned long ago," "she understood something else entirely" are near-filter constructions but remain voice-motivated. One paraphrase loop: paragraphs 6–7 restate "value in attention/moments" without added pressure (−0.2). "Noctilucent reckonings" and "careful hand" metaphors border on elevated but do not obscure causality. No loops or artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The artist-facing-demolition premise is familiar, but Elena's physics-and-light lens and distributed-installation pivot offer specificity. The stone-ripple communion method is fresh. Risk-taking is moderate: the piece commits to its accumulative structure and quiet ending without hedging. "Ends as patterns transforming" risks abstraction; grounding in the notebook sketch and breakwater sites rescues it. Transformation test: swapping occupation and object would require substantial rewrite, indicating decent integration. Solid mid-range originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elena (reflective harbor glazier) is present throughout and makes the key closure decision—to rebuild scattered installations after accepting the atrium's loss. Setup early, middle observation (stone/ripples), payoff in final notebook sketch. Her reflective trait enables the ripple-reading beat and the pivot. Causal pressure is moderate; the decision feels somewhat inevitable rather than sharply constrained. Two gates clear, closure participation solid, but swappability (another artisan-observer) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prism atrium appears in paragraph one, is described in action (light through mist, captain's reaction), and is reweighted at closure (cannot be saved, will be replaced by scattered pieces). Three beats: opening description, dawn-light performance, final abandonment. It constrains the choice (demolition) and shapes the ending tactic. Strong integration. Reaching 8.5+ would require the atrium's specific optical properties to alter a mid-scene tactic, not just frame the problem and solution.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Noctilucent reckonings (high ice-crystal clouds as messengers of boundary-thinning) are mentioned in one paragraph, tied to grandmother's superstition, and invoked in the final paragraph as "invisible now." The concept does not constrain an on-page choice or change Elena's tactics; it functions as atmospheric motif and thematic echo. Setup weak (mid-story), no middle development, closure mention is ornamental. Present but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reads between lines" (pattern recognition through physics) is demonstrated in the stone-ripple beat and repeatedly in Elena's approach to glass, light, and the bay. It enables the closure insight (value in moments/patterns) and is tied to her profession. Setup early, middle use (ripple reading), payoff in final understanding. The trait is character-specific and shapes the pivot. Reaching 7.0+ would require the trait to visibly foreclose an alternate choice or impose a tradeoff cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Commune (through observation and creation) drives Elena's entire relationship with the bay and structures the stone-throw beat that delivers the key insight. Setup early ("conversation with the bay"), middle dramatization (ripple observation), payoff in closure decision (rebuild to teach communion). The action is irreplaceable—removing it breaks the causal chain to the ending choice. Solid across all three gates. Cost connection moderate; stronger if the communing had imposed a visible tradeoff mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The method (reading patterns in pond rings after throwing a stone) is signaled early, executed on-page in paragraphs 4–6, and delivers the insight that shifts Elena's stance. Setup clear, middle dramatization solid, closure participation via the ripple-born realization. The method's mechanics matter (concentric circles, interference with pilings). Reaching 7.0+ would require the method to fail or succeed with visible cost in the moment, not just deliver understanding.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn anchors the story spatially and temporally. The mist refracts the atrium's light, the water receives the stone, the shore provides the vantage, and the fishing boat's passage dramatizes the effect. The setting pressures the choice (city council demolition, impermanence of place) and supplies the materials for communion. Setup immediate, middle use constant, payoff in final scope expansion (breakwater, lighthouse). Strong integration; environmental constraint is clear.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "before everything shifts" is established in paragraph three (council vote, weeks until demolition) and recurs in the final line. It tightens the decision window and adds urgency to Elena's pivot. Setup mid-story, closure reprise clear. The clock does not alter tactics on the page within this scene; it frames the problem rather than pressing moment-to-moment choices. Lyric resonance present but causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation (illuminate value in the mundane) is dramatized through the atrium's seventeen-year construction, the ripple observation, and the captain's surprised joy. It drives the closure choice (scatter installations to teach noticing). Setup early, middle demonstration (light-gilding the boat), payoff in seed-scattering plan. The motivation faces friction (demolition as external cost) and is reaffirmed with visible sacrifice (abandoning the grand work). Strong integration; cost is legible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone (clear complexity) is maintained through layered imagery (light, physics, impermanence), restrained lyricism, and steady emotional register. The piece avoids sentimentality while treating loss and beauty; no tonal breaks. Modulation is subtle—Elena's calm observation shifts to resolve without melodrama. The tone charges the final image (notebook sketch as quiet determination). Coherent and consistent. Reaching higher would require the tone to sharpen or compress at a pivotal beat to heighten pressure on the page.</comment>
