<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is grounded in embodied detail ("spine unbend from its perpetual defensive curve") and her final choice to complete the interrupted confession feels earned by the prior causality. The metaphysical curse premise risks abstraction, but her fear of nonexistence is tied to concrete behavior—guarding against hope, moving with "warlike serenity." Internal contradiction appears in her simultaneous fortress posture and active seeking; the stakes deepen when she trades lifespan for the seed. Minor slip: the druid's "gift for finding lost things" is label-only until the ending reframes it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page: Maren completes her interrupted confession, the ice cracks, and her reflection returns—a Decisive Change with visible cost (three years of lifespan traded, the long search endured). Drive lens reads Causal: the seed enables navigation, the touch triggers the whispered confessions, the spoken completion breaks the curse. Orientation is swift (druid, cursed lake's heart, island of stone). One tightening occurs when she steps onto the vine and reaches the frozen face; the final image reweights her earlier guarding with the shadow "stretching faithfully behind her for the first time in years."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The swirling orchard vortex, pale-bone tree, and frozen face supply vivid, purposeful anchors that shape Maren's tactical choices (casting the seed into churning water, stepping onto vines). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency: "wind tearing at her cloak," "cold burned into her skin." The vines and the still tree at the center function as micro-setting that constrains movement and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the approach and central confrontation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming her reflection/existence—is signaled early and drives every beat. Pressure escalates when Maren trades three years of lifespan for the seed, steps onto carnivorous vines under the vortex's scream, and confronts the frozen confession. The final choice (completing the unfinished sentence) is driven by protagonist agency and forecloses the guarded, fortress existence with felt cost. No multiple reversals, but the single tightening (reaching the tree, hearing her own incomplete confession, choosing to finish it) narrows options and reweights the premise under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action: mirrors that refuse her, the fortress posture, the act of finishing an interrupted truth. The frozen confession tree literalizes "truths spoken too late," and Maren's realization—"I exist... whether seen or unseen"—is earned by the concrete journey and the whispered fragments rather than asserted. The final image (shadow stretching faithfully, no treasures but "hard-won knowledge") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the gesture of unbending her spine and the choice to cast the seed knowing its hunger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; Maren's perceptual signature is consistent (notices the vortex's appetite, recognizes guilt and relief crystallized together). Distance modulates purposefully: close during the spine-unbending and the confession completion, slightly wider during the vortex crossing. Diction stays character-bound ("druid," "warlike serenity," "flesh-eating plant seed pulsed... eager"); no head-hopping. Minor slip: "The druid had learned long ago to guard herself against hope" leans slightly expository, but anchors present stance. Rhythmic control holds under pressure; the confession moment compresses syntax effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong through the vortex crossing and tree confrontation. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or causality. Minor loops: "The vortex screamed around her, wind tearing at her cloak" and later "the vortex began to slow" repeat the vortex anchor without new pressure; "she had fought worse storms within her own heart" is a stock metaphor. Figurative language is mostly grounded ("branches heavy with fruit that would never ripen," "spine unbend from its perpetual defensive curve"), but the opening's "apple trees spiral eternally through mist and dark water" borders purple without adding causal weight. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise (curse that removes reflection, resolved by finishing an interrupted confession at a vortex of frozen truths) synthesizes familiar fantasy elements into a specific psychological stakes. The flesh-eating plant as navigation tool and the frozen-face tree are fresh inflections. Emotional specificity—fear of nonexistence, the fortress posture, trading lifespan—grounds the fantastical frame. The warlike-serenity tone and the "hard-won knowledge" ending resist sentiment. Minor predictability: the structure (enter perilous place, confront symbolic challenge, speak truth, gain resolution) follows a recognizable quest template, though the spine-unbending gesture and the shadow detail add particular resonance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's guardedness shapes her choices at every turn: she withholds hope, moves with "warlike serenity," and her fortress posture literally unbends at the closure beat. The act of unbending and completing the confession are direct expressions of her arc from guarded to present. She drives the seed-casting, the vine-stepping, and the final spoken completion. The trait appears in setup, middle (vortex crossing), and payoff (unbending, speaking).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The seed is traded for with lifespan (setup), cast into water (beat 1), erupts into vines that create the path (beat 2), and its hunger "having consumed enough of its power to break the cycle" contributes to the vortex slowing at closure. It enables the approach and its mechanics (devouring to grow) matter. The plant recognizes her "as gardener rather than prey," linking it to her druid identity. Strong causal role across three beats and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frozen confession is the literal destination and the pivot of the plot: the tree holds "truths spoken too late or never finished," Maren hears her own incomplete confession among the fragments, and completing it breaks the curse. The concept shapes stakes (she seeks what was lost in an unfinished fear) and the final action (finishing the sentence). Indispensable; without this exact element, the curse origin, the climax, and the thematic answer collapse.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maren's gift for finding lost things leads her to the vortex (setup) and is reframed at the end: "she had found what was lost... inside us all along." It motivates the journey but does not constrain a middle choice or supply a visible cost; the druid label does more work than the trait itself. The final-line reprise reweights it thematically, lifting it into the 6-band via lyric resonance, but mid-story it remains label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Unbending her spine is the physical and symbolic hinge of closure: "she released that tension, standing straight for the first time since the curse began" immediately precedes the spoken completion that breaks the ice. The earlier image "spine unbend from its perpetual defensive curve" sets it up, and the action redefines her posture from fortress to presence. Swapping it would require rewriting the entire character arc and the embodied metaphor. Indispensable to the final turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Expanding circles appear in the vine growth: "vines erupted upward... growing through expanding circles that pushed against the vortex's rotation." The mechanics enable the path and oppose the vortex's structure. The method is signaled in the middle beat and its success (widening circles, devouring bark) alters Maren's ability to reach the center. Not merely decorative; the противо-rotational mechanic is load-bearing for the approach sequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The vortex supplies the central constraint: seventeen seekers consumed before Maren, apple trees spiraling eternally, wind tearing at her cloak, the still tree at the center an exception to the chaos. It forces the flesh-eating plant tactic and shapes every movement across the middle. The cursed lake's heart and the "last stable island of stone" frame the opening and the final emergence. The setting drives choices, provides the frozen-face tree, and charges the quiet ending when "the orchard... continued its eternal spiral, but quieter now."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The three-year gap since the curse and the three years of lifespan traded establish temporal weight and motivate urgency. The story does not track a live in-scene clock, but the "after the trick fails" frame structures the entire quest and the cost. The timeframe appears in setup (curse origin), middle (lifespan trade), and payoff (shadow returns "for the first time in years"). It tightens stakes more than tactics; no moment-to-moment countdown, but the accrued cost is felt.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation—to discover what mirrors don't show—is dramatized in the opening (mirrors display empty space), drives the journey to the vortex, and resolves in the final beat when "a face looked back" and she reclaims "the simple act of finishing a sentence." The friction between wanting to be seen and fearing nonexistence creates the incomplete confession that caused the curse. The desire is tested by the lifespan cost and the vortex danger. Indispensable to the arc and the thematic question.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Warlike serenity is embodied throughout: "she moved with warlike serenity, each step deliberate and measured, her breath steady as a blade waiting to fall." The tone coheres through the vortex crossing (calm under the scream) and modulates at the unbending (releasing the fortress tension). It charges the final image: walking home with shadow and knowledge, no treasures. The oxymoron is made concrete in gesture and pacing, not merely asserted, and supports the druid's arc from guarded to grounded presence.</comment>
