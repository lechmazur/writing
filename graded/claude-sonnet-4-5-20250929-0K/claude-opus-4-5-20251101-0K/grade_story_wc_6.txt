<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior is richly embodied through fire imagery and physical scars, and her therapy/sculpture work provides concrete interiority. However, the central arc—choosing to write back to her father—occurred before the story opens; on-page she collects sand and reflects without a meaningful choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final walk forward is poetic but lacks a decisive on-page alteration or renunciation that grows from dramatized pressure within this scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece is oriented (firefighter at volcanic lagoon during cloud migration) and the accumulative/textural lens is legible by midpoint. However, closure lacks an on-page decisive change or reconfiguration with felt cost; Mara's walk away repeats her existing stance rather than crystallizing a new one. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) applies: "who, where, when" anchors arrive cleanly by paragraph two, but the waiver cannot apply because the disorientation does not charge closure—the final image reiterates theme without reweighting prior material through dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, black sand, and volcanic glass are vividly rendered and filtered through Mara's professional lens (fire/heat memory). The environment supplies the sand she collects, which will be grafted into her sculpture, creating a micro-setting constraint. Sensory hierarchy is strong (heat, texture, visual metamorphosis), and the kelp/succulents embody survival motifs without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving scars can sing—is signaled early but remains abstract. Mara's decision to write back to her father is backstory; the on-page action (collecting sand) does not narrow options or force a trade-off. The piece deepens thematically through accumulation but lacks a visible tightening or price paid within this scene that alters her tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: black sand as transformed destruction, grafting as compassion, the lagoon as refuge. The final image—"carrying darkness toward the light she would make from it"—offers a resonant answer to the scars-can-sing question without moralizing. Minor slip: "scars hummed quietly beneath her skin, learning their notes, preparing to sing" edges toward on-the-nose thematic echo in the final paragraph, but the surrounding imagery keeps it grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature: Mara's firefighter lens filters heat, ash, and transformation throughout. Psychic distance is stable; metaphors (clouds as whales, obsidian as ribs) feel voice-motivated. The recurring "gracefully alert" phrase and "kelp-drift peace" are purposeful compressions that teach the pattern. No head-hopping; interior voice remains consistent under reflection-heavy design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is strong, with varied sentence lengths and vivid concrete detail (obsidian walls, red thread, melted glass). However, several lines loop thematically without advancing pressure: "Each piece had witnessed destruction. Each piece was learning a new song" is paraphrase churn (−0.2). "Gracefully alert" appears twice in close proximity as a label without differentiated action (−0.3). Template cadence in the therapy/sculpture paragraph ("She called it… Mara called it…") adds minor drag (−0.2). Information density is high elsewhere, but these artifacts cluster enough to prevent high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The firefighter-as-arsonist's-daughter frame is well-executed but not novel; transformation through accumulation (sand, sculpture, scars) synthesizes familiar material with specific detail (Turkish lira, obsidian lagoon, kelp). The volcanic-beach setting and cloud-migration timeframe offer fresh texture. Risk-taking is present in the reflection-heavy, lyric design, but the closure image—walking toward light—feels predictable given the arc, preventing higher originality scores.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's identity shapes the lens (heat, ash, extinguishing) and motivates the sand collection. However, her key decision—writing back to her father—is backstory. On-page she observes and reflects without a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Present in setup and ending, but no middle beat where being a firefighter constrains or enables a turn. Two gates (setup, ending frame) met; causal pressure weak; closure linkage thematic rather than action-driven.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Black sand is handled in the opening beat (slips through fingers) and collected into the jar for grafting in the final third. It seeds the heat-memory motif and returns with reweighted meaning (molten → gracefully alert). Three gates met (setup, middle collection, ending jar). Causal pressure moderate (it shapes the sculpture plan); closure linkage present but not decisive (the walk away could occur without it). Specificity strong (volcanic origin, texture). Late collection (second half) and swappability (another charged material could serve) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Unyielding compassion" appears as theme—succulents with "patience and unyielding compassion for their own survival"—but does not shape Mara's on-page choices or tactics. It is a label layered onto the lagoon's ecology rather than a stake that alters her options. Present in setup as motif, absent from middle beats, echoed thematically at ending. One gate (setup); ornamental use; no causal pressure or closure linkage. Swappable with "resilience" or "persistence" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Gracefully alert" appears twice: once describing the sand ("gracefully alert, ready for whatever the tide might bring") and once describing Mara rising ("gracefully alert to the way the light shifted"). Both uses are adjectival labels without constraining or enabling an on-page action with visible cost. No middle beat where the trait forces a trade-off. Present in setup and ending as description; no causal pressure; swappable with "poised" or "attentive." Two gates (setup, ending) but purely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Graft" is the story's central metaphor: succulents grafted onto stone, sand grafted onto the sculpture, Mara "a healer grafted onto wound." It drives her ongoing project (sculpture from salvaged materials) and frames the ending choice to carry the sand home. Three gates met (setup with succulents, middle with sculpture description, ending with "carrying" plan). Causal pressure strong (the sculpture motivates the sand collection); closure linkage high (final image of grafting darkness to light). Irreplaceable metaphor. Only dock points because the actual grafting act is future tense; the on-page action is collection, not grafting.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The Turkish lira on red thread is introduced early (grandmother's deathbed gift), handled on-page (placed into the jar with sand), and seeds the wounds-as-doorways motif. Three gates met (setup, middle with jar, ending as part of the carried assemblage). However, its mechanics do not shape tactics; it is a symbolic anchor rather than a means that alters attempts. Causal pressure weak; closure linkage moderate (present in the jar but not decisive to the walk). Specificity strong (drilled coin, red thread). Lyric resonance carries it to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon provides the sand Mara collects, supplies the succulents-on-stone image that frames grafting, and offers spatial pressure (she must climb the dune to leave). Three gates met (setup with vivid anchoring, middle as resource/metaphor source, ending as the place she departs). Causal pressure high (the lagoon enables her sculpture plan and embodies transformation); closure linkage strong (the final climb away from it charges her forward motion). Specificity exceptional (volcanic glass, kelp, ribs-of-a-beast walls). Could not be replaced without breaking the heat/transformation logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Cloud migration is mentioned in setup ("clouds that migrated slowly overhead"), tied to her discovery of the lagoon three years prior, and noted again at ending ("clouds continued their ancient journey"). It sets atmosphere and cycles with her visits but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock within this scene. Two gates (setup, ending); no middle beat where time pressure alters tactics. Ornamental timekeeping; swappable with "seasonal change" or "annual pilgrimage" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To prove that scars can sing" is stated early, revisited in therapy/sculpture description, and echoed in the final line ("scars hummed quietly beneath her skin, learning their notes, preparing to sing"). Three gates met. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice on the page; Mara's actions (collecting sand, reflecting) do not force friction between this want and a competing cost. Causal pressure moderate (it frames the sculpture project); closure linkage high (final image directly invokes singing scars). Label-only use and lack of on-page conflict cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Kelp-drift peace" appears once as a compound descriptor ("kelp that grew in the shallow water swayed with kelp-drift peace") and sets the contemplative tone throughout. The tone is coherent and modulates subtly (quiet reflection → gentle determination), charging the final image of walking forward. Two gates (setup phrase, ending tone modulation). However, the exact phrase does not recur or deepen; tone work is strong but the phrase itself is ornamental. Lyric resonance present; purposeful compression taught. Swappable with "meditative calm" without breaking closure effect.</comment>
