<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marta's motivation is clear and embodied—her shift from body-finder to daughter-seeker is concretely grounded in the waxed leaf memory. The final choice to walk east is earned by prior causality with visible cost (abandoning her settlement perch, gathering courage). Interior voice remains consistent and particular throughout. Minor: the daughter's fascination with transformation is told rather than shown in early beats, slightly weakening the memory's anchor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Decisive Change: Marta shifts from searching for the dead to following the living, with the map providing concrete new options and the eastward walk forecloses her settled life. Causality is clean—Ven's discovery → riddle → memory → compost pit → map. Orientation is swift (bloodhound, scrapyard, post-war by line three). The inferred lens is Causal with light Accumulative texture; linkage holds and cost is visible in her gathering "the last of her courage."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The scrapyard settlement is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: "towers of compressed cars," "half-buried shipping container," "compost pit...oxidizing fragments that bled orange." The compost pit functions as micro-setting, constraining Marta's search and charging the closure (metal dreams of being earth). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The autumn leaf as recurring object charges the final image, elevating the setting's thematic work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding her daughter—is signaled early and tightens through the riddle, memory, and excavation. The compost-pit discovery narrows options decisively: Marta now has a map and a direction, foreclosing her passive waiting. Agency is clear in her run, dig, and final decision to walk east. Cost is visible: she abandons her settlement and faces the "impassable" eastern wastelands. One meaningful tightening with escalation under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme—transformation, recycling loss into hope, distance collapsed by memory—emerges organically from the waxed leaf, the compost pit ("metal dreams of being earth"), and Marta's shift from death-tracking to life-seeking. The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "metal dreaming of earth, and somewhere ahead, a girl waited." Minor slip: "translating distance into closeness" in the penultimate section edges toward thematic summary, though it's brief and tied to action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Marta's bloodhound instincts, scent-based perception, and memory filter. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Ven's lines carry purpose. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the memory and closure beats. Minor: a few filter verbs ("she realized," "she remembered") in mid-beats slightly dull immediacy, and the phrase "intuitively descriptive in their movements" momentarily shifts register without clear POV motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse; clarity is high throughout. Information density is strong in the riddle and excavation sequences. Minor issues: "wild hush pervaded everything here, the silence of a world holding its breath" is near-redundant (hush = silence). "Tinted revelations came slowly" in the map paragraph is abstract and slightly inflated for the concrete moment. A few adjacent lines paraphrase without adding pressure. No major loops, but small scaffold reduces propulsion in two beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The combination—post-apocalyptic bloodhound, phonograph-groove cipher, waxed-leaf memory riddle—is fresh and organically integrated. The transformation of "finding bodies" into "following the living" and "metal dreams of being earth" offers specific, non-obvious synthesis. The piece takes risks with the scrapyard-as-archive conceit. Minor: the post-resource-war setting and settlement structure are familiar genre territory; transformation is present but not radical enough to reach the high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marta's identity as a retired bloodhound shapes the opening, her scent-tracking instinct at the compost pit, and her final decision to "follow the living" instead of the dead—a direct inversion of her former role. Present in setup, drives the excavation beat, and charges the closure. The bloodhound trait enables her to locate the box and frames the thematic arc. Specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The autumn leaf appears in Sera's childhood memory (setup), as the answer to the riddle (development), is discovered in the compost pit (mid-beat), and Marta presses it to her chest at closure, where it reweights the dominant stake with felt cost. Present across three beats, causally active, and indispensable to the riddle and final image. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Tinted revelations" appears once as a phrase when Marta studies the map but does not shape stakes or constrain tactics on the page. The concept is thematically present (hidden messages gradually revealed) but functions as atmospheric label rather than causal driver. The riddle and map do the tactical work; "tinted" is ornamental. Swappable with "gradual" or "layered."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" is applied to Ven's finger movements when tracing the phonograph cylinder but does not constrain or enable a choice with cost. It's a one-line character note without on-page consequence. Mentioned in setup but never returns or alters a beat. Functional description, but replaceable with "careful" or "practiced" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The riddle ("What I kept to remember the end of growing things...") is the story's central puzzle, introduced early, drives Marta's memory and excavation, and directly produces the map that enables the closure choice. Removes it and the entire causal chain collapses. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure consequence. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The phonograph cylinder and its secret grooves are introduced in the Archive beat, explained by Ven, yield the riddle and Sera's name, and motivate the entire search. The method is signaled early, its mechanics matter (grooves layered over music), and it shapes Marta's attempt. Present across setup, development (the riddle), and indirectly in closure (the map it led to). Specific and essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The scrapyard settlement (Crag Hollow) provides spatial anchors throughout: gutted refrigerator perch, Archive container, compost pit. The compost pit's location and composition directly enable the discovery and constrain Marta's search method (digging where scent is strongest). The setting pressures choices and supplies the riddle's answer. Present in all three structural moments with causal force.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The post-resource-war timeframe is established early, frames the scrapyard's existence and Marta's retirement, and anchors the three-winters-ago disappearance. It tightens decisions by establishing scarcity and impassable territories. Present in setup and colors all tactics, but does not create a live ticking clock or alter moves beat-to-beat. Shapes context more than immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marta's desire to "translate distance into closeness" is dramatized through her shift from passive searching to active following, the riddle as emotional bridge, and the map that collapses "impossible miles into steps." Friction is visible: she must abandon safety and face the wastelands. The motivation drives setup, excavation, and closure with felt cost. Irreplaceable and charged at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Wild hush" is named twice and sustained through "silence of a world holding its breath," "creak of settling debris," and "whisper of wind through hollow pipes." The tone modulates under pressure (Marta runs, digs) and deepens at closure ("seemed to deepen around her"). It charges the final image with quietness and waiting. Coherent across turns and purposeful, though one explicit label ("wild hush of Crag Hollow") slightly over-signals.</comment>
