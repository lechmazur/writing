<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's plant telepathy is embodied through specific whispers (fern speaks of thirst, ivy curls with hope) that drive concrete choices—fleeing the tower, using roots to guide—with visible cost (defying doctors, risking another surgery). Thomas's arc from concern to complicity is earned by his trust in her wound-reading and the coffee-ring evidence. Minor slip: the mother's scar-reading ability is told rather than shown constraining a present choice, functioning more as backstory texture than immediate pressure. Interior voice remains consistent and specific throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Mira, tower, post-surgery dawn) land cleanly by paragraph two. The piece operates under a Causal lens: surgery failure → flight decision → descent with plant guidance, culminating in the hourglass sand falling as Charged Poise—options crystallize (pursue mother's trail vs. submit to doctors) with felt cost (defiance, unknown dangers below). The closure reconfigures the frozen miracle into motion, reweighting Mira's aberration as potential salvation. One meaningful tightening (Thomas's shift from resistance to aid) narrows options and the final image charges prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tower at dawn is grounded through frosted hourglass, coffee-stained desk, stone floors, and garden passage—spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The hourglass constrains the final beat (sand begins to fall) and charges closure; the coffee rings enable the method that drives plot. Sensory detail (frosted glass, moss on north wall, ivy outside) is filtered through Mira's plant-attuned perception and serves pressure rather than catalog. Minor gap: the caverns beneath are declared but not anchored with micro-detail that would raise spatial vividness to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape before the second surgery and find the mother—is signaled early and tightens when Thomas must choose complicity. Plant whispers (fern warns of approaching footsteps, roots sense movement below) provide escalating intelligence that narrows options under causal pressure. The final reversal (sand begins to fall) delivers visible cost: Mira commits to the unknown descent, foreclosing safety. Agency is robust (her refusal, her reading of coffee rings, her enlistment of Thomas) and the price—risking deeper brain damage, confronting whatever killed her mother—is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "closure was just another word for opening wounds carefully enough that they could finally drain," Mira's refusal to let the aberration be carved out, and the hourglass miracle taking root "in the wrong garden." The final image (sand falling) offers a non-literal answer to whether miracles and wounds can coexist without stating a moral. Subtext operates in Thomas's choice (trust over logic) and in the ivy "curling with hope." No thematic echo or sermonizing; the piece commits to its premise (displaced miracles, scar stories) and follows implications to closure without retreat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization on Mira; distance modulates purposefully (tight interiority during decision beats, slight pull-back for Thomas's entrance). Perceptual signature is distinct: Mira notices plant whispers, coffee rings, root vibrations—details a non-telepathic character would ignore. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext (Thomas's "supposed to make you normal" vs. Mira's "the surgery failed" crystallizes their conflict). Minor texture slip: a few lines lean toward stock phrasing ("something like grief," "something like hope") that slightly dulls the otherwise sharp voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively (short crisis beats, longer reflective turns) and information density is high—most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere. Opening and closing images (frosted hourglass, falling sand) bracket the arc cleanly. Two minor issues lower the score: "meteor-strike silence" and "displaced miracle" recur without deepening, risking decorative repetition; and one paraphrase loop in paragraph nine ("She spent her life learning to read them—the stories in wounds, the narratives written in damage") restates the same idea without added pressure. Apply −0.4 once in Q7 for the loop and slight figurative redundancy. No scaffold or generation artifacts harm clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—plant telepathy + scar-reading mother + frozen hourglass from meteor strike—feels specific and non-obvious, unified by the "displaced miracle" premise that blooms in the wrong garden. Coffee-ring divination and root-guided navigation transform familiar fantasy tropes through grounded micro-choices. Emotional truth (sibling trust under institutional pressure) anchors the speculative elements. Risk: the piece commits fully to its lyric-conceptual premise without hedging. Minor limitation: the "closure seeker" occupation and the meteor-struck hourglass, while vivid, echo broader SFF/fantasy templates; the story earns freshness through execution and voice rather than premise alone, capping the high band just shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira is identified as continuing her mother's closure-seeking work and explicitly names the concept ("closure was just another word for opening wounds carefully enough that they could finally drain"). The wound-opening logic drives her choice to pursue the unfinished patient rather than submit to surgery, and she refuses to let her own wound (the aberration) close. Present early, shapes the central decision, and charges the ending image. Reaches mid-6s on causal pressure and closure linkage; lacks a second distinct beat where the trait visibly alters tactics mid-scene to push higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frosted hourglass appears in three beats: Mira presses her palm against it (opening), lifts it to explain its origin and frozen sand (middle exposition), pockets it before descent, and the sand begins to fall in the final line. Early signal, mid-scene handling with backstory that primes closure, and decisive transformation at the end (frozen → falling reweights the miracle theme). Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability (the specific meteor-struck, time-stopped quality matters). Stops short of 8.5+ because the middle beat is mostly explanatory rather than a second distinct tactical use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Displaced miracle" is named and embodied: the meteor-struck hourglass with frozen sand, Mira's aberration "blooming into something the world calls aberration," and the final sand-fall reversal. The concept shapes stakes (miracle vs. medical correction) and the closure effect hinges on the miracle activating (sand falls) as Mira commits to her path. Present early, defines the central conflict, and charges the ending image with undeniable conceptual cost. Reaches 7+ on closure participation and specificity; slight limitation is that the concept is articulated more than enacted in middle tactical beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plant telepathy is signaled in paragraph three (fern murmurs thirst), enables key information (fern warns of Thomas's approach, senses movement in caverns), and drives the escape plan (plants guide through garden passage). The trait carries visible cost (reason for the surgery, risk of deeper intervention) and alters tactics at least twice (warning system, navigation resource). Early, causal across beats, closure-linked (descent relies on plant guidance), and irreplaceable (no other sense modality provides this intelligence). Strong integration; stops shy of 8.5+ because the final image focuses on the hourglass rather than a plant-mediated climax.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Tunnel" appears twice with purposeful meaning: Mira examines coffee rings that "tunnel backward through her final days" (divination method) and she asks Thomas to "tunnel out through the garden passage" (escape route). Both uses shape key turns—the coffee rings provide the mother's trail, the garden tunnel enables flight—and the verb choice coheres thematically (excavation, opening wounds). Present early and at closure transition. Reaches mid-6s on causal work; does not push higher because the action itself (tunneling as physical movement) is more metaphorical setup than on-page enacted struggle.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Coffee-ring examination is dramatized on the page: Mira "traced the coffee rings," explains the three-ring structure (past/present/future), and claims "Mother left a message in them... mapped her entire journey." The method provides the crucial intelligence (mother's trail to the monastery caverns) that drives the decision to descend. Signaled early, used in one key beat, and its mechanics matter to plot. Reaches mid-6s on causal work and specificity. Does not climb higher because the method appears in one extended explanatory beat rather than iterating across multiple tactical turns with evolving cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The quiet tower at dawn is anchored through frosted glass, stone floors, moss on the north wall, ivy outside, and the garden passage—spatial details that enable choices (Mira reads the desk, plants provide intel, the passage offers escape). Dawn timing adds urgency (doctors will come) and "meteor hush" tone charges the atmosphere. The setting constrains the escape route and supplies plant resources that alter outcome. Early signal, micro-setting details (desk, windowsill) used tactically, and tied to closure (descent from tower). Solid 7+ integration; stops short of 8+ because the tower itself is more stage than active pressure—no locked doors, patrols, or environmental obstacles complicate the flight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Forty minutes ago" anchors post-anesthesia timing and "this morning" signals the escape window before doctors arrive. The timeframe creates urgency (implied pursuit) but the clock is not tracked beat-by-beat or used to tighten a tactical dilemma on the page. Present and functional (sets up why now), but the anesthesia recovery itself does not impose physical limits that alter Mira's moves. Reaches mid-5s on setup and weak urgency; lacks the live ticking pressure or visible cost (e.g., lingering grogginess forcing a trade-off) that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira's desire to "learn to read the stories in scars" is inherited from her mother and directly motivates the choice to pursue the unfinished patient rather than erase her own aberration-scar. The motivation is dramatized in her refusal ("they'll want to tunnel deeper... until they carved out whatever miracle had taken residence") and in the closing commitment to "chasing closure through wounds that had never been allowed to heal." Present early, drives the central conflict, and shapes the ending. Reaches high-6s on causal pressure and closure linkage; friction between want (find mother, preserve gift) and cost (risk death, defy medicine) is strong. Stops short of 7+ because the scar-reading skill itself is told in backstory rather than shown altering a present on-page choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is named once and enacted throughout: "The tower stood silent," "in the hush of dawn—that meteor-strike silence before the world fully wakes," quiet footsteps, whispered plant voices, and the final descent into "waking tower" without clamor. Tone is coherent, modulates with pressure (hushed urgency rather than loud crisis), and charges the closure image (sand falls in near-silence). The meteor metaphor ties to the hourglass origin and displaced-miracle theme. Strong tonal consistency and thematic integration; reaches 7+ on coherence and closure charge. Slight limitation: the tone is more sustained atmosphere than a shifting texture that escalates under peak pressure.</comment>
