<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The oracle's interiority is concrete and purposeful—"mildly obsessed with understanding" is embodied through the three-day climb and her steady resolve in darkness. Her micro-choices (touching the flaking gold, tracing the map with bleeding fingers) reveal hierarchy of values. However, the final smile and confidence feel slightly unearned; the cost of eternal night is declared but not felt as internal contradiction or loss. No secondary character pressures her directly, so relational bullets don't apply.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers sensory density (bloodied feet, flaking gold, dimming stars) toward a final reconfiguration where the oracle completes her map and the booklet glows faintly. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the endless night remains but becomes navigable, reweighting the void from annihilation to charted territory. Cost is visible (bleeding fingers, three-day climb, solitary descent into darkness). One minor slip: the "borrowed light" glow at the end hints at resolution comfort that slightly softens the conceptual price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort and flaking gold booklet constrain action—she must wait in the tower, must work fast as the star dies. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: bloodied feet, metallic fragments in wind, "ambered hush" thickening time. The final descent through darkness with sureness of pebbles demonstrates micro-setting (body knowledge) charging the ending. Spatial choreography is clean. The fort's abandonment and the oracle's bare feet recur with purpose, anchoring her lived-in relationship to stone and shore.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map the darkness before it consumes everything—is signaled early and tightens as stars wink out one by one. The oracle's agency is decision and endurance: she climbs three days, waits for the precise moment, works faster as the last star dies. The tightening is clear (second-to-last star flickers → last star dies → absolute darkness) and forecloses the path of inaction with visible cost (bleeding fingers, solitary descent into void). No reversal, but the accumulative pressure and her renunciation of safety for knowledge earn the ending. Minor gap: the darkness is described as patient and curious but never materially complicates her work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action and image: silence as knowledge, darkness as chartable territory, the oracle's translation of extinction into navigation. The flaking gold booklet—pages that "summarize silence"—anchors the concept without stating a moral. The final image (small sun carried into night) offers a resonant answer: even annihilation has paths. No thematic echo or late moralizing. One small excess: "quality of light" and "compressing eons of burning" edge toward abstraction, though they're tied to her finger-work on gold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she reads futures in stones, notices the "language of pebbles," registers time as "thickening like honey." Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("mildly obsessed," "quiet persistence of water wearing through stone"). No dialogue; not required. The phrase "what consumed them" (stars) briefly floats reference, but context clarifies. Patterned compression ("not frantically so—she had lived too long") teaches its rhythm early and pays off in the measured final descent. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance character, image, or pressure. Figurative language is controlled: "ambered hush," "marbled hush," "time thickening like honey." Minor loop: "the darkness" and "the void" are near-synonyms across several sentences in the middle third without added pressure. "Borrowed light" at the end is slightly incongruous—where is the light borrowed from if all stars are extinguished? This touches the closure image but doesn't obscure causality. No scaffolding or template cadence. Clarity and concision are strong overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Premise—oracle maps an encroaching void by translating dying starlight into gold-leaf cartography—feels fresh and committed. The synthesis of pebble-shore divination, flaking booklet-as-vessel, and star-as-narrator is specific and non-obvious. Emotional truth (calm resolve, water-like persistence) avoids generic apocalypse templates. Risk: the story leans into lyric compression and mythic tone without safety hedges. One friction: the "curious and cold" darkness and the faintly glowing booklet at the end feel like late-added comfort that slightly retreats from the boldness of absolute night.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pebble-shore oracle: present from the title/opening, frames her climb and choices (waiting for the one-star moment, touching the booklet, descending with confidence). Her specific skill—reading futures in stone arrangement—shapes her sureness in darkness and her method of charting silence. Her decision to map rather than flee drives the entire arc and enables the closure reconfiguration. Causal in setup, middle action, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Flaking gold leaf booklet: handled in opening (pressed to chest, releases fragments), middle (opened, touched to reform lines), and ending (glows faintly, carried into night). Its unique property—recording "what could not be spoken"—enables the map and is irreplaceable. The flaking quality adds urgency (fragments lost to wind) and her bleeding gold/crimson mixes with its purpose. Closure hinges on its completion and faint glow. Deeply integrated across all three gates with high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ambered hush: appears once explicitly ("ambered hush descended") and echoed as "marbled hush." It signals the temporal thickening that preserves the mapping moment, shaping the stakes by slowing time. The concept charges the tower scene's atmosphere and supports the theme of silence-as-knowledge. However, it doesn't constrain a tactical choice or directly alter the closure; it's more tonal scaffold than pressure lever. Present in setup and development, but absent from the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mildly obsessed: explicitly noted ("mildly obsessed with understanding") and embodied through the three-day bloodied climb and her persistent mapping under pressure. The qualifier "mildly" distinguishes her calm resolve from panic, shaping tone and pacing. However, the trait doesn't force a visible tradeoff or constrain a key choice—she pursues her goal without competing desires. Present in setup and thematically consistent, but lacks beat-level cost or friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Retell: the last star "began to retell its story—not in words, but in the quality of light." This action enables the map's creation and defines the method of knowledge transfer (light-into-lines). Removing it would break the mechanism. However, "retell" is used once at the hinge and not seeded earlier; swapping to "tell" or "transmit" would require only minor edits. Strong closure linkage and causal necessity, but moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>By summarizing silence: explicitly stated in the booklet's purpose ("summarizing silence into something the living might comprehend") and demonstrated when the oracle translates the star's "quality of light" into map-lines. The method shapes her approach and the story's conceptual frame. However, the mechanics are asserted more than shown—how silence becomes cartography remains abstract. Present in setup (booklet's history) and ending (map completed), but the middle "doing" is gestural.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Storm-tossed ridge fort: she climbs three days to reach it, waits in its highest tower, and the shattered window frames the star-watching. The fort's abandonment and elevation provide isolation necessary for the mapping. However, the storm itself is mentioned only as howling wind and then falls silent; the fort's specific features (moss, gales) don't constrain tactics or supply resources. Functional setting that frames action but doesn't pressure choices or charge the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>When only one star remains in a dimming sky: the timeframe is seeded early ("that was when the silence would speak"), structures the middle wait (second-to-last star flickers, last star pulses and dies), and tightens the climax ("worked faster, its light growing thin"). The clock is legible and drives urgency. Removing it would collapse the story's mechanism. However, the star's death is not resisted by any complication—the timeline unfolds smoothly without friction. Strong setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To draw a map of an endless night: stated early, drives the three-day climb and tower vigil, and is fulfilled when she completes the golden cartography. The desire is dramatized through action (bleeding fingers, sureness in descent) and carries conceptual cost (she enters the void she mapped). Friction appears in the star's dying speed forcing faster work. The motivation shapes all major beats and the closure reconfiguration. High integration, though the want vs. need tension is minimal—she pursues mapping without internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marbled hush: appears once explicitly ("marbled hush of the tower wrapped around her") and echoes "ambered hush." The tone is coherent—calm, measured, mythic—and modulates slightly (storm falls silent, darkness presses curious and cold). It charges the final image of confident descent and faint glow. However, "marbled" is used only once and feels ornamental rather than weight-bearing; swapping to "stone-quiet" or "crystalline" would not break logic. Consistent mood without decisive pressure shift.</comment>
