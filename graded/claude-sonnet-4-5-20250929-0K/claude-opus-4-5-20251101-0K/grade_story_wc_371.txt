<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mei's interiority is concrete and well-embodied ("heuristically gentle approach—learning tenderness through trial and error—had cost her years of rage"), with her noticing habit driving choices consistently. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between remembering and seeking reprieve, though the final choice to plant seeds feels more symbolic than viscerally conflicted. The backstory about the bakery and grandmother anchors her motivation, but the closure act (planting wheat, whispering the name) reads as ritual rather than a high-stakes decision that forecloses a live option with immediate cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (tea house, Mei, morning, frost). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered memories, the bread's emergence, and the guerrilla gardening method, culminating in the wheat-planting act that reweights the dominant stake of resisting erasure. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mei's refusal to participate in forgetting is crystallized on-page with the whispered bakery name, and the cost—her solitary burden, the uncertainty of discovery—is felt. One meaningful deepening (bread → wheat seeds → physical planting) tightens the pattern, and the final image charges prior material without requiring a causal reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tea house and overgrown courtyard are vividly anchored with sensory detail (frost on wild roses, spider's web, cold soil) that reflects Mei's priorities. The setting constrains her choices (the courtyard as hidden garden site) and charges the final image (planting near the eastern wall). Spatial choreography is clear, and the recurring tea house frames the action purposefully. The spider's web at opening and close functions as micro-setting that mirrors her patient, unobserved work and reweights the ending without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resisting collective forgetting through preservation—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens: the bread discovery, her family's split memory, and the decision to plant wheat seeds tighten her mission from passive observation to active preservation. One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from holding the bread as evidence to committing seeds to soil, which forecloses the option of mere witnessing. The cost is legible: her solitude, the uncertainty of growth or discovery, and the weight of remembering alone. No causal reversal is required under this lens, and the accumulative design succeeds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme (memory, erasure, witnessing) emerges organically through the bread, extinct seeds, and spider's web without overt statement. The final image—whispering the bakery's name to the soil—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to resist forgetting, reweighting the opening's "vines swallowing the structure" with active preservation. "Tenuous absolution" is explored concretely through Mei's decision to distribute the burden by planting, though the phrase "refusing to participate in the forgetting" in the final section edges toward thematic echo. Subtext operates well in the spider's patient, unseen work and the bread's "ghost of sweetness."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and controlled: selective, lyrical, with a contemplative rhythm that modulates appropriately ("heuristically gentle," "guerrilla gardening," "tenuous absolution"). POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear—Mei notices "things that crept" and gradual erasures—and shapes the narrative texture. The phrase "heuristically gentle approach" briefly elevates diction beyond immediate crisis register, but the voice recovers quickly and the choice reads voice-motivated. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance shifts purposefully between interiority and external observation, and the final paragraph's rhythm charges the closure without slipping into exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with high information density ("She noticed when the bakery on Chrysanthemum Street vanished overnight, though her neighbors insisted it had never existed"). Sentence openings vary, and rhythm modulates well from reflective opening to the kinetic final planting. Minor scaffold appears in "This was her method of uncloaking the disappeared: through guerrilla gardening," which tells rather than shows the method in action earlier. The phrase "heuristically gentle" recurs as a label without embodied demonstration of trial-and-error gentleness in a high-pressure beat. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; figurative language (spider's geometry, bread's ghost) is precise and earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of memory-keeper protagonist, guerrilla gardening as resistance method, and bread-as-artifact is specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms a familiar "lone rememberer" trope through the concrete detail of extinct wheat seeds and the Chen Family Bread wrapper, making the premise feel earned rather than generic. The tea house setting and spider's patient work add fresh angles. Risk is present in the quiet, accumulative structure and the refusal of dramatic confrontation, which heightens thematic resonance without obscuring clarity. The final image (whispering the bakery's name to soil) feels inevitable in hindsight and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mei's role as "creeping normality noticer" is signaled early (bakery disappearance, temple bells, old songs) and shapes her dominant choice to plant wheat seeds as counteraction. Her observation drives the decision to preserve rather than merely witness, altering tactics from passive noticing to active gardening. The trait appears in setup, middle reflection, and closure participation, meeting all three gates. However, the observation itself doesn't create a high-cost turn; the planting decision feels more thematic confirmation than a narrow, pressured choice that forecloses a live alternative with immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bread appears in setup (unwrapped, examined), middle (piece placed as offering, memory contrast with family), and closure (seeds planted as its extension). It enables the wheat-planting decision and carries reweighted meaning from artifact-as-evidence to catalyst-for-growth. The bread's causal role is strong: without it, the wheat seeds and bakery name have no anchor. Specificity is high (Chen Family Bread, Est. 1923, faded blue ink). However, the bread is handled more as symbol than tactile, evolving prop—its "ghost of sweetness" is described rather than shaping a physical choice under pressure in the moment of tasting.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution" is named explicitly midway and explored concretely through Mei's desire to distribute the burden of remembering by planting seeds that might be discovered. It shapes her motivation and reframes the ending as reprieve-seeking rather than moral resolution, altering the stakes from solitary witness to potential shared memory. The concept constrains her choice (not preservation for its own sake, but for possible relief) and charges the final whispered name. However, the phrase is labeled rather than fully dramatized through a moment where absolution's tenuousness creates friction or cost in the planting act itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" is introduced early and tied to her shift from rage to patience, with visible cost ("years of rage"). The trait enables her current observational method and constrains her to slow, deliberate planting ("heuristically gentle with the earth") in the closure. It appears in setup and payoff, meeting two gates. However, the trait is more told ("learning tenderness through trial and error") than shown through an on-page moment where trial-and-error gentleness forces a specific tradeoff or mistake. The label recurs but doesn't visibly constrain a middle choice with immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Uncloak" is used once as a verb describing her guerrilla gardening method ("her method of uncloaking the disappeared"). It frames the planting action thematically but does not create a distinct, irreplaceable turn—remove the word and the planting scene functions identically. The action of revealing/preserving is present throughout, but "uncloak" itself is ornamental vocabulary rather than a dramatized beat. It could be swapped for "reveal," "recover," or "restore" without structural impact. Late first mention (mid-story) and single use further limit integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Guerrilla gardening" is signaled early as "her method of uncloaking the disappeared," explained concretely (planting extinct seeds in the palace courtyard), and executed in the closure beat (digging, planting wheat seeds near the eastern wall). The method shapes multiple beats: her past courtyard work, the bread-to-seeds decision, and the final planting action. It enables the closure and is irreplaceable—without this specific means, the ending loses its tactical and thematic charge. The method's mechanics (seed saving, hidden beds, physical planting) constrain her choices and supply the story's primary action, meeting all three gates with high causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The tea house and overgrown courtyard are anchored early (discovered three autumns ago, vines, jasmine, creeping fig) and frame the action (morning tea, planting near the eastern wall). The setting enables the guerrilla gardening by providing hidden, wild space and recurs in the final image ("left the tea house to the vines"). It constrains Mei's choice of planting location and charges the closure through the courtyard's embodiment of refusal-to-be-forgotten. However, the tea house itself functions more as ritual frame than active pressure—remove the structure and the courtyard alone would suffice. The setting is essential but the "secret tea house" label adds modest lyric weight without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the birds fly south" is mentioned in the opening and reappears at closure ("in the quiet after the birds had flown south"). It marks seasonal timing (autumn/early winter, frost) and mirrors the emptied, silent world Mei inhabits. The timeframe shapes tone and grounds the setting but does not tighten decisions or create urgency—planting could occur at any point in the empty season without consequence. It meets setup and payoff gates through lyric reprise, but lacks middle development or causal pressure. The element functions as atmospheric anchor rather than live constraint, scoring in the mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The desire "to find the sacred in the ordinary" is stated explicitly ("Finding the sacred in the ordinary was not escapism; it was the only honest response") and demonstrated through the tea ritual, spider's web observation, and bread's "stubborn sweetness." It motivates Mei's planting decision as reframing resistance into reverence, shaping her stance at closure. The motivation appears in setup (tea house ritual), middle (reflection on sacred in steam, bread, spider), and closure (planting as sacred act). However, it is more told than dramatized through conflicting wants or a moment where seeking the sacred costs her an alternative goal. Friction is present (burden vs. reprieve) but not directly tied to this specific desire.</comment>
