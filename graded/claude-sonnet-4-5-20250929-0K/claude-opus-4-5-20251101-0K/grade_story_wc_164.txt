<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's emotional specificity is strong—"cheerful gloom" is embodied through contradictory impulses (tears and laughter coexist naturally). The transliteration process is enacted concretely in two beats (crater glass alone, then layered with seeds), showing work rather than declaring insight. Internal contradiction operates in scene: she seeks answers yet the resolution is accepting not-finding. Minor cap: the sister's arc is entirely reflective backstory without on-page friction, and the final peace arrives without visible cost to Mira's present choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (recollectionist, cave, three-day countdown) land by ~15% of text. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira plants seeds and accepts her sister's unknowability, foreclosing the search with felt cost ("grief she would carry forever"). The textural deepening occurs when seeds layer over crater glass, reweighting her sister's emotions from defeat to release. Cost is on the page: she climbs lighter but still carrying grief, and the memory will fade. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The iridescent cave constrains action (crystal shelf as workspace, crevices for planting) and charges the final image (light scattered through crystal becomes metaphor for paths). Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "hummed with trapped light," "fractured rainbows," moisture-gathering crevices. The seeds and crater glass function as micro-setting objects that enable the conjecture beat. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. Minor limit: the cave's beauty is described more than it pressures choice, trending toward postcard in the opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand sister's disappearance before memory fades) is signaled in paragraph one. One meaningful tightening: the seed discovery prompts conjecture that reweights her sister's final emotions, narrowing the mystery from "missing" to "transformed." Agency is attention and renunciation—she plants seeds and accepts not-finding with on-page cost (the grief remains). The three-day countdown is declared but never tested or tracked on the page, reducing urgency. Coincidence (bird-dropped seeds) complicates but does not resolve; Mira's interpretive choice drives the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (paths as transformation, not disappearance) emerges from seed metaphor, transliteration process, and the sister's arc without direct statement until the penultimate beat, where it's earned. The final image—emerging with warmth in her pocket and understanding planted like a seed—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the crater glass (twisted form = sister's unknowable change) and seeds (scattered yet purposeful). Minor friction: "Some paths disappear because..." triplicate in the ending risks thematic echo, though each iteration adds specificity and the cumulative effect charges rather than flattens.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric: "cheerful gloom like a second skin," "transliterates emotions into something navigable." POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is consistent (beauty and sorrow coexist). Diction remains character-apt except one slip: "via the scattered path of a creature following ancient instincts" elevates into academic register during peak conjecture beat, briefly pulling reader out of Mira's embodied present. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she noticed") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance image, emotion, or concept. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short at emotional peaks: "But there were missing pieces. There were always missing pieces."). Minor loop: "missing pieces" recurs across three beats without sufficient reweighting until the end. Template cadence in paragraph 14: "Some paths disappear because..." x3 creates a drumbeat that risks mechanical closure, though the specificity escalates. One weak nominalization: "her work" (paragraph 4) could sharpen to a concrete verb. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "cheerful gloom like a lantern" mixed slightly with earlier "second skin" metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The transliteration conceit is fresh, and the seed-as-migration metaphor offers a non-obvious angle on paths/transformation. Emotional specificity (grief and wonder coexist) avoids generic templates. The sister's off-page arc and the conjecture structure feel familiar to workshop prompt-response patterns: mysterious disappearance + metaphorical object + epiphany of acceptance. The piece commits fully to its premise but does not surprise; the seed discovery feels convenient rather than inevitable, and the final understanding arrives cleanly without complication or cost that reshapes Mira's tactics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and makes two decisions: to transliterate (paragraph 4) and to layer seeds over crater glass (paragraph 8), which shifts her interpretation. The seed-planting (paragraph 15) is a hopeful gesture but does not create a turn. Setup clear, middle beat functional, ending gesture present but not causally decisive—she already has peace before planting.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Crater glass appears in four beats: arrival (paragraph 3), first transliteration (paragraph 4), layered transliteration (paragraph 8), and final hold-up to light (paragraph 16). It enables both key emotional shifts (confusion→resignation, resignation→release). The object's twisted form is causally tied to its origin and metaphorically charged. Final image ("warm in her pocket") reprises with reweighted meaning (warmth = sister's peace internalized). Strong integration; not quite indispensable because the seed insight could theoretically occur without it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Missing pieces" is the stated quest (paragraph 3), drives the transliteration attempts (paragraphs 4, 5, 8), and is explicitly repriced at closure (paragraph 14: "weren't missing at all"). The concept shapes both Mira's tactics (search for coherence in emotions) and the final reconfiguration (acceptance of transformation). It appears in the title-like opening stake and returns with opposite meaning at the end, reweighting prior material. Essential to story logic and theme.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Transliteration is enacted twice on the page (paragraphs 4 and 8) with visible method (crater glass grows warm, emotions "bleeding through," then layering with seeds). It enables the key turn (reinterpreting resignation as release). Setup clear, middle beat functional, closure participation indirect (the final transliteration's result carries forward but the act itself is complete by paragraph 8). Cost is implied (concentration, risk of misreading) but not dramatized. Functional but the trait could be replaced with "interprets" or "reads emotions" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Conjecture occurs explicitly in paragraph 7 ("This was conjecture, she knew") and drives the seed-layering transliteration (paragraph 8) that produces the key insight. Setup (she's a recollectionist who reads patterns) is early, the act is middle, and the result shapes closure. The piece acknowledges conjecture's uncertainty ("couldn't know if...correct"), which adds texture. Moderate integration: the story could function with "interpretation" or "intuition" as the method, though conjecture's epistemic humility ("guesswork built on intuition") fits the acceptance theme.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Seeds appear first in paragraph 6 (discovery on cave floor), are used in paragraph 8 (layered over crater glass), and planted in paragraph 15. The bird's migratory path is the metaphorical key ("impossible distance via scattered path...following ancient instincts") that unlocks Mira's reinterpretation. Setup late (~40% mark), but the middle beat is causally strong (enables the transliteration shift). Closure participation is gestural (planting) rather than decisive. Swappability: another natural-process metaphor (water, wind) could serve similar thematic work with edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cave is introduced in paragraph 1 (descent, crystal formations), used as workspace (paragraph 4: "crystal shelf"), supplies the seeds (paragraph 6: scattered on floor), and provides planting sites (paragraph 15: crevices where moisture gathers). The iridescent light charges the final image (paragraph 13: "alive with its own strange joy"; paragraph 16: tears become rainbows). Setup immediate, middle workspace function solid, closure participation strong (light metaphor). The cave's specific properties (moisture, crystal, light) enable and symbolize the resolution. Near-essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Three-day countdown is declared in paragraph 1 ("perhaps three days before the memories...would dissolve") and referenced at closure (paragraph 18: "memory would fade soon"). It frames urgency but is never tracked or tested on the page—no moment where time pressure alters Mira's choices or accelerates her work. Setup clear, no middle development, closure mention is summary-only. Swappable with any vague deadline ("soon," "before long") without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's seventeen-year quest to understand disappearing paths is stated in paragraph 3, drives her transliteration work (paragraphs 4–8), and is resolved with visible cost at closure (paragraph 11: she finds peace with not-finding; paragraph 18: "grief she would carry forever"). The desire is foregrounded, shapes all on-page action, and the final reconfiguration answers it. Friction between want (answers) and cost (accepting unknowability) is present. Strong integration; one notch below indispensable because the motivation could be "find my sister" without the paths-disappearing layer.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cheerful gloom is embodied immediately (paragraph 2: "smiled...even as sorrow pooled"; "wearing cheerful gloom like a second skin") and modulates with pressure: tears and laughter together (paragraph 10), lightness with carried grief (paragraph 13), warmth and fading memory (paragraph 18). The tone is consistent through all turns and charges the final image ("lighter...carrying her cheerful gloom like a lantern"). It's not decorative—the oxymoron structures Mira's perceptual signature and the story's emotional logic. Essential to voice and closure.</comment>
