<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and her motivation coherent throughout, with the pivot from extraction to witnessing earned by the accumulation of sensory experience in the garden. The mist-walking sequence demonstrates embodied transformation. However, key moments lean on abstract epiphany language ("she understood what her motivation had truly been") rather than letting the choice dramatize the shift, and the "underachieving mage" trait remains largely a label that doesn't constrain on-page action. The final glow on her fingertips feels convenient rather than earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens by the garden arrival and sustains it through the ending. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (renunciation with Charged Poise): Mara chooses not to extract the keystone, crystallizing the sacred-in-the-simple realization. Cost is visible in the decision to descend with "nothing tangible" in a world that has automated wonder. The orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first two paragraphs. One minor friction: the mist-walking sequence feels more like a technical obstacle than a pressure-driven escalation that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The icebound spire, impossible geometry, and the Garden of Modest Wonders are rendered with vivid, purposeful detail—"perpetual twilight above the clouds, where stars never fully emerged" creates atmosphere that charges the ending. The frozen flowers and folly architecture constrain Mara's final choice by embodying the theme of simplicity. Spatial choreography remains clean through the ascent and garden arrival. The "brilliant dimness" lighting functions as micro-setting that directly shapes the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding meaning the automatons can't replicate—is signaled early and maintained. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening when Mara stops mid-extraction and reconceives her goal, a tightening consistent with Accumulative design. However, the escalation is more conceptual than concrete: the climb itself poses little visible cost or adaptive pressure, and the core conflict (Mara vs. her impulse to take the keystone) materializes abruptly rather than building through resistant beats. The Academy's closure and automaton dominance provide context but exert no on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the garden particulars and Mara's renunciation without overt moralizing until the final paragraphs. The keystone as "lingering luminance" and the folly as monument to simplicity charge the ending image effectively. The piece resists tidy binaries by honoring Mara's continued underachievement even as she gains insight. Penalty: the final three paragraphs edge toward thematic summary—"they could never manufacture wondering" and "that small distinction was the only magic worth keeping" declare rather than embody the theme, costing ~0.3 in an otherwise strong execution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara's way of noticing blends practical detail with lyric sensitivity. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the mist-walking sequence. The prose carries character-specific texture in word choice and rhythm. Minor slips: "which is why it accommodates dreamers" in the mentor's voice feels slightly didactic, and a few lines ("feeling nothing, which was exactly what she'd felt") use syntactic templates that flatten momentum. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high in the garden sequence. Figurative language is vivid and mostly coherent. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "light that persisted beyond its source, beauty that outlasted reason" restates the same idea across adjacent clauses; "accommodates impossibilities... accommodates dreamers" loops within a single beat. The final section stacks abstract declarations ("No trophy... no proof... But her fingertips glowed") in a way that dilutes propulsion. Template-cadence penalty (−0.4) for repetitive "She + past-tense verb" stems in the closing paragraphs: "She had found... She was still... She had climbed..."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The automaton-threatens-magic premise is familiar, but the piece personalizes it through the folly's celebration of smallness and Mara's shift from extraction to witnessing. The mist-walking sequence and impossible-geometry spire offer fresh sensory angles. However, the emotional arc (underachiever learns to value what she already has) follows a well-worn template without sufficient transformation. The "automatons can manufacture wonder / But they could never manufacture wondering" formulation feels like a pre-constructed thesis rather than an earned synthesis, costing originality points.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara appears throughout and makes the key choice to leave the keystone, altering the story's trajectory. Her "underachieving mage" status is signaled early and reprised at closure but functions more as context than constraint—it doesn't visibly limit her on-page actions (the climb and mist-walking succeed without friction tied to her low skill). Two beats involve decision (mist-walking, renunciation), but the trait itself remains largely a label. Mid-band: causal involvement in closure, but swappable with "any seeker" without major restructuring.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The keystone is introduced at the setup, handled physically when Mara reaches for her crystal, and returns with reweighted meaning in the final image as "lingering luminance." Its properties (light that persists beyond source) directly enable the thematic pivot from extraction to witnessing. It drives two distinct beats (approach, renunciation) and charges the closure. Strong integration; not quite indispensable because the story could function with a different sacred object, but would require substantial rewriting.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Lingering luminance" is introduced early as the keystone's defining property and reappears in the garden observation and Mara's glowing fingertips at closure. It shapes her final choice (to witness rather than extract) and charges the thematic opposition to automation. However, it functions more as metaphor than as mechanic—it doesn't constrain tactics or narrow options in the middle beats. Lyric reprise earns mid-band credit: early seed → final payoff with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Accommodates impossibilities" is mentioned twice (corridors bent backward, mentor's quote) but remains descriptive rather than functional. The impossible geometry delays Mara briefly, but mist-walking bypasses it without cost, and the trait doesn't constrain her final choice. Present and thematically consonant, but replaceable with "strange architecture" without altering story logic. Functional but swappable: mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Unstrap" triggers the pivot beat: Mara begins to remove her satchel to extract the keystone, then stops—the hinge moment that defines the closure. It appears late (final third) but transforms all prior material by redefining her goal. The action is specific and irreplaceable; swapping it for "reached" or "prepared" would dilute the physicality and the embodied hesitation. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, with visible cost (she lets the crystal fall back).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Mist-walking is seeded at step 300, explained briefly, and executed in one beat to pass the collapsed stairwell. It enables forward progress and provides a memorable sensory sequence. However, its mechanics don't recur or shape later choices, and it could be replaced with "climbed around" without affecting closure. Functional single-beat use with early signal, but no development or payoff beyond its immediate utility. Mid-band for one-beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The spire is introduced immediately, structures the entire ascent, and provides the garden's "perpetual twilight" lighting that charges the final image. Its icebound walls, impossible geometry, and altitude isolate Mara and create the conditions for her choice. The setting appears in setup, middle (stairwell obstacle), and closure (garden courtyard), driving at least two beats and contributing essential atmosphere. Strong integration; not quite indispensable because the story could function in a different remote sacred site, but removal would require major rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"When creativity gets automated" frames the inciting context (Academy closure, automaton dominance) and recurs in Mara's final reflection. However, it functions as backdrop rather than active pressure—no on-page automaton presence, no ticking clock tied to automation's advance. The timeframe explains why Mara climbs but doesn't constrain her tactics or tighten decisions. Present and thematically relevant, but replaceable with any "post-collapse" context. Functional but swappable: mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to find the sacred in the simple" is stated early, dramatized through her observation of the folly and frozen flowers, and crystallizes in her renunciation of extraction. The motivation drives two key beats (approach, choice not to take) and charges closure with visible cost (descending empty-handed). It's tested by friction between her initial extraction plan and the garden's invitation to witness. Strong causal involvement and closure linkage; not quite indispensable because a similar "seeker finds wisdom in restraint" arc could substitute, but would need rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" is introduced in the garden's "perpetual twilight" lighting, recurs in Mara's self-discovery ("brilliant dimness within herself"), and modulates from atmospheric description to thematic synthesis. It charges the final image and remains tonally coherent through the contemplative beats. However, the phrase itself arrives late (garden sequence) rather than anchoring from the opening, and the tonal shift from climb-obstacle to lyric observation feels more abrupt than modulated. Good closure linkage and reprise, but setup delay and modest pressure work keep it mid-band.</comment>
