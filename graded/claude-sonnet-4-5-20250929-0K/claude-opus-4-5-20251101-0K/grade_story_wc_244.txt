<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's characterization shows consistent elusiveness and career-long avoidance patterns, with her final offer to stay driven by recognizing herself in the network she's been running from. The "desperately jocular" trait appears in the fox exchange but reads more as a label than embodied contradiction under pressure. Okonkwo's instantaneous catalogue of Maya and his gardener-philosopher persona feel convenient rather than earned through prior beats. The ending choice arrives without visible internal conflict—Maya offers to help distribute the compound without dramatized resistance to her fifteen-year pattern.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Maya, disused station, present-day pursuit). The causal chain holds: Yuen gives sample → Maya tracks Okonkwo → sample completes the protocol → cure exists. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis shifting to Charged Poise): Maya's offer to stay forecloses her elusive pattern with felt cost ("unfamiliar and terrifying"). The drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative accent (the favor-network reveal reweights prior material). One minor slip: the pilot's rumor that led Maya here is never explained—who started it and why remains unearned convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ivy-strangled station is vividly rendered and functional: it houses the hidden lab, embodies the reciprocity theme through patient organic reaching, and the moss-covered trunk becomes Maya's literal seat of decision. The fox pair in the ticket booth charges the final image with companionship motif. Spatial choreography is clean (Platform 3 → stationmaster's office → lab inside). The microscope, charts, and humming equipment ground Okonkwo's operation plausibly. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (lichen on jacket, vines strangling doors).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Maya delivering the sample and understanding the protocol—is clear and present from paragraph two. Pressure tightens when Okonkwo receives the fragment and explains the fifteen-year network, reweighting Maya's entire career as unwitting participation. Her offer to help distributes the compound narrows her options (no more running) with stated emotional cost. The escalation is more revelatory than agonistic: the network's existence is explained rather than tested on the page. No antagonist appears; coincidence (the pilot's rumor) delivers Maya to the station without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—loneliness as invisible disaster, cured not by chemistry but by the network itself—emerges organically from Okonkwo's work and Maya's elusive career. The ivy's patient reaching and the fox pair's companionship reinforce connection without stating it. The reciprocity protocol becomes both cure and crucible: helping others while staying unmoored is the disease. The final image ("gentle chains of reciprocity… felt, remarkably, like freedom") offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. One small slip: "polite anarchy" is declared mid-dialogue rather than fully embodied in on-page rule-breaking with visible cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds cleanly on Maya with stable psychic distance and no head-hopping. Voice carries a wry, compact texture ("desperately jocular even with herself") and modulates appropriately under pressure. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Okonkwo's "rather rude" and Maya's fox-vineyard quip establish character quickly. Free indirect style is clean. One friction: Maya's interior voice and Okonkwo's speech share similar register and wit (both deploy dry humor and abstract phrasing), reducing distinction under emotional peaks. Filter verbs ("watched," "understood") appear but remain voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with varied syntax and high information density. Figurative language (ivy as "living shrouds," "gentle chains") is coherent and functional. No major loops or scaffold detected. Minor issues: "improbable rumor chains" summarizes the three-month search rather than dramatizing any friction; the phrase "bound by reciprocity" appears in both Okonkwo's explanation and Maya's closing thought, creating slight echo without added pressure. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Rhythm accelerates cleanly through the lab revelation without drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—disaster-relief workers unknowingly building a favor economy to harvest lunar minerals for a loneliness cure—offers a fresh synthesis of mutual aid and speculative biotech. The station setting and moon-rock catalyst avoid cliché. Execution transforms the "found family through catastrophe" template through the fifteen-year distributed network and Maya's career-long flight from connection. Risk: the piece commits to soft-SF without hedging. One limitation: the core emotional arc (loner learns to stay) is familiar, and the ending's "gentle chains… like freedom" borders on platitude despite thematic grounding. The transformation test is borderline: swap names and the structure still reads recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maya's elusiveness shapes the entire premise: fifteen years appearing at disasters then vanishing creates the need for rumor-chain tracking and positions her as the ideal distributor. Her choice to offer help at the end forecloses her elusive pattern with stated cost ("unfamiliar and terrifying"). She appears in setup, drives the middle search (summarized but functional), and makes the closure decision. The trait constrains her prior life and enables the final turn. Swappability: a different logistics role would require only minor edits, but the specific disaster-relief context ties to the favor-network mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The moon rock appears in paragraph two (Maya turns it beneath skylights), drives the middle beat (Okonkwo receives it "with trembling hands" and places it under microscope), and is causally essential—without this fragment the protocol remains incomplete for fifteen years. Its lunar origin and catalytic property are irreplaceable: harvesting required the global favor network. The object is handled on-page across three distinct beats and its arrival triggers Okonkwo's exposition of the reciprocity system. It does not charge the final image directly but enables all closure consequences. Slight cap: the rock itself is passive; its meaning is told rather than shown through failed use or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Reciprocity structures the entire plot: the favor-network (antibiotics, airlift, generator fix) that transported the sample is both method and theme. Okonkwo's explanation—"everyone who helped… received something they needed first"—reweights Maya's career as participation in the system. The concept shapes tactics (no one knew they were part of something larger) and the ending stakes (Maya's offer to stay binds her in the network). The final line ("bound now… by the gentle chains of reciprocity") makes the concept the closure's emotional cost. The concept appears early (title of the protocol, paragraph two), drives middle causality, and charges the ending image. Irreplaceable: swap for generic mutual aid and the moon-rock logistics collapse.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Desperately jocular" appears once in paragraph four as a narratorial label ("desperately jocular even with herself") and is demonstrated briefly in the fox-vineyard quip. It does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost—Maya's humor is a coping mechanism mentioned but not tested under pressure. The trait could be removed with no impact on plot or closure. Late-band credit requires the trait to enable or block a key action; here it remains decorative characterization.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Catalyze" functions literally (lunar minerals catalyze the loneliness-repair compound) and structurally: the sample's arrival catalyzes Okonkwo's explanation, which catalyzes Maya's decision to stay. The action is chemically specific and plot-essential—without catalysis the protocol fails. It appears in setup (Yuen's sample), middle (Okonkwo's microscope work), and implicitly at closure (the compound can now be distributed). Swappability test: replacing "catalyze" with a generic "activate" or "enable" would require rewriting the chemistry and weaken the thematic parallel (Maya as catalyst for the network's continuation). Minor cap: the catalysis itself happens off-page in the microscope; we see handling but not the chemical transformation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Improbable rumor chains are signaled in paragraph three (nurse, engineer, pilot mentions) and frame Maya's three-month search. The method's difficulty justifies the opening and Okonkwo's final reveal ("someone started a rumor you were exactly the person I needed"). The mechanics appear in both setup and closure, reweighting the search as orchestrated. Limitation: the search itself is summarized in one paragraph rather than dramatized with on-page friction or failure. The method enables the meeting but does not constrain middle tactics—Maya simply follows leads without detours. Swappable with "coded messages" or "anonymous tips" with modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The disused railway station with ivy appears in the title beat, houses the hidden lab (middle function), and its patient ivy becomes the penultimate image reinforcing theme. The station's abandonment mirrors Maya's elusiveness; the ivy's persistence ("never stopped reaching") charges the closure moment. The setting enables Okonkwo's secrecy (no one would look there) and provides the moss-covered trunk Maya sits on, the ticket booth where foxes settle, and the fractured skylights. Spatial details alter tactics: vines "strangled with vines" door signals the lab's concealment. The impossible train whistle in the final paragraph reweights the station's function. Irreplaceable: swap for generic hideout and the organic-reaching motif collapses.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"When the story changes" appears in Maya's question ("When does the story change?") and Okonkwo's reply, making it an explicit meta-frame. The timeframe functions thematically: fifteen years of network-building converge at this moment. Limitation: no live clock tightens decisions—Maya waits, Okonkwo arrives, the conversation unfolds without time pressure. The ending implies future distribution but does not track elapsed minutes or impose urgency. The phrase charges the closure image (Maya stops running now) but does not constrain middle tactics. Present in setup (fifteen-year context), middle (Maya's question), and closure (the shift happens on-page), but time as a tactical pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cure for loneliness is Okonkwo's explicit goal (paragraph nine: "loneliness is the disaster no one calls me to fix") and Maya's implicit need—her fifteen years of elusiveness are flight from connection. The motivation drives the entire reciprocity protocol and reweights Maya's career. Friction: Maya's loneliness is told (she helps others connect while staying elusive) but her on-page choices show little active resistance to connection—she waits, listens, and offers help without dramatized internal conflict between wanting and fearing attachment. The motivation shapes closure (her offer forecloses running) but the emotional cost is stated ("unfamiliar and terrifying") rather than embodied in hesitation or contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Polite anarchy appears as Maya's phrase ("Polite anarchy… Everyone breaking rules for each other") and is embodied in the favor-network mechanics: no formal system, yet mutual aid flows. The tone is present in Maya's wry humor, Okonkwo's gardener-philosopher stance, and the hidden lab in a derelict station. It modulates under pressure: the opening is playful (fox banter), the middle more earnest (protocol explanation), the ending quietly defiant (impossible train whistle). Limitation: the rule-breaking is mostly told—we hear about airlifts and antibiotics but witness no on-page code-bending with visible social cost. The tone charges theme but remains more conceptual than felt in moment-to-moment choices.</comment>
