<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and embodied through the copper nail and her ancestor's legacy, with choices that advance the plot. However, her internal experience remains somewhat surface-level—the "spongey dread" is asserted rather than shown through contradictory impulses or embodied degradation under pressure. The Commander's skepticism-to-belief arc happens too cleanly without friction that would test Mira's resolve. The final choice (organizing pages, making them listen) lacks visible cost or foreclosed paths that would elevate the characterization into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation is clean early (weather station, Mira's role, the journals). The causal lens holds: journals → decoding → correlation with data → warning decision. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Mira fulfills her ancestor's mission with visible purpose), but the cost remains abstract—"hope" and "satisfaction" are asserted rather than dramatized through a tangible sacrifice or foreclosed option. The reversal (Commander's shift from skepticism to action) happens off Mira's agency but feels mechanically triggered by data correlation rather than earned through her pressure or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The experimental weather station is vivid and specific (reinforced glass, groaning structure, new winds, experimental sensors), with sensory details filtered through Mira's anxious attention. The copper nail functions as micro-setting, recurring with shifted weight at key beats. The station's isolation and the atmospheric chaos frame the stakes clearly. However, the analysis room and the spatial choreography within the station remain generic; the environment does not meaningfully constrain Mira's choices or tactics—she spreads pages, calls the intercom, organizes without spatial friction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (proving Elena's predictions to save lives) is signaled early and tightens once when Mira decodes the cycle and convinces Torres. However, escalation lacks a second meaningful pressure point—the Commander's conversion happens too easily without a reversal or complication that would force Mira to pay a visible price. The fourteen-month timeline creates urgency in concept but does not alter Mira's on-page tactics or force a trade-off. Agency is present (decoding, presenting evidence) but the resolution feels granted rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme (honoring overlooked bravery, legacies fulfilled across generations) emerges cleanly from the journals and Mira's mission. The "reversible exile" metaphor deepens the climate premise without overt statement. However, the final image—"hope, perhaps. Or simply the satisfaction of a question finally answered"—tilts toward thematic summary rather than a resonant non-literal answer. The copper nail warming is a symbolic convenience that arrives late to harvest closure points. The story resists easy morals but does not embrace ambiguity; Elena's predictions are validated without complication or cost to that certainty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct archival-librarian texture ("spongey dread," "sediment in her chest") that modulates under pressure. Dialogue with Torres is functional and advances plot, though his lines lack subtext or resistance that would create indirection. The prose reflects Mira's internal state without filter-verb stacks. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("phenomenon the current scientists had missed entirely") that feels authorial rather than character-bound, and Torres's skepticism-to-belief dialogue feels templated rather than idiomatically distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the decoding beats. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The world had exiled its familiar weather, and that exile was about to end violently" echoes the earlier "reversible exile" concept without added pressure. "Nervously confident" is asserted twice (grant applications, organizing pages) without evolving. The final paragraph stacks abstract closure claims ("hope, perhaps. Or simply the satisfaction") that dull momentum rather than landing a concrete image. Minor template cadence in exposition ("three months after," "six years ago") and a thesaurus-itis slip ("spongey dread" recurs without justification) lower the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The coded-journal premise and the reversible climate cycle offer a fresh synthesis of climate fiction and historical cipher work. The librarian protagonist and the resistance-courier ancestor add specificity. However, the "overlooked woman's bravery finally recognized" frame is a familiar template, and the story does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or lived friction. The Commander's conversion and the clean validation of Elena's work feel derivative of discovery-vindication arcs. The copper nail as talisman and the warming-approval moment are symbolic conveniences rather than bold risks.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and drives key turns: traveling to the station, decoding the journals, presenting evidence to Torres. Her idealism is embodied in her nervous confidence and her mission to honor Elena. The librarian skillset (cipher recognition, archival work) enables the plot. However, she does not face a meaningful choice that tests or costs her idealism—Torres's acceptance comes easily, and the ending grants her purpose without friction. Setup, development, and closure participation are all present, but causal pressure and visible cost are limited.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The copper nail appears in the first section (setup), recurs when Mira decodes the cycle (development), and warms in the final paragraph (closure participation). All three gates are present. However, its use is largely static—it hangs as a reminder, is touched through fabric, and warms symbolically. It does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; removing it would not break the plot. The warming at the end is a lyric reprise that reweights meaning slightly, but the element remains more ornamental than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Reversible exile" is decoded early, reframes the jet stream shift as a cycle rather than permanent change, and supplies the fourteen-month urgency that drives the ending. It shapes the dominant stake (warning populations before the reversal) and alters Mira's tactics (presenting the cycle to Torres with calculated timeline). The concept is causally active, participates in closure (the new winds "carried the promise of their own undoing"), and is irreplaceable—no near-synonym would preserve the story's logic. Strong integration across all three gates with visible cost (the reversal will be catastrophic).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Nervously confident" is asserted twice: during grant applications (backstory) and when organizing pages (ending). It colors Mira's presentation to Torres but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait is more label than dramatized friction—Mira's choices do not show the competing impulses of nervousness and confidence acting simultaneously under pressure. Setup and closure participation are present, but middle development and causal pressure are weak. The trait is swappable with "determined" or "uncertain" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Question" (Mira questions Torres's team about pressure readings) triggers the key turn: Torres arrives, sees the correlation, and shifts from skepticism to action. The action is signaled early (Mira's cipher work is described as reading/questioning), recurs in the intercom call, and drives the ending decision. However, the questioning itself is brief and mechanically successful—no resistance or complication tests Mira's ability to ask the right question. The action is essential but its execution lacks the friction that would make it fully indispensable. Strong setup, development, and closure participation with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The coded stanzas are introduced early (shipwrecked journals, Elena's cipher), drive Mira's decoding work in the middle (the "serpent swallows its tail" stanza), and supply the evidence Torres accepts at closure. The method is irreplaceable—removing the cipher would collapse the plot. However, the mechanics remain abstract; we see one decoded line but not the on-page friction of decoding under pressure or the risk of misinterpretation. Setup, development, and closure participation are all strong, with solid causal pressure and specificity, but the method is more told than tactilely shown.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The experimental weather station is present throughout, supplies the sensors and data that confirm Elena's predictions, and houses the final decision. It frames the isolation and urgency of the mission. However, the station does not constrain Mira's choices—she spreads pages, calls the intercom, and organizes without spatial friction or resource limits. The setting is more backdrop than pressure. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is weak. The station is swappable with any remote research outpost without significant structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The timeframe ("three months after the jet stream shifted") orients the story and creates the premise. The fourteen-month countdown decoded by Mira supplies urgency at closure. However, the timeframe does not tighten on-page tactics—Mira's decoding and Torres's decision happen in narrative present without a live clock that forces compression or trade-offs. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is thin. The timeframe enables the plot but does not impose felt cost or narrow options during the key beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Honoring Elena's overlooked bravery motivates Mira's journey, drives her decoding work, and charges the ending ("make them listen this time"). The motivation is dramatized through the copper nail, the exhumation memory, and Mira's throat-tightening when she recalls "No one listened." It shapes multiple beats and participates in closure. However, the motivation does not face meaningful friction—Mira's desire aligns cleanly with the plot's needs, and Torres's acceptance removes the conflict between honoring the ancestor and being heard. Strong setup, development, and closure participation with moderate cost visibility.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Spongey dread" is asserted three times (introduction, intensification during decoding, and at the end where it "shared space with something stronger"). The tone is coherent and supports the atmospheric chaos. However, it remains static rather than modulating with pressure—Mira's dread does not degrade or sharpen her perception during key beats. The tone does not constrain choices or charge the final image in a felt way; it is more atmospheric label than embodied pressure. Setup and closure participation are present, but middle development and causal pressure are weak.</comment>
