<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's characterization shows clear interior texture—the whirring quartz eye, the fog-colored ribbon, the embodied grief for her daughter—and her agency drives the climb and the teaching decision. Petra's "endearingly feisty" trait manifests in sharp dialogue and action (already perched higher, insisting they bring everything), creating a credible secondary pressure. The final choice to pass the ribbon and commit to teaching feels earned by prior causality, though the emotional progression from months of assumed loss to laughter could use one more visible friction. Minor: the grandmother-granddaughter dynamic occasionally tilts toward stock banter without deeper contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece holds a clear Causal lens: climb → discovery of journal → decision to teach, with the breach of contract and daughter's foresight motivating the archive's existence. Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to renewed commitment) with visible cost: Mira relinquishes the ribbon, foreclosing solitary mourning and accepting the deciduous cycle. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraphs. One small cost-legibility question: the "months" of grief mentioned late could have been signaled earlier to charge the laughter beat more fully.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The impossible orchard on cathedral rafters is vivid, purposeful, and constraints the climb (three hours, massive branches, Gothic arches). Micro-setting details—dust centuries thick, apple trees rooted in decay, amber light through broken rose window—are filtered through Mira's mender-eye and the climbing task. The setting charges the final image (life in impossible places) and the bird's nest reinforces theme without becoming a forced motif. Spatial choreography is clear across all moves. Does not quite reach 8.5+ because the cathedral's interior layout (rafters, beams, arches) could constrain one more mid-climb choice to deepen necessity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether mending knowledge dies or persists—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Mira opens the bag and discovers her daughter's journal, narrowing options from solitary endurance to active teaching. The climb itself functions as escalating physical pressure, and Petra's insistence that they "bring everything" seeds the reversal. Cost is visible: Mira must release her private mourning (the ribbon) and commit to teaching with no guild infrastructure. The piece edges toward 8.0+ but lacks a second pressure point between the journal discovery and the ending choice; the climb, while embodied, advances mostly through elapsed time rather than branching decisions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical renewal ("deciduous vows") emerges organically from the cathedral orchard, the guild's fall, and the daughter's hidden archive without overt statement. The final image—grandmother and granddaughter climbing into the orchard "where knowledge waited like ripening fruit"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether craft persists, reweighting the breach of contract as seasonal rather than terminal. The ribbon's color shift (blue to fog) and the bird nesting in a sideways apple tree layer thematic particulars without becoming checklist symbols. Slight hold at 8.4: the closing two paragraphs ("The vows would fall again...") risk restating the theme rather than trusting the image alone, though the lines remain poetic rather than didactic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV stays tightly bound to Mira's focalization; no head-hopping. Voice carries distinct texture: "slower than a drunk beetle," "stubborn creature," "triply cursed" feel character-specific and voice-motivated. Dialogue distinguishes Petra's sharpness from Mira's wry patience, and subtext operates cleanly ("It's just a ribbon" / "It's a promise"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority (the whirring eye, the daughter's handwriting) to wider atmospheric shots. One minor slip: "endearingly feisty" in narration reads slightly more authorial than Mira's established idiom, though it's brief. Free indirect style is clean throughout; no filter-verb stacks or tense drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, and carries high information density—most sentences advance setting, character, or theme. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and the opening/closing images anchor well. Minor scaffold detected: "Now it was the color of fog" stands alone as a beat when it could integrate into the prior sentence for tighter momentum. A few near-paraphrase adjacencies in the journal discovery section ("Instructions," "For what?" / "For teaching you") feel slightly template-like but don't obscure causality. Figurative language (leaves like green snow, fruit glowing like lanterns) is controlled and doesn't overwrite. No major loops or clarity breaks; stays comfortably in the 7.5–8.0 range but doesn't reach 8.5+ due to the small scaffold moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The orchard-in-rafters premise is fresh and the quartz-eye mender craft reads specific rather than generic fantasy-artisan. The deciduous-vows concept transforms the cyclical-knowledge trope through concrete particulars: the ribbon's color fade, the guild dissolution, the daughter's foresight. Emotional truth (grief layered with hope, teaching as continuation) avoids sentimentality. The story doesn't quite reach 8.5+ because the "lost guild knowledge rediscovered in archive" frame, while executed well, follows a familiar template; the orchard setting and quartz-eye detail provide the main originality. The ending image is strong but the closing two paragraphs risk over-articulating the cyclical theme rather than trusting the reader.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's role as quartz-eye mender is seeded early (opening line), her crystalline eye whirs during the journal read (middle), and her mender-eye training frames the teaching commitment at closure. The craft constrains her choices: she reads the journal through lens calibration expertise, recognizes Petra's "steadiness that marked true menders," and the daughter's handwriting triggers the teaching decision. Her specific knowledge (crystal cataracts, shielding) shapes the final beat. Reaches 7.8 because the mending craft is causally active across setup/development/payoff and charges the closure, though one more mid-climb beat where her eye-mending skill solves a problem (e.g., judging beam stability through the quartz lens) would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ribbon appears early (tied around Mira's wrist, faded from blue to fog), is handled and reflected upon during the journal discovery ("touched the faded hair ribbon"), and is physically passed to Petra at closure with explicit meaning shift ("It's a promise"). The color change embodies passage of time and grief, and the untying/retying enacts the generational transfer. The ribbon is irreplaceable: its specific history (daughter at seven, blue to fog) and the physical transfer action make it indispensable to the closure's felt cost. Meets all three gates with strong causal and symbolic work; the exact object could not be swapped without breaking the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Deciduous vows are introduced early ("promises that fell away each autumn only to be renewed each spring"), anchor the grandmother's misbelief that the craft would die, and are explicitly reframed at closure ("We let go, but we come back"). The concept shapes Mira's initial despair and her final acceptance of cyclical teaching. However, the vows function more as thematic lens than on-page constraint—they don't alter tactics or narrow a mid-story choice. The final articulation ("We persist") makes the concept legible but also risks telling. Scores in the 6.5–7.0 range: present across all three gates with thematic payoff, but the concept could constrain one more dramatized decision to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Endearingly feisty" is attributed to Petra early and manifests in her dialogue ("slower than a drunk beetle," "I'll respect you when you catch up") and her action (already perched higher, insisting they bring the bag). The trait enables the bag discovery (middle gate) and her final demand to start teaching (closure). However, the trait itself is labeled by narration rather than purely shown, and "feisty" could be swapped for "impatient" or "bold" without deep structural change. The cost/tradeoff is mild: her impatience accelerates decisions but doesn't visibly foreclose an option. Scores ~5.9: functional across gates with one clear beat (bag insistence) but replaceable and lacking sharp cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Persist" is seeded through the climb (three hours, pulling onto rafters, hauling higher), invoked explicitly at the journal discovery ("We persist"), and frames the closure commitment (teaching as persistence, cyclical return). The action shapes multiple beats: the physical climb structures the first half, and the decision to persist-through-teaching drives the ending. However, "persist" as an action is somewhat abstract—swapping it for "endure" or "continue" would leave most beats intact. The climb itself is necessary but could be compressed; the teaching decision is the sharper turn. Reaches 7.2: essential to the ending's meaning and present across beats, but the action's mechanics are less specific than required for 8+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The forgotten bag is introduced early ("old bag Mira had grabbed from the guild hall… nearly left it behind"), Petra insists they bring it (setup/middle), and its contents—journal, crystals, solution—directly enable the teaching decision at closure. The bag's "accidental wisdom of hoarding" is thematized but also functional: without it, no archive, no teaching. The mechanics matter: Mira dismisses it as junk, Petra overrules, the journal's discovery reweights the entire journey. The method is irreplaceable and causally central. Scores 8.3: all three gates with strong necessity, though one more micro-detail (e.g., Petra spotting the bag or Mira almost dropping it mid-climb) would deepen inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchard-on-rafters setting is established in the opening paragraph, structures the climb (beams, branches, Gothic arches), and charges the final image ("life finding purchase in impossible places"). The setting is irreplaceable: the cathedral's height and the orchard's improbability embody the deciduous-vows theme and make the physical journey a direct metaphor for knowledge persistence. Micro-setting details (apple glowing like lanterns, bird nest in sideways tree) recur and reweight at closure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting constrains every beat and is indispensable to closure. Reaches 8.7: exemplary integration with all gates and thematic/physical necessity, stopping short of 9+ only because one more tactical choice shaped by setting (e.g., choosing a route due to branch placement) would cement inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the breach of contract" anchors the timeframe early and explains the guild's dissolution, Mira's despair, and the daughter's foresight. The breach is causally necessary: without it, no crisis, no archive, no teaching urgency. However, the timeframe itself doesn't tighten decisions on the page—no live clock or countdown pressures choices. The "months" of Mira's grief appear late and don't alter tactics. The breach shapes the situation but functions as backstory rather than active temporal constraint. Scores ~6.4: setup and closure participation with causal weight, but the timeframe is static rather than escalating, and removing the breach's timing would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation to bridge generational wisdom is seeded early (Mira assumed the craft would die, Petra found the daughter's letter), drives the climb and bag discovery, and crystallizes at closure when Mira commits to teaching and passes the ribbon. The desire is dramatized through Mira's internal conflict (months of grief vs. the laugh when she discovers the journal) and through her choice to untie the ribbon with visible cost (foreclosing private mourning). The friction between want (preserve knowledge) and cost (release grief, accept cyclical impermanence) is legible. Reaches 7.9: all three gates with visible tradeoff at closure, though one more mid-story moment where teaching temptation conflicts with grief-protection would deepen the friction and push toward 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tone of "accidental wisdom" (hoarding that pays off, forgotten bag, serendipitous archive) is seeded early and modulates across the piece: Mira laughs at the absurdity, the bag is "nearly left behind," the orchard is "impossible." The tone supports the deciduous-vows theme and charges the final image (spring returns through accident and foresight). However, "accidental wisdom" as tone risks being told rather than shown in a few moments ("accidental wisdom of hoarding struck Mira"). The tone is coherent and purposeful but not indispensable—swapping it for "earned luck" or "persistent hope" would leave the structure largely intact. Scores 7.6: present across beats and ending with thematic support, but the tone's specificity is conceptual rather than irreplaceable in execution.</comment>
