<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's interior landscape is concrete and specific—her muscle-memory sequences, the parachute buckle's cold reminder, and her mother's death create a clear hierarchy of values. Internal conflict manifests well when she crosses out conclusions twice and chooses honest uncertainty over false certainty, with the buckle motif grounding the stakes in generational failure. The flattening comes when emotional processing feels slightly over-articulated ("Trust was not built through false confidence...") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. No knowledge leaps; the renunciation of certainty is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, with causal pressure tightening through Vera's repeated revision and the partial-evacuation choice. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (name, arbor, seventeen years, role). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Vera's choice to document anomalous patterns and carry doubt honestly forecloses the path of false certainty, charged by the parachute buckle moment at dawn. Cost is felt (mother's death as cautionary stake, reputational risk with Ash) and the final image—recording for future watchers—reweights the watcher's burden with undeniable pressure. One minor wobble: the dawn resolution arrives slightly fast after six hours compressed into a single sentence, creating a micro-elision that doesn't harm closure but leaves the escalation's final turn feeling summarized rather than dramatized at the peak.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor supplies a distinct spatial constraint (highest branch, cloud layer, starlight above) and the observation equipment becomes a tactile anchor for decision-making. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: the radio static, cold buckle against sternum, swaying arbor in dawn winds. The constraint test is met—Vera's perch and tools directly shape her ability to gather data and the partial-evacuation recommendation. Missing the 8+ band because the arbor itself never complicates a choice after setup; it remains a vivid stage rather than an active pressure once established.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve trust while reading unprecedented patterns) is signaled early and tightens through Vera's revision sequence. The partial-evacuation decision narrows options with visible cost: Ash's warning about panic, the risk of admitting ignorance, and the fragile trust threatened. Agency is clear—Vera's renunciation of false certainty forecloses the comfortable path her mother took. The six-hour vigil compresses into summary rather than a second on-page beat, slightly muting the escalation's final pressure point before the thermal anomalies dissipate. One meaningful tightening present; cost legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (the courage to admit limits, trust built through honest uncertainty) emerges clearly from Vera's choice and the parachute-buckle motif. The logbook documentation and "I do not know" radio moment offer concrete particulars. The wobble: the final paragraph edges toward overt statement ("Trust was not built through false confidence. It was built through...") where a purely image-based close would have trusted the reader more. The closing image—people returning home, Vera waiting—does reweight the burden without a stated moral, but the preceding lines slightly over-explain the thematic work already done.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (spectral lens, wind gauges, pressure differentials filtered through a watcher's training). Diction remains within Vera's plausible lexicon—technical but not academic, disciplined yet haunted. The radio dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Ash's pauses and Vera's sparse replies. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the revision sequence, pulling back slightly for the six-hour summary. Minor slip: "like a soundless echo, reverberating with implications she could feel but not hear" is a beautiful phrase but slightly over-explains its own effect in a way that drifts toward narrator commentary rather than Vera's percept.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and aural texture. Information density is high—most lines advance situation, character, or atmosphere. Two friction points: "After the radio static clears, she thought, I will know" reads as future-tense framing that the narrative then ignores, creating a small scaffold seam. The phrase "like a soundless echo, reverberating with implications she could feel but not hear" is figuratively strained (an echo is already sound; "soundless echo" contradicts itself and then the line repeats the concept with "could feel but not hear"). These don't obscure causality but introduce momentary opacity in high-pressure beats. No loops or template cadence; proofreading clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The watcher-in-a-tree frame is fresh and the volcanic-misdirection plot avoids obvious beats. Vera's choice to recommend partial evacuation and document uncertainty rather than guess confidently offers a non-obvious moral calculus. The nocturnal arbor piercing clouds is vivid and particular. The limiter: the mother's-parachute-failure backstory and the inherited burden feel like familiar scaffolding for "protagonist learns from predecessor's fatal mistake," and the thematic territory (honesty under pressure, limits of knowledge) is well-trodden. Transformation is present but modest—specific detail and the arbor-setting raise it above template, but the emotional arc and final wisdom ("courage to say I do not know") resolve in expected contours.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's decision to recommend partial evacuation (not confirm volcanic activity, not declare safety) creates the story's key turn. Her choice to document anomalous patterns in the logbook and unclasping the parachute buckle at dawn are active decisions with consequence. Present by paragraph two, drives the radio exchange and the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The parachute buckle appears in three beats: initial tactile anchor ("fingers resting on the parachute buckle"), mid-story reminder ("pressed cold against Vera's sternum"), and dawn closure moment ("unclasped the parachute buckle and held it toward the sunrise"). Each use reweights meaning—from inherited burden to present constraint to renunciation of false certainty. Charged reprise that shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The watcher's burden shapes Vera's dominant stake (observe, interpret, warn without lying) and directly alters her tactics—she refuses to confirm volcanic activity and chooses partial evacuation. Present in the opening explanation and returned in the logbook-documentation closure. The concept drives on-page choices with visible cost (reputational risk, Ash's resistance).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Attentively inventive" is illustrated through Vera's layering of traditional techniques with her own innovations (cross-referencing thermal signatures with atmospheric pressure, wind direction with cloud density). This enables her recognition that the patterns are anomalous, which drives the partial-evacuation decision. Present by mid-story; constrains one key choice. Label is shown more than enacted—could be stronger if a second specific innovation appeared.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Revision (crossing out first conclusion, then second; repeated recalculation over six hours; documenting anomalous patterns in the logbook) is the action that defines both the central conflict and the closure. Vera's willingness to revise rather than commit prematurely differentiates her from her mother and enacts the theme. Present in three beats, drives the ending, and would break the story's logic if swapped for a different action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Remembering through muscle memory" is signaled early ("her fingers knew the dance even when her conscious mind faltered") and enables Vera's observation sequence (adjust spectral lens, calibrate wind gauges, check pressure differentials). The method provides credibility and grounds her expertise. It does not, however, create a trade-off or complicate a later choice—it simply works. Present in one key beat; functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor above the clouds supplies spatial constraint (Vera's perch enables observation but isolates her from surface life) and atmospheric charge (starlight, swaying in winds, clouds below). The setting enables Vera's observation role and the radio communication with Ash. It pressures the stakes (distance creates interpretive responsibility) and charges the final image (waiting above the gold-and-pink clouds). Present throughout, shapes two beats and the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the radio static clears" frames the inciting beat (Ash's transmission requesting confirmation). The timeframe creates urgency—Vera must decide before the evacuation window closes—and the six-hour vigil tracks elapsed pressure. However, the clock itself never tightens a choice on the page; Vera's decision comes before the vigil, and the dawn resolution arrives without a visible deadline forcing her hand. Functional framing; mild causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve trust under pressure drives Vera's refusal to lie ("I will not lie to you about what I see"), her recommendation of partial evacuation despite Ash's warning about panic, and her logbook documentation for future watchers. The desire creates friction between comfort (certainty) and cost (admitting ignorance). Present by mid-story, drives the climax choice and closure, with visible relational and reputational stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Soundless echo" as tone appears once in the text ("like a soundless echo, reverberating with implications she could feel but not hear"). The phrase gestures toward a mood of unspoken weight and patient observation, which does cohere with the arbor setting and Vera's deliberative stance. However, the tone is not modulated across turns or charged meaningfully at the ending—it remains a single figurative moment rather than a sustained or evolving atmosphere. Present but ornamental.</comment>
