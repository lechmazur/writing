<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Celeste's motivation is clear and intensifies appropriately, though her interior work relies heavily on label-heavy terms ("retrocognitively trapped," "searing reverie") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to record testimony feels inevitable given her archival role, but the moment lacks visible cost—she carries "weight" but we don't see what she sacrifices or forecloses. The grandmother figure arrives late and her backstory is told rather than tested under pressure, reducing relational crucible work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is legible: Celeste moves from solitary decoder to bridge for silenced voices, fulfilling the archival mission with a palpable shift in responsibility. The piece infers a Causal lens by midpoint (diary → visions → coordinates → lagoon → parley) and holds it through the ending. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening paragraph (floating library, zeppelin, dunes). The final image—carrying voices that "refused to stay encrypted"—reconfigures her role with conceptual cost, though the emotional or tactical price remains abstract rather than dramatized in a concrete forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The zeppelin, dunes, and obsidian lagoon are vivid and purposeful; the lagoon's "volcanic glass" and "parley marks" constrain the final encounter and charge the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (heat-ghosts, salt-crusted pillar, black water). The micro-setting of the lagoon depression alters tactics—Celeste must descend, recognize the patterns, and meet the waiting woman—elevating the score into the 7s. Minor: the "floating library" frame is scenic but does not pressure mid-scene choices beyond transit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncover buried truth—is signaled early and tightens once via Celeste's descent and the recognition of parley marks. The grandmother's arrival reverses isolation into collaboration, and the final testimony collection narrows Celeste's options (she commits to "burn through every comfortable silence"). Cost is stated rather than shown: we don't see what Celeste risks by recording this testimony or what she loses in the act. One meaningful tightening is present; escalation under the Causal lens is functional but the price remains more conceptual than tactile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—truth encrypted in time, voices refusing silence—emerges organically from the diary, visions, and lagoon encounter without overt thesis statements. The parley-mark motif recurs purposefully and the final image ("stories trap you only so you can finally set them free") reweights prior material as a resonant answer to the central question. No heavy moralizing in the final paragraph; the thematic resonance is built from particulars (shells, driftwood, stones) rather than abstractions. Subtext operates cleanly in gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Celeste with a consistent archival-lyric register. Perceptual signature is distinct: she notices testimonies, encrypted patterns, heat-ghosts, and silence as data. Dialogue (two brief exchanges with the grandmother) is goal-driven and advances plot without filler. The prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("searing reverie," "bittersweet knowledge") that feels authorial rather than character-particular under peak pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Distance modulates appropriately with emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is mostly strong: rhythm varies, opening and closing images anchor stakes, spatial choreography is clear. Information density is high in the diary-decoding passages. Minor pattern debt: "She had been…she'd discovered…she had witnessed" clusters similar stems in the opening third, and phrases like "searing reverie" and "bittersweet knowledge" feel stock-metaphor adjacent in peak beats. No paraphrase loops, but the final paragraph's "she carried…she carried" repetition leans scaffolded. These accumulate to −0.6 in Q7 without touching closure directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The encrypted-diary-as-retrocognitive-trap premise is fresh, and the parley-mark motif (beach debris as code) offers a non-obvious historical anchor. The floating library and Saharan Reclamation Zone feel specific rather than generic. Emotional truth—archival obsession, generational witness—avoids sentimentality. The grandmother's wait and the lagoon's preservation inject mild convenience, but the synthesis (memory embedded in ink, messages in debris, truth waiting for the right decoder) feels cohesive and purposeful. Risk-taking in structure (vision interludes, dual timelines) heightens without obscuring.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Celeste decodes the diary, plots coordinates, secures zeppelin passage, climbs through the cargo hatch, and descends to the lagoon—each choice narrows options and drives a turn. Her decision to record testimony at the end forecloses comfortable archival silence and commits her to public exposure. She is present in all major beats and her archival expertise enables the central action. Swappability is low; her solemn profession and seventeen-year tenure anchor her credibility and motivation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon appears early (diary descriptions), returns physically in the descent, and its parley marks trigger the grandmother's emergence and the final testimony exchange. It constrains Celeste's path (she must find it, descend, recognize the marks) and charges the closure image as the "wound in the earth that remembered everything." The lagoon's dual role—historical site and present meeting ground—gives it causal and symbolic weight across at least three beats (vision, coordinates, encounter). Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The encrypted diary discovery is the inciting incident and shapes stakes throughout: Celeste decodes it, experiences retrocognitive visions from it, follows its coordinates, and ultimately honors its author's intent by recording testimony. The diary's cipher and Josefina's voice drive tactics (sleepless translation, pattern recognition) and the final parley fulfills its encoded purpose. The diary is causally active in at least three beats and essential to closure—without it, Celeste has no map, no vision, and no connection to the grandmother.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" enables the visions that give Celeste experiential knowledge of the lagoon and parley marks, shaping her recognition in the final scene. It constrains her agency (visions "seize her at random moments") and carries implied cost (sleepless nights, disorientation). The trait is present early, recurs in the shelving vision, and pays off when she recognizes the debris patterns. Moderate causal pressure and closure participation, though the cost remains more told than dramatized in a specific on-page choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The parley action structures both timelines: Josefina's negotiation with water-hoarders (described via vision) and Celeste's present encounter with the grandmother. The grandmother's pebble arrangement—"a circle of stones"—triggers the final testimony exchange and fulfills the diary's encoded purpose. Parley defines the stakes (negotiation over buried truth) and the resolution method. Removing this action would collapse the historical parallel and the closure's collaborative logic. Present in setup, middle vision, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Arranging beach debris as messages is seeded early (shells for surrender, driftwood for defiance, stones for parley), recurs in Celeste's visions of Josefina, and materializes physically at the lagoon when Celeste recognizes "patterns she recognized from Josefina's descriptions." The grandmother's stone circle triggers the parley. The method constrains tactics (silent negotiation under drone surveillance) and charges the final image by linking past and present resistance. Three beats: diary description, vision, physical encounter. Specificity and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The floating library frames the story and provides Celeste's archival context, but does not pressure mid-scene choices or alter tactics. The captain's "favors accumulated across years of discretion" enable the descent, which is functional but generic—any transport could serve. The zeppelin's shadow passes overhead at the end, a scenic reprise without reweighted meaning. The library's restricted section and pneumatic tube are setup details; the lagoon itself functions as the active setting that constrains the climax.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the letters are found" anchors the inciting sequence: letters surface, then the diary, then three weeks of decoding, then the zeppelin descent. The timeframe tightens pressure (Celeste has been translating for weeks, visions worsen, she acts now) and shapes her urgency. The grandmother has been "waiting" since the letters surfaced, creating a convergent clock. The frame is legible and causally functional, though the piece does not track elapsed time beat-by-beat during the lagoon encounter. Moderate causal contribution and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to uncover truth in tension is dramatized through Celeste's sleepless decoding, her defiance of the toxic-zone fence, and her final commitment to record testimony that will "burn through every comfortable silence." Friction is present: visions trap her, the truth is dangerous, and the archives have "sheltered" silence. The choice to parley with the grandmother and carry the testimony forward forecloses the safety of archival neutrality. The motivation shapes at least three beats and drives the ending with visible cost (loss of discretion, professional risk implied).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Searing reverie appears as a named attribute ("eyes holding the same searing reverie") and operates throughout: Celeste's vision-states blur past and present, the prose rhythm modulates between archival calm and desert heat-intensity, and the final image ("fierce, bittersweet knowledge") charges the closure with layered emotion. Tone is coherent across turns and intensifies during the descent and encounter. The phrase "searing reverie" itself risks abstraction, but the effect—heat, memory, urgency—is embodied in diction (obsidian, volcanic, signal fire) and supports the ending's emotional charge.</comment>
