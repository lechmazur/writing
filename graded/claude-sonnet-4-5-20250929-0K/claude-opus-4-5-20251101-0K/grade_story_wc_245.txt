<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Meridia's interiority is concrete and character-particular—her absorption of ultrasonic frequencies, her grandmother's ring humming against her skin. The stillpoint discovery drives a meaningful choice: she touches emotional neutrality and consciously rejects it, choosing to "keep feeling." Internal contradiction appears when she discovers the stillpoint isn't destination but doorway, and her renunciation is embodied through the map she creates for another while refusing return for herself. Minor deduction for the "quiet blaze" phrase appearing twice as a somewhat abstract summary rather than fully embodied sensation in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two (Meridia, forest, constellation pause). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: ultrasonic languages and musical notes build density until the stillpoint's silence reweights the premise. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—Meridia maps the stillpoint, delivers choice to the dying woman, but herself walks away choosing feeling over neutrality, with visible cost (renouncing future access to equilibrium). One meaningful deepening occurs when the clearing's silence forces her to confront what neutrality means. Cost is legible: she charts escape from feeling, then rejects it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest constrains choice throughout—Meridia must wait three years for stellar pause, must touch specific trees to absorb stories, follows musical notes only her ring can translate. The platinum ring functions as micro-setting/tool: it guides dowsing, translates frequencies, points toward truth rather than north. The clearing's absolute silence charges the closure by forcing her confrontation with emotional neutrality. Spatial choreography stays coherent (forest floor, singing pines, clearing, return path) and the constellations' pause creates genuine pressure on timing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: map the hidden stillpoint for a dying woman. Pressure accumulates through the ultrasonic trail, dowsing with the forked branch, following her mother's lullaby in new harmonies. The stillpoint encounter provides one meaningful tightening—standing in emotional neutrality, she feels nothing, then understands it's a doorway requiring choice about which feelings to carry forward. Agency is decision and renunciation: she maps it for another but refuses return, forecloses equilibrium's path with felt cost. The musical trail and ring-guided dowsing create earned escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the stillpoint as doorway rather than destination, feeling nothing as "its own kind of blindness, one far darker than the absence of light." The final image offers non-literal answer—walking back through singing pines, ring pointing toward home and "the beautiful, aching complexity of a heart that chose to keep feeling"—without stating a moral. The platinum ring and ultrasonic languages accumulate meaning across the piece. Minor deduction for "quiet blaze" appearing as somewhat abstract thematic statement rather than fully earned through scene pressure, though the phrase does recur purposefully.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtered through Meridia's synesthetic perception ("felt the tree's language seep into her skin," "heard it not with her ears but through the soles of her worn boots"). Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent—she translates vibrations the way others translate ink. Psychic distance modulates appropriately from close sensory absorption to brief reflective pulls. Minor slips: "the dialect of abandoned nests, the grammar of forgotten streams" edges toward elevated register in a peak beat, and "beautiful, aching complexity" in the final line reads slightly generic against the otherwise specific perceptual texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (establishing world, character perception, advancing plot). Minor loop appears: "The platinum compass ring" introduced in graf three, then "the platinum ring" repeated closely in graf four without added pressure. The phrase "quiet blaze" appears identically in two locations as a thematic anchor rather than evolving usage. "Frequencies" and variants recur frequently but serve the ultrasonic-language premise. Figurative language is generally controlled, though "threads through... like silver wire through cloth" and "quiet blaze" lean toward stock metaphor territory. No major clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of blind mapmaker + emotional cartography + ultrasonic forest + synesthetic perception feels purposefully integrated rather than checklist assembly. The stillpoint-as-doorway insight transforms the quest premise in hindsight. Risk-taking in the sensory mode (absorbing language through skin, translating vibrations) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Modest deduction: the emotional-territory mapping premise, while executed with specific detail here, echoes a common spec-fic template (abstractions made literal/mappable), and the "finding equilibrium only to reject it" arc follows a recognizable wisdom-quest pattern. Transformation through Meridia's synesthetic embodiment and the ultrasonic mechanics lifts it above derivative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Meridia's choices drive key turns: waiting three years for constellation pause (setup), following the dowsing and musical trail (development), and the closure choice to map the stillpoint for another while refusing personal return. Her decision to prefer "the quiet blaze" over neutrality forecloses equilibrium's path. Present across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage. Cost is visible: she renounces future access to the stillpoint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The platinum compass ring appears in setup (graf three), guides dowsing in development ("the ring never pointed north. It pointed toward truth"), translates ultrasonic notes into directional certainty, stops humming at the stillpoint, then resumes at closure pointing toward home. Handled in at least three distinct beats. It constrains navigation and charges the ending. Modest deduction: its mechanics (absorbing frequencies, converting to directional pulls) are asserted more than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hidden stillpoint shapes stakes throughout: Meridia has waited three years and commissioned to find it, the forest reveals pathways only during stellar pause, reaching it requires precise navigation. At closure it redefines the quest—not destination but doorway, not refuge but choice point. The stillpoint's silence (all frequencies cease) creates the pivotal confrontation. Its reweighting from goal to threshold with "terrifying" neutrality drives Meridia's renunciation. Essential to plot and closure; removal would collapse the arc.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Absorbing languages through skin is seeded early ("felt the tree's language seep into her skin"), used in multiple beats (touching bark to absorb stories, feeling root-system language through boot soles, "absorbing their ultrasonic farewells"), and enables the navigation. It constrains her method—she must touch to understand. Modest deduction: the trait enables but doesn't visibly cost her in a decision under pressure; we see what it allows, not what it forecloses or taxes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dowsing with the silverwood branch appears in development ("lifted a forked branch of silverwood and began to dowse"), guided by the ring, and the branch "translated her intention into motion" and "pulled leftward, trembling." It's the method by which she follows the trail. Present in setup of the search but not returned to at closure. Functional but somewhat replaceable—the ring's guidance could operate without the branch. Scored for one-beat causal work and partial middle development.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The musical-note trail is signaled in development ("a single note, high and pure... forming a trail of musical fragments"), its mechanics matter (her grandmother's ring translates into directional certainty), and it intensifies into her mother's lullaby with "new phrases, harmonies her mother had never voiced." The melody leads her to the stillpoint clearing. Present across setup (the ultrasonic frequencies), development (following the notes), and indirectly at closure (when all sound ceases, then returns). The trail shapes her attempts and success.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest pressures choices throughout: only Meridia can perceive its frequencies, she must wait for constellation pause when "stellar noise" clears, trees "grew in emotional geometries" that she reads by touch, and the clearing's total silence forces her stillpoint confrontation. The forest supplies resources (singing pines, root languages, the musical trail) and denies them (silence at the center). Setting alters tactics (touch-based navigation, timing dependence) and charges the closure when frequencies return and she walks back through farewells.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The constellation pause is seeded early ("brief cosmic pause between winter's patterns and spring's emergence... Meridia had waited three years for this exact moment") and creates genuine constraint—she can only navigate when stellar noise stops. At closure, "the stars resumed their rotation," marking the window's end. The timeframe enables the quest and bookends the action. Modest deduction: once inside the window, urgency doesn't visibly tighten her moves; we don't see her racing the closing pause or adjusting tactics as time runs out.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation to map emotional territories is declared early ("charted impossible territories for forty years... architecture of grief, topology of longing") and this commission is framed as "more than her usual cartography." Her drive is demonstrated through the three-year wait and the navigation itself. At closure, the motivation is tested and refined—she discovers equilibrium but chooses continued feeling, redefining her cartographic purpose. Friction appears between the client's need (escape to stillpoint) and Meridia's discovered preference (the ache of feeling). Told more than dramatized in moment-to-moment conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone reads as contemplative and sensory-rich throughout ("ultrasonic whispers," "absorbed stories in languages she'd never spoken aloud"), modulates at the stillpoint's "terrifying moment" of neutrality, then closes on "the beautiful, aching complexity" and "quiet blaze." The phrase "quiet blaze" appears twice, framing her purpose. Coherent but somewhat static—the "quiet" register persists even at peak pressure (the stillpoint silence), and the final image restates rather than charges the tone. Lyric consistency without dynamic modulation under stress.</comment>
