<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Seren's motivation is clear and rooted in traumatic loss, but her interior remains somewhat abstract—"consciously wild" is asserted more than embodied in concrete micro-choices. The brother's death is told efficiently but lacks the contradictory impulse that would elevate agency; her stance feels predetermined rather than tested on the page. Embodied emotion is present in "serene and patient as a glacier" anger, though the phrasing leans toward poetic summary. The final choice to pursue the nomads is logical but not dramatically costly within this scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (albino tracker, wind-carved encampment, three days post-eclipse) land early and clearly. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (ink stains, time distortion, Needle's recording) that reweight Seren's obsession without a traditional causal turn. Closure is a Charged Poise—she walks toward the canyon mouth with new understanding and renewed hunt, crystallizing her stance with the cost felt in "quiet, seething rage" and the irreversibility of her brother's death. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ink fades and reveals faces, changing her knowledge of the mechanism.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment, perpetual wind, and red sand anchor the scene with tactile specificity. Sensory details are filtered through Seren's tracker perspective (grooves in stone, ink tendrils, Needle's wing beats slowing). The encampment's impermanence and the nomads' fire circles constrain her investigation—she must track them elsewhere, a direct choice shaped by setting. The final image of wind erasing her presence charges the closure with environmental metaphor that avoids overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding time distortion to prevent future loss) is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when the ink fades, revealing faces and confirming the substance's role, which narrows her hunt to the nomad scribes. The cost is largely retrospective (brother's death) rather than immediate; Seren's decision to pursue lacks a visible on-page trade-off or loss in this scene. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening is sufficient, but the price at closure is conceptual more than felt in present action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of trauma and the compulsion to master uncontrollable forces emerges through concrete images (spilled ink, frozen traffic, stretched seconds) rather than statement. The ink as memory-holder and the wind as erasure work as motifs that constrain and charge without token recurrence. "The dead could not be saved by regret, only by understanding" edges toward thematic summary but is anchored in Seren's embodied hunt. The final image offers a resonant answer—she will not be tamed—without moralizing, though the question of mastery versus destruction remains conceptual rather than viscerally tested on this page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Seren's perceptual signature: tracker's precision, sensory focus on grooves and patterns, and the time-distortion filter. Diction is mostly controlled—"consciously wild" and "honey-thick seconds" carry distinct texture, though "serene and patient as a glacier" leans elevated for a character in crisis. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is consistent, and free indirect style is clean. The prose rhythm modulates effectively between observational calm and intensified perception during the time-stretch beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentences vary in structure and rhythm; paragraph lengths create visual flow. Information density is high in the ink-stain beat, where multiple jobs (world-building, time distortion, Seren's curse) compress cleanly. However, minor scaffold appears: "She had been searching...hunting the mechanism of her curse" paraphrases the earlier hunt description without added pressure (−0.2). "Consciously wild" recurs three times as a label without fully dramatizing its cost in action. Figurative language ("frozen lightning," "cold honey") is purposeful and clear, but "serene and patient as a glacier" in a peak anger beat reads slightly overwrought. No template cadence or major loops; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise (time distortion linked to ink and crisis) is fresh and the albino tracker with mechanical companion avoids stock framing. However, the core emotional arc—traumatized investigator hunting a phenomenon tied to sibling loss—is a familiar template, elevated here by the ink-as-memory specificity and the wind-carved impermanence setting. The ending choice (pursue the nomads) feels inevitable but not startlingly original. Risk-taking in the time-stretch beat and the textural accumulation adds distinction without full transformation of the grieving-investigator frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Seren is present throughout, frames the hunt, and makes the final decision to pursue the nomads. Her tracker skills (tracing grooves, reading ink patterns) enable investigation, and her sensitivity to time distortion is specific. However, her choices within this scene are largely observational; the decision to leave is logical continuation rather than a turn with visible cost. Two beats (examining grooves, analyzing ink) plus closure participation meet the gate, but the swappability of "tracker" with another investigator role caps higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Needle appears in three beats (hovering beside ear, recording ink, perched on shoulder at exit) and is described with specificity ("mechanical wings catching light"). Its function (recording patterns) is clear and tied to Seren's hunt. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; it observes passively. The final perched image is present but ornamental. Setup, development, and closure presence are met, but lack of causal pressure limits the score to functional-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Disappearing ink is seeded early (dark pools, scribes' work), drives the central investigation beat where Seren watches it fade and reveal faces, and directly motivates her pursuit of the nomad scribes—it changes her tactics from passive observation to active hunt. The mechanics (ink mixed with something ancient, holds fear in suspension) shape her understanding and the story's stakes. Present across all three gates with clear causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Consciously wild" appears as a label three times (title phrase, "consciously wild in her rejection," "She would not be tamed") but does not visibly constrain an on-page action with cost. It functions as thematic assertion rather than a trait that forces a trade-off. The final paragraph's "consciously wild in her rejection of the world's ordinary pace" restates the concept without dramatizing a micro-choice where wildness costs her something tangible. Present and thematically coherent, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Disappear" occurs explicitly when the ink fades ("began to disappear, fading from edges inward") and implicitly as Seren walks into the distance and the wind erases her tracks. The ink's disappearance is the scene's key turn, revealing faces and redefining her understanding. Her own disappearance into the desert charges the final image with thematic resonance. Two beats plus closure participation with causal work, though the action itself could be swapped for "vanish" or "fade" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ephemeral patterns in spilled ink are seeded early (tendrils, spirals in prior crises), form the investigation's focal object, and their mechanics (absorbing panic, warping time) drive Seren's realization and pursuit. The method is signaled, matters in the middle beat where she witnesses the fade, and motivates the ending decision. Present across all gates with clear causal pressure; the specificity of "ephemeral patterns" rather than generic "clues" strengthens irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment provides spatial anchor and impermanence motif. The grooves Seren traces and the fire circles establish nomad presence, but the setting does not constrain a tactical choice under pressure—she could examine ink anywhere. The perpetual wind charges the final image (erasing evidence) but does not alter her options within the scene. Descriptive presence across beats and thematic resonance at closure, but lacks the causal constraint that would elevate to essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Three days after the eclipse ended" anchors the opening and the final paragraph notes "where the last eclipse shadows had retreated three days ago," creating a bracket. However, the timeframe does not tighten tactics or create urgency within this scene; Seren's investigation proceeds at her own deliberate pace. The eclipse's end is context rather than a live clock. Present but functionally replaceable with any post-event marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Seren's motivation (discover why time slows in crisis) is stated explicitly, rooted in her brother's death, and drives her eleven-year hunt. It shapes her choice to examine the ink and pursue the scribes. However, it is primarily told rather than tested with friction—no on-page moment where the desire to understand conflicts with another cost. Present across all gates with clear causal linkage, but the dramatization of conflicted want versus price is thin within this scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Serene anger" is named explicitly ("Her anger rose then, serene and patient as a glacier") and the tone modulates coherently—calm observation shifts to intensified perception during time-stretch, then resolves in "quiet, seething rage." The oxymoron is sustained through diction (deliberate grace, patient hunt) and charges the final image. However, the phrasing "serene and patient as a glacier" in the anger beat leans slightly tell-y. Tone is legible and purposeful across beats and ending, meeting the essential threshold.</comment>
