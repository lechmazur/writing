<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elin's internal journey from guilt through forgiveness to action is consistently embodied through her tactile work with wax, rope, and memory. The contradictory impulses—desperate grip versus letting go—operate simultaneously in the sanctum scene, not as sequential summary. Minor slip: the brother and mother's names surface through the rope's structure rather than earned internal struggle, slightly externalizing what should be visceral reclamation. The final renunciation of bronze-casting permanence for embodied song carries visible cost and feels earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): Elin becomes "the mold and the metal both," the rope holds its new pattern, and she releases the punched card to dust—visible cost that forecloses return to her old methods. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered objects (wax model, punched card, rope, aurora) and the final cadence shift ("The aurora faded. The ice sang with names.") reweights the stake with undeniable pressure. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Elin, ice sanctum, aurora, lost wax caster). One tightening suffices: the rope reconfiguration narrows her method and the melody's emergence crystallizes the transcription.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sanctum's translucent ice walls and aurora current actively enable the rope's new function, constraining Elin's movements ("technically gentle… one wrong movement would shatter") and charging the closure when "the ice walls caught the sound and multiplied it." The rope as micro-setting (body, tool, environment compressed) shapes both middle choices and final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects her craft (tactile priority: "feeling the contours," "feeling for the give") and the aurora modulates from green/violet to "green deepening to gold" as pressure peaks. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve forgotten names through sound, not just form—is signaled early and tightens once: she shifts from reconstructing melody via instruments (failed attempt) to reconfiguring the rope, which succeeds. That pivot forecloses her reliance on bronze permanence ("she would cast again… But she would never forget that permanence required first letting go") with felt cost. The rope's reconfiguration is protagonist-driven agency; the punched card crumbles as visible price. No antagonist needed; the accumulative pressure coheres under the lens and the final sung melody reweights all prior attempts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars (lost wax process, braided rope as generational archive, punched card's burned origin) without stated moral. The ending offers a non-literal answer to "how to hold what you've lost": become the vessel, not the artifact. "Permanence required first letting go" reweights the opening's "melting away the temporary to reveal the permanent" through specific on-page action (rope reconfiguration, card to dust, humming at dawn). The auroral current and technically gentle constraint charge the closure image with layered resonance. Minor slip: "forgiving yourself became more than words" leans slightly abstract but is quickly anchored by the sanctum's physical work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds stable distance and perceptual signature: Elin notices through a caster's idiom ("contours," "give in ancient fibers," "mold and metal"). Diction remains within her artisan lexicon; no register drift. Sentence rhythm modulates purposefully—longer contemplative lines early ("As a lost wax caster, she had spent thirty years…") compress to fragments under peak pressure ("The aurora faded. The ice sang with names."). No dialogue to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean ("She understood now why the sanctum existed"). Elision of the melody itself is purposeful and legible: we experience its effect (names surface, aurora pulses) without transcription, matching the story's premise that sound transcends notation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, and premise together. Sentence openings vary and rhythm breathes with the scene. Minor scaffold appears in the grandmother exposition paragraph: "The paper was yellow and brittle, holes punched in a pattern…" followed by "Her grandmother had cranked the organ…" feels slightly list-like without immediate scene pressure. The closure paragraph's fragment cascade ("The aurora faded. The ice sang with names. And Elin, at last, remembered.") is purposeful and lands cleanly. No loops or synonym churn. One small clarity slip: "not recorded, but woven into the music itself" slightly tells what the punched card mechanism already shows.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost wax casting (impermanence as method), street organ mechanics (punched pattern as memory encoding), and rope braiding (lineage archive) feels specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms "preserving memory" from digital/archival tropes into embodied, acoustically charged labor. Emotional specificity avoids template grief: Elin's guilt over forgetting names is grounded in her thirty-year practice of "melting away the temporary." Risk-taking (aurora as energy current, rope reconfiguration as transcription method) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The technically gentle constraint and the punched card's crumbling are fresh inflections that arise from prior particulars. Transformation test passes: swap names/places and the emotional arc collapses.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elin's choices create all major turns: she travels to the sanctum (setup), decides to reconfigure the rope rather than continue failed reconstructions (middle), and opens her mouth to sing the melody (closure). Her agency drives the Accumulative/Textural escalation and the final Charged Poise. Signaled early (lost wax caster by paragraph two), present across all beats, and indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Punched card appears in three beats: carried for two decades (backstory anchor), placed at rope's base to glow under aurora current (middle), crumbles to dust at dawn (closure). Its pattern governs the rope reconfiguration ("each opening… corresponded to a position"). The crumbling marks visible cost and payoff. Slight swappability: another notational relic could substitute with moderate edits, but the street organ's acoustic history deepens the transcription premise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Transcribed memory" shapes stakes (preserve sound of names) and tactics (shift from instrument approximation to rope pattern encoding). Signaled early ("A transcribed memory… required more than notation"), tested in middle attempts, and resolved when "the rope's new configuration drew that current downward" and melody emerges. It reweights the wax-casting metaphor at closure. Moderate irreplaceability: "encoded" or "recorded" memory would function similarly but lack the mechanical specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" constrains one on-page action with cost: "one wrong movement would shatter the ice-rigid fibers; one careless touch would erase what others had entrusted." This pressure governs her slow, deliberate braiding work in the middle beat and charges the risk at closure. Signaled via the rope's four-hundred-year preservation. Moderate ceiling: the trait enables rather than creates a decision fork; removing it would lower tension but not break plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Illuminate" drives the major turn: names surface ("clear as ice-melt") when the rope's new pattern draws auroral current and "the scrap… began to glow." This realization shifts Elin from failed instrument attempts to embodied singing. Present in middle and closure beats. High specificity: the aurora-as-energy mechanism depends on illumination to justify the setting and the rope's function. Swapping to another reveal verb would require mechanical rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rope reconfiguration is signaled early (ceremonial rope described by paragraph six), occupies the entire middle beat with mechanical detail ("adjusting the next section of braid," "pattern that matched the punched card's holes"), and produces the closure: "The rope hung differently now, its new pattern set, holding the transcribed memory." Removes swappability: no other method integrates wax-casting metaphor, punched card mechanics, and lineage braiding. The method's constraints (technically gentle, aurora-powered) charge every choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sanctum supplies the aurora current (resource that enables transcription), ice walls that "caught the sound and multiplied it" (closure amplification), and four-hundred-year rope preservation (setup). Setting pressures choice via the technically gentle constraint and participates directly in closure when "the ice walls caught the sound." Micro-setting (rope, aurora, ice) tightly integrated. Slight deduction: "icebound sanctum under aurora" as labeled phrase arrives late (paragraph four); earlier cues are vivid but unnamed.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After forgiving yourself" frames the emotional starting point and is dramatized as already-occurred internal shift that "made room for something else." It enables the journey but does not tighten on-page decisions; the night's work unfolds without a forgiveness-versus-guilt friction in real time. Lyric reprise: opening "after forgiving yourself became more than words" returns at closure as "letting go—of guilt, of fear." Moderate impact: removing this timeframe would require reframing her emotional readiness but not alter the rope work or closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is signaled early ("to preserve the sound of forgotten names"), dramatized through failed attempts ("Instruments could approximate… but they could not capture the specific resonance"), and tested under pressure when she must risk the rope and become "the mold and the metal both." Internal conflict (desperate grip versus letting go) layers with the external goal. Closure directly fulfills and redefines the motivation: singing the names aloud rather than casting them in bronze. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" coheres as tone: controlled warmth over frozen grief, gradual thaw toward release. Aurora "rippled… like a memory refusing to settle" (restless), "green deepening to gold" (warming intensification), "dawn came gray and soft" (quiet resolution). Modulates with pressure and charges the final image when "the ice sang with names." The tone supports the technically gentle constraint and the shift from rigid bronze to flowing song. Slight abstraction: "snowmelt ardor" as phrase never appears on the page, requiring inference from image pattern.</comment>
