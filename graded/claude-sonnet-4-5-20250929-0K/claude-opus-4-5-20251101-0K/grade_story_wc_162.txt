<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Wren's interior world is richly textured through sensory intuition (reading wood grain "like braille"), and her seventeen-year exile establishes clear motivation. The emotional progression feels somewhat abstract—"featherly determined" is poetic but doesn't fully embody contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to step through the threshold is prepared by accumulative reflection, but the moment when her father begins searching feels convenient rather than earned by Wren's agency, softening the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered imagery (prism terrace, logbook codes, butterfly effect) and converges at the violet threshold. Orientation anchors (Wren on the drifting terrace, seventeen years post-disappearance) arrive early enough. The closure—Wren stepping through as her father simultaneously resumes searching—achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing reunion with undeniable emotional weight. One causality softness: the father's sudden turn feels synchronized by narrative will rather than motivated ellipsis, introducing a faint coincidence note at the resolution point.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prism terrace is vividly particular: "crystalline platforms refracting light into whispers," a salvaged oak bench, violet threshold. These elements actively constrain Wren's existence and charge the final crossing. Spatial choreography remains clear across the drifting journey, and sensory detail (clouds "tasted of forgotten harvests," "fractured hush") filters through Wren's perceptual priorities. The terrace functions as both setting and symbolic pressure, meeting the micro-setting gate by shaping the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Wren's search for why thresholds feel sacred and her readiness to return—is signaled early and tightens through her analysis of the logbook. The terrace stopping its drift and the threshold opening provide one meaningful deepening that reconfigures her exile into homecoming. Escalation reads as accumulative density rather than causal reversal, appropriate to the lens. However, the father's simultaneous agency feels orchestrated rather than driven by Wren's choices, slightly diluting the protagonist-driven pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete imagery: mazes as teaching tools, necessary distances as preparation, weather codes reinterpreted as prayers ("CAVOK: permission to see clearly"). The final image—stepping through with "weather codes and wooden memory"—offers a resonant answer to the sacred-threshold question without moralizing. "Featherly determined" and the butterfly effect recur with reweighted meaning. One thematic echo: "sacred spaces exist wherever someone waits and someone seeks" borders on explicit thesis but remains grounded enough in the closure action to avoid heavy penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, anchored to Wren's perceptual signature: intuiting history through wood grain, translating weather codes as prayers. Diction is consistently lyric and voice-motivated ("fractured hush," "featherly determined"), with no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between sensory immediacy and reflective depth. One register note: "She couldn't explain why his hand suddenly trembled" briefly reports the father's interiority from across impossible distance, a minor POV leak that doesn't break focalization but softens distance control at a pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with vivid specificity ("clouds that tasted of forgotten harvests," "light lied constantly"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or character. Two frictions: "necessary distances" appears in conceptual restatement across multiple paragraphs (paraphrase loop), and the phrase "fractured hush—that silence that wasn't silent but shattered into a thousand almost-sounds" over-explains its own metaphor. The closure beat remains clear, limiting penalty spread, but these artifacts prevent entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of drifting exile, maze logic, and pilot logbook weather codes as spiritual coordinates is specific and non-obvious. The butterfly-effect frame and "featherly determined" show fresh inflection. However, the lost-child-finds-way-home arc and the simultaneous parent-child reconnection follow familiar emotional templates. The piece transforms through lyric texture and the prism-terrace setting, but the resolution's synchronicity (father searches exactly when Wren steps through) leans toward conveniences common in portal-return narratives, keeping originality in the solid-but-not-exceptional range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Wren (corn maze architect's lost child) is present throughout and makes the key choice to step through the threshold at closure. Her identity shapes motivation and stakes across multiple beats (reading wood, interpreting logbook, walking toward violet edge). Setup is immediate, middle beats show her analyzing and preparing, and the ending choice is hers. The element is essential to the story's logic and closure participation is clear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pilot logbook appears early (hidden beneath the bench, retrieved "months ago"), is handled and reinterpreted in the middle beat (weather codes as prayers, CAVOK realization), and Wren clutches it against her chest at the threshold crossing. It evolves from obsession-object to talisman to spiritual cipher, with each use adding causal pressure. The logbook's reweighted meaning ("not meteorological data but prayers") directly shapes her readiness to cross. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with visible cost tied to her decision.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" is introduced early ("she understood necessary distances") and revisited at the midpoint realization ("necessary distances weren't punishments; they were preparations"). It shapes Wren's interpretation of her exile and informs her decision to stop drifting. The concept charges the thematic resolution but operates more as framing than as a constraint that narrows tactical options in scene. Solid thematic integration with closure linkage, though it remains partially abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" appears once in the middle section as Wren reads the logbook margin note and applies it to herself ("Soft and hollow-boned but relentlessly pushing against winds"), then implicitly at the ending ("featherly determined, and walked toward the violet edge"). The trait characterizes her resolve but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. It functions more as metaphorical self-description than tactical attribute. Present in two beats with thematic weight but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Intuition is Wren's primary method: she intuits truth through refracted light, reads the oak bench's history, traces the logbook's leather to sense the pilot's story, and finally intuits her father's attention "through impossible distances." The action drives her understanding at multiple beats and enables the closure realization. The story would lose coherence without this specific perceptual mode. Strong causal pressure, early signal, and closure linkage with irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Analyzing wood grain is introduced early ("run her fingers along the grain, reading it like braille") and demonstrated on the salvaged oak bench ("Each ring told her about the tree's thirst... of a pilot who had once rested against this very tree"). The method leads her to the logbook and establishes her pattern of material intuition. It appears in two distinct beats and shapes her perceptual toolkit, though the grain-reading itself does not directly constrain the threshold crossing. Solid setup and development with thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is anchored immediately ("drifted eastward through clouds," "crystalline platforms"), provides the spatial frame for all action, and stops drifting at the closure beat as a signal of transformation. Its properties (refracting light into whispers, drifting motion, violet threshold edge) directly shape Wren's exile and her final crossing. The terrace is causally active across setup, middle pressure, and ending, with its cessation marking the threshold opening. Strong integration with closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" frames the entire narrative as occurring post-disappearance (seventeen years later). The timeframe establishes Wren's long exile and the necessary distance she's endured. However, the butterfly effect itself functions more as backstory explanation than live pressure that tightens present decisions. It recurs thematically ("Always the butterfly effect") but does not create a ticking clock or constrain tactics in scene. Present in setup and thematic reflection with moderate integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Wren's desire to understand sacred thresholds is stated early ("why did some thresholds feel sacred?") and drives her obsession with the logbook and her journey to the violet edge. The motivation is tested when she declares readiness to stop drifting and steps through. However, the want is more contemplative than conflicted—there's little friction between this desire and competing costs on the page. The motivation shapes the arc and closure but lacks visible struggle or trade-off that would elevate it to high integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" is introduced midway ("fractured hush—that silence that wasn't silent but shattered") and recurs at the ending ("whispered to whatever listened in the fractured hush"). The tone of lyric suspension and layered quiet coheres through the accumulative structure and modulates appropriately as Wren moves from observation to decision. It charges the final threshold moment with atmospheric weight. Solid tone control with closure participation, though the term's over-explanation slightly dilutes its effect.</comment>
