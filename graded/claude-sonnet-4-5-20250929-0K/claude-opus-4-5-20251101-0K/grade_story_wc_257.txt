<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is specific—calloused fingers, craft as accusation—and her turn from jewelry maker to teacher is grounded in her observed vacancy reflected in others. The micro-choice to fold the first crane despite forgotten gentleness carries embodied cost. However, the swift expansion to a community of mourners summarizes rather than dramatizes her most pivotal interactions, and her final stance ("The thought no longer shattered her") feels slightly thesis-declared rather than earned through on-page friction. The ending choice to meet the new visitor shows agency, but the emotional arc from numbness to illumination compresses key beats into summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (observatory, three months post-loss, mourning jewelry maker). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: grief particulars (calloused fingers, eviction notice, empty craft) accumulate pressure until the stencil and cranes shift her stance into teaching. The closure reconfigures Elara's relationship to her daughter's memory ("The thought no longer shattered her. Instead, it illuminated everything"), and the final image of meeting a new visitor charges the pattern with visible continuity cost. Cost is legible but leans oblique—emotional reweighting rather than a decisive forfeiture. The summarized middle (clients arriving, community forming) compresses causal links that would sharpen escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory's cracked dome, timeless suspension, and brass telescope mount ground Elara's withdrawal and shape the community's formation. The stencil on vellum constrains her teaching ("traced its lines"), and the cot beneath the lens positions her physically in the timeless frame. Sensory details—dust motes, starlight pouring through damaged sections—charge the final beat without ornament. The observatory functions as micro-setting that enables her stance shift and charges the ending image of descent to meet the new visitor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Elara's recovery of agency and purpose after grief-driven collapse. The first crane ("fingers having forgotten gentleness") represents a meaningful tightening that forecloses her descent. The ending shows continuity (another mourner arrives), but the middle arc—from solitary folding to teaching a community—is summarized rather than dramatized with visible reversals or costs. The final meeting with a new visitor demonstrates endurance and stance crystallization, qualifying as Earned Stasis, but the lack of on-page friction between her wants (isolation) and costs (teaching vulnerability) keeps escalation legible yet compressed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "curtains of intention," "genuinely artificial," "withering to bloom." The stencil as blueprint for reconstruction charges the conceptual frame without overstatement. The final image—"curtains of intention parted again, letting in another sliver of light"—offers a resonant answer to the question of grief recovery without moralizing. However, the phrase "some things must be genuinely artificial before they can become genuinely real" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thesis articulation. The chrysanthemum-to-constellation motif reweights prior material effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters setting through Elara's craft expertise ("twisting silver wire around locks of the dead's hair"). Perceptual signature is specific: she sees vacancy in others because she recognizes it. Diction stays controlled—"subdued ardor," "timeless space"—and fits the established voice. The phrase "She had stopped eating, stopped sleeping, stopped answering when clients knocked" uses anaphora purposefully. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. The final paragraph's "patient knowledge" risks slight elevation but remains within lexicon. Psychic distance modulates cleanly as pressure shifts from numbness to teaching.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. "After burying her daughter three months ago, she needed somewhere that didn't measure the hours since loss" is concise and layered. Information density is high in the opening third. However, the middle section recycles "They came to her" and "She taught them" stems across multiple paragraphs, creating template cadence. "Curtains of intention" appears three times, twice in the final third, risking loop. The phrase "genuinely artificial" and its variants recur without added pressure. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats. The final image—"coordinates folded inside like a secret promise"—is vivid but leans slightly decorative. Minor scaffold present but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The observatory as timeless grief refuge and the origami-coordinates method offer fresh synthesis. "Curtains of intention" as both literal veil metaphor and actionable concept is specific. The mourning jewelry maker pivoting to teaching transforms the premise beyond generic grief-recovery templates. However, the "broken person finds purpose by helping others" frame is familiar, and the middle arc's summary treatment (clients arrive, community forms) does not fully dramatize the transformation's friction. The stencil as "blueprint for reconstruction" and "chrysanthemum becoming constellation" charge the conceptual frame, but the final promise of withering never being "the end of the story" risks stating rather than showing the thematic turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's identity as mourning jewelry maker anchors her craft expertise, her collapse (each piece "felt like an accusation"), and her return to transformed making. Her decision to fold the first crane and later teach others drives two key beats. Her descent to meet the new visitor in the final beat demonstrates continued agency. The jewelry-to-teaching pivot shapes the closure's pressure. Present early, shapes middle choice, charges ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tattoo stencil appears in paragraph four, pressed between journals. It arrests her descent ("something about its design arrested her descent into numbness") and becomes the teaching symbol ("traced its lines"). Returns in the resolution paragraph as "blueprint for reconstruction." However, it is not handled or used in dramatized beats—description and thematic claim dominate. No visible mechanical constraint or cost tied to its specific properties. Present, returns with reweighted meaning, but use remains summary rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Curtains of intention" is coined by Elara and taught to mourners. It names the veils "we draw between ourselves and continued living" and the deliberate parting that "illuminate[s] the path forward." Appears in the teaching beat and reprises in the final paragraph ("curtains of intention parted again"). However, the concept functions more as thematic label than tactical constraint—no on-page choice is visibly altered by understanding or refusing the metaphor. Present in two beats, shapes teaching stance, but does not narrow options with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Genuinely artificial" describes the stencil's lines and the idea that "healing could be genuinely artificial at first, manufactured through deliberate action until it became real." Appears again in the penultimate paragraph: "some things must be genuinely artificial before they can become genuinely real." The concept supports the theme of intentional reconstruction, but no on-page action is constrained or enabled by this trait—characters do not choose differently because something is artificial versus organic. Label-only mention; no visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Illuminate" appears as verb (starlight through dome) and metaphor. The resolution beat states, "The thought no longer shattered her. Instead, it illuminated everything." The final image references "another sliver of light." The action structures the thematic turn from darkness to light, but the verb itself is not a physical deed that alters tactics—it names the conceptual shift rather than dramatizing a distinct on-page act. Present early and late, charges closure image, but easily swappable with similar metaphors (e.g., "clarified," "revealed").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Origami cranes with coordinates inside are introduced in paragraph six, folded by Elara for the young man and the weeping woman. The method is repeated ("They simply kept folding") and returns in the final image ("clutching a paper crane, following coordinates"). The mechanics shape the community's formation and enable the recursive helping structure. Present in three beats, drives middle pressure, and charges the ending. The method is irreplaceable—removing it breaks the connection mechanism and the closure's promise of continuity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The observatory's timeless quality—"no clocks, no calendars, only the slow rotation of stars"—provides refuge that alters Elara's relationship to grief measurement. Its cracked dome lets in starlight that charges the resolution beat. The brass telescope mount, cot beneath the lens, and abandoned instruments create tactile pressure. The space enables the teaching community and shapes the final descent ("climbed the observatory stairs"). Present early, constrains middle choices (where mourners gather), and charges the ending image. Setting is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"After burying her daughter three months ago" anchors the frame. "Rock bottom had been a Tuesday" (eviction notice) sets the low point. The narrative position is post-collapse, during recovery. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no live clock or deadline pressures choices. Time functions as emotional marker rather than tactical constraint. Present early, shapes context, but does not alter tactics or narrow options with urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To teach withering to bloom again" is stated explicitly ("she would whisper to her students") and demonstrated through the locket with hair and seed. The desire drives her return to craft and teaching. However, the motivation is more declared than dramatized through conflicted choices—Elara's pivot from isolation to teaching happens off-page in summary. The friction between wanting isolation (timeless refuge) and teaching (vulnerability) is implied but not shown in a dramatized beat. Present, shapes two beats, but wants versus costs remain understated.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Subdued ardor" is stated in paragraph twelve ("The subdued ardor of their work filled the timeless space"). The tone is consistent: quiet rather than triumphant ("No one laughed loudly or proclaimed transformation complete"), with controlled emotional peaks ("The thought no longer shattered her. Instead, it illuminated everything"). Diction and rhythm support restraint—"patient knowledge," "sliver of light." The tone modulates appropriately as pressure shifts from numbness to purpose and charges the final meeting without forced uplift. Coherent through turns, charges closure image.</comment>
