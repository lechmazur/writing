<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Margaret's interiority is concrete and carries embodied tension through the scarred hands, the pillbox ritual, and her measured approach to confrontation. The final choice to carry Viktor's secrets forward is earned by the prior beats—her watching the snow patterns, her prepared extraction plans, her physical journey. Internal contradiction operates cleanly: "I don't forgive you" paired with the shoulder-touch and the decision to vouchsafe the folder. Minor slip: Viktor's sharp eyes and oxygen tubes are somewhat stock for the dying-spy archetype, and his dialogue edges toward explicating the theme rather than purely pursuing a goal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal: snow coordinates → descent → sanatorium → folder → decision to carry secrets forward. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening beat (Margaret, Zephyr Bluff, mist, spring tilting). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (acknowledgment without absolution) with visible cost: she walks out carrying "the weight of old betrayals and new purposes." One meaningful tightening occurs when Viktor reveals the folder and Margaret must choose; the cost is legible in the final image of her bearing that weight into spring. The two-day ellipsis is motivated and does not break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bluff's mist and snow patterns constrain Margaret's choices (reading codes, descending the eastern trail) and charge the opening and closing images with "silver hush." The pillbox functions as micro-setting, handled twice with shifting meaning. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Margaret's professional lens—melting patterns, rock suggestions, oxygen tubes. The sanatorium's white-on-white dissolution mirrors the thematic ambiguity. Spatial choreography is clean across the descent and the final room.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to engage Viktor's plea and carry forward intelligence that comes from her betrayer. Pressure tightens when the snow reveals "Watched. Come alone. Dawn," then deepens when Viktor offers the folder. Margaret's agency drives escalation: she prepares three extraction plans (prudently daring), makes the journey, and chooses to vouchsafe the intelligence despite withholding forgiveness. The final cost is visible—she shoulders old betrayals and new purposes—and forecloses the path of walking away or burning the folder. One meaningful reversal: her initial skepticism converted to action by Viktor's vulnerability and the folder's value.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: fixing what's broken operates through Margaret's scars, Viktor's betrayal, and her choice to carry secrets despite moral ambiguity. "Courage unused is courage lost" seeds the question and the final image answers it obliquely—courage lives in the doing, not the feeling. Subtext operates in the shoulder-touch (acknowledgment, not absolution) and the folder's weight. The piece resists moralizing: forgiveness is withheld yet the protagonist acts anyway, embracing complexity. Minor deduction: Viktor's line "That's where unused courage waits—in the doing, not the feeling" edges close to thematic articulation, though it's character-voiced and earns the moment through prior dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Margaret; perceptual signature is professional (reading codes, noting melt patterns, preparing extraction plans). Dialogue is sparse and goal-driven—Viktor's plea, Margaret's refusal of forgiveness—and carries subtext in the folder exchange. Diction remains consistent with Margaret's intelligence background. Minor deduction: "silver hush" and "mist breathed" recur enough to approach pattern without full lyric commitment, and Viktor's final speech, while earned, leans slightly toward thematic explication rather than pure character pursuit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; the opening's long, layered sentences give way to shorter beats in the sanatorium confrontation. Information density is high—scarred hands + pillbox + fire history compressed into the opening paragraph. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deductions: "Some broken things stayed broken and became beautiful in their fractures. Some needed mending. And some—the hardest category—needed to be forgiven" reads slightly scaffolded in the triadic structure, and "silver hush" appears three times, creating mild decorative echo. The final image "carrying the weight of old betrayals and new purposes, the earth tilting steadily toward spring" is strong but leans into abstract noun stacking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The snow-melt cipher is a fresh inflection on spy tradecraft, and the refusal-to-forgive-yet-act premise offers a non-obvious moral calculus. Margaret's scars and Viktor's medical-debt betrayal are specific. The burned-spy-meets-dying-handler frame is familiar, but the piece transforms it through the forgiveness/acknowledgment distinction and the "prudently daring" calculus. The "unused courage" motif risks abstraction but is anchored in concrete choices. Risk-taking is moderate—no bold structural experiments—so the score trends mid-7s rather than higher.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margaret (burned spy) drives all key turns: reading the snow codes, descending the bluff, confronting Viktor, accepting the folder. Her professional skills and scars shape perception and tactics throughout. Present in setup (scarred hands, fire history), development (descent, preparation), and payoff (folder decision). Specific cost: she shoulders betrayal and new danger. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The pillbox appears in two beats—opened at the bluff to read Viktor's message, carried "heavy in her pocket" at the sanatorium—and the engraving "Courage unused is courage lost" primes the closure choice. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development is lighter (it's mentioned but not handled). The object's meaning reweights at the end when Margaret enacts the engraving's command. Solidly functional but not indispensable; the story could convey the same arc through memory alone.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Fixing what's broken" shapes stakes directly: Viktor's plea to fix the network, Margaret's internal question about forgiving broken trust, and her choice to repair intelligence gaps despite personal fracture. The concept operates on-page in dialogue ("Some things need fixing before they break completely") and drives the folder decision. Present across setup (fire scars, broken network), development (Viktor's dying state), and payoff (vouchsafe choice). Cost is visible: she accepts the burden of old betrayals. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Prudently daring" constrains on-page action: Margaret prepares "three separate extraction plans" (prudence) while making the risky journey alone (daring). The trait is named once but demonstrated through behavior—measured risk assessment plus bold execution. Visible in middle development (descent, preparation) and implicit at closure (accepting the folder with eyes open). The label appears late and somewhat heavy-handedly, capping the score; behavior is stronger than articulation. Cost: calculated danger accepted.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" is Viktor's explicit ask ("I have something to vouchsafe") and Margaret's closure action—accepting the folder and carrying the intelligence forward. The action redefines options: she could burn it or refuse, but chooses to bear the weight. Present in development (Viktor's offer) and payoff (her exit with the folder). High causal role in the final turn. The term is slightly archaic but voice-appropriate for spy tradecraft, and the action is irreplaceable to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Codes in melting snow are signaled early (Margaret watches melt patterns for three weeks, matches them to a shared cipher) and shape her descent ("Viktor's code spelling out a warning"). Mechanics matter: the cipher points to the sanatorium and includes "Watched. Come alone. Dawn." Present in setup (snow observation), development (descent triggered by decoded coordinates), and implicit at payoff (the intelligence she now carries continues the cipher game). The method is specific and drives two beats; removing it would require a different mechanism for contact.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff in mist frames the opening and closing images ("silver hush" recurs) and the eastern trail descent is a micro-obstacle that Margaret navigates. The bluff supplies the snow-code medium and the precipice grounds her scarred-hands gesture. Setup and payoff are strong; middle development is lighter (the trail is "barely a suggestion" but doesn't block her). The mist charges the tone but doesn't create tactical pressure beyond atmosphere. Solid integration, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Spring tilting" and "accumulated snow" beginning to speak anchor the timing and create urgency for the melt-code read. The timeframe is named in the opening and closing ("earth tilting steadily toward spring") and implies a narrow window before the code vanishes. The two-day journey is noted but not used to tighten decisions on the page. Setup and payoff present; middle pressure is light. Functional but not decisive—removing the seasonal frame would weaken atmosphere more than causality.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Unused courage" is dramatized through Margaret's prior small acts (subway defense, testimony) and the closure choice to vouchsafe despite personal cost. The motivation is seeded via the pillbox engraving and tested when Viktor offers the folder. Friction between wanting safety and needing to act is visible in her "I don't forgive you" paired with the shoulder-touch and folder acceptance. Present in setup (engraving, exile history), development (journey despite risk), and payoff (doing without feeling). Cost is clear; the desire shapes the final action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Silver hush" recurs three times and the mist/softness motif modulates from contemplative opening to tense descent to quiet closure. Tone is coherent and supports the theme of ambiguous resolution without sentimentality. The hush charges the final image when Margaret walks out "into the silver hush" bearing her new burden. Present across all three segments. Not indispensable—removing the mist/silver language would thin atmosphere but not break causality—but it contributes meaningfully to the ending's resonance.</comment>
