<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marina's interiority is concrete and embodied through the tapping habit that measures loss across eleven years. Her grandmother's complicity creates genuine moral complexity without hedging, and the final choice to transmit coordinates carries visible cost ("couldn't resurrect the coral or restore her grandmother's silence into speech"). Minor weakness: the emotional progression occasionally summarizes grief rather than layering contradictory impulses in real time, and the therapy-adjacent phrasing "rationing grief like provisions" briefly flattens what is otherwise specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise/Decisive Change: Marina transmits the coordinates, making invisible wounds visible with felt cost (can't resurrect coral, can't restore grandmother's silence). Causality is tight—grandmother's journals → coordinate matching → transmission decision—and the inferred lens (Causal with Accumulative texture) holds. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two. The "periodically eternal" resurfaces at closure to reweight the premise (truth surfaces with tides), charging the final image without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The monitoring station as floating/moored object constrains Marina's physical isolation and charges the closure (she remains "moored to her task"). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: the torn atlas page's texture under fingertips, the station's sway, horizon drift. The ocean's "patient breathing" at closure integrates setting into thematic reconfiguration. Minor gap: the station's interior workspace and the mechanics of data collection remain somewhat generic; more tool-specific detail (console design, sample storage) would elevate micro-setting pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering why reefs died—is signaled early and tightens when Marina realizes poison, not just warming, caused bleaching. The revelation narrows options (she can't undo damage but can expose it) and the transmission decision carries visible cost. Agency is decision with renunciation (can't resurrect coral). One meaningful deepening occurs when dumping coordinates overlay bleaching records, reweighting eleven years of assumptions. No antagonist required; pressure coheres through accumulating evidence and moral weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: paths that "simply disappeared" because the ocean learned to avoid its wounds, the station "periodically eternal" like suppressed truth. The grandmother's guilt and Marina's grief braid into a non-obvious synthesis without moralizing. The final image—atlas page fluttering, "stories only become whole when broken open"—offers resonant reconfiguration without stating a thesis. The tapping rhythm recurs with evolving meaning (childhood silence → wave patterns → countdown to reckoning), constraining perception and charging closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is distinct (Marina notices texture, rhythm, data patterns). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("cathedrals of color into bone-white graveyards"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the coordinate-matching revelation. Minor slip: "The coral had screamed in ways only data could translate" edges toward poetic convenience rather than Marina's professional lexicon, and a few phrases ("accumulated weight, the way sediment builds into stone") feel slightly elevated for the moment's urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively and information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or discovery). The opening simile ("creature that had forgotten how to swim") and closing image (torn edge as reminder) bracket purposefully. Minor deductions: "periodically eternal" appears three times with slight redundancy; "tapping a rhythm" recurs in similar constructions without always adding pressure; and "paths disappeared" is paraphrased across adjacent paragraphs in the middle section. No severe loops, but cumulative template cadence in the tapping-rhythm beats reduces propulsion slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of environmental monitoring, family complicity, and delayed revelation feels earned rather than assembled from prompts. The twist—poison beneath warming seas—transforms the familiar climate-grief narrative through specific coordinate overlay and generational guilt. The grandmother's role as energy-company witness adds moral complexity without false balance. Risk: the accumulative structure and quiet ending heighten stakes without gimmickry. Slight deduction: the monitoring-station setup and post-ban timeframe, while specific, still echo common cli-fi templates; transformation is present but not radical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina as coral bleaching witness is causally central: her eleven years of documentation provide the data that she matches to dumping sites, driving the revelation and transmission decision. Present in setup (bleaching events documented), middle (coordinate matching), and closure (transmitting evidence). Her professional role enables the discovery and her choice alters tactics from passive observation to active exposure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The atlas page appears in setup (grandmother's marked routes), middle (Marina matches coordinates to her bleaching records), and closure (flutters under vent, "torn edge a reminder"). It enables the coordinate discovery and is handled physically ("feeling the paper's texture"). However, it could be replaced with a marked chart or annotated map without breaking story logic; the specific quality of "torn from a book" adds symbolic weight but not unique causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Delayed revelation structures the entire narrative: Marina works for eleven years believing climate alone killed reefs, then discovers dumping-site overlay. The concept shapes stakes (her grief becomes guilt by association) and tactics (from documenting to exposing). Setup seeds the mystery ("paths disappeared"), middle delivers the grandmother's journals, closure transforms understanding ("searching for the wrong answer"). Removing this exact concept would collapse the story's causal spine and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" appears three times: station funding (bursts/resurrections), grandmother's final entry ("truth is periodically eternal"), and the opening description. It charges the theme (suppressed truth resurfaces) but operates primarily as motif rather than constraint. The trait enables no specific on-page action with trade-off; it labels the recursive pattern without altering Marina's tactics. Present across beats but more thematic echo than causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Assemble" is signaled early ("trying to assemble something that refused to become whole"), drives the middle revelation (matching coordinates to bleaching records), and shapes closure (transmitting assembled evidence, "assembling truth from fragments"). The action is specific to Marina's investigative process and her choice to make fragments cohere. Swapping for "compile" or "gather" would weaken the motif of broken-then-whole but the core causality would survive, preventing a top score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tapping rhythms anchor Marina's perceptual signature from childhood (father's silences) through present (measuring wave patterns, heartbeats, data transmissions) to closure (countdown to reckoning). The practice recurs across four beats and charges her final action. However, the mechanics do not constrain her discovery or alter tactics; it functions as characterizing motif rather than method that shapes outcome. Present in setup and closure with moderate reprise effect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sea level monitoring station grounds Marina's isolation and professional access to data. It enables the coordinate matching (she has years of readings on-site) and her position to transmit globally. The floating/moored quality charges the closure metaphor. Setup and closure participation are strong, but middle development is weaker—the station's tools and spatial constraints do not visibly limit her choices during the revelation sequence. Essential for context, not quite indispensable for tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The fossil fuel ban contextualizes the station's "periodically eternal" funding and the grandmother's energy-company guilt (journals date to before the ban). It sets historical frame but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Marina's investigation unfolds over three months of journal-reading with no urgency tied to the timeframe itself. Present in setup and thematically relevant to guilt, but swappable with other regulatory turning points.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marina's desire to discover why paths disappear drives every beat: setup (watching reefs die), middle (matching coordinates reveals the true cause), closure (transmission exposes the hidden paths). The motivation is dramatized through her eleven-year persistence and conflicted when she realizes her grandmother contributed to the poison. The friction between wanting to restore versus wanting to reveal creates the final choice with visible cost. Causally indispensable and shapes the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Drifting moored" coheres across the narrative: the station floats but is anchored, Marina returns like a tide, the horizon "seemed to drift despite being fixed." Tone modulates with pressure—patient accumulation during evidence-gathering, tightening during revelation, charged stillness at closure. The paradox charges the final image (Marina "moored to her task, drifting through revelations"). Tone is consistent, purposeful, and integral to the Charged Poise ending, reaching high integration without being absolutely indispensable to plot logic.</comment>
