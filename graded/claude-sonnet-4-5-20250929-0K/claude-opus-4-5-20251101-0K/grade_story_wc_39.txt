<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus is characterized through concrete detail—his shelter, jars, methods—and his motivation is clear. However, interiority remains somewhat abstract and conceptual rather than embodied with contradictory impulses. The final gesture of "making silence speak" feels like an assertion of purpose rather than a choice under pressure with visible cost. The backstory about his grandmother and the old man occupies significant space without creating on-page friction that alters present choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the final image of footprints and "stories that nothing could wash away," but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—Marcus experiences no visible loss or foreclosed path. The music box mystery is resolved entirely in summary ("The three notes spelled a name...") rather than dramatized pressure. Orientation is clear early; the structure is single-scene reflective with minimal escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The feral loft beneath the dunes is vivid and specific, with sensory detail filtered through Marcus's POV ("smell of salt and rotting kelp"). The mason jars function as micro-setting, recurring throughout and charging the final image when he releases a captured sound. The beach environment subtly constrains action (climbing through gaps, leaving footprints the tide will erase) and supports the thematic register of transience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating the music box's meaning—is signaled early but resolved entirely off-stage through reflection rather than on-page pressure. No meaningful tightening or reversal occurs; Marcus "slowly" pieces together the code without obstacles or cost. The final decision to deliver findings and return lacks friction; no live option is foreclosed. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening moment is sufficient, but here the discovery is recounted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of bridging silence and making the dead speak emerges through concrete images (jars, music box, maritime code). However, the final paragraph edges toward direct statement: "patient work of making silence speak" and "returning it at last to where it belonged" articulate theme rather than letting the image resonate. The music box code revelation (Samuel = drowned boy = mother's grief) offers specific thematic grounding, but Marcus's epiphany about "gleaned redemption" reads as labeled rather than earned through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled with elevated diction appropriate to a poet narrator ("feral loft," "patient architecture of storms," "lonesome splendor"). Psychic distance remains stable in close third; perceptual signature is character-specific (noticing sounds, scents, the "ache of beauty"). Some phrases edge toward writerly performance ("positively wistful," "confession of a dying fisherman") but remain voice-coherent. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully with strong opening and closing images. However, several beats carry decorative density without advancing pressure: "patient architecture of storms," "translate between generations," "stories that nothing could wash away." The maritime code revelation is recounted in summary rather than shown. Minor template cadence in the middle section ("He sat up...reached for...played the tune...wrote it all down"). Information density is uneven; the backstory block summarizes rather than compresses strategically.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—capturing sounds in jars, decoding a music box—offers a fresh angle on inherited grief. The maritime code twist (Samuel as the drowned love) is specific and non-obvious. However, the vagrant-poet-as-mystic-translator leans toward familiar archetype without sharp transformation. The emotional arc (exile → purpose → wistful acceptance) follows a predictable redemption template. Specificity in the jar method and code detail elevates but does not fully escape the genre conventions of magical-realist homelessness narratives.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus is present throughout and his past choice to come to the dunes frames the story. However, his on-page actions are passive: listening, writing, deciding to deliver findings. The key discovery (decoding the music box) happens off-stage in reflection. He makes no choice under pressure that narrows options or alters tactics; the final walk to town is stated intention rather than dramatized turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The music box appears in the opening reflection, is handled and played into jars in the middle, and plays "one final time" at closure. Its mechanics matter (three notes = maritime code = Samuel), shaping the mystery and resolution. However, the decoding happens in summary rather than scene pressure, and the box does not constrain a present choice. It charges the final image but remains more thematic anchor than active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Gleaned redemption" is stated explicitly in a reflective passage ("understood now that gleaned redemption came not from grand gestures but from gathering what others discarded"). It functions as thematic claim rather than on-page stakes that alter tactics. Marcus's sense of purpose is told, not tested. The concept echoes in the ending ("patient work of making silence speak") but does not create friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Positively wistful" appears once as a label in the penultimate section: "He was positively wistful as he watched the sun crest the dunes." It describes Marcus's mood but does not constrain or enable action. No on-page choice or cost traces to this trait; it remains decorative rather than functional.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Sweeten" appears in a reflective beat: "The work seemed to sweeten the bitter edges of his exile." It describes the effect of his translating work but does not drive a turn. The metaphor recurs implicitly in "something sweeter—the lingering essence of sounds" early in the story, creating a through-line. However, no major choice or escalation hinges on this action; it colors rather than shapes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Capturing sounds in jars is signaled early, explained as inherited method from his grandmother, and shown in use (he plays the tune into jars, mingles sounds, releases a child's voice at the end). The method's mechanics matter to the mystery and appear in multiple beats. However, the actual decoding process is summarized rather than dramatized as a constrained attempt, and the jars do not impose a visible cost or limitation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The feral loft beneath the dunes is described early with sensory detail and recurs (he climbs through the gap to exit). It provides shelter and houses the jars, but does not constrain a present choice or alter tactics. The setting charges atmosphere and anchors the thematic register of transience ("leaving footprints that the tide would erase"), participating in the lyric closure but not shaping escalation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Dawn's earliest whistle" opens the story and anchors the timeline. However, time does not tighten decisions; Marcus reflects, gathers his papers, and walks to town without urgency. The dawn setting colors mood but imposes no deadline or pressure. Time is static rather than tracked.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To become the translator between generations" is stated explicitly: "He wanted to become the translator between generations, the one who could speak what the dead had left unspoken." This motivation frames his presence in the dunes and his work on the music box. However, it remains told rather than tested; no on-page friction or competing desire challenges this want. The story dramatizes the result (he succeeds) without cost or obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" appears explicitly: "There was lonesome splendor in this moment, in knowing he had bridged an impossible gap." The tone is coherent throughout—elegiac, lyric, solitary—and modulates with the final image of footprints and untranslatable gull cries. The phrase charges the ending's mood, but because tone remains static (no pressure shift), it functions more as thematic label than active pressure modulator.</comment>
