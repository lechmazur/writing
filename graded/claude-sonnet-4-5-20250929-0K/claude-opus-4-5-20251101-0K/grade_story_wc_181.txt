<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is often abstract and declarative rather than embodied under pressure. The piece tells us she is "bewildered" repeatedly but her micro-choices feel more like guided tour stops than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The grandmother remains a narrative convenience rather than a lived relationship with friction. The bathroom breakthrough and the carving decision lack visible struggle or foreclosed paths with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the orchard's pattern accumulates and the final carving gesture reweights the inheritance motif. Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, though "between the first and last page" remains opaque until the reflection explains it. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren begins carving the cameo, crystallizing her curator role, but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically paid on the page—no visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing in the final beats. One meaningful deepening occurs when she grasps nonlinear inheritance, yet the breakthrough arrives via exposition rather than scene pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The astral orchard is vividly evoked with upward-drifting silver blossoms and trees growing from black rock. The bathroom's incongruity is noted but not leveraged to constrain a choice. The pistachio shell cameo appears in Maren's hand and returns at the end to charge the closure image, crossing the 9+ gate for this category. Spatial choreography is clean and the membrane detail grounds the impossible setting with specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the inheritance and her role—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through her exploration and the bathroom realization, but no on-page reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The carving decision at the end feels inevitable rather than costly; we do not see what she gives up or what path is foreclosed. Escalation under an Accumulative lens requires a meaningful tightening or cadence shift with visible cost, and here the cost remains conceptual and offstage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear inheritance and self-created legacy emerges through specific images—the blank cameo, the orchard's retroactive ownership. The bathroom breakthrough and the carving gesture offer a non-literal answer to "Why did you leave me this?" without overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("Some inheritances... weren't meant to be understood. They were meant to be inhabited") rather than letting the image do all the work. The piece resists tidy morals and embraces temporal complexity, but the closing articulation slightly undercuts the earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren's curious, philosophical attention filters the surreal setting. Phrases like "brightened disquiet" and "simply complicated" attempt a consistent idiolect but edge toward ornamental abstraction under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. The grandmother's journal notes ("Don't ask why. Just trust the tiles.") read as a convenient voice insert rather than earned character texture. Psychic distance is controlled and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings are mostly distinct, but several beats carry decorative figurative language without clear propulsion: "a smile from someone who knew too much about your future," "knowledge that moved backward through time." The phrase "simply complicated" appears twice without added pressure. Paraphrase loops appear in the bathroom section: "The answer came... as understanding" followed immediately by restating the same nonlinear-inheritance concept. Template stems recur: "she understood" appears three times in close succession in the final third. These artifacts dull momentum and disallow 9+ globally; applying −0.6 in Q7 for template cadence and minor synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The nonlinear inheritance premise is fresh and the astral orchard setting is memorable. The pistachio shell cameo as incomplete artifact waiting for self-inscription offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis. However, the "curator of her own past/future" arc follows a fairly predictable template for time-loop/self-fulfilling stories. The bathroom-breakthrough motif is quirky but underutilized; it does not transform the arc in a way that feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth is present but the resolution into purposeful bewilderment feels slightly abstract rather than grounded in lived cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout and her choices to explore the orchard, enter the bathroom, and begin carving the cameo create key beats. However, these decisions feel guided by narrative necessity rather than embodied pressure or visible trade-offs. She is bewildered but her bewilderment does not constrain or enable a clear tactical fork. Present in setup, middle, and ending; causal pressure is weak; closure linkage is moderate. Starting at 3.0, +0.8 early signal, +0.9 for two beats, +0.5 closure linkage, −0.6 swappability (curator could be scholar/heir with minor edits), −0.4 ornamental observation in several passages = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pistachio shell cameo blank appears early in Maren's palm, is described as incomplete and waiting, and returns at the end when she begins to carve. It is handled in two distinct beats (inheritance reflection, final carving) and the final image reweights its meaning from passive heirloom to active map-making tool. Starting at 3.0, +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +1.0 closure linkage, +0.5 causal pressure (the blank's incompleteness frames her task), +0.4 specificity (pistachio shell is unusual), −0.3 summary-only in the middle (not handled on-page between appearance and ending) = 6.3, but the charged reprise in the final paragraph lifts it to 6.8 under lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance is explained in the bathroom realization ("the orchard had belonged to Maren first, passed backward to her grandmother, then forward again") and shapes the ending's stance. It constrains Maren's understanding and her role as curator across time. Present in setup (will reading), middle (bathroom breakthrough), and ending (retroactive creation of her position). Starting at 3.0, +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure linkage, +0.8 causal pressure (the concept redefines her task), −0.5 summary-only (the breakthrough is told rather than dramatized through action) = 5.7, rounded to 5.9 for strong conceptual integration despite lack of scene pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Simply complicated" appears twice as a descriptor for understanding and truth but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. It is a label-only trait that colors tone without altering tactics. Present in middle and ending but no setup signal. Starting at 3.0, +0.4 one beat, +0.3 closure adjacency (appears near the end), −0.3 label-only, −0.4 swappability (could be "elegantly paradoxical" with no plot change) = 3.0, cap at 3.8 for mid-scene label use without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Maren inquires of her reflection in the bathroom, triggering the nonlinear-inheritance realization. The action is dramatized and drives one major turn. However, it is easily swappable: she could meditate, dream, or read the journal to the same effect. Present in middle and ending (the inquiry leads to the carving decision). Starting at 3.0, +0.4 one beat, +0.7 closure linkage (the inquiry enables the final understanding), +0.6 causal pressure, −0.6 swappability, −0.4 late first appearance (bathroom section is past midpoint) = 4.7, adjusted to 5.4 for solid causal work despite replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The grandmother's note establishes the bathroom-breakthrough method early ("The breakthroughs come in bathrooms. Don't ask why. Just trust the tiles."), and Maren uses it once in the middle to achieve her key realization. The method is quirky and specific, but its mechanics are opaque—why bathrooms work is never shown, only asserted. Present in setup (journal note), middle (bathroom scene), and ending (she returns to the bathroom for her next breakthrough). Starting at 3.0, +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +0.5 closure adjacency, +0.5 causal pressure (the method enables the turn), −0.7 summary-only (the breakthrough is told, not dramatically constrained by the space), −0.4 swappability (any quiet space could serve) = 4.6, adjusted to 4.8 for consistent patterning.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The astral orchard is vividly described and provides the setting for Maren's exploration and final carving decision. Silver blossoms drifting upward, trees growing from black rock, and the membrane are specific and shape the atmosphere. The orchard does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it is a stage rather than a pressure. Present in setup, middle, and ending. Starting at 3.0, +0.8 early signal, +1.4 three beats (arrival, exploration, final carving), +0.7 closure linkage (the orchard is the site of her curatorial work), +0.6 specificity, −0.8 ornamental (postcard description without tactical pressure), −0.6 swappability (could be an enchanted library or temporal labyrinth) = 5.1, adjusted to 6.1 for strong atmospheric integration and ending presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Between the first and last page" is introduced in the second paragraph and explained in the bathroom realization as the orchard's temporal frame. It recurs in the final section ("exist here... forever—or at least between the first and last page"). The timeframe is conceptual rather than a ticking clock; it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. Present in setup, middle, and ending. Starting at 3.0, +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +0.5 closure linkage, +0.4 specificity (unique phrase), −0.7 ornamental (vague and untracked, no live pressure) = 3.9, adjusted to 4.9 for thematic coherence despite lack of tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Maren's desire to pursue forbidden knowledge is stated early ("the forbidden knowledge she'd been chasing since childhood") and drives her bathroom inquiry and final understanding. The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices or visible costs. Present in setup, middle (bathroom realization), and ending (her sacred duty). Starting at 3.0, +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +0.6 closure linkage, +0.6 causal pressure (the desire frames her task), −0.5 told-only (no on-page friction between want and cost), −0.3 label-only in several passages = 5.1, adjusted to 5.6 for consistent presence and thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Brightened disquiet" appears three times, framing Maren's emotional state from arrival to the final line. The tone is coherent and modulates slightly as she moves from bewilderment to purposeful acceptance. It charges the final image ("smiled at the brightened disquiet humming in her bones"). Present in setup, middle, and ending. Starting at 3.0, +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +0.9 closure linkage (the phrase anchors the final line), +0.5 specificity (unusual formulation), −0.6 static mood (little modulation under pressure), −0.3 label-only in middle passages = 5.2.</comment>
