<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and driven by consistent motivation (wavelength alignment), but internal conflict remains largely abstract—"stellar doubt" is named more than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The coin-casting micro-choices shape present stance, yet the final acceptance of dissolution reads more as philosophical resolution than a decision that forecloses a live option with visible emotional cost. Embodied emotion is present ("quietly enthusiastic," the small smile) but stays muted throughout, never escalating into genuine struggle that would earn the transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and pattern build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where the coins landing on edge and the amber glow crystallize alignment with undeniable pressure. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the first paragraph. The closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (accepting un-happening as becoming), though the felt price remains oblique—dissolution is embraced rather than resisted, so the path foreclosed is implicit. One meaningful deepening occurs through the three coin-casting beats that shift from alignment-reading to certainty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (the amber begins to glow), satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (crystalline resin catching starlight, blue-shifting stars, amber-smooth navigation table) and filtered through Mira's professional lens as a cast lots decision maker. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the single-location scene, and the setting's preservation motif reweights at closure from protection-against-time to witness-to-reversal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (achieving wavelength alignment) is signaled early and remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs: the three casting sequences progress from reading alignment to translating backwards prophecy to final certainty when coins land on edge. However, the escalation lacks a visible tradeoff or cost that narrows options—Mira's doubt evaporates rather than being overcome through sacrifice. The resolution is driven by cosmic convergence (coins landing impossibly, amber glowing) rather than protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (accepting dissolution as transformation, un-happening as becoming) emerges organically from the backwards-prophecy conceit and the coin-casting pattern without overt statement. The final image ("let the universe remember her into being") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the premise. Subtext operates effectively in the reversal structures (endings before beginnings, futures folding into pasts) and the motif progression (foreign coins from collapsed worlds → spiral arrangement → edge-standing impossibility). One mild abstraction: "wavelength align with purpose" occasionally reads as label rather than lived experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (Mira notices cosmic signals, coin patterns, stellar behavior through her diviner's lens). Diction remains controlled with purposeful compression ("ambered," "un-becoming," "distill meaning from static") that feels voice-motivated rather than ornamental. The narrative stance modulates appropriately from technical observation to quiet enthusiasm to acceptance. One minor slip: "stellar doubt" and "quietly enthusiastic" occasionally read as authorial labels imposed on interiority rather than emerging from Mira's own thought patterns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic resonance. Minor scaffold present: "The backwards prophecy had found her" and "The backwards prophecy promised this" function as near-synonym anchors; "cast lots decision maker" and "chance-divination" restate the same concept adjacently in paragraph three. Figurative language ("ambered," "cosmic inhalation," coins as "threads of collapsed possibility") is dense but coherent and serves the Accumulative design. No loops touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The contracting-universe premise offers a fresh synthesis, and the backwards-transmission conceit (signals arriving endings-first) provides a non-obvious angle on cosmic-scale dissolution narratives. Emotional specificity elevates familiar acceptance-of-mortality material through the coin-divination particulars and the ambered-observatory micro-setting. The "cast lots decision maker" occupation and the foreign-coins-from-folded-worlds detail anchor universals in specificity. Risk-taking is moderate: the structure commits fully to its premise but opts for a relatively serene resolution rather than complicating Mira's acceptance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira as "cast lots decision maker" is signaled in the opening third, drives all three coin-casting beats (which narrow her understanding and lead to final certainty), and shapes the closure image where her decision to align crystallizes. Her choices create the key turns: reading alignment → translating prophecy → accepting dissolution. The occupation's specific mechanics (reading fallen coins as divination) constrain her method and charge the ending when coins land impossibly on edge.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Foreign coins appear in setup (opening paragraphs), development (three distinct casting beats with tetradrachm, hexagonal credit, Old Earth copper), and payoff (final casting where all land on edge). They constrain Mira's divination method, carry thematic weight (collapsed civilizations/possibility threads), and their impossible final configuration enables the closure moment. Each coin type is specified, and the spiral arrangement explicitly mirrors galaxy collapse. The exact currencies matter less than the collection's function, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Backwards prophecy is introduced early, shapes Mira's central task (remembering futures that will un-happen), and manifests on-page when she reverses the static transmission. It alters her stance from uncertainty to acceptance and is present at closure ("The backwards prophecy had always been about this"). However, its mechanics remain abstract—it functions more as thematic frame than as a constraint that narrows tactical options in the casting scenes. One strong reprise but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Quietly enthusiastic" is mentioned twice (after the first casting, then again near the end when she "fully allows herself the emotion"), but it remains label-only description rather than constraining action. No visible tradeoff or cost is tied to this trait; her enthusiasm is permission she grants herself rather than a stance that forecloses an alternative path. The attribute colors tone but does not shape a key choice or alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Distill" appears as explicit action twice: "distill meaning from static" (early declaration) and "distilled a lifetime of doubt into one moment of certainty" (near closure). The verb frames her interpretive task and the final transformation, but the major turns trace more directly to coin-casting and signal-translation than to distillation per se. Swappable with "extract," "derive," or "parse" without structural loss, though the closure reprise adds some resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Understanding static bursts" is signaled early (Mira has "spent decades understanding static bursts"), shapes the middle beat where she filters and reverses the transmission, and contributes to closure by resolving noise into clear tone. The method matters: without it, she cannot translate the backwards message. However, the mechanics remain generic—filtering and reversing—rather than offering specific technical constraints that alter her approach across attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck is introduced in the opening line, provides the amber-smooth navigation table for coin-casting, and charges the closure image when "the amber began to glow." Its preservation motif reweights from protection to witness. The setting supplies both the physical surface for divination and the conceptual container (preservation in crystalline resin) that mirrors Mira's transformation. The exact setting (observatory vs. any isolated station) shapes tone and thematic resonance meaningfully.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The contracting-universe timeframe is established early and grounds all world-logic (blue-shifting stars, backwards signals, collapsing reality). It provides the premise for Mira's task and the stakes (annihilation vs. transformation). However, it does not function as a ticking clock that alters her tactics beat-to-beat; the contraction is ambient pressure rather than a deadline forcing specific choices. Present in closure as the observatory contracts, but the temporal urgency remains implicit.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to wavelength align with purpose" is named explicitly mid-story and implicit in her coin-casting persistence. It drives her continued work at the station and her acceptance of dissolution at closure. The desire is dramatized through the three casting attempts and the final alignment when her frequency matches the universe's. Mild friction between desire and doubt is present ("stellar doubt crept in"), but the conflict resolves smoothly rather than imposing a visible cost or trade-off that forecloses an alternative path.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Stellar doubt" is named once mid-story ("Stellar doubt crept into her thoughts, as it always did") and manifests in her questioning whether she reads signals correctly. The tone modulates from technical observation to doubt to quiet acceptance, supporting the Accumulative design. However, doubt functions more as momentary acknowledgment than sustained pressure that complicates her choices. The tone is coherent and charges the final image (certainty replacing doubt), but the emotional stakes of that shift remain muted.</comment>
