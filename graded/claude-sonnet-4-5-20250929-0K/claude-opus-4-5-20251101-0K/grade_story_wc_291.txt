<question>1</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Clara's prosopagnosia is efficiently integrated into her methodology, but her interiority reads more like procedure than lived contradiction. The final "methodical care" passage tells empathy rather than embodying it through micro-choices under pressure. No visible cost attends her revelation about Marcus—she climbs away unchanged, which undercuts the character arc the text claims.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (Clara, quarry, morning). The structure follows a single-scene investigation leading to Clara's sketch revelation, fitting the accumulative lens. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing ("not closure, but witness"), but the cost remains abstract—Clara experiences no foreclosed path or tangible sacrifice on the page. The lens holds, but the ending asserts thematic weight without dramatizing a before/after shift in Clara's options or stance.</comment>

<comment>The flooded quarry and mist are vividly rendered and consistently present. The ribbon fragment and black water serve as anchors. However, the setting functions mostly as backdrop; it does not materially constrain Clara's choices or alter her investigative path. Spatial choreography (descent, sketching spot, ascent) is clear but passive.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—solving Elena's disappearance—is signaled early and pursued methodically. Yet the story lacks on-page escalation: Clara reviews photos, draws a sketch, and deduces the answer without encountering resistance, error, or a tightening choice. No reversal or cost attends her discovery; Marcus is long beyond legal reach, and Clara's tactics never shift. The promised "empathy" motivation does not generate friction or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The theme of bearing witness versus achieving justice emerges clearly through image and action. The final "witness" claim is non-literal and apt. However, "to awaken dormant empathy" is stated rather than dramatized—Clara's process shows no internal conflict about empathy, and the ending asserts her purpose without showing a reweighting of her stance. The ribbon and mask motifs recur but do not deepen thematically.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>POV is stable third-limited on Clara; perceptual signature (counting stones, mapping geometry) is specific and consistent. Diction remains controlled and voice-apt throughout. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived. The narrative certainty matches Clara's knowledge cleanly, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally clean and purposeful. Minor template cadence in the middle third ("She drew… She sketched… She understood…") and one paraphrase loop ("not closure, but witness" echoes "truth becomes a matter of architecture" without added pressure) reduce momentum slightly. The "lance-sharp" simile is vivid but isolated; no figurative muddle or heavy artifact debt touches the closure beat. Sentence variety and rhythm are competent.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—face-blind portrait artist solving cold cases—offers a fresh synthesis of concept and character. However, the execution follows a procedural template: detective assigns case, protagonist reviews evidence, deduces answer, reflects on meaning. The "unifying opposites" method and Marcus revelation are clever but arrive without complication or risk. The ending retreats to a safe middle (justice impossible, memory preserved) rather than pressing the premise's implications.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Clara's face blindness shapes her entire investigative method (geometry mapping, bone structure analysis) and drives the key turn—recognizing that two witness descriptions map to one person. Her condition is established early, constrains her process across multiple beats, and enables the solution. The trait is specific and irreplaceable; swapping it for generic "keen observation" would break the logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>The ribbon fragment is introduced early (Morrison gives it to her) and handled twice on the page (unfolding it, keeping it in her pocket at the end). It confirms the mask color match to Elena's costume, contributing to the solution. However, it does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning—it functions as confirmatory evidence rather than a catalyst. Its presence in the final paragraph is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The cold-case frame establishes the core stake (a 30-year-old unsolved disappearance) and shapes Clara's work throughout. The timeframe eliminates legal justice, narrowing her goal to witness and memory. The concept appears in the opening, drives the investigation beats, and anchors the thematic resolution. Morrison's assignment and the expired statute of limitations are causally active.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>"Very methodical" is signaled early ("process was very methodical, almost surgical") and demonstrated in Clara's counting stones, cataloging bone structure, and sixteen hours of photo study. The trait enables her breakthrough (systematic comparison of photos) and appears in the closure paragraph ("methodical care"). However, no visible cost or tradeoff attends the trait—it functions as pure advantage without friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>3.2</grade>
<comment>"Lance" appears once as a simile ("her pencil lance-sharp") during the sketching beat. The metaphor is vivid but does not recur or drive a turn. The action it describes (sketching with precision) is central, but "lance" itself is ornamental and easily swappable with "razor," "scalpel," or any sharp implement. No structural dependence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>"Unifying opposites" is seeded in Clara's approach (mapping geometry where others see identity) and explicitly named at the key turn: she realizes "cruel smile and kind eyes belonged to the same face." The method is signaled, demonstrated, and yields the breakthrough. However, it appears cleanly in one beat without complication or cost; Clara applies it successfully on the first try, reducing its structural weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>The quarry is established early (silent for thirty years, granite walls, flooded pit, mist) and frames the entire scene. The setting provides atmosphere and historical context (masquerade ball location). The "furrowed hush" recurs and the mist lifts at the end, creating a lyric bracket. However, the quarry does not constrain Clara's choices—she could have conducted the investigation anywhere. The eastern ledge blood detail is mentioned but not used.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>"After the evidence disappears" is quoted directly as Clara's notebook axiom and governs the story's stakes: thirty years elapsed, rain and time erased physical evidence, statute of limitations expired. The timeframe is established in paragraph two, shapes Clara's methods (relying on photographs and witness accounts), and narrows the closure to memory rather than prosecution. The constraint is causally active across beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The motivation "to awaken dormant empathy" is stated explicitly in the reflection: "To awaken dormant empathy—that was the purpose of looking backward into cold violence." It frames Morrison's assignments and Clara's final act of reconstructing Elena's portrait. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. Clara experiences no struggle between empathy and detachment; the trait functions as a thematic claim without friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>"Furrowed hush" is introduced early ("that familiar furrowed hush settling over everything like a held breath") and returns in the final paragraph ("perpetual furrowed hush"). The tone—quiet, meditative, restrained—remains coherent throughout and modulates appropriately with Clara's focused investigation and reflective closure. The phrase is specific and atmospheric, charging the opening and ending. No tonal breaks occur under pressure.</comment>
