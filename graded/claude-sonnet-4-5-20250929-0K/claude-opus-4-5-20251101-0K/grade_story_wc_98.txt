<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Yara's interiority is character-particular and embodied throughout ("doubt glowed within her like phosphorescence"), with genuine contradictions between her empirical training and emergent trust in dream-interpretation. The shift from skepticism to planting the seed is earned through the vision sequence that reframes her role. Minor deduction: the grandmother's sudden muteness feels convenient rather than causally integrated, and the final paragraph's "luminous doubt" risks abstraction though it remains anchored in her seventeen-year arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by paragraph two (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered reflection on memory-preservation, the seed's properties, and the approaching monsoon, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where Yara's planting and acceptance of uncertainty reweights her role with felt cost—she abandons verification as her mission. The cost is legible: "something in her that she had spent seventeen years trying to verify into silence." One meaningful deepening through the dream-vision that changes her stance suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ancient ridge is vivid and specific ("purple starflowers cascaded down limestone terraces," "golden ferns unfurled"), filtering through Yara's trained eye ("empirically whimsical"). Micro-setting via the seed and soil anchor tactile engagement. The ridge's impossible botanical contradictions mirror the thematic tension and the monsoon's arrival pressures her window. Minor gap: while evocative, the ridge does not constrain a tactical choice as sharply as it might—she plants anywhere on the ridge without spatial consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve collective memory via the seed) is signaled early and sustained. The approaching monsoon provides a live deadline. One meaningful tightening occurs when Yara shifts from empirical analysis (university test, "mundane" results) to dream-interpretation, narrowing her options and forcing a trade-off between her professional skepticism and cultural inheritance. The cost is visible: accepting uncertainty after seventeen years of reality-checking. Lacks a second on-page reversal or complication that would elevate pressure further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (the shape of caring vs. verifiable fact, meaning vs. truth) emerges organically through Yara's occupation, the seed's scientific banality contrasted with its cultural weight, and the ridge's "empirically whimsical" blooms. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "protect the space where her people could keep asking" reweights her role from arbiter to guardian of uncertainty. The final image of the monsoon "waken[ing] something" she had tried to silence delivers thematic closure with lyric specificity. No overt thesis statements mar the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and stable, blending Yara's analytical precision with emergent lyricism ("doubt glowed within her like phosphorescence," "empirically whimsical"). Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices soil dampness, categorizes botanical contradictions, measures erosion. Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: "the shape of caring itself, the pattern of attention" in the vision risks elevated abstraction slightly outside her established diction, though it reads as epiphanic register shift rather than voice break. No dialogue present; single-POV focalization is tight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied syntax and high information density. Figurative language ("doubt glowed within her like phosphorescence") is purposeful and grounded. Minor deductions: "empirically whimsical" recurs three times, bordering on motif overuse without full pattern payoff; "luminous doubt, that particular brightness" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward synonym churn. The phrase "gloriously uncertain, remembering everything in its own patient language" stacks modifiers without sharp propulsion. No major loops or scaffold, but these small artifacts prevent high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of reality-checker protagonist with collective-memory stakes and dream-interpretation offers a fresh angle on cultural-preservation narratives. "Empirically whimsical" as both descriptor and thematic axis is memorable. The ridge's botanical impossibilities and Yara's professional doubt create organic tension. Minor limitation: the grandmother's deathbed seed-passing and approaching-monsoon frame are familiar genre moves; the piece executes them well but does not fully transform them. The ending's embrace of uncertainty feels earned rather than boldly risky.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Yara as reality checker is signaled early (paragraph one) and her professional skepticism drives her resistance to dream-interpretation, creating the central tension. Her decision to plant the seed via the old method (paragraphs starting "She pressed the seed") is the story's pivotal choice, altering her stance from verification to guardianship. Her role reframes at closure ("protect the space where her people could keep asking"). Present in setup, middle conflict (resisting the method), and closure (accepting her reframed role). High causal pressure and irreplaceability: remove the reality-checker trait and the tension between empiricism and cultural memory collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The seed appears in beat one (grandmother's gift), middle beats (examination, university analysis, pressing to forehead, planting), and is causally active at closure (half-buried, "would either grow or it wouldn't"). It shifts from mundane object to cultural vessel through the dream-vision, reweighting its meaning. Early signal, multiple touches, closure linkage, and cost connection (planting it forecloses retrieval and verification). Minor gap: the seed's physical transformation on the page is minimal—Yara "didn't remember planting it" elides the dramatized act slightly, reducing embodied presence at the peak moment.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Collective memory is signaled early ("last fragment of collective memory") and frames Yara's stake throughout. It shapes her occupation (cataloging what people "actually remembered versus what they claimed"), motivates the grandmother's bequest, and reconfigures at closure when Yara sees memory as "the shape of caring itself" rather than archivable facts. Present in setup, thematic pressure (young ones leaving, "erosion of meaning"), and closure reframing. Solid causal role, though it functions more as thematic pressure than a tactical constraint that narrows on-page choices in real time.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Empirically whimsical" is introduced early as descriptor for the ridge's contradictory flora and recurs as Yara's internal tension label. It charges the final image ("empirically whimsical, gloriously uncertain"). However, it operates more as atmospheric/thematic label than a trait that visibly constrains a choice with cost. The attribute colors perception but does not create a clear either/or tactical decision on the page. Present in setup and closure reprise (lyric track), but lacks middle-beat action where the attribute forces a visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Waken" appears as verb choice in the final line ("let it waken something in her") and frames the seed's potential ("tried to waken the seed's secrets"). The action is signaled and its success/failure is the story's open question. It drives the grandmother's instruction implicitly (plant to waken memory) and Yara's shift from analysis to ritual. Present in setup (implied instruction), middle (failed attempts), and closure (acceptance of wakening as process). Solid integration, though the action itself is more metaphorical than physically dramatized—Yara does not perform a distinct "wakening" ritual on the page beyond pressing the seed to her forehead.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interpreted dreams are named early as "another method" the grandmother taught, and Yara executes the method on the page (pressing seed to forehead, sinking "into a space between sleeping and waking," vision of generational seed-passing). The method enables the turning insight that "collective memory wasn't facts" and precipitates the planting. Present in setup (dismissed as mythology), middle (executed), and implicit in closure (the shift it caused). Deduction: the mechanics are compressed—how the method works remains vague, and Yara's prior dismissal of it as "cultural mythology" undercuts its necessity (why does it work now when empirical methods didn't?).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient ridge is introduced in paragraph one and sustained: its bloom state signals urgency ("as if the mountain itself knew these might be its last dry days"), its soil accepts the seed, and it "bloomed on around her" at closure. The ridge's "impossible gardens" mirror Yara's reconciliation of contradiction. Present in setup, atmospheric middle pressure (flowering despite logic), and closure image. Solid spatial anchor and thematic resonance. Minor gap: the ridge does not tactically constrain her choice—she could plant elsewhere; it functions more as charged backdrop than active environmental constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The monsoon timeframe is signaled in paragraph one ("storm clouds gathered," "monsoon was coming"), tightened in paragraph eight ("perhaps hours away now"), and arrives at closure as Yara plants and "the first drops fell." The deadline pressures her window to act and makes the seed's survival uncertain. Present in setup, middle escalation (clock ticking), and closure (rain arrives as she finishes). Strong causal role: the timeframe forces her to choose the untested method rather than wait for more analysis. The live clock narrows her options and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Yara's motivation to protect cultural memory is established early (her role as reality checker, grandmother's seed, "last fragment of collective memory") and dramatized through her seventeen-year career, her documentation work, and her internal conflict between verification and preservation. The friction between protecting memory and her empirical skepticism is the story's engine. Present in setup, tested in middle (university analysis vs. dream method), and reframed at closure ("protect the space where her people could keep asking"). High specificity and cost: she sacrifices professional certainty. Slightly label-heavy in places ("protect the space") but mostly enacted through choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Luminous doubt" is named explicitly late (paragraph nine: "doubt glowed within her like phosphorescence, beautiful and uncertain") and recurs in the penultimate paragraph. The tone is coherent throughout: Yara's questioning stance, the ridge's "empirically whimsical" blooms, the seed's unverified promise, and the ending's embrace of uncertainty. The tone modulates from analytical detachment (early paragraphs) to emergent wonder (dream-vision) to acceptance (closure). Strong thematic charge. Deduction: labeling the tone explicitly ("luminous doubt, that particular brightness") in late paragraphs reduces subtlety; the effect would be stronger if enacted without naming.</comment>
