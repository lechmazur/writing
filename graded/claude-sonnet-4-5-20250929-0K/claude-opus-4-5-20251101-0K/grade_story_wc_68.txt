<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to preserve artifacts is consistent and his philosophical contradictions are stated clearly. However, his interior life relies heavily on abstract philosophizing rather than embodied, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "agonizing" is told more than shown through micro-choices with visible cost. His reflection on competing narratives reads more like essay than character-particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (cataloging artifacts through sedimentary layers). Orientation anchors are clear early. The closure—sealing the cog and carving the forbidden date—offers a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: preservation as rebellion), but the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The piece accumulates texture through layers and objects, yet the final image doesn't decisively reweight prior material; it restates the established pattern without a meaningful cadence shift or deepening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sedimentary layers, sewer tunnels, and sunken ruins create a vivid vertical geography that constrains Marcus's movements and supplies his archive. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through his philosophical lens. The chronometer cog and other artifacts function as micro-setting elements that charge his mission, and the spatial descent/ascent pattern supports the thematic layers. The setting meaningfully shapes his choices and isolation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving ancient methods before erasure—is clear early. However, pressure remains static; Marcus faces no on-page opposition or complication that forces a trade-off or narrows his options. The New Covenant survivors chant above but never threaten him directly. The descent, cataloging, and sealing unfold without reversal or tightening. One meaningful escalation or on-page cost that forecloses a path is missing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of competing narratives and the limits of certainty emerges organically from the sedimentary layers and artifacts. The chronometer cog and other objects carry distinct epistemologies without heavy-handed exposition. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("preservation itself was a form of rebellion") rather than letting the image speak. The piece invites reflection on historical erasure and narrative certainty, but the ending doesn't offer a non-literal answer—it restates the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent philosophical register. Marcus's perceptual signature—seeing artifacts as narratives—is clear and voice-motivated. The prose occasionally drifts toward essay diction ("empirical navigation," "final arbiter of truth") that feels more authorial than character-particular under pressure. Psychic distance is controlled, though the abstract register can flatten immediacy in key beats. No dialogue present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clarity is generally strong, and spatial choreography through the tunnels is coherent. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "competing narratives" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure; "agonize" and its synonyms recur; the final three paragraphs repeat the preservation-as-rebellion idea. Template cadence in places: "He [verb]" stems in the descent sequence. Figurative language is spare and functional, but information density dips in reflective passages that rehash prior points.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The sedimentary-layers conceit offers a fresh spatial metaphor for epistemological strata, and the post-plague archivist angle transforms the survivalist trope. However, the "lone philosopher preserving knowledge against zealots" premise is familiar, and the piece doesn't fully transform it through unexpected character choices or moral calculus. The ending confirms rather than reweights the opening stance. No significant risk-taking in structure or closure effect; the arc is linear and predictable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus is present throughout and his archival decisions drive the sequence. However, his choices (descend, catalog, seal, ascend) are unopposed and don't create reversals or visible trade-offs. Setup early, involved in beats, shapes ending, but lacks the causal pressure or cost that would elevate the score. His philosopher identity is more label than engine of conflicted action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The chronometer cog appears in multiple beats: examined early, discussed for its narrative meaning, sealed in the cache, and referenced at closure. It anchors the theme of empirical methods. However, its use remains largely symbolic—Marcus holds it, talks to it, stores it—without the object's specific properties (worn teeth, verdigris) constraining a choice or altering tactics. Reprise at closure is present but doesn't reweight prior material decisively.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Competing narratives (chronometer empiricism vs. religious texts vs. astronomical symbols) structure the thematic exploration and Marcus's preservation mission. The concept shapes his motivation and the story's intellectual stakes. It's signaled early, developed through artifact examples, and frames the ending. However, it doesn't alter on-page options or force a tactical choice—Marcus's response (preserve everything) is consistent throughout without friction or reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Rationally rebellious" is mentioned in the exposition but not dramatized through on-page action. Marcus questions everything (rational) and defies the New Covenant by using the old calendar (rebellious), yet no scene shows these traits constraining a choice or creating a visible cost. The attribute remains label-level without embodied trade-offs. Present and somewhat functional, but swappable with "thoughtful contrarian" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Agonize" appears explicitly ("agonized over these competing narratives") and implicitly in his reflective passages. It colors his stance but doesn't drive major turns—his choices proceed methodically without the agonizing altering tactics or creating a reversal. The action is more emotional backdrop than plot engine. Removing it would flatten tone but wouldn't break the story's logic or closure. Present in beats, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sedimentary layers are signaled early, structure the spatial world (Old Quarter, middle ruins, deepest harbor city), and organize the thematic conceit (each stratum = a civilization's truth). Marcus's descent through layers shapes his archival method and the discovery sequence. The layers constrain his movements and supply the artifacts. Mechanics matter: he follows drainage channels, seals caches in specific strata. Essential across beats and directly shapes the ending's vertical geography.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken city ruins anchor the story's spatial logic, supply the artifacts, and enable Marcus's isolation from the survivors. The ruins' vertical structure (surface sewers to deepest chambers) organizes his descent and preservation work. They constrain his choices (where to search, where to hide caches) and charge the ending (sealing artifacts in primordial stone). Setup early, involved in all major beats, and essential to closure. Removing the ruins would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The post-plague timeframe establishes the survivors' zealotry and Marcus's isolation. "Three years ago" anchors the backstory, and "after the plague ends" frames the new narrative war. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten present decisions—no clock pressures Marcus's archival work, and the New Covenant's threat remains off-page and static. Present and functional, shaping context, but not a live constraint that alters tactics or escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus's desire to preserve ancient methods is stated early, dramatized through his artifact handling and cataloging, and conflicted in his reflection on the futility of evidence against zealots. The motivation shapes every beat: examining the cog, descending to the archive, sealing the cache, defying the New Covenant calendar. Friction exists between his desire and the survivors' erasure, though it remains internal rather than forcing an on-page choice with visible cost. Essential and well-integrated.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Abrasive calm" is named twice and attempts to capture Marcus's contradictory stance (philosophical doubt within methodical action). The tone is present in the measured, reflective prose and his un-panicked descent. However, it remains more label than felt texture—the prose doesn't embody abrasiveness, and calm dominates without modulation under pressure. The ending's quiet conviction fits "calm" but loses the "abrasive" edge. Functional but not fully realized.</comment>
