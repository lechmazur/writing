<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal journey shows embodied grief work through concrete choices—measuring ribbon, sketching relationships, listening to Thomas. The "fiercely meditative state" registers as shown practice rather than label. Minor slip: Thomas's forty-year death feels ornamental rather than constraining a present choice. The final sketch choice demonstrates earned insight from prior causality with visible cost (adding black ribbon to the chronicle).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within opening lines. The accumulative lens holds: each evening's teaching deepens understanding until the final sketch crystallizes collective grief's architecture. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's realization that "collective grief was simply love made visible by absence" reweights all prior instruction with conceptual cost (she must now carve differently). The three-week timeframe and "until the last butterfly crosses" promise create forward pressure, but the escalation reads more as steady accumulation than tightening crisis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively shapes the work: gaps in panes allow monarchs through, overgrown vines house the ghost, glass catches dying light. The ribbon roll is handled across beats (pocket, measuring, wrist-tying) and its frayed texture carries history. Dusk recurs as workspace constraint. The micro-setting of cultivation and decay coexisting charges Elara's insight about grief's architecture. Strong sensory economy filtered through carver's attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering collective grief's shape—is signaled early and pursued through listening practice. The Hendricks sketch deepens understanding once (individual names → constellation of relationships). No reversal or tightening that narrows options; the arc is steady accumulation toward insight. Cost is conceptual (new obligation to "carve the space where fragments meet") rather than a visible forfeiture. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens but lacks a single moment where options narrow or a live trade-off occurs on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from ribbon chronicle, monarchs' flight patterns, and Thomas's teaching without thesis statement. The final image—"love made visible by absence"—reweights prior material through specific constellation metaphor and the daughter's Oliver poem. No moralizing; the shape of grief is discovered through particulars (Hendricks relationships, trading poems, butterfly migration as instinct map). The closing sketch instruction ("space enough for everyone to stand together") offers resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV maintains stable distance; Elara's perceptual signature (carver's eye for relationships, meditation practice, family poem-trading) is consistent. Thomas's dialogue feels purpose-driven ("Feel instead how their absences connect") and distinct from Elara's interior rhythms. Minor slip: "his voice arriving like distant thunder rolling across still water" reaches for elevation in a way that slightly exceeds earned register. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong propulsion in opening (iron bones/glass tears/monarchs) and closure sketch. Information density is high—most lines advance understanding or atmosphere. Two minor loops: "Thomas Marsh had been dead for forty years" is restated as fact without adding pressure, and "shape of grief" recurs three times in similar phrasing. The "thundering calm" phrase (prompt element) lands once as forced elevation. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Rhythm modulates well under meditative pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship is a familiar frame, but the combination of gravestone carving, ribbon chronicle, butterfly migration timing, and family poem-trading creates specific synthesis. The constellation-not-list insight for the Hendricks stone feels earned rather than convenient. Risk-taking is modest—the ghost remains benign tutor rather than complicating force—but the meditative accumulation and quiet ending commit fully to the premise. Transformation test: swapping monarchs for another migrating species would weaken the pattern-as-instinct metaphor but not break the arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices drive all key turns: seeking Thomas nightly, pulling the ribbon, sketching constellation rather than list, tying black ribbon, promising to continue. Early signal (dusk arrival, three weeks), middle development (retrace request, listening practice), and closure (final sketch with space for all). Carving itself happens off-page, but the contemplative preparation and design choices are on-page agency with visible cost (obligation to honor collective shape).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ribbon appears in three beats: pulled from pocket with texture detail (frayed from years), Elara measures black length, ties it around wrist with promise to add tomorrow. Early signal, modest middle involvement (color catalog), and closure presence (black ribbon as new entry). The colors-of-loss catalog deepens meaning, but the object enables rather than constrains—swapping for another chronicle device (journal, carved marks) would not break story logic. Solid functional integration without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship shapes every teaching beat: Thomas critiques individual vs. collective approach, shares mining-disaster method, gestures toward ribbons, fades at twilight. Setup immediate, development spans multiple nights, and closure includes his "same time tomorrow" ritual. The ghost enables the instruction that produces the constellation insight. Removing Thomas would require a different teaching mechanism, but the core arc (carver learning collective-grief shape) could function through other means. Strong but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Fiercely meditative" appears once as shown state ("breathed deeply, settling into that fiercely meditative state") that enables the listening insight. Middle development only—no setup signal, and closure references meditation's product (sketch) rather than the trait itself. The state enables the breakthrough but reads as method rather than constraining attribute with visible cost. Functional but replaceable with "focused" or "contemplative" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Retrace" appears as explicit request ("I want to retrace the pattern from your masterwork, the one you carved for the mining disaster") that triggers Thomas's core teaching about listening. Middle beat only—not present in setup or closure. The word choice matters thematically (returning to prior work rather than inventing new) but the story could substitute "study" or "learn from" without breaking causality. Shapes one key turn; solid integration without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Poem-trading custom appears in reflection (childhood memory of mother/Dickinson, father/Rilke) and closure (daughter offers Mary Oliver). Setup is retrospective anchor, closure shows practice continuing. The custom provides the "grammar" parallel Thomas invokes ("Collective grief has the same grammar"), and Elara imagines translating Oliver's rhythm into granite. Two-gate presence with thematic linkage, but the arc's pressure comes from Thomas's instruction and the Hendricks sketch—poems enrich rather than constrain. Meaningful but not load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse appears in every beat: iron bones/glass/gaps for monarchs (opening), overgrown vines house Thomas, dusk light through panes marks session end, "where cultivation and decay existed in the same breath" teaches Elara why Thomas chose this space. Setup, development (Thomas brings her "here, to this place"), and closure (amber/violet sky through glass as she finishes sketch). The setting's dual nature (growth/ruin) directly informs the insight about collective grief. Removing the greenhouse would require a different spatial metaphor. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Butterfly migration frames the work: "across the butterfly migration" (title-like opening), monarchs drift through gaps, spiral above during meditation, land on shoulder, and Elara promises "until the last butterfly crosses" with one week remaining. Early signal, atmospheric development, closure deadline. The migration provides temporal bracket and pattern-metaphor (instinct older than language), but does not tighten a live decision on the page—Elara could continue past migration end without breaking story logic. Shapes thematic resonance more than tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Discovering collective grief's shape drives every choice: Elara visits nightly to learn, asks Thomas how he found the shape, practices listening, shifts from individuals to "how their absences connect," sketches constellation. Setup (three weeks to carve names that outlast), development (Hendricks stone attempt, listening practice), closure (final understanding: "love made visible by absence" and sketch with space for all). The want faces friction (thirty-seven names "nearly broke" Thomas) and costs Elara new obligation. Strong integration with visible pursuit and conceptual price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Thundering calm" appears once as descriptor ("the thundering calm of dusk settling over everything") and recurs implicitly in Thomas's voice ("arriving like distant thunder rolling across still water") and the meditative stillness. The oxymoron fits the grief-work tone—intense yet contemplative—and modulates with Elara's deepening focus. Present at key beats and coherent through turns, but the explicit phrase reads slightly forced in the middle passage. Tone charges the final image's quiet authority without becoming static. Solid functional integration.</comment>
