<comment>Mira's interior life is established through her solitary documentation practice, and her choice to finish the sketch before engaging with the approaching ship shows agency under pressure. However, the transformation from "raged against the glass" to purposeful documentarian is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening the earned quality of her final stance. The mutation that grants temporal immunity reads as convenient biology rather than a trait that complicates choice. Embodied emotion is present but occasional therapy-speak ("blessed and cursed," "true north of her own strange existence") softens peak moments.</comment>

<comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Mira's ritual sketching deepens across three years of solitude, and the arriving ship reweights her practice without disrupting it. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by the third paragraph. The closure—Mira continuing her sketch as the ship approaches, choosing documentation over rescue—constitutes Earned Stasis with visible cost (prolonged isolation, deferred human contact). One structural concern: the extensive backstory (shutdown, evacuation, her initial breakdown)占s roughly 30% of the text and flattens present-scene momentum, though it does prime the final choice.</comment>

<comment>The observation deck's temporal dilation is vividly rendered ("stars hung suspended," "each beat a sustained drumroll") and the warped field constrains Mira's biology, making her exile both blessing and cage. The gilded compass rose applique gains tactile presence through repeated handling. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting directly enables the closure: only from this temporally stretched vantage can Mira create her unprecedented star atlas, and the deck's isolation charges her choice to continue sketching as the ship approaches.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—Mira's purpose in isolation versus the possibility of rescue—is signaled early and tightens when the ship appears. Her decision to finish the anniversary sketch before engaging constitutes meaningful agency that forecloses immediate reunion with humanity. The cost is legible: three years alone, "her voice forgotten from disuse." However, the escalation is gentle rather than acute; the ship's arrival raises possibility without creating urgent conflict, and Mira's choice feels contemplative rather than torn. The piece operates successfully under an Accumulative lens but lacks the visceral pressure that would elevate it into high 8s.</comment>

<comment>The theme of finding direction through solitude and purpose emerges organically from Mira's documentation practice and her grandmother's compass-rose wisdom. The final image—adding the ship to her star map as "another point of light among many"—reconfigures rescue from climax to data point, a non-literal answer to the question of belonging. The "true north" motif is worked through action (choosing to stay, to sketch, to document) rather than stated directly until the final reflection, where it earns its articulation. Minor weakness: "blessed and cursed" appears three times as a phrase, approaching thematic echo territory, though the final instance ties to concrete choice.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close throughout; psychic distance tightens appropriately during the ship's approach. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("time stretched thin as spider silk," "stars that moved like honey through the darkness") that matches Mira's contemplative isolation without tipping into purple excess. Perceptual signature is strong: she notices stellar positions, journal wear, applique damage—details filtered through her astronomer's eye and family inheritance. One minor slip: "temporal-patient fingers" in the penultimate paragraph reads slightly over-constructed, a self-conscious descriptor that breaks the established rhythm.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("temporally stretched like taffy," "each beat a sustained drumroll") clarifies rather than obscures the time-dilation concept. Information density is high in the observation-deck description and sketch ritual. However, several paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 12-13 restate Mira's initial despair and recovery; "blessed and cursed" repeats across three paragraphs with minor variation; "echoed silence" appears twice as identical phrasing. Template cadence in the middle section ("She had raged... screamed... wept... Then she had found...") stacks parallel constructions without payoff. These artifacts don't obscure closure but create local drag, warranting −0.6 under the patterned-artifact penalty.</comment>

<comment>The premise—a temporal anomaly creates a solitary observer who documents skies no one else can see—offers a fresh angle on isolation narratives, and the grandmother's compass rose grounds the sci-fi concept in family ritual. However, the core emotional arc (finding purpose in exile, choosing continued solitude over rescue) follows a familiar template: the hermit who has learned to value their isolation. The time-dilation mechanics are vivid but remain backdrop rather than complication; Mira's mutation conveniently removes all biological cost, leaving only loneliness. The sketch-as-compass metaphor and the decision to add the ship to her star map provide specific grace notes, but the synthesis doesn't fully transform its component parts.</comment>

<comment>Mira as "blessed pariah" is present from paragraph 3 and shapes the entire narrative: her immunity enables her stay, her isolation defines her purpose. She makes two key on-page choices: initially deciding to stay (recounted) and choosing to finish her sketch before engaging the ship (dramatized in the final third). The second choice directly expresses her blessed-pariah status—she can afford to delay reunion because she exists outside normal time. However, the pariah dimension (social exile, others' fear or rejection) is mostly told rather than shown through specific conflict or memory. The "blessed" half dominates, softening the pariah cost.</comment>

<comment>The gilded compass rose applique appears in three distinct beats: withdrawn from pocket (paragraph 9), examined under ship's lights (paragraph 21), and pressed back onto the journal cover (paragraph 25). It carries specific physical detail (eight-pointed star, cracked gold leaf, loose from handling) and accumulates meaning from family heirloom to navigation metaphor to tactile anchor during the ship's approach. The final pressing-back gesture accompanies Mira's thematic realization about true north. However, the applique doesn't constrain or enable a choice with visible tradeoff; it's handled and contemplated but remains symbolic rather than causal. It shapes two beats and touches the ending without being indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<comment>"True north" is seeded early (paragraph 10: "their family's true north, a reminder that even when lost among infinite stars, there was always a direction that meant home") and structures Mira's purpose throughout: she navigates by documentation rather than escape. The concept is dramatized in her choice to stay and sketch, then tested when the ship arrives—she could reorient toward rescue but instead reaffirms her chosen direction. The penultimate paragraph delivers the thematic payoff: "True north was never about a fixed destination... It was about knowing yourself well enough to choose a direction and mean it." This articulation feels earned by prior action. The concept shapes stakes (what defines home and direction) and is active in the closure choice, though the final articulation verges on statement rather than pure image.</comment>

<comment>Temporal stretching is introduced early (paragraph 2) and provides concrete sensory detail throughout: "each beat a sustained drumroll," the ship's lights pulsing "in the drawn-out rhythm of dilated time," each flash lasting "what felt like minutes." The attribute enables Mira's unique star atlas and constrains her social life (others evacuated; she alone can survive here). However, the trait grants only advantages—heightened perception, purposeful work—without visible on-page cost beyond loneliness, which would exist regardless. The mutation operates as premise rather than complication; Mira never struggles with the stretched perception or makes a choice shaped by temporal tradeoff. Present across many beats but not meaningfully constraining tactics.</comment>

<comment>"Glimpse" drives the major turn: Mira catches sight of the approaching ship (paragraph 18), which redefines her situation from permanent exile to potential rescue. This moment pivots the narrative from documentation-as-solace to documentation-as-choice. The glimpse is prepared by the observational frame (she's always watching the sky) and generates the closure decision (finish the sketch first, add the ship to her map). Her quickening heartbeat and the decision to "finish her anniversary tradition first" trace directly to this glimpsed ship. The action is irreplaceable—no other trigger would authentically introduce the rescue option at this moment—and it reweights all prior material.</comment>

<comment>The family custom is introduced in paragraph 5 ("sketching the night sky on the anniversary of each passing year"), demonstrated across Mira's three-year practice (paragraph 16: "Each night, Mira documented the sky"), and anchors the entire present-scene action: tonight is an anniversary, and she is mid-sketch when the ship appears. The method shapes her response to isolation ("she had found her grandmother's journal... and understood what she needed to do") and dictates her closure choice—completing the ritual before engaging with rescue. The sketching practice is the means by which confusion becomes exploration, making it causally central. It constrains her present action (she will finish this sketch) and provides the metaphor for the ending (adding the ship as another star). Present in setup, development, and closure with clear mechanical and thematic weight.</comment>

<comment>The observation deck is established immediately (paragraph 1) and its properties—temporal field, isolation, glass observation plane, emergency lighting—shape every beat. The deck's temporal dilation enables Mira's unique astronomy and forces the evacuation that leaves her alone. The setting provides the glass she presses against, the vantage from which she sees the approaching ship, and the "vacuum-adjacent silence" that defines her sonic environment. Most critically, the deck makes her star atlas unprecedented: "constellations no one else would ever witness, stellar movements visible only to someone blessed and cursed enough to watch from this particular vantage." The setting is the story's condition of possibility; remove it and the entire premise collapses. It constrains biology, enables purpose, and charges the final image of her sketching while the ship approaches.</comment>

<comment>The timeframe "after the shutdown" brackets the entire narrative and provides backstory context (paragraph 12: "The shutdown had come suddenly"). The three-year duration of Mira's solitude is specified and gives weight to her transformation and the "hundreds of star maps" in her journal. However, "after the shutdown" functions more as a static condition than a dynamic pressure; there's no ticking clock or deadline that shapes Mira's decisions. The anniversary provides ritual rhythm but not urgency. The ship's approach introduces time pressure (it "crept closer") but this is dilated and contemplative rather than urgent. The timeframe establishes premise and duration but doesn't tighten tactics or force choices within the present scene.</comment>

<comment>The motivation is stated explicitly in paragraph 15 ("To turn confusion into exploration: this became her purpose") and dramatized through Mira's three-year documentation practice. It governs her response to the ship's arrival: rather than immediate relief or panic, she returns to her sketch, fulfilling the exploratory purpose she has built. The motivation is tested—rescue offers an alternative—and reaffirmed through choice. However, the confusion-to-exploration shift is largely recounted (paragraphs 13-15 summarize her breakdown and recovery) rather than shown in present-tense conflict. The final scene enacts the "exploration" half convincingly, but the "confusion" dimension exists primarily in backstory. The motivation shapes her stance at closure and carries cost (continued isolation, deferred reunion) but with modest friction.</comment>

<comment>"Echoed silence" appears in paragraph 11 and recurs in paragraph 27 ("The echoed silence held her gently"), bracketing Mira's solitary practice. The tone—contemplative, hushed, stretched—is coherent throughout and modulates subtly as the ship approaches: her heartbeat quickens but remains "sustained," the silence persists even as possibility arrives. The tone supports the Accumulative lens and charges the final image of Mira sketching in that "echoed silence" while the ship grows larger. However, the phrase "echoed silence" itself is repeated identically without transformation, and the tone remains relatively static (one mood held steady) rather than shifting under pressure. The tone is purposeful and coherent but could more actively intensify or complicate as stakes rise.</comment>
