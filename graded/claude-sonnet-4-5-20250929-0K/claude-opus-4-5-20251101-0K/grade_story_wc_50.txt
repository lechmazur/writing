<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's locksmith expertise and her methodical, patient approach are well-embodied through concrete action (machining gears, measuring tension). Her interior motivation—preserving wonder without killing it—is grounded in grandmother's legacy and drives her three-month commitment. The embodied patience (measuring spring tension "against the beat of her own patient heart") and peripheral focus method show contradictory impulses (scientific rigor vs. mystical openness) acting simultaneously. Minor weakness: the grandmother backstory functions more as thematic scaffolding than a choice-altering memory; it primes but doesn't pivot present action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers observations, failed attempts, and incremental understanding across three months, then delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure when the harvest occurs and Elena sits "with the marble, the mechanism, and the memory of voices." Orientation is clean by opening lines (marble cavern, three months descent, autumn-to-winter). The cost is conceptual and felt—wonder captured but not explained, mystery held in notation—visible in her "notebook full of phonetic transcriptions." One meaningful deepening (the timer clicks into wholeness, voices emerge) suffices at this length under the Accumulative lens. Closure remains open but charged, fitting the declared aim to "store wonder."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The marble cavern is not mere backdrop: its crystalline walls hold echoes differently depending on position, reflection angles govern the harvest mechanism, and Elena maps surfaces over weeks. The timer mechanism—machined, calibrated, positioned to catch light—constrains her choices (she must work peripherally, coordinate light/time/resonance precisely). The wounded season outside creates a "blank canvas" absence of noise that enables the work. Candlelight, flat stone workspace, skeletal fingers clutching prior notes—all anchor tactile engagement. The micro-setting (timer, marble geometry) charges the final image when voices emerge "like bubbles rising through deep water."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: successfully harvesting the echoes using the repaired timer. Pressure accumulates steadily under the Textural lens: each week of mapping, each gear filed, the sixty-three-day span, the precise calibration all narrow the window for success. The protagonist's agency is decision and endurance (descending three months ago, filing gears by candlelight, keeping focus peripheral). The tightening occurs on day sixty-three when the mechanism "clicked into wholeness" and the harvest begins, foreclosing further preparation. Cost is legible: three months of isolation, painstaking labor, and the knowledge that direct observation "killed the phenomenon." The wounded season's suspended time heightens the conditions required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—wonder preserved without explanation, awe held in understanding's amber—emerges organically from Elena's locksmith-mystic synthesis and the grandmother's teaching. The cellar-of-reason metaphor recurs with purpose: opening as grandmother's whisper, closing as Elena's "cellar of carefully stored wonder." No overt moralizing; the final image (sitting with marble, mechanism, memory) offers a resonant answer to whether mystery and mechanism can coexist. The timer as literal and figurative device for "capturing time" deepens specificity. Subtext operates in "peripherally focused" work, the implication that direct scrutiny kills magic, and the paradox of using precision tools to touch the ineffable. The ending reweights prior material—voices "waited so long to be heard again"—without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, with psychic distance close enough to access Elena's interior ("wonder bloom in her chest, vast and terrifying") and far enough for lyric elevation ("the season hung suspended"). Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "stumbled and fell wounded into an early winter that refused to commit" establishes the prose's patient, precise rhythm. Perceptual signature is locksmith-specific (tumblers, gears, escapement, mainspring, filing smooth). Filter verbs ("she had realized," "she had learned") are sparse and voice-motivated. No dialogue to judge. Minor slip: "the harvest of echoes" italicized feels like a prompt echo rather than Elena's phrasing, a small register bump in an otherwise seamless voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance world-logic, character motive, or thematic layering without padding. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declarative "The timer was essential" after longer accumulative sentences). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is selective and coherent: "season hung suspended," "voices emerged like bubbles rising through deep water," "stone womb." Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges motifs (marble, mechanism, memory). Minor deduction: "cellar of reason where one could store wonder" and "to capture mystery without killing it" repeat the same conceptual content across adjacent beats in paragraph three, a small loop that could tighten. Otherwise exemplary momentum and clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of locksmith precision and mystical harvest is specific and non-obvious, grounded in marble acoustics, light-angle mechanics, and peripheral observation. The "wounded season" as enabling condition rather than obstacle is a fresh inflection. Elena's motivation—preserve awe through notation, not explanation—transforms the "preserve mystery" trope into a craftsperson's ethic. The grandmother's teaching and skeletal predecessor add depth without cliché. Risk in structure (three-month span compressed, lyric pacing) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Small deduction: the core image of "echoes trapped in stone" has literary precedent; transformation is strong but not fully unprecedented. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena present throughout; early signal (paragraph two establishes locksmith craft); beats include filing gears, mapping reflections, setting timer, recording harvest; causal pressure (her skill enables repair, her discipline sustains three months); closure participation (she sits with notebook, the harvest complete). Cost visible: isolation, painstaking labor, peripheral focus constraint. High irreplaceability—story requires this exact synthesis of locksmith and seeker.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Timer introduced early (paragraph three, "broken timer mechanism sat before her"); development across multiple beats (found clutched in skeletal fingers, escapement shattered, she machines new gear, rewinds mainspring, sets it on day sixty-three); causal pressure (governs harvest through precise coordination of light/time/resonance); closure linkage (its countdown triggers the harvest, "The timer wound down"). Specificity high—mainspring tension, brass face angled to catch light. Cost tied to element: three months' labor to repair it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Concept "harvest of echoes" appears early (paragraph four, italicized); grandmother's teaching establishes it; development through Elena's realization that marble holds sound, mapping process, calibration; stakes shaped (must coordinate light/sound/time to release voices); closure active (voices emerge, Elena records them, "The harvest" confirmed). Strong causal role—concept defines entire goal structure. Specificity: "Centuries of human sound, preserved in crystalline geometry."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Peripherally focused" introduced mid-story (paragraph six, "Elena worked peripherally focused"); development one beat ("Direct observation killed the phenomenon"); causal constraint (she must study by indirection, reflection angles); closure implicit (she "kept her focus peripheral" during harvest). Late signal and single-beat use limit score. Cost visible: must work indirectly, precision hampered. Moderate irreplaceability—trait could be "indirect" or "oblique" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Reverse-engineer" mentioned once (paragraph six, "reverse-engineer the process by indirection"); development through studying reflection angles, noting light changes, mapping over weeks; causal role (this method enables the harvest mechanics); closure shaping (her "phonetic transcriptions and acoustic measurements" result from reverse-engineering). Signaled mid-story. Moderate swappability—"decode" or "reconstruct" could substitute with minor edits. Cost implicit in weeks of observation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Studying reflection angles at different times" appears paragraph six; development through mapping surfaces, noting how light changes acoustic properties, positioning timer to catch light; causal role (reflections multiply through chamber, "Sound followed light here"); closure participation (timer angled to multiply reflections triggers harvest). Moderate specificity—angles and timing matter to mechanics. Cost: weeks of observation work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marble cavern anchored opening line; early description (crystalline walls catching light, fissures, deeper chambers); development across beats (footsteps return differently, walls sing, geometry preserves sound); causal pressure (marble's acoustic properties enable harvest, requires specific resonance frequencies); closure active (marble releases voices, Elena sits "with the marble"). High irreplaceability—crystalline structure essential to sound-preservation logic. Constrains choices: must map geometry, work in stillness.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Timeframe "wounded season" established opening (autumn into early winter, "hung suspended"); sixty-three-day span mentioned; development through "extreme seasons created noise, interference. This suspended time was a blank canvas"; causal role (the lull enables the harvest by reducing noise); closure implicit (season will heal, she'll return to surface). Moderate causal pressure—time enables rather than tightens. Cost visible: three-month isolation. Specificity moderate—"wounded" and "suspended" are evocative but somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motivation "to store wonder in the cellar of reason" appears paragraph four via grandmother; development through Elena's rejection then acceptance, her locksmith-mystic synthesis; stakes shaped (not to explain away but hold safe, prove world contains more than mechanisms while using mechanisms); closure active (she stores harvest in "careful notation," sits with "carefully stored wonder"). Strong causal role—motivation drives three-month commitment. Cost visible: isolation, painstaking labor, tension between knowing and preserving mystery. High specificity.</comment>
