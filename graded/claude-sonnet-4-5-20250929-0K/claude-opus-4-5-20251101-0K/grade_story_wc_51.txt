<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior state is richly embodied—"boundary-lessly trapped within her gift" manifests as concrete sensory dissolution, patterns spreading into thoughts and memories. The final shift from boundary-lessness to structure is earned through the night's labor, with visible cost (absorbing others' burdens) and a credible transformation. Minor slip: the kerosene lamp burner's warming feels slightly symbolic rather than causally motivated, and the grandmother backstory adds texture but doesn't alter a present choice. Internal contradiction (patterns spreading vs. needing to calcify) drives the central tension effectively.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara's boundary-less state calcifies into structure through labor, with visible cost (absorbing burdens, pressing the weaving into stone). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered echoes, the weaving process, and the final exchange with the grotto. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening: the fractals learn to end where she begins, reweighting her initial trap into a navigable structure. Cost is legible in the transformation and the burdens she now carries.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bronze grotto functions as micro-setting with constraint: its acoustics hold the echoes Elara needs, and the "shingled hush" guides her weaving by orienting her loom toward each burden's source. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—mineral sweat, singing walls, pale geometry of starlight—filtered through Elara's craft-specific attention. The aperture's starlight and the grotto's resonance charge the final image when she presses her weaving into the stone. Spatial choreography is clear (northeastern wall, grotto's heart, climb back out). Minor gap: the kerosene lamp burner's warmth at dawn lacks spatial or causal grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Elara needs emotional mass to anchor her fractals or they will calcify her mind entirely. Pressure is Accumulative/Textural, building through the night's weaving as each burden adds density. One meaningful tightening: the fractals begin to calcify, but into structure rather than paralysis, narrowing her options to this exact labor. The cost is visible—she absorbs others' sorrows, presses her work into stone, and in exchange regains her name and edges. Agency is clear: her decision to weave by orienting toward each echo drives the transformation. No antagonist required; the internal/craft conflict coheres throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: being lost is converted into being found through labor that absorbs and transforms others' pain. The final image—"the weight of being lost converted into the lightness of being found"—reweights the premise without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the kerosene lamp burner (unlit but warming, remembering fire) and the shingled hush (layered silences becoming structure). No thematic echo; Elara's realization is earned through the night's specific work. The fractals learning to end where she begins offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the boundary-less trap. Quiet ending charged by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature rooted in Elara's craft (threads humming, patterns that never resolve, frequencies of loss). Diction is controlled and purposeful—"shingled hush," "boundary-lessly trapped," "calcifying"—within a consistent lyric register. Psychic distance modulates intentionally: close during weaving, pulling back slightly for the dawn realization. No dialogue to judge. Minor slip: "the earth remembered how to breathe" in the opening leans slightly poetic-generic, but recovers quickly. Compression at closure (lamp burner warming, whispering her name) supports pressure without obscuring the transformation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual breath. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, and the weaving process. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting: "boundary-lessly trapped within her gift" and "calcifying, yes, but not into paralysis. Into structure. Into edges" carry slight figurative density without muddle. "The earth remembered how to breathe" is a stock metaphor but doesn't recur. Clarity remains strong throughout; the weaving sequence and final exchange are propulsive and concrete. Zero scaffolding or synonym churn. Strong line-level control with one minor register lift at the opening that doesn't harm closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of fractal weaving, emotional acoustics, and calcification as both trap and structure feels specific and non-obvious. The grotto's function—holding burdens in bronze resonance—transforms the familiar "place of unburdening" trope through the weaver's need for mass. The kerosene lamp burner and the shingled hush are fresh inflections, though the lamp's warming at dawn leans slightly symbolic. The final turn (fractals learning to end where she begins) arises from prior particulars and avoids the safety middle. No close echoes of famous lines. Risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passes: the weaver's specific craft and the grotto's acoustic properties are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's choices create every key turn: traveling to the grotto (setup), weaving by orienting toward echoes (development), pressing the completed work into stone (closure). Her agency drives the transformation from boundary-less to structured. Present in all three acts with causal pressure throughout. Cost tied directly to her labor: absorbing burdens, surrendering the weaving, regaining her name. Irreplaceable; no other character could execute this arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The kerosene lamp burner appears in setup (retrieved from pack, held against chest) and closure (grows warm at dawn). However, it does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics. The warming at dawn feels symbolic rather than causal—she does not light it, and its effect on the outcome is unclear. Lyric reprise present but without demonstrated necessity. Swappable with another heirloom object. Two touches across story but no beat involvement or cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Shingled hush" is seeded early, defined as layered silence holding echoes. It shapes Elara's method: she listens within the hush to locate each burden's source, then orients her loom accordingly. Present in development (guides weaving) and closure (her burden joins the shingled hush). Causal pressure: without the hush's acoustics, she cannot collect the emotional mass. Cost tied to the concept: her work becomes part of the permanent echo. Irreplaceability high; the acoustic layering is integral to the grotto's function and her craft.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Boundary-lessly trapped" is seeded in paragraph three, constrains Elara's entire motivation (she will calcify without anchoring mass), enables the night's labor (she must weave to survive), and is reweighted at closure (calcification becomes structure, not paralysis). Present across all three gates with visible cost: the transformation forecloses her prior formless state. Causal pressure throughout; the trait drives every choice. Specificity high; "boundary-less" is not generic but craft-specific. Three beats minimum, closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Calcify" appears as threat (fractals will calcify her mind), process (patterns beginning to calcify during weaving), and transformation (calcifying into structure, not paralysis). Drives the dominant stake, shapes the middle labor, and reweights at closure. The action cannot be swapped; the story's logic hinges on calcification as both danger and solution. Present in all three gates with high causal pressure and visible cost. The final image ("learned to end where she began") is the calcification's result. Irreplaceable; no synonym captures the dual nature.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"By orienting properly" is seeded early (listening to the grotto), enacted in development (turning loom to face each echo's source), and enables the weaving's success. Method is specific and causally necessary: without proper orientation, she cannot capture the burdens' frequencies. Shapes at least two beats (listening, weaving northeastern wall, turning again). Cost connection: the method requires sustained attention and physical labor through the night. Closure linkage indirect but present: the completed weaving's density results from accurate orientation. Swappability low; "orienting" is craft-specific.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bronze grotto is seeded in title/opening, supplies the resource Elara needs (echoes held in resonant stone), constrains her method (she must work within its acoustics), and receives the final weaving. Present across all three gates with high causal pressure. The grotto's properties (singing walls, mineral sweat, starlight aperture) are irreplaceable; no other setting provides the shingled hush. Closure linkage strong: pressing the weaving into the grotto's heart completes the exchange. Cost connection: the grotto gives back her name. Setting as active participant, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the first snowmelt" is mentioned in the opening line but does not constrain choices, tighten decisions, or reappear. No live clock; Elara works "through the night" and "as dawn approached" without time pressure altering her tactics. The timeframe is atmospheric scene-setting rather than a stake-shaping force. Missing development and closure gates. Swappable with any season without structural impact. Ornamental use only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"To collect the weights of different burdens" is seeded early (paragraph four), drives the entire middle sequence (listening, weaving each echo), and is fulfilled at closure (burdens merge with stone, grotto returns her name). Motivation is dramatized through action: she turns her loom, captures frequencies, adds mass. Friction present: absorbing others' sorrows to save herself. Cost visible: the weaving she presses into stone carries those burdens. Three beats minimum, causal pressure throughout, closure linkage undeniable. The motivation is irreplaceable; story logic collapses without it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Whalebone reverie" reads as lyric, contemplative, and elegiac—tone established in the opening (fractal weaver, impossible geometries, boundary-less) and sustained through the weaving sequence. Modulates subtly: quiet intensity during labor, slight lift at dawn realization. Tone charges the final image: the whispered name, the lightness of being found. Coherent through turns without static monotony. Minor slip: "the earth remembered how to breathe" and "rivers that remembered the sea" lean slightly stock-poetic, but recover. Tone does not constrain a choice but does shape the closure's resonance. Present across all three gates with strong closure linkage.</comment>
