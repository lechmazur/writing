<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation is clear and distinctive—a reluctant prophet seeking genuine inquiry over certainty. Her interiority carries specificity ("variant allegiance had always been her specialty") and the final choice to offer doubt instead of blessing is earned through seventeen years of storm-watching. Internal contradiction operates well: she craves listeners but rejects followers, wants influence but refuses weaponization. Minor slip: Caro's voice feels slightly generic in dialogue, lacking distinct idiom beyond youth, and the emotional embodiment occasionally leans toward stock gestures ("fingers found the transmission dial").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: Miriam's broadcast of doubt and invitation transforms the campfires from war preparation to pilgrimage, reweighting her loneliness from isolation to "waiting for them to arrive ready to listen." The causal-accumulative hybrid lens holds—radio intercept triggers tactical choice (cancel assault), which crystallizes her prophetic stance with visible cost (accepting followers she never wanted). Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two. One micro-turn (the campfires' direction shift) sets up closure without undermining the dominant choice. Cost is legible: she must now teach, ending her solitary vigil.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choice effectively: elevation creates the signal advantage and physical separation that enables her refusal of direct engagement. The cobalt portico returns twice with shifted meaning (reflection/inscription, then lightning illumination during the climactic broadcast), charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("cloud sea," "storm howled its approval or indifference"). Spatial choreography stays clear throughout. Minor gap: the radio array's physical components and Miriam's interaction with controls remain somewhat abstract; more tactile detail during transmission would strengthen micro-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent weaponization of her teachings vs. grant the blessing Caro seeks) is signaled early and tightens when Caro's transmission arrives. The meaningful pressure point—Miriam's choice to transmit doubt and recordings instead of support—narrows options with visible cost: she must abandon isolation and accept pedagogical responsibility. Agency is clear decision, not coincidence. The escalation operates under the hybrid lens: causal (intercept → choice → tactical shift) and accumulative (seventeen years of signal-gathering pays off). Cost is felt on the page: "fellow searchers" acceptance forecloses her hermitage. One stronger physical constraint during the choice moment (weather threatening equipment, time pressure) would have elevated further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: doubt as generative force versus certainty as rigidity, encoded in ancient signal fragments and Miriam's pedagogical choice. The final image offers a non-literal answer—static singing, followers climbing—without moralizing. Subtext operates well in the cobalt-glass reflection and "gritty whimsy" of apocalypse comedy broadcasts. Minor weakness: "variant allegiance" as concept is more told than dramatized through specific contradictory choices under immediate pressure; the term itself feels slightly prompt-facing. The inscription "What rises must remember what fell" borders on overt thematic statement but is contextualized as environmental detail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV control is stable and Miriam's perceptual signature is distinct: she filters world-as-signal, reads weather as indifferent texture, notices electromagnetic patterns over human warmth. Diction stays consistent with her isolated, technical expertise ("variant allegiance," "electromagnetic radiation," "lyrically prophetic"). Dialogue serves subtext well—Caro's "your word shapes belief" advances her goal while revealing the burden Miriam resists. Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: "gritty whimsy" appears as label in narration without full embodiment through rhythm or word choice in that moment; the phrase feels slightly authorial rather than Miriam's natural idiom. Under peak stress (Caro's request), syntax tightens appropriately without voice collapse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is strong and most sentences advance character or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language ("forgotten god's monocle," "woman made of weather and regret") sharpens without muddle. Clarity holds through complex shifts. Significant weakness: multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs flatten momentum. "Loneliness was a condition rather than a calling" / "loneliness had never been about the absence of others" restates across distant paragraphs. "The faithful were gathering…campfires visible…constellations of belief" / "watched the first campfires below begin to move" recycles imagery. Several filter-verb stacks ("had climbed," "had been," "had taught") dull immediacy in reflective passages. These artifacts don't touch closure but spread across the piece, triggering accumulated deduction and preventing high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of radio-prophet, electromagnetic archaeology, and doubt-as-sermon is specific and non-obvious. "Variant allegiance" and teaching through static rather than certainty transform the reluctant-prophet trope effectively. Emotional truth grounds the concept—loneliness redefined through pedagogy resonates without sentiment. Minor limitation: the observatory-above-clouds setting and prophet-on-mountain frame echo familiar archetypes without full transformation; the vertical symbolism (high places, rising, climbing) operates conventionally. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications, but the core geography and Dawn Shepherds faction lack the granular, verifiable detail that would make them irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miriam as "lonely visionary" is present from paragraph one, drives the key choice (transmit doubt vs. blessing), and her solitary expertise shapes tactics throughout. Her decision alters the campfires' direction and forecloses her hermitage. Closure hinges on her acceptance of fellow searchers, reweighting loneliness with visible cost. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico appears in three beats: opening description with inscription, mid-story reflection, and lightning illumination during climactic broadcast. It provides atmospheric texture and houses the inscription that seeds theme. However, its physical properties (cobalt specifically) never constrain a choice or enable a tactic; any observatory window would serve. The glass does not return with meaningfully reweighted stakes at closure—it remains backdrop. Lyric resonance (opening→ending reprise) is present but the object itself is replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Variant allegiance" is named once and glossed ("the ability to hold contradictory loyalties without breaking"), then demonstrated through Miriam's choice to offer doubt rather than either support or refusal. It shapes her pedagogical method but does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost. The concept appears late (paragraph six), operates more as thematic claim than live tactic, and could be replaced with "intellectual flexibility" or "nuanced thinking" without restructuring. Functional but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Lyrically prophetic" is used once as descriptor for the world's broadcasts ("the world had become lyrically prophetic in its destruction"), not as Miriam's personal trait. It colors atmosphere and supports tone but does not constrain her actions or create a tradeoff. The attribute is present thematically but ornamental to the main choice. No visible cost tied to this specific quality; replaced easily with "poetic" or "elegiac."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Unfold" drives the key visual moment: Miriam's reflection unfolds in the cobalt glass, seeding her self-recognition and the decision beat. It recurs implicitly when the Dawn Shepherds' campfires unfold into pilgrimage. The action shapes the dominant turn—her broadcast choice—and charges the final image of followers climbing. Two beats, causal pressure, closure linkage. Strong integration, though the mechanics of "unfolding" as process remain somewhat abstract rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Through fragmented radio frequencies" is signaled early (paragraph two), shapes Miriam's entire tactical landscape (intercept→choice→broadcast), and appears in three distinct beats: initial monitoring, Caro's assault request, Miriam's doubt transmission. The means constrains her choice—she cannot bless in person, only via radio—and the ancient recordings become her pedagogical tool. Mechanics matter: static, frequencies, transistors. Closure depends on this exact method. Indispensable; removal breaks story logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "stormlit observatory above clouds" is present from the title beat, supplies the elevation that enables radio intercept and separation from the faithful, and pressures the climax when storm presses against glass during broadcast. The setting returns in the final image as destination for the climbing followers. Micro-setting (altitude, isolation) alters Miriam's tactics—she can refuse direct engagement but must accept eventual pilgrimage. Three gates met, strong causal and closure participation, irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across the rise of a prophet" frames the temporal scope and is referenced ("seventeen years ago," "now," "the rise of her reluctant prophethood"), but time does not tighten the present decision. The timeframe is more thematic container than live constraint. No countdown or urgency tied to duration; Caro's assault timing ("moonrise") appears once but does not pressure Miriam's response speed. Functional background but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is Miriam's explicit motivation, dramatized through her signal-collecting and pedagogical stance. It drives her refusal to weaponize teachings ("not weapons…memories encoded") and her choice to transmit the recordings. Desire is conflicted—she wants influence without followers, dawn without war. The motivation shapes two beats (initial refusal, broadcast decision) and the final image of pilgrimage as new beginning. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, though the "ancient shadows" mechanics remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Gritty whimsy" appears in the mid-story catalogue of broadcasts (children's choir, comedian, weather report for vanished cities) and colors the overall atmosphere. The tone modulates coherently—lyric wonder in storm description, wry distance in Miriam's self-assessment, dark comedy in the broadcast fragments. However, the tone does not intensify or shift decisively at closure to charge the final image; the ending remains earnest and hopeful without whimsical inflection. Present across beats but does not reweight the ending. Mid-band integration.</comment>
