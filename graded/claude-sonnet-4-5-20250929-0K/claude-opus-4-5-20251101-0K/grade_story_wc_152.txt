<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's "fool's smile" gambit is motivated and embodied through concrete micro-choices (spilling spools, adjusting her voice). Her interiority balances competence with genuine tension—she collects intelligence while managing the precarity of her position. The final choice to carry evidence through servants' passages is earned by prior causality. Minor slip: the eternal flame's role as memory device edges toward symbolic convenience without constraining a single on-page choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with situational pressures: Mira overhears conspiracy fragments, recognizes the pattern in her embroidery, and decides to act. Closure is Charged Poise—she completes the warning panel and prepares to carry it, crystallizing the stakes with felt cost (risk of exposure). Orientation anchors early (observatory, autumn, Mira at work). One tightening occurs when she sees "the complete conspiracy" and understands the purge's scope. Cost is implied rather than dramatized on the final page, which keeps this in the 7s rather than higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: blue-tinted walls, copper ribs, the great telescope. Autumn winds and leaves create atmospheric coherence. The worktable, scattered spools, and map table provide spatial choreography that supports Mira's intelligence-gathering. The observatory's three-century history and lamplight anchor the scene without over-exposition. The setting does not directly constrain a choice at closure, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Mira must decode and deliver the conspiracy evidence before the coup in three days. The tension escalates when she "sees it now, the complete conspiracy," narrowing her window and raising the cost. Her decision to carry the embroidery through servants' passages is protagonist-driven. The three-day deadline provides urgency but is not visibly tightened on the page during the scene. No on-page reversal that changes her tactics; the pressure is accumulative rather than turn-based, which fits the lens but limits the escalation score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth preserved through art and disguise, wisdom cloaked as foolishness, listening for "unheard stories." The embroidery as cipher, the fool's smile as fortress, and the eternal flame as witness cohere without thesis statements. The final image—Mira's needle "threading wisdom through the disguise of foolishness"—reweights prior material with resonance. Minor penalty: "The silence echoed with all the stories yet to be told" edges toward portentous abstraction in the last line, slightly diluting the concrete closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly with Mira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong: she collects "syllables like scattered pearls," watches the flame's flickers, maps "the constellation of their treachery." Dialogue is sparse, functional, and carries subtext—her vacant sweetness contrasts with sharp interior perception. Diction remains stable and voice-motivated. The prose modulates effectively under pressure (spilling spools, the rushed realization). Reaches the 8-band on clean distance control and distinct voice texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence runs. Information density is high—most lines advance character, conspiracy, or atmosphere. Minor loop: "The flame flickered twice, and Mira understood" followed immediately by rising and gathering creates a slight redundancy in the transition beat. "Echoed silence" and "spiral" recur across the piece, but the pattern is voice-consistent rather than artifactual. One filter-verb cluster in the opening paragraph ("having passed," "whispering that") is acceptable in exposition. Figurative language is controlled and apt ("copper coins thrown to fate").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—embroiderer as spy, foolishness as cover—transforms familiar tropes through specific execution (silk galaxy chart as cipher, eternal flame as mnemonic). Mira's dual identity and the observatory setting offer fresh synthesis. The piece commits fully to its conceit without hedging. Risk penalty: the "eternal flame" as memory device leans into symbolic convenience without transforming the constraint in a non-obvious way. The story would survive substitution of the flame with a simpler mnemonic tool, indicating mid-band rather than high originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's embroidering is present in setup (stitching spiral arms), middle (adjusting threads to reveal the pattern), and ending (adding the final red stitch, beginning a new panel). Her recognition of the conspiracy pattern drives the key turn—"she saw it now"—and her decision to carry the evidence. The embroidering constrains her tactics (she must maintain her fool's disguise while working) and shapes the closure image. Strong causal involvement across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The eternal candle appears in setup (passed down seven generations, "the flame remembered") and is referenced twice in the middle ("The flame leaned east," "The flame flickered twice"). It does not constrain an on-page choice or enable a tactic; Mira's intelligence-gathering proceeds independently of the flame. At closure, it receives a brief callback ("The flame leaned toward her work approvingly") but does not charge the final action or reweight meaning. Present across beats but largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Unraveling conspiracies is the story's central engine: Mira collects fragments ("every court had its chorus of approved voices"), recognizes the pattern in her embroidery ("the complete conspiracy embroidered across her silken galaxy"), and decides to deliver the warning. The concept shapes her tactics (maintaining her fool's disguise, using the embroidery as cipher) and drives the closure decision to carry evidence through servants' passages. Causally essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Disguises wisdom as foolishness" is established early (humming nonsense, "vacant sweetness of a fool"), constrains her behavior throughout (letting spools scatter, giggling "Always do, my lord"), and enables her intelligence-gathering by making the conspirators careless. The attribute drives a key beat when she deliberately plays the fool to retrieve a spool near the battle plans. At closure, her "fool's smile" frames the decision to act. The trait is indispensable to both tactics and characterization, with visible cost (constant performance, precarity).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Synchronize" appears explicitly once: "Mira found that watching the flame's subtle flickers helped her synchronize the fragments she gathered into coherent patterns." This frames her method but does not drive a major turn. The recognition of the pattern ("suddenly the pattern revealed itself through adjacent possibilities") is the key action, and "synchronize" provides conceptual scaffolding rather than a distinct, irreplaceable verb. Present in middle development and linked to the realization beat, but swappable with "assemble" or "connect" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Through adjacent possibilities" appears once in the key recognition beat: "Each piece of intelligence... connected to the next like stepping stones across dark water... She adjusted one thread, shifted another, and suddenly the pattern revealed itself through adjacent possibilities." The phrase signals her method of linking intelligence fragments but does not mechanically shape her attempts beforehand. Early implicit setup (collecting fragments, adjusting threads) and closure participation (the final stitch marks the Queen's chamber) bracket the explicit mention, but the exact phrasing is ornamental rather than load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory anchors every beat: the dome's acoustics fragment whispers into "syllables she collected like scattered pearls," the map table provides proximity for her spool retrieval, the three-century history establishes the flame's lineage, and autumn winds charge the atmosphere. The setting enables her intelligence-gathering (astronomers' midnight observations) and constrains her tactics (maintaining her fool's role in their workspace). The final image places her "in the cobalt observatory, surrounded by men who charted distant stars while plotting earthly destruction." Essential across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Before the coup" is signaled in the title-element position and made concrete mid-story: "She had three days before the coup." The timeframe tightens the decision to act and frames the urgency of carrying the embroidered evidence. However, the three-day deadline does not visibly compress tactics on the page during this scene; it functions as declared urgency rather than a live clock that alters moves beat-by-beat. Present in setup (implicit), middle (explicit), and closure (her preparation to act), but the mechanics remain static.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To listen for unheard stories" is established early ("The stars tell stories... I just listen") and reappears at closure ("But now someone would listen to the unheard story"). The motivation drives her intelligence-gathering throughout: she "listened for the unheard stories... in the pauses where men swallowed their real intentions." It shapes her tactics (maintaining the fool disguise to be dismissed and thus privy to secrets) and grounds the decision to deliver the evidence. No on-page friction between this desire and a competing cost, which would elevate the score further.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" appears three times: "Their whispers echoed against the dome's copper ribs," "The echoed silence of the dome swallowed their voices," and "The silence echoed with all the stories yet to be told." The tone is coherent and atmospheric, modulating from observation to action preparation. It charges the final image by linking silence to untold stories. The recurrence is purposeful but edges toward decorative in the last line's abstraction. Present across all three gates, with moderate causal and thematic weight.</comment>
