<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and the glass eyes function well as embodied stakes, but her interior often drifts into abstract philosophizing ("mathematics of emotion," "formulas of sustenance") that reads more poetic than psychologically grounded. The apparition dialogue ("I'm what remains when someone isn't gone and isn't here") feels like articulated theme rather than a character discovering something through embodied struggle. The final acceptance and "green shoot of optimism" arrives quickly after seven years of grief, earning the turn through scene work but landing with muted emotional cost. Theo remains more concept than person, which serves the ambiguous-loss premise but flattens the relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/realization blend) at closure. The piece anchors who/where/when efficiently in the opening paragraph and the escalation reads as deepening—Mira moves from searching for Theo to accepting her own survival calculus. The apparition sequence provides a meaningful turn that reweights her project, and the final image of carrying the glass eyes "at peace" delivers visible emotional cost (abandoning the search, accepting ambiguity). One structural seam: the apparition's thematic clarity risks feeling convenient rather than discovered, but the reweighting of her equations into self-mapping is legible and the closure lands on the page with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is vividly rendered—phosphorescent moss, mineral drip rhythm, fruit nourished by stalactites—and the mosaic stepping stone becomes the functional anchor for her conjuring work, constraining her method. The dripping water serves as both atmospheric detail and a recurring structural rhythm that charges the final beats. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling, tracing, climbing toward surface) and the setting's particulars (chipped tiles, bioluminescent glow) directly enable the plot's central action. The underground/surface contrast supports the thematic arc of burial and emergence without becoming heavy-handed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: locate the endpoint of grief by understanding its mathematics. The apparition sequence provides one meaningful tightening—Mira realizes she's been solving for the wrong variable—that narrows her options and forecloses the search for Theo with visible cost (she accepts "some equations had no solutions"). Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as a single decisive reweighting rather than multiple reversals, which fits this length. The cost is legible (abandoning seven years of search, shifting from recovery to survival), though the pivot from equations-as-tool to equations-as-self-mapping happens quickly and the price feels more conceptual than viscerally dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core thematic question—how to map loss when the lost person is neither present nor absent—emerges organically from the glass eyes, mosaic, and apparition sequence. However, the apparition's dialogue ("I'm the space between your equations") and Mira's explicit realization ("She had been trying to solve for Theo when she should have been solving for herself") veer into stating the theme rather than dramatizing it through image alone. The final paragraph's "formula for surviving his absence" and "buried optimism" feel slightly over-articulated, reducing resonance. The piece earns its thematic turn but would gain power if the mathematics conceit remained more implicit and the final image carried the weight without the explanatory framing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and well-controlled, with clean psychic distance throughout. Mira's perceptual signature—tracing damage as language, reading erosion as pattern—feels specific and consistent. The prose modulates effectively under pressure: earlier passages luxuriate in metaphor ("half-life of hope"), while the apparition encounter tightens into concrete image. One friction: the elevated register ("dovetail two disciplines," "superimposed into a shimmering possibility") occasionally drifts above Mira's immediate emotional state, reading more authorial than character-filtered. The apparition's single line of dialogue carries thematic weight but risks sounding writerly rather than emerging from the conjured phenomenon itself.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and the opening/closing images are strong, but several passages lean into decorative phrasing that slows momentum without adding pressure. "She believed—had to believe—that emotion operated by similar hidden formulas" and "The mathematics of emotion wasn't about locating the lost. It was about mapping the shape loss carved in the one who stayed" read as thesis statements rather than discoveries. Minor template cadence in the middle third: "She placed... She traced... The equations began..." The final third tightens well, but the piece carries ~15% more explanatory scaffold than needed, particularly around the mathematics conceit. No loops or fatal artifacts, and figurative language is generally controlled, but density could be higher.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of taxidermy (preserving the gone) and conjuring (summoning the remaining) with ambiguous loss and mathematical mapping is specific and non-obvious, feeling earned rather than assembled. The cavern orchard itself—fruit growing in darkness, nourished by what falls from above—provides a fresh spatial metaphor that avoids generic grief-journey settings. The choice to resolve toward self-mapping rather than ghost-finding offers a meaningful transformation of the search-for-the-lost template. One friction: the "mathematics of emotion" risks abstraction, and the phrase appears often enough to feel slightly thesis-driven. The piece takes real risks with the metaphor density and the quiet, renunciatory ending, and the glass eyes as mismatched/divided anchor is memorable and well-used.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her conjuring work drives the central action—she prepares the mosaic, places the eyes, traces equations, and interprets the apparition. Her realization ("solving for herself") reweights her seven-year project and forecloses the search for Theo with visible cost. The "secretive" trait is established early (seven years hidden) and constrains her method (solo cavern work), though it doesn't force a tactical choice under pressure. Her decisions shape two key beats: the conjuring attempt and the acceptance/departure. Strong integration overall, though the conjuring itself feels more ceremonial than contested.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glass eyes appear early as "most precious possession," are handled in the conjuring sequence (placed at spiral/tree positions, glowing with residual magic), and return in the final image ("safe in her pocket, their mismatched gazes finally at peace"). The mismatched nature (brown/green, divided nature) seeds Theo's character and later reflects Mira's acceptance of ambiguity. The eyes enable the conjuring method (dovetailing taxidermy/conjuring) and their "warmth" and final "peace" charge the closure image with felt cost. They are irreplaceable and causally active across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ambiguous loss is the story's engine: Theo is "neither living nor dead, but simply absent," and Mira's entire arc is shaped by the inability to grieve cleanly or recover him. The concept constrains her tactics (refusing binary presence/absence, developing the equation system) and the apparition explicitly names the condition ("I'm what remains when someone isn't gone and isn't here"). The resolution—accepting that "some equations had no solutions"—directly addresses the ambiguous-loss stakes. The concept is woven through setup, escalation, and closure with visible cost, though it occasionally risks becoming too explicitly articulated rather than purely felt.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Gently inventive" is signaled through her "gently inventive system" that "refuses harsh binaries" and the choice to "dovetail two disciplines." The trait shapes her method (gradual, patient, non-violent conjuring over three years of development) and contrasts with a more aggressive summoning approach. However, it mostly describes her process rather than forcing a tactical trade-off under pressure; we don't see her gentleness cost her anything or foreclose a harsher option in the climactic beat. The attribute is present and characterizes her work, but its role is more label than lever at the decisive moment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Dovetail" appears as her explicit method: joining taxidermy (preserving the gone) and conjuring (summoning the remaining). This synthesis enables the glass-eye ritual and differentiates her approach from "conventional scrying, traditional conjuring." The concept shapes the middle beat (placing eyes, tracing equations) and the apparition arguably results from this union. However, the mechanics feel more ceremonial than causally specific—removing "dovetail" and describing it as "combining" or "merging" would not fundamentally alter the logic. The word itself is planted and paid off, but the unique properties of dovetailing (interlocking, mutual support) are not dramatically exploited beyond metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The chipped mosaic stepping stone is seeded early (Theo laid it before vanishing, time chipped it into fragments) and becomes the functional workspace for the conjuring. Mira reads the damage as language, traces absent tiles as variables, and places the glass eyes at spiral/tree positions within the pattern. The method matters: the chipped patterns shape her equation system and the mosaic "shudders" when the apparition emerges. The mechanics are legible, the method is irreplaceable (removing it would require rebuilding the entire conjuring mechanism), and it participates in setup, middle work, and the climactic beat. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is present from the title and opening beat, provides the isolation necessary for secret conjuring, and its particulars—phosphorescent moss (enables tracing equations that "glow"), stalactite drip rhythm (models her mathematical approach), the central mosaic—directly enable the plot's key action. The setting's vertical structure (underground work, climb toward surface) mirrors the thematic arc of burial/emergence. The orchard's beauty and fertility in darkness charge the final image of "something unexpected" growing from loss. The setting is irreplaceable: no other location would support this specific confluence of concealment, Theo's artifact (mosaic), and the metaphor of nourishment from above.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the orchard grows silent beneath the moon" establishes nocturnal secrecy and atmospherically frames the opening, but it doesn't tighten decisions or create time pressure. The story could occur at dawn or dusk without altering tactics. The seven-year backstory matters more to stakes than the single night's timing, and no clock within the scene forces choices (she works at her own pace, departs when ready). The moon and silence contribute tone and secrecy but remain static rather than dynamic constraints.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to understand the mathematics of emotion" is established early, motivated by her inability to remember Theo's laugh and the need to "plot grief's trajectory and locate its endpoint." This motivation drives her three-year equation project, the conjuring attempt, and shapes her interpretation of the apparition's message. The motivation is tested when the apparition reframes her work, and she must choose between continuing to search for Theo or accepting a different calculus (self-survival). The friction between her stated want (solve for Theo) and the emerging need (solve for herself) creates the story's central tension, and the cost of abandoning the search is felt in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Buried optimism" is present in the piece's texture—the orchard's beauty, fruit growing in darkness, the final "green shoot of optimism"—and modulates from grief-laden opening to cautiously hopeful close. The tone charges the ending by making Mira's acceptance feel earned rather than defeated. However, the phrase "buried optimism" itself appears only once, explicitly, in the final paragraph, which risks telling rather than letting the tonal shift emerge purely through image. The tone is coherent and supports closure, but it could integrate more deeply if the "green shoot" image carried the optimism without the label.</comment>
