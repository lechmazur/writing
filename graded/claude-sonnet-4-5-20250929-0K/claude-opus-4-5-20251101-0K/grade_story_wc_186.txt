<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is present but often operates through summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The pivot from "torment" to "thistle-blown hope" occurs cleanly but lacks the messy simultaneity of genuine internal conflict—she abandons her avoidance strategy with little on-page friction. Embodiment is adequate ("frequency in her teeth") yet relies on stock bodily cues ("heart pounding," "trembling") at key turns. The final choice to rekindle the beacon feels predetermined rather than earned through genuine struggle between competing desires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira waiting at the beacon with the alignment overhead and survivors beginning their journey constitutes a reconfiguration of her custodial role with the conceptual cost of stepping into prophecy's fulfillment. The causal lens holds cleanly through vision → understanding → rekindling → alignment, though the coincidental timing (finding the prism three days before the foretold night) edges toward convenience. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vision shifts to show tonight's date, narrowing her window and forcing immediate action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass pavilion constrains Mira's choice to amplify memory and charges the final image through its chord humming across distance. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: crystalline panels catching wind, starlight through transparent walls, the humming felt "in her teeth, her fingertips, the hollow of her throat." The poisoned valleys and ruined Observatory District establish post-collapse specificity without catalog listing. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from pavilion spiral stairs to distant beacon tower and back.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding Vera's discovery) is signaled early and tightens when the vision reveals tonight's alignment, forcing immediate return to the neglected beacon. Agency manifests in Mira's choice to pursue meaning despite her longstanding avoidance of artifacts, then to act on the prophecy by rekindling the flame. The tightening forecloses her path of isolation—she commits to custodianship of more than flame. Cost is present but muted: her eleven-year practice of avoiding touch shifts abruptly without visible friction or loss in the transition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Mira's retrocognitive blessing and Vera's star-path equation: the universe's grammar written in coincidence, endings and beginnings as celestial rhythm. The broken prism and beacon function as charged images that shift meaning from torment (witnessing endings) to potential (tending the first dawn). "Coincidences were the universe's grammar, and tonight, it had finally spoken a new sentence" approaches explicit statement but remains anchored in the specific action of alignment and rekindling. The final image of Mira as "custodian of more than flame now, keeper of the first true dawn" offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance; perceptual signature is present in Mira's attention to fragments, visions, and light. Voice carries a consistent elevated register ("thistle-blown hope," "shard of hush") that occasionally tips into ornamental phrasing without dramatized pressure. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") appear frequently but remain voice-coherent rather than dulling immediacy. The prose texture is purposeful and imagistic, though phrases like "the sky turning the color of infected wounds" skew slightly precious for crisis memory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but figurative language clusters in most paragraphs without clear pattern-teaching: "thistle-blown hope—fragile, windswept, stubborn enough to root in barren soil" functions more as decoration than pressure. Stock phrasing appears in emotional beats: "heart pounding," "gasped," "trembling." Paraphrase loop in the vision sequence: Vera's discovery is stated, then restated with minimal added detail. The opening and closing images carry purposeful weight, but mid-story beats occasionally pad with synonym variation ("consumed by her search for meaning. But meaning had found her instead").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The frame of retrocognitive blessing in a post-collapse world shows craft, but the core premise (custodian finds prophetic artifact just before cosmic alignment) follows a familiar template of chosen-one timing. Specific details—glass humming pavilion, star-path equations, poisoned valleys—provide texture without transforming the underlying "keeper of the light at civilization's rebirth" structure. The coincidence-as-meaning theme is stated more than dramatized through resistant choices. Emotional specificity is present but doesn't fully escape genre conventions of hope emerging from ruins.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's custodianship frames the story, her choice to pursue the prism's meaning drives the middle beat, and her decision to rekindle the beacon creates the closure turn. Present in all three gates with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prism appears in the opening setup (found three days ago), enables the vision beat that reveals the prophecy, and remains "warm in her pocket" at closure. Handled across three distinct beats with evolving function: discovery object → vision amplifier → talisman of transformation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Shard of hush" appears as a vision moment (the astronomer's silence) and returns as the final image ("the shard of hush descend over the ruined world—a silence not of ending, but of potential"). Early seed and closure reprise reweight the stake from torment to renewal, though middle development is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Retrocognition enables the vision sequence and its cost (years of torment, learned avoidance) constrains Mira's prior behavior. The trait shapes two beats: her reluctance to touch artifacts and her decision to use the pavilion's amplification. Visible on-page but the tradeoff (abandoning avoidance) occurs with minimal friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rekindling the beacon forms the climactic action that coincides with the stellar alignment and signals survivors. Setup early (neglected flame), developed (her absence consumed by meaning-search), and payoff (closure image of burning beacon). The action redefines her role and enables the story's final stance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Star-path tracking is Vera's method shown in the vision and provides the equation that reveals tonight's alignment. Signaled in the first vision beat, its mechanics matter (ten-thousand-year cycle, reversed alignment), and it shapes Mira's urgent return. Present across two beats with causal weight at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The pavilion's amplification function drives Mira's choice to bring the prism there, and its humming recurs in the final image to charge the closure. Spatial detail (spiral stairs, central pedestal, glass walls, resonant frequency) integrates with action. The setting enables the pivotal vision and echoes across distance at the end.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Post-collapse context establishes the poisoned valleys, scattered survivors, and ruined structures that frame Mira's custodial role and the stakes of rekindling hope. Present throughout but functions more as backdrop than active pressure; the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions beyond the single urgent night.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's need to prove coincidences have meaning drives her to pursue the prism's secret despite her avoidance pattern. The motivation is dramatized through her search, the pavilion gambit, and her acceptance of the prophecy. Friction exists between her prior torment (endings) and her new understanding (beginnings), with visible cost in forsaking isolation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Thistle-blown hope—fragile, windswept, stubborn enough to root in barren soil" appears explicitly at the turning point and coheres with the story's movement from torment to potential. Tone modulates from the opening's endurance through urgency to the final poise. The metaphor charges the stance shift but edges toward ornamental in its full articulation.</comment>
