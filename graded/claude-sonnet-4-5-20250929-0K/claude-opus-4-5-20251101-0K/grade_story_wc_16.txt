<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior stakes (guilt, cowardice dressed as righteousness) drive the reconciliation choice with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and particular to her profession ("symphonies of truth hidden in ancient syntax"). Elias's "careful recklessness" operates as a label more than embodied contradiction, and his interior access is thin. The final mutual promise forecloses three years of silence with felt cost, though the shift from anger to forgiveness accelerates in the final third without intermediate friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): mutual promises voiced, silence broken, work begun together—options narrow from divergence to collaboration with felt relational cost. Drive lens is Causal with lyric texture: Maren's discovery of Veth'ari → invitation → mutual confession → decision to translate together. One meaningful tightening (the voiced promises) reconfigures the sibling relationship. Orientation anchors (archive, Maren POV, tonight-before-tomorrow timeframe) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. Cost is emotional and relational, legible in "I blamed you…I couldn't bear to blame myself."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archive is vivid ("dust and forgotten vowels," phosphorescent moss) and pressures the reconciliation via its symbolic weight and the Veth'ari ink well as focal object. Spatial choreography (corridors, small chamber, pedestal) remains clear. The glass ink well constrains choice by anchoring the promise ritual and charges the final image ("empty of ink but full of possibility"). Sensory detail is selective and atmosphere-driven, though occupation-level linguistics remains abstract rather than tactile in the translation work itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore trust before paths diverge) is signaled early and tightens once: Maren's invitation → mutual confession → commitment to stay and translate. Agency is clear: Maren chooses vulnerability, Elias reciprocates, both forfeit their planned divergence. The tightening is protagonist-driven and narrows options from permanent separation to tentative reunion with visible cost (admitting cowardice, enduring forgiveness). One pressure point is sufficient at this length; the cost ("I blamed you…because I couldn't bear to blame myself") is legible on the page and forecloses the path of continued silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (truth as symphony, interconnected promises, silence as cowardice) emerges organically from the Veth'ari linguistics without thesis statement. The glass ink well and the concept of interconnected vows shape the reconciliation without overt moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: empty ink well "full of possibility" reweights prior silence as the raw material for new speech. Subtext operates in gesture and implication ("your anger was easier to endure than your forgiveness"). No diagnostic label-speak or thematic echo in the final paragraph; the image does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV (Maren) is stable; psychic distance and narrative certainty remain consistent. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated ("cathedral of silence," "careful recklessness," "cautious exuberance coloring each syllable"). Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot; Elias's lines feel distinct in rhythm and lexicon ("That sounds terrifying" vs. Maren's technical excitement). Minor filter-verb presence ("She watched understanding dawn") does not dull immediacy. Perceptual signature is professional (linguistic terminology) but remains accessible; no head-hopping or tense slips.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic texture. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; figurative language ("grief had calcified into accusations") is coherent and purposeful. Clarity and propulsion are strong through the climax. Minor overwriting in the opening ("cathedral of silence where dead tongues waited for resurrection") adds texture without obscuring causality. Zero scaffolding or synonym churn; the final image ("empty of ink but full of possibility") recharges prior material cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The frame (extinct language as reconciliation tool) offers a fresh synthesis of linguistics and sibling estrangement. Veth'ari's promise-as-becoming mechanic is specific and non-obvious, transforming the "magical reconciliation language" trope through grounded worldbuilding. Emotional specificity (blaming the absent sibling to avoid self-blame) avoids generic templates. The archive setting and arcane-linguist lens feel particular to this story. Risk-taking (technical linguistics framing an emotional arc) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the Veth'ari exposition in the middle third slows momentum slightly before the payoff.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (arcane linguist) drives two key turns: discovering Veth'ari and inviting Elias, then voicing the first promise that precipitates mutual confession. Her professional lens (hearing "symphonies of truth") shapes perception and tactics throughout. Profession is causally active, not ornamental. Present in setup (opening paragraph), middle choice (showing the ink well), and closure (beginning translation together). Cost is tied to her insight: professional knowledge enables the vulnerability that forecloses silence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Glass ink well appears in three beats: pedestal reveal, dual touch during confession, final image. Early signal (middle third setup) and closure linkage are strong ("empty of ink but full of possibility" reweights prior material). Specificity matters: dried crystalline residue, faceted surface, light refraction. The object enables the promise ritual and charges the ending. Causal pressure is moderate; it frames rather than narrows options. Cost connection: the empty well symbolizes the sibling relationship's potential, tying visual detail to relational stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" shapes stakes (truth as harmony vs. dissonance) and tactics (voicing interconnected promises to "unsnarl every lie"). Present in setup (Maren's belief system), middle exposition (Veth'ari mechanics), and closure framing (forming "first movements of a new symphony"). The concept enables the reconciliation strategy but remains more thematic than tactical; it doesn't narrow on-page options as much as frame them. Causal role is present but secondary to the emotional confession itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Carefully reckless" is labeled twice (childhood memory, final smile) but not embodied in on-page choice with visible cost. Elias's decision to stay and reciprocate confession could demonstrate the trait, but the text doesn't explicitly link risk calculation to abandonment. Present in setup (character description) and closure echo ("unfamiliar yet achingly recognizable"), but swappable with "cautious yet bold" without structural loss. No distinct middle beat where the trait constrains action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" drives the core action: Maren wants to "unsnarl every lie I've told myself" and mutual confession does unsnarl the "half-truths and unspoken accusations." Present in setup ("accusations neither could unsnarl"), middle turn (Maren's promise to unsnarl her lies), and implicit in closure (beginning the work of untangling via translation). The verb is specific and causally active, tying linguistics to emotion. Not easily swappable; "resolve" or "fix" would lose the linguistic texture and tangled-thread metaphor that bridges profession and estrangement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Interconnected promises" is signaled in the Veth'ari exposition (middle third) and executed in the mutual confession, shaping the reconciliation method. Present in setup concept (Veth'ari mechanics explained), middle development (Maren proposes making a promise in Veth'ari), and closure participation (both voice promises that form "interconnected" new symphony). Mechanics matter: the idea that vows link to every other vow creates the framework for mutual vulnerability. Moderate causal pressure; the method frames rather than tightens options, but it's integral to how reconciliation occurs.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Extinct Language Archive pressures the reconciliation via symbolic weight (dead tongues awaiting resurrection mirror silent siblings) and provides the Veth'ari resource. Present in setup (opening sensory grounding), middle development (archive chambers supply the ink well and texts), and closure (staying to translate in the archive space). The setting enables discovery and frames the work ahead. Micro-setting (small chamber, pedestal, phosphorescent moss) alters tactics by creating intimate confrontation space. Not merely postcard; the archive's function (preserving lost speech) directly charges the theme of restoring broken communication.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Before paths diverge" creates narrative urgency: tomorrow Elias leaves north, Maren descends to vaults, "perhaps forever." Time constraint is signaled in setup ("one night remained"), tightens the middle choice (Maren must act tonight), and is resolved in closure (Elias decides "I'll stay" instead of leaving at morning). The deadline alters tactics by forcing immediate vulnerability rather than deferral. Clock is tracked and live; the "until morning" window pressures the confession and narrows the decision space. Felt cost: staying forecloses the planned northern departure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation (restore trust after silence) is dramatized in every beat: Maren's hope "trembling beneath" inadequate words, her search for "words powerful enough to rebuild," mutual confession of blame and cowardice, final commitment to translate together. Desire is conflicted with visible cost: admitting "I blamed you…because I couldn't bear to blame myself" requires confronting self-deception. Present in setup (three-year silence, Maren's invitation), middle friction (fear that forgiveness is harder than anger), and closure (choosing collaboration over divergence). The want-versus-fear tension is embodied and drives the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is named once late ("cautious exuberance coloring each syllable") but embodied throughout: Maren's excitement building "despite her caution," "careful recklessness" remembered, final tentativeness mixed with hope ("cautious exuberance" explicit; "two linguists learning to speak again" balances fragility and possibility). Tone modulates with pressure: opening weight and silence → middle intellectual excitement tempered by emotional risk → ending hopefulness shadowed by years of damage. The final image ("empty of ink but full of possibility") charges the tone without resolving it into simple optimism. Coherent and purposeful across turns.</comment>
