<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's resiliently positive stance is embodied through her cheerful dialogue and laugh during splitting pain, but her interior life remains thin—we get voice ("smile anyway") more than contradiction or genuine cost-driven choice. The decision to pour the hourglass feels less like a turn forced by competing impulses and more like acceptance of a known role. Secondary characters flicker as static props without exerting real pressure. The grandmother backstory seeds the hourglass but does not complicate Mara's present choice with friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara stays aboard holding the now-filling hourglass, crystallizing her role as rescuer of other lost souls with felt cost (she alone remembers, passengers disembark into a world that has moved on). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered voices on the radio, phosphorescence patterns, and the final image of starlight gathering in the hourglass. Orientation anchors arrive quickly (ferry, deckhand, seventeen minutes). One meaningful deepening when the hourglass is upended and the grotto shudders, reweighting all prior material. Cost is legible: Mara endures splitting pain and permanent liminality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The spectral grotto is vivid and purposeful: luminescent water, impossible stars, walls reflecting every lost ferry. The setting constrains choice—Mara must reach the grotto to act, and the radio only works there. The hourglass warming in her hands and the phosphorescence rearranging into patterns charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear (ferry deck → grotto → harbor), and the sensory hierarchy (salt, static electricity, starlight) reflects Mara's focus. Minor: the grotto's mechanics (how it opens, why Mara can act when passengers can't) remain vague, but the effect supports the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: passengers trapped between departure and arrival. One meaningful tightening when Mara pours the hourglass, narrowing options (act now or remain liminal forever). Agency is decision with on-page cost: the splitting pain and her permanent role as witness. The escalation reads under the Accumulative lens—density builds through radio voices, pattern alignment, and the grotto shudder. Minor: the passengers' flickering is described but never tested as a complication; Mara's choice feels inevitable rather than forced by competing pressures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of time's net structure and liminality emerges through phosphorescence patterns, dual timelines, and the empty-then-filling hourglass. The final image (Mara holding starlight hourglass, alone remembering) offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the passengers' mimed emotions and Mara's bright-edged voice masking isolation. Minor: "time runs sideways" and "permanent transients" brush close to thematic echo, but the concept is embodied enough in the grotto mechanics to avoid sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mara's resiliently positive filter colors her narration ("Beautiful evening for a dissolving"). Diction remains consistent and controlled ("spectral grotto," "phosphorescence," "membrane between worlds"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("I know what you want"). POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Minor: under peak stress (splitting pain), the voice remains composed and articulate without compression or syntactic breakdown, slightly dulling the embodied urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; lines do multiple jobs (the hourglass both seeds backstory and drives closure). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Minor artifacts: "somehow" appears twice as a causality hedge; "the moment when clocks run sideways and destinations become theoretical" leans slightly abstract for the established voice. The final paragraph's parallel structure ("other ferries, other grottoes, other souls") feels template-cadenced but serves closure. No loops or major scaffolding. Clarity remains strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of vanishing ferry + parallel timelines + empty-then-filling hourglass feels specific and purposeful, not derivative. The grotto mechanics (phosphorescence as map, radio layering voices) add fresh texture. Risk-taking in the unconventional structure (no antagonist, Accumulative lens, conceptual cost) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor: the "choosing left or right around rocks" divergence point reads slightly mechanical, a familiar split-timeline trope without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara appears early and her choice (pouring hourglass) creates the key turn at closure. Her deckhand role is signaled immediately and her resilient positivity constrains her voice throughout. She drives two beats: discovering the grotto mechanics and acting to merge timelines. Cost is visible (splitting pain, permanent liminality). Cap reasoning: while her decision alters outcome, her interior contradiction is thin—she accepts rather than struggles, reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The hourglass is seeded early (grandmother's gift), handled in two distinct beats (Mara pulling it from her pocket, upending it over water), and returns with reweighted meaning (filling with starlight at closure). Its mechanics matter: it collects scattered seconds and enables the merge. Specificity is high—empty-then-filling is irreplaceable. Cost is tied to its use (splitting pain). Closure linkage is strong. Minor: the hourglass's exact function ("collecting time") is told more than dramatized through action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vanishing ferry is the premise and shapes stakes from the opening line. It constrains Mara's world (seventeen minutes of dissolving, passengers flickering) and drives the dominant conflict (trapped between timelines). The concept changes options: without the vanishing, no grotto access, no merge. Closure directly resolves it (ferry solidifies, docks). Present in all three gates. Minor: the mechanics of vanishing (why Mara alone remains whole) are asserted rather than earned through action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's resilient positivity is embodied in dialogue ("Beautiful evening for a dissolving") and her laugh during splitting pain. It constrains her voice throughout and shapes her choice to stay aboard at the end. Present early. However, it does not visibly trade off against another impulse or cost her a specific option—she never wavers, so the trait feels more like characterization than a driver of conflict. Cap at mid-band for label-plus-embodiment without friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The radio is seeded early (crackling at her belt) and used in a key beat (layered voices signal the merge mechanics). It constrains setting (only works in the grotto) and shapes Mara's understanding. Present in setup and middle. However, it does not appear in or shape the closure image (the hourglass does that work), and could be replaced by another communication device with minor edits. Mid-band for functional participation without closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Interconnected patterns" is signaled early (phosphorescence tracing water, reflections aligning) and shapes the middle beat (Mara reads the divergence in the patterns). The method matters: without pattern alignment, no merge. It appears at closure (grotto shudders, stars wheel). However, the mechanics remain abstract—what specifically makes patterns interconnect is told, not shown through action. Cap in lower-7s for setup-middle-closure presence with moderate causal pressure but low specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The spectral grotto is discovered early (third crossing) and pressures all middle action: it is the only place the radio works, the hourglass can be used, and the merge attempted. Setting provides resources (luminescent water, pattern walls) that alter outcome. It charges the closure image (walls fade, harbor lights replace them). Spatial constraints are legible and irreplaceable. Strong setup-middle-closure integration with causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"When clocks run sideways" is signaled early (opening line: "time was not a river but a net") and shapes the premise (passengers trapped in a moment). However, it does not tighten a specific decision or create a countdown. The timeframe is conceptual rather than tactical—no live clock alters Mara's moves. Present in setup and thematically at closure (fifteen years mourned, starlight filling hourglass), but swappable with "timeless" or "frozen" with minor edits. Mid-band for thematic presence without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to merge timelines is stated early ("You want the passengers to arrive") and dramatized in her choice to pour the hourglass. The desire is tested: splitting pain and permanent liminality are the cost. It drives the dominant conflict and shapes closure (passengers disembark, Mara stays). Minor: the motivation feels accepted rather than conflicted—no friction between her want and another cost or fear. Strong setup-middle-closure presence with visible cost, but low internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Permanent transient" tone is coherent from the opening (Mara's bright-edged voice, passengers flickering) and modulates under pressure (splitting pain, laugh). It charges the final image (Mara alone, remembering, holding starlight). The tone is purposeful and specific to the lens (Accumulative/Textural). However, it remains steady rather than shifting—no tonal break or escalation that reweights the stake. Strong presence and closure linkage, moderate modulation.</comment>
