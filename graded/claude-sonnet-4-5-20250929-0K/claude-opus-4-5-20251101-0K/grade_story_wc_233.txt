<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The queen's contradictory impulses—wanting truth while fearing it, needing the advisor who poisoned her husband—act simultaneously in scene through embodied choices (the climb itself, settling across from the oracle despite exhaustion). The recovered memory beat earns the final stance with visible cost: seven years of complicity. Minor slip: "softly commanding" appears twice as a label without full dramatization of the trait's tradeoff under pressure, though her deliberate movements down the mountain partly compensate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise: the queen descends with clarified purpose, the final lines crystallizing her new stance ("some truths, buried long enough, become weapons") with felt cost—acknowledging her cowardice/survival and the upcoming confrontation. Causal lens holds: dream → climb → oracle's prodding → memory recovery → descent with intent. One meaningful tightening (the recovered memory) narrows options decisively. Orientation anchors (queen, ridge base, post-warning timeframe) arrive cleanly within the opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto's bleeding starlight constrains the queen's realization (she watches the phenomenon from her dreams made real, triggering the memory), and the fireflies charge the oracle's declaration of the sign. Spatial choreography tracks clearly (base, climb, threshold, interior, descent). Sensory hierarchy reflects the queen's dual crisis: physical (slick handholds, burning muscles) and existential (luminescent ichor, lacy mist). The cobalt walls and cloudline function as more than postcard; they supply the pressure-vessel for revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel the recurring dreams to act against an unseen enemy) is signaled early and tightens once through the oracle's confrontation, which forces the queen to retrieve the buried memory. That recovery forecloses the path of willful ignorance with visible cost: she must now act against the man who sustained her. The climb itself is a secondary physical test that mirrors the internal escalation. Agency is choice (the decision to climb, then to descend with purpose) with undeniable on-page price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—the weaponization of suppressed truth, survival versus cowardice—emerges from the bleeding starlight motif, the oracle's blunt honesty, and the queen's recovered memory without thesis statement. The final image (truths become weapons) resonates non-literally, reweighting the entire climb and the seven-year silence. The fireflies' impossible ascent functions as earned symbol, not ornament: they mirror the queen's defiance of her prior inertia. Subtext operates cleanly in the oracle's sparse dialogue and the queen's bodily reluctance during the ascent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the queen's noticing is shaped by her dual roles (girlhood climber, burdened monarch) and the prose modulates with her emotional state—terse and physical during the climb, more reflective in the grotto, propulsive at descent. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext ("You came after the final warning" / "I came because of it"). Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: "her voice softly commanding despite the exhaustion" slightly tells what the surrounding action already shows, though the phrase serves character continuity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; most sentences advance image, choice, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully (short bursts during the climb, longer legato sentences in the grotto). One template-cadence cluster in the penultimate section: "By dawn... By noon... By evening..." reads mechanical but is brief and does not obscure closure. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and charge the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—recovered traumatic memory housed in recurring dreams, externalized via a physical pilgrimage to an oracle above the clouds—feels specific and earned in hindsight. The bleeding starlight and fireflies transform familiar fantasy motifs through concrete anchoring (mineral deposits, cloudbank ascent). Risk-taking is moderate: the structure and revelation are legible without gimmickry, though the trope of the wise oracle and the poisoned-king backstory are familiar. The ending's restraint (preparation rather than confrontation) and the queen's self-aware "cowardice and survival" line add freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The disenchanted queen drives every major turn: her choice to climb despite the warning, her demand for plain words, her acceptance of the oracle's confrontation, and her decision to descend with lethal intent. Introduced immediately, present across all beats, and her final stance (arming herself with buried truth) would collapse without her agency. Cost is visible: acknowledging complicity and preparing to act against her sustainer.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ember grotto appears early (paragraph two) and is used across three distinct beats: arrival (threshold pause watching the bleeding starlight), interior revelation (sitting across from the oracle), and implied departure (she begins the climb down). It provides the pressure-vessel for the memory recovery and its cobalt shimmer charges the closure section. Slightly shy of indispensable: the revelation could occur in another high-stakes location, though the grotto's dream-echo function is strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight shapes stakes directly: it is the recurring dream image that compels the queen's climb, and its physical manifestation in the grotto triggers the memory breakthrough ("the bleeding starlight pressed against her lids, and she remembered"). Present in opening dreams, the grotto description, and the final paragraph's callback. The concept alters options (dream → pilgrimage → recovered knowledge → weaponized truth). Strong integration, though the mechanics of why starlight "bleeds" remain impressionistic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Softly commanding" appears twice as a descriptor (paragraph eight and final section) and is embodied in the queen's deliberate climb and her composed demand for clarity despite exhaustion. It enables her to hold authority in the grotto and frames her final descent. However, the trait is more label than on-page tradeoff; we don't see a moment where soft command costs her or where a harsher approach was available and rejected. Functional but not deeply causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The climb is the story's spine: introduced in paragraph three, it occupies the entire middle (handholds, burning muscles, lacy mist), and the descent bookends the arc with transformed purpose. Major turns trace to it: physical struggle mirrors internal resistance, arrival at the grotto enables the oracle encounter, and the descent literalizes her newfound resolve. Swapping "climb" for another journey form (crossing a river, entering a crypt) would require structural redesign. The action is irreplaceable and shapes closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shared exhale and fireflies are signaled in paragraph fifteen as "the sign" and function as the hinge for the oracle's final explanation: the queen already knew everything. The simultaneous breath underscores the moment's synchronicity and charges the revelation. Present in the closure third, though not introduced earlier; if seeded in the opening or mid-climb, integration would be tighter. Still, the fireflies' impossible ascent mirrors the queen's defiance and reweights the grotto scene.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto above clouds is introduced early (paragraph two), explored in detail (paragraphs six, eight, fifteen), and its bleeding starlight directly triggers the memory that alters the queen's stance. The setting supplies both physical constraint (treacherous climb gates access) and perceptual catalyst (dream made real). The grotto is the crucible; without it, the revelation loses its charged vessel. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"After the final warning" is the opening anchor and frames urgency: the queen climbs because the warning has already been delivered, and the closing lines impose a live clock ("By dawn... By noon... By evening..."). The timeframe tightens decisions—there is no more deferral available—and the night climb plus the impending palace return shape tactics. Not a second-by-second countdown, but the post-warning pressure is legible and sustained.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Unraveling the mystery of recurring dreams is stated explicitly (paragraph eight: "Every night for three months. I need to know why") and drives the climb, the grotto encounter, and the oracle's prodding. The queen's friction between wanting truth and fearing its cost is dramatized in her climb (body remembering, mind resisting) and the oracle's challenge. The revelation delivers the answer with cost: the dreams were buried memory, not prophecy. Desire is embodied and conflicted throughout.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lacy menace operates from the opening image (husband's blood in patterns repeated in dreams) through the climb (mist curling "like funeral shrouds," trying to "drag her back"), the grotto's bleeding starlight, and the final weaponized truth. Tone modulates with pressure: foreboding during ascent, stark in the oracle confrontation, coiled and purposeful at descent. The "lacy" quality—delicate yet ensnaring—charges the final image of the queen hidden in mist, ready to strike. Coherent and intensifying.</comment>
