<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior life shows embodied emotion (weeping over the shell, heart-hammering) and a clear arc from fear to understanding. However, the climactic realization "The cicada had not fought its shell. It had simply become too vast to be contained" arrives as an epiphany without sufficient prior dramatized struggle—it feels declared rather than earned through on-page choice. The supporting cast (groundskeeper, child, old man) are mentioned but never pressure her directly, remaining abstract. The final descent feels inevitable but lacks visible cost; we don't see what she forfeits by this choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation cleanly (sky-bridge, orchard, statues) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Mira's music cracks the statues and she begins her descent to "reawaken every sleeping dreamer." The causal lens holds through most beats (playing → statue climbs → she signals → others join → statues crack), but the middle pivot—heartbeat signaling that triggers mass synchronization—happens off-page and feels convenient rather than motivated by prior cause-effect linkage. The cost (the old laws ending, her vulnerability on the bridge) is somewhat abstract; we see the statues crack but not what Mira personally loses or risks in that final image. One meaningful tightening is present when the statue begins climbing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard, sky-bridge, and statues are vividly anchored with sensory detail (rotting fruit, frost, silvered planks, marble eyes). The environment directly constrains choice: the bridge's height gives her safety, the statues' proximity creates urgency, and the crystalline pulse network becomes a tactical resource. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (statue climbing ladder, Mira descending). The final image of apple blossoms falling upward charges the setting with thematic weight and makes the "enchanted orchard" rules integral to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—playing forbidden music without recalibration—is signaled early and escalates when the statue climbs. Mira's agency (choosing to signal via heartbeat rather than submit) drives the turn. However, the escalation relies heavily on a deus ex: her months of practice and the existence of a hidden network are told rather than tested on-page before the climax. The cost at closure (statues cracking, system ending) is conceptual and collective rather than a personal, visible price Mira pays. The synchronization of "others" happens off-stage, reducing the felt immediacy of the final stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (beauty as organic resistance to mechanical control) emerges through images—the shell, the soft violin, heartbeats—and the contrast between approved harmonies and "wild" music. The cicada metaphor threads through and reweights at the end. However, the final paragraphs slip into thematic summary: "Beauty was not mechanical, could not be regulated" and "Now there was only the work of becoming free" are overt thesis statements rather than implied resonance. The gap between "knowing and understanding" is named repeatedly but not dramatized through a specific choice that embodies the transition. The ending offers conceptual repricing but states it rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and lyric, with controlled rhythm ("That softness had kept her alive") and a perceptual signature (peripheral glances, dust patterns, the way sound is cataloged). Psychic distance remains stable; interiority is filtered through Mira's musicianship and heightened awareness. The prose modulates effectively under pressure (shorter syntax when the statue climbs). No dialogue to evaluate. Minor filter-verb density in reflective passages ("she had learned," "she had wept") slightly dulls immediacy but remains voice-consistent. The final line's syntactic shift ("one heartbeat at a time") integrates rhythm with theme without overreach.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in action beats. However, the piece carries noticeable scaffold: "She had always known this moment would come" is a stock phrase; "The question was whether she would..." is an and-then connector. The cicada explanation ("The cicada had not fought its shell. It had simply become too vast to be contained. Mira understood now.") is a three-line paraphrase loop stating the same insight. Figurative language is dense ("resonantly soft," "tarnished wonder," "silence they had planted in your throat") but mostly coherent. The loop and stock phrasing cluster in the middle third, dulling momentum before the climax. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loop and template stems ("She had," "The statue").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise (musician resisting aesthetic tyranny via bodily signaling) offers a fresh synthesis of surveillance-state and embodied-art resistance tropes. The cicada-shell metaphor is specific and apt. However, the "heartbeat code" solution and the synchronized uprising feel like late-introduced conveniences that resolve the problem without prior causal groundwork—months of practice are told, not shown pressuring her choices earlier. The statue-cracking finale echoes numerous "magic breaks rigid system" climaxes. The transformation is present but relies on telling (her "theory," the "others hidden throughout") rather than dramatized particulars that make the ending feel inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout, frames the opening, drives the middle turn (choosing to signal rather than submit), and executes the closure action (playing with "genuine feeling," then descending). Her decision to shift her song and use heartbeat code creates the key reversal. Removing her specific choices (signaling, continuing to play) would collapse the plot. Strong setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The locust shell appears in paragraph five (weeping discovery) and returns at closure ("crumbled to dust in her palm, its purpose fulfilled"). The shell seeds the metaphor that Mira articulates mid-story and its destruction bookends her transformation. However, between discovery and crumble it is handled only once on-page and does not constrain a middle choice—it remains symbolic rather than tactically functional. Two touches with thematic reprise, but limited beat involvement. Early setup and closure linkage present; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Breaking free" is the story's engine: Mira breaks from compliance, the cicada metaphor literalizes escape from confinement, and the ending depicts systemic rupture. The concept shapes her tactics (soft playing, heartbeat signaling to evade detection) and the climax (playing beyond the shell, statues cracking). The story cannot function without this exact concept. Setup, development, and payoff all present with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Resonantly soft" is introduced early as Mira's survival tactic: "That softness had kept her alive. The statues hunted for defiance in volume." It constrains her method throughout (she cannot use crescendos) and enables her final move (softness becomes genuine feeling the statues cannot measure). The attribute drives at least two beats and is indispensable to both her prior survival and the closure turn. Strong setup, development, and payoff with visible cost (she cannot play loudly, forcing subtler resistance).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Uproot" appears in the middle as Mira's heartbeat signal: "Three quick beats, two slow, three quick again: uproot. Uproot everything." The signal triggers the synchronized uprising that cracks the statues. However, the action is named once and its execution happens off-page (the "others" respond unseen). It enables closure but is not dramatized across multiple beats. Setup in middle third, payoff at closure with causal link, but swappable with another code word ("rise," "break") without structural loss. Mid-high band: integral to closure but limited specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heart-rhythm signaling is introduced in paragraph seven ("For months, she had practiced this—slowing her pulse, speeding it, tapping rhythms") and executed in paragraph eight. It appears in two beats: her silent code and the collective synchronization at closure. The method is specific and enables her tactic (evading sound-monitoring statues). However, it is told as backstory rather than shown constraining an earlier choice, and the mechanics (how others receive and decode bodily rhythms) remain vague. Setup weak (late + told), development minimal, payoff present. Two-gate pass with modest causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard and living statues are established in the opening and directly pressure every beat: the statues' surveillance forces Mira to play softly, their approach triggers her decision, the orchard's "dirt remembers seeds" enables the final transformation, and the statues' cracking is the closure image. The setting supplies resources (trees, roots) and constraints (marble eyes, crystalline network) that alter tactics and outcome. Setup, development, and payoff all strong with high causal pressure and closure linkage. Removing the specific setting (statues, orchard rules) would break the story.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"The gap between knowing and understanding" is introduced with the shell discovery ("She existed in that gap...sensing the shell meant something without grasping what") and closed at the climax ("The gap...had finally closed"). The timeframe brackets her internal arc and the final line echoes it. However, it is a conceptual marker rather than a ticking clock that alters tactics; the gap does not constrain her middle choices—she signals and plays without the understanding crystallizing until told to us. Lyric reprise with thematic weight, but limited tactical pressure. Two gates (setup, payoff) with modest development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's desire to reawaken beauty is signaled early (playing forbidden folk songs) and drives her climactic choice (playing "genuine feeling" despite the statue's approach, descending to "reawaken every sleeping dreamer"). The motivation is embodied in her weeping, her refusal to submit, and her final action. However, it is stated more than tested: we see her want but not a moment where it conflicts with another desire (safety, comfort) in a way that forces a visible trade-off. Setup and closure strong; middle friction modest. High thematic integration with causal linkage to closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Tarnished wonder" appears explicitly in the penultimate paragraph ("the tarnished wonder of it all—this broken world still capable of impossible things") and the tone threads through: decayed orchard, silvered bridge, "rotting fruit," yet "apple blossoms began falling upward." The oxymoron charges the ending image. Tone modulates from vigilant restraint (opening) to defiant wonder (climax). However, the explicit naming in the final third reduces subtlety—tone is declared rather than purely embodied. Strong setup and payoff with coherent modulation, but the on-page label costs some integration credit. Closure linkage clear.</comment>
