<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is vivid and embodied through her tactile relationship with type and her mathematical framing of emotion. The borrowed-personality trait operates metaphorically but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost; the poet's grief intensifies her feeling but doesn't alter her action. The final shift to "transposed empathy" feels conceptually asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ending choice to continue printing lacks friction—no path is foreclosed, no visible sacrifice made.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors appear by the third paragraph (Mira, topaz workshop, vanishing stars). The piece accumulates density through recurring images (stars, halo fragment, type-setting) and arrives at a Conceptual Repricing: emotion as harmony rather than formula. However, the cost remains abstract—Mira smiles and continues working with no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift. The before/after legibility depends on thematic assertion ("finally understanding") rather than a dramatized constraint or loss that alters her next move.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The topaz plateau, vanishing stars, and letterpress create a vivid, constraint-rich micro-setting. The halo fragment's warmth and the press's mechanical groan anchor tactile choices. Setting charges the final image (topaz floor blazing, stars flickering) and the timeframe pressure (dissolving stars) subtly tightens urgency. Spatial choreography remains clear across beats, and sensory detail is filtered through Mira's mathematical lens without becoming a catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: complete the "great work" (emotional equation) before stars vanish. The halo fragment intensifies borrowed grief and triggers the transposition insight, which reads as one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, Mira's agency at closure is continuation, not renunciation or decision that forecloses a path. The timeframe creates ambient pressure but doesn't force a trade-off; she simply keeps printing with new understanding, so the escalation lacks a visible price that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—emotion as relational harmony versus solitary formula—emerges organically from Mira's tactile work and the transposition discovery. The final image (grief and hope's "infinite dance") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the halo fragment's pulsing rhythm and the shifting meaning of the printed questions. Minor slip: "lucid turbulence of finally understanding" edges toward thematic echo, but the phrase is embedded in action and image rather than standing as naked thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; diction carries a consistent mathematical-poetic idiom ("time's cruel asymptote," "truth sometimes emerged sideways"). Perceptual signature is strong: Mira notices via geometry and equations. Two minor slips: "the peculiar joy of being understood" in the printed text reads slightly diagnostic for a letterpress output, and "lucid turbulence" in the final paragraph veers toward meta-label. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood") are voice-appropriate and don't dull immediacy here.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyric and image-dense with strong figurative control ("sky hemorrhaging light," "stretched thin as hammered gold"). Minor overwriting cluster: "loss multiplied by memory, divided by time's cruel asymptote" followed by adjacent metaphorical constructions in the same beat slightly reduces propulsion. No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. Final paragraph stacks metaphors ("intersection of loss and wonder," "transposed emotion") without pause, creating slight density drag. Information load is high but clarity holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Letterpress-as-emotional-mathematics premise is specific and non-obvious; borrowed personalities plus halo fragments create a fresh synthesis. The transposition concept (feeling transformed through borrowing) offers an inventive turn on empathy tropes. Topaz workshop under dissolving stars is vivid and particular. Risk: lyric density and abstraction could alienate, but the piece commits fully to its idiom without retreat. Transformation test passes: plot would collapse without these exact metaphysical mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira sets type, picks up the fragment, works the press, and decides to continue—four beats with causal involvement. Her choices (printing questions, reading aloud, continuing work) shape mid-story turns. However, the final choice is continuation rather than a decision that alters stakes or forecloses a path, so closure participation is thematic rather than causal. Early signal strong; beat involvement solid; closure linkage present but passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Halo fragment appears in setup (payment for prior job), middle (intensifies poet's grief, triggers transposition insight), and ending (dims, "its work complete"). It constrains Mira's emotional state and enables the key turn when it "blazed" as she reads the equations aloud. Irreplaceable: its pulsing rhythm and warmth are causally active across three beats. Cost connection: its dimming signals the transposition is complete and alters her understanding.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Transposed empathy is named and explained mid-story ("feeling transformed through the borrowing itself") and shapes Mira's final understanding that emotion is relational. It appears in the climactic press-work beat where poet's sorrow and her hope "multiplied together." However, it doesn't constrain an on-page choice with visible cost; it reframes her ongoing work rather than forcing a trade-off. Closure linkage is conceptual rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Borrowing personalities is signaled early ("wore the melancholy of a drowned poet") and recurs (poet's grief intensifies, personalities "transpose"). It enables the transposition insight but never visibly constrains a choice—Mira doesn't face a cost or tactical shift tied to over-borrowing or losing herself. The trait functions thematically (frames her search) but lacks on-page friction. Present across beats; lacks closure-level pressure or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Disorient" is enacted twice: the book of questions designed "to disorient anyone who sought certainty" and the final truth that "disoriented only those who believed certainty was possible." It shapes Mira's method and recurs in the ending image. However, it doesn't drive a major turn—no reversal hinges on disorientation. Closure linkage is thematic; the action could be swapped for "confuse" or "unsettle" with minor rewording. Early signal and reprise strong; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through deliberate ambiguity" is signaled in the book-printing beat ("each word deliberately ambiguous") and echoed at closure ("truths that disoriented only those who believed certainty was possible"). It frames Mira's craft and recurs in the ending. However, its mechanics don't alter a mid-story choice—she prints ambiguously from the start and continues. The method is thematic rather than tactical; it doesn't constrain her attempts or force adaptation under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Topaz plateau, stars, and letterpress are vivid and present from the opening. The vanishing stars create ambient pressure (universe simplifying, time running out) and the workshop supplies the press and halo fragment. The topaz floor "blazed with reflected light" charges the final image. However, the setting doesn't constrain a tactical choice—Mira's access and tools remain stable. Strong atmosphere and closure linkage; moderate causal pressure on decisions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Between vanishing stars" frames the opening and recurs ("three more stars had begun their slow dissolution," "another star vanished," "remaining stars flickered"). It creates urgency ("running out of time") and bookends the narrative. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten a specific on-page choice—Mira works at her own pace without a countdown forcing trade-offs. Lyric reprise is strong; clock pressure on tactics is ambient rather than acute.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's forty-year quest to "understand the mathematics of emotion" is signaled early and drives her type-setting, use of the halo fragment, and final insight. The motivation shapes her perception (everything filtered through equations) and culminates in the discovery that emotion is harmony, not formula. However, the desire faces no on-page friction—no competing want or cost forces her to choose between understanding and another value. Strong thematic spine; lacks conflicted choice at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Lucid turbulence" is named once in the final paragraph but enacted throughout: precise geometric imagery mixed with chaotic emotion (hemorrhaging sky, drowned poet's grief, stars dissolving). Tone modulates—calm tactile work (setting type) intensifies when the fragment blazes, then stabilizes at closure ("smiled"). The phrase "lucid turbulence of finally understanding" charges the ending and integrates the contradiction. Tone is coherent across pressure shifts and reconfigures at the final image; late explicit naming prevents higher score.</comment>
