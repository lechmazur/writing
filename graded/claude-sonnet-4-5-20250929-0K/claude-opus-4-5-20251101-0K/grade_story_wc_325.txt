<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's claustrophobia ("hated enclosed spaces") is articulated but never dramatized under pressure in the flooded station; her chest tightens once without altering tactics. The motivation to witness is declared and enacted through documentation, but the final act—writing names on deck—reads as fulfillment rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interior texture is present ("terror kept her sharp") yet the cataloging beats flatten into inventory without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The renunciation of surface comfort for deep witness is credible but lacks a micro-choice that closes an option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors promptly (elevator shaft, headlamp, flooded facility). The piece moves through a clear descent–discovery–ascent arc with minimal escalation; each body and the codex are logged without a reversal that narrows options. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mira writes the names, fulfilling her stated mission, but the cost is conceptual (endurance) rather than a visible trade-off on the page. The two-hour tidal window is declared but never tightens tactics. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through repetition (bodies, names, gold flecks) and the final list-making reweights the opening, yet the pattern does not break or intensify—it confirms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The flooded facility is vividly rendered (barnacled ceiling, corroded copper, cold pressure) and the codex's gold flecks recur with charged specificity, appearing first in the archives and again at surface to bookend the mission. The tidal window and undersea cables supply world texture but do not constrain a choice. Spatial choreography is clean (communications room, archives, laboratory, shaft ascent) and sensory detail is selective (weak-tea water, "crashing hush"). The body as micro-setting (suit, muscles burning) and the codex case both pressure Mira's endurance, lifting the score into the 8-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—bearing witness to the unremembered—is signaled early and pursued consistently, but no on-page tightening forces a trade-off. The tidal window is mentioned twice (twelve hours in backstory, two hours at return) yet never counts down or alters Mira's moves. Each discovery (body, codex, final body count) accumulates without a reversal; the ascent is "harder" physically but not tactically. Closure fulfills the stated mission without foreclosing a live alternative, and the cost (exhaustion, emotional weight) is felt but not legible as a choice that narrows options. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens but does not escalate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from concrete particulars: the codex's gold illumination, the photograph in Chen's hands, the humming cables carrying "new data to new destinations" while the dead remain silent. The final list-making answers the thematic question (who remembers the forgotten?) through action rather than statement, and the contrast between "the world perpetually moving forward" and Mira's deliberate pause charges the ending. No overt moralizing; the "gift and her curse" line risks summary but stays rooted in the witness act. The phase-transition motif (solid/liquid/gas, tidal pressure) subtly mirrors the human cost of transformation without forced symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with clear perceptual signature: Mira's professional lens (coordinates, sensors, electromagnetic ghosts) blends with emotional specificity ("strange in the flooded chamber"). The single dialogue line ("Dr. Samuel Chen…I see you") serves witness rather than conversation and carries subtext. Diction stays consistent under pressure; no filter-verb stacks or register drift. The phrase "crashing hush" recurs purposefully (opening "tidal change and then nothing but silence," closing "ocean crashed its endless hush") and modulates tone without head-hopping. Minor slip: "their stories surfacing from the deep" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic echo, but the line stays anchored in Mira's mission.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high (e.g., "The undersea cables had carried more than data; they'd carried voices, last words, pleas…"). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Two minor artifacts: "that particular silence that wasn't silence at all but the weight of an ocean holding its breath" stacks modifiers at a peak beat, and "proved that someone, finally, had returned" delivers the thematic thesis slightly on the nose. The codex description ("painstakingly applied, decorated the borders…like medieval monks") lingers without adding pressure. Propulsion is steady; the ascent paragraph compresses transit efficiently. Clarity remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise (deep-sea archaeologist documenting a drowned research station) is well-executed but not structurally novel; similar witness-and-recovery arcs are common in speculative and literary fiction. The codex's margin illumination and the phase-transition notes add textural freshness, and the choice to voice-record a scientist's name aloud in the dark is a specific, non-obvious beat. The tidal-window frame and the undersea-cable motif (data vs. voices) offer conceptual coherence. The claustrophobic-spelunker contradiction is set up but not transformed through a difficult choice. No close echoes of famous texts; the synthesis feels competent and emotionally honest but stops short of bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's claustrophobia is mentioned twice (opening paragraph, laboratory ceiling) but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; she "forced herself to breathe, to stay, to document" without visible cost. Her decisions to photograph, log coordinates, and speak names drive the documentation arc. The descent and ascent are physical actions, not choices that foreclose alternatives. Present in setup and middle, absent from closure as a shaping force.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The codex appears in two beats: discovery in the archives (sealed case, gold-flecked margins, Chen's name) and surface reprise ("gold flecks caught the dying light like small preserved stars"). The margin illumination is handled and described with specificity, and the final image reweights the opening's emphasis on beauty amid catastrophe. Not causally active in closure but charged with thematic resonance. No middle development beyond static description.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Undersea cables frame backstory (severed in 1983, twelve hours of air) and appear at the end ("hummed with new data"), but do not constrain Mira's tactics or choices on the page. The electromagnetic traces she follows are mentioned once ("sensors that tracked invisible things…still echoing through corroded copper") without shaping a beat. Present as world texture and thematic contrast (old voices vs. new data) but not as causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Tracks invisible things" is declared in one paragraph ("sensors that tracked…electromagnetic ghosts") and enables the mission's premise, but no on-page action demonstrates the attribute constraining a choice or revealing a trade-off. The trait is told rather than shown in use. Present in setup, absent from middle development and closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Return" structures the entire arc: descent, documentation, ascent, and the final act of writing names on deck ("bring the forgotten home"). The return journey is harder physically and closes with Mira's list-making, fulfilling the witness mission. The action is indispensable to the story's logic and shapes the closure image. All three gates satisfied; causal pressure across beats; strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Phase transitions appear as codex content ("experiments in phase transitions—matter shifting between states") and in one narratorial observation ("Water moved through phase transitions of its own…not temperature but pressure"). The method does not shape tactics or constrain choices; it is thematic texture. Mentioned in middle, absent from closure action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The forgotten research facility (observation domes, flooded shaft, communications room, archives, laboratory) supplies all spatial pressure and resources: bodies to document, codex to retrieve, barnacled ceilings that trigger claustrophobia. The cold and pressure preserve the bodies, enabling discovery. The facility's severed cables and redacted status drive Mira's mission. Essential across setup, middle, and closure; removal would collapse the story.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The tidal window is declared twice: "twelve hours between one tidal change and the next" (backstory) and "perhaps two hours before the currents shifted" (return). It does not count down or tighten Mira's choices on the page; she emerges "between tidal changes, gasping" without dramatized urgency. Present in setup and mentioned at closure but does not alter tactics in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to stand witness is articulated early ("someone had to remember") and enacted in every beat: photographing bodies, logging coordinates, speaking names aloud, writing the final list. The choice to say "I see you" into the recorder and the closing list-making demonstrate the desire under pressure. The cost (exhaustion, terror, isolation) is felt. Friction between the comfort of surface and the imperative to descend is implicit but not dramatized as a competing want. All three gates; strong closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Crashing hush" is coined in the opening ("the crashing hush of the deep") and reprised at closure ("ocean crashed its endless hush against the hull"), modulating from oppressive silence during discovery to elegiac rhythm during list-making. The tone—reverent, mournful, charged with quiet urgency—remains coherent across turns and charges the final image of names being written against the ocean's endless pressure. Strong setup and payoff; purposeful recurrence.</comment>
