<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is embodied through concrete actions—pressing palm to stone, carrying the cork, making tea—and her stance is rooted in her grandmother's teaching about quiet attention. The boy's grief is particularized through the funeral detail and the scent mechanism, though his manifestation as "flickering at the edges" risks abstraction. Internal contradiction appears when Mira feels "screaming tenderness" and uses the cork to filter emotions, showing layered response. The final choice to guide him through lighthouse work earns the closure, though the boy's agency remains minimal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story accretes pressure through sensory details (heat wave, dead birds, night-garden scent) and the vial cork as a charged object, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira's quiet listening manifests the boy and she offers him both witness and release. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (assistant keeper, cobalt lighthouse, after heat breaks). The closure lands on-page with felt cost—Mira takes on the burden of tending this ghost-child, foreclosing her solitude—and the lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful deepening occurs when the scent intensifies and the boy appears, reweighting Mira's vigil into active care.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, salt-crusted windows, and spiral stairs create concrete spatial choreography; the vial cork functions as a micro-setting object that constrains Mira's emotional processing and charges the final image when she holds it alongside the boy's hand. Sensory detail is purposeful: "jasmine and moonflower and wet earth" signals the supernatural call, and the shift from brutal sun to cool stone marks the atmospheric turn. The setting enables the central choice—this isolated structure is the only place "where someone might be listening"—and the final shadow across rocks roots the ending spatially.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Mira's commitment to quiet attendance versus abandonment. Pressure tightens when the night-garden scent announces the boy's impossible arrival, forcing her to choose between dismissing the manifestation or engaging. The boy's plea—"I just wanted someone to listen"—crystallizes the moral calculus: Mira can send him away or honor her principle that whispers travel farther by tending him. Agency is hers: she uses the cork to filter her emotions, extends her hand with "quiet certainty," and offers lighthouse work as a path to release. The cost is visible—she accepts ongoing care of a flickering, fragile presence—and the final image of holding both cork and ghost-hand shows the price of her listening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the grandmother's teaching about purifying intentions, dead shore birds as "fallen prayers," and the contrast between the head keeper's loud abandonment and Mira's quiet fidelity. The vial cork moves from heirloom to active tool to symbol of dual care (cork in one hand, ghost in the other), reweighting prior material without stating a moral. The boy's funeral detail—criticized for being "too quiet"—inverts into validation when Mira proves that silent calling works. The final line "some goodbyes, the quietest ones, echo across oceans" offers a resonant answer to the central question without becoming a thesis statement, though it approaches the threshold of thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-close on Mira; perceptual signature is evident in her attention to breath, texture, and vibrations. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: the boy's "I didn't mean to" and Mira's "Your mother was right" carry subtext about grief and validation. Diction is controlled—"bruise against the pale morning sky," "fingers like dried flowers"—though some phrases ("heat-induced stillness," "desperate thought could thrum") slide toward elevated abstraction. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "the vibrations of intent" paragraph tilts into exposition. The final paragraph's long compound sentence maintains rhythm under emotional weight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: "paint the exact color of exhaustion after the heat wave finally broke" does triple work (setting, mood, timeframe). Some scaffolding appears: "It didn't matter" and "She knew what the scent meant" are tell-y shortcuts. The phrase "screaming tenderness, the kind that tears at your throat even in silence" over-explains the paradox rather than trusting the image. Clarity is strong throughout, and no paraphrase loops or template cadence appears. Figurative language is dense but controlled—"bruise," "fallen prayers," "fingers like dried flowers"—though the concentration approaches overwriting in the opening third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse keeper + grief manifestation + sensory call (night-garden scent) + vial cork as intention-filter creates a specific, non-obvious combination. The piece transforms the "quiet versus loud grief" premise through the tactile cork, the particular cobalt lighthouse, and the choice to offer ghost-tending as release rather than exorcism. Risk is present in the ambiguous boy (ghost, wish, or manifestation) and the open ending where his flickering nature remains unresolved. The premise leans on familiar lonely-lighthouse and summoned-ghost templates but differentiates through the grandmother's teaching and the "purifies intentions" mechanic, lifting it above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: Mira is named assistant keeper in paragraph one. Development: she stays when the head keeper abandons (paragraph two), understands the scent-call, and climbs to meet the boy. Payoff: she makes the key choice to guide him, offer tea and lighthouse work, and teach release. Her decisions at each beat alter tactics and enable closure. Causal pressure is strong: without her choice to stay and her training in "vibrations of intent," the boy's call would go unanswered. Closure depends on her action. Score reflects strong beat involvement, causal necessity, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: vial cork introduced in paragraph three with backstory. Development: Mira uses it mid-scene to "filter what you truly mean," pressing it between her palms to sift "complicated mess of her own emotions until only tenderness remained." Payoff: final image shows her holding cork in left hand and boy's fingers in right with "equal reverence." Two distinct beats (emotional filtering, dual holding) and a charged reprise that reweights its meaning from personal tool to shared care. The cork enables her to act with clarity and charges the closure image. Swappability is low—its properties (purifies, worn smooth, grandmother's gift) are specific. Score reflects setup, two-beat use, and closure linkage, though the middle beat is brief.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "vibrations of intent" introduced explicitly in paragraph two via grandmother's teaching. Development: the concept is named when the boy's "call so pure" pulls him across water, and Mira "feels" the thrum. Payoff: the ending emphasizes "Some messages… arrive not in bottles but in broken children," echoing the premise. The concept shapes the inciting event (boy's manifestation) and validates Mira's method, but its mechanics remain abstract—no on-page moment shows Mira actively using vibrational perception to make a tactical choice. It functions more as worldbuilding and thematic claim than a constraint that alters moves. Score reflects setup, inciting-event role, and thematic payoff, but limited causal pressure in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: cork "purifies intentions" per grandmother's instruction (paragraph three). Development: Mira uses it once to filter emotions before speaking to the boy. Payoff: the final holding gesture implies dual care but does not revisit the purification trait. The attribute enables one on-page action (emotional clarity before extending her hand) but does not constrain later moves or create visible cost. It is presented as a benefit without trade-off. Swappability is moderate—any calming ritual could replace it with minor edits. Score reflects single-beat enablement and setup, but weak cost connection and limited causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: "beckon" introduced as Mira's method in paragraph two ("her soft attendance") and prepared through her choice to stay. Development: she beckons with the cork-filtered gesture ("not with words, but with the quiet certainty of someone who has spent years tending a light"). Payoff: the boy takes her hand, descends with her, and the closure hinges on this acceptance. The action drives the key turn from isolation to connection and is causally necessary—without her beckoning gesture, the boy remains at the lamp. Specificity is high: the beckoning is tied to her lighthouse-keeper identity and "quiet certainty." Score reflects setup, causal pressure, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Setup: night-garden scent (jasmine, moonflower, wet earth) appears in paragraph one as a signal "Someone was calling." Development: scent intensifies when Mira climbs, "pouring off him in waves," confirming the boy's presence. Payoff: scent "slowly faded, replaced by ordinary sea air" as they descend, marking the transition from supernatural call to ordinary care. The method is signaled early and its fade charges the ending image, but its mechanics are not tested—Mira does not navigate by scent or use it to make a tactical choice. It functions as atmospheric signal rather than constraint. Score reflects early signal, reprise with reweighted meaning, and closure participation, but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: cobalt lighthouse anchors the opening line and first paragraph. Development: the spiral stairs and lamp housing provide spatial choreography for the encounter; the isolated structure is "the only place where someone might be listening," motivating the boy's manifestation. Payoff: final image shows "The cobalt tower cast its long shadow across the rocks as the sun rose higher," recharging the opening and grounding the closure spatially. The setting enables the inciting event (boy appears at the lamp), provides the micro-setting for the key choice (extending her hand at the lamp), and charges the final image. Irreplaceability is high—the lighthouse's function (light in darkness, isolated vigil) is integral to theme and stakes. Score reflects setup, beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: "after the heat wave finally broke" appears in the opening sentence; "seventeen days" of heat and the head keeper's day-nine abandonment establish timeframe. Development: the cool morning air marks the shift and enables Mira to act ("welcomed the ache after so many days of heat-induced stillness"). Payoff: "the promise of cooler days ahead" closes the weather arc. The timeframe provides context and motivates the tonal shift from exhaustion to possibility, but does not create urgency or constrain choices—Mira's decision timeline is untracked. No live clock tightens tactics. Score reflects setup and thematic resonance, but weak causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: "whispers travel farther than shouts" is articulated in paragraph two and shown through Mira's choice to stay versus the head keeper's loud departure. Development: the boy's quiet grief is validated when Mira tells him "Your mother was right… you called out… with something stronger." Payoff: the final line "some goodbyes, the quietest ones, echo across oceans" re-states the premise. The motivation shapes Mira's stance and drives her choice to respond to the call, but the articulation is more thematic claim than dramatized friction—no on-page moment shows her tempted to shout or doubt her method. Cost is implied (solitude, ongoing care) but not felt as conflict. Score reflects setup, consistent characterization, and thematic payoff, but limited internal friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: tone is established through "bruise," "fallen prayers," "exhaustion," and "heat wave" imagery. Development: "screaming tenderness, the kind that tears at your throat even in silence" is named explicitly and embodied in Mira's filtered emotion and hand-extension. Payoff: final image holds dual care ("equal reverence") and quiet echo, fusing tenderness with the ache of loss. The tone modulates from exhaustion to encounter to gentle closure, and the oxymoron ("screaming" + "tenderness") charges the key beat. Over-explanation of the paradox ("the kind that tears") slightly undercuts trust in the reader, but the tone remains coherent and elevates the ending. Score reflects setup, modulation under pressure, and closure charge, with minor penalty for explicating the effect.</comment>
