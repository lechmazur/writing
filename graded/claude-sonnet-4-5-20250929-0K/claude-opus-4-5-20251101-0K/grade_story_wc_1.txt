<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is concrete and her micro-choices (settling onto stone, studying the ledger, comparing frost patterns) reveal priorities under pressure. The transformation from "artist who worked only for approval" to someone "steadily adaptive" is declared rather than fully dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The poisoning backstory anchors motivation but the patron's death ("his own poison somehow found his cup") reads convenient rather than causally earned through Elena's action. Internal conflict exists but operates more through reflection than simultaneous competing drives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with elements of Situational. Orientation anchors clearly (glass artist, canyon, post-poisoning, night-to-dawn). The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: Elena's decision to create "works that captured this canyon's frozen mathematics" reweights her artistic purpose with conceptual cost (rejecting commissions, abandoning patron-approval model). One meaningful deepening occurs when frost patterns unlock the ledger's code, shifting her knowledge and crystallizing her stance. The patron's death by his own poison weakens causal pressure since Elena's agency didn't drive that reversal, but the decoding sequence and final resolve compensate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The canyon setting constrains choices through cold ("steadily adaptive to the cold, adjusting her cloak"), and the frost formations function as micro-setting that enables the cipher breakthrough. Dawn's arrival ("sun crested the canyon rim, light poured down like molten gold") charges the final transformation with environmental pressure. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elena's glass-artist priorities (light, temperature, crystalline patterns). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the descent and climb.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reclaiming artistic purpose independent of patronage. The frost-pattern decoding narrows options by revealing she was "valuable and expendable," which crystallizes her renunciation of commission work. One meaningful tightening occurs when she discovers her name on the smuggler's ledger. The patron's convenient death limits protagonist agency in escalation; Elena survives by luck rather than action. The final choice to create a new series carries visible cost (economic uncertainty, rejection of prior validation) but the escalation path would be stronger if her decisions drove the patron's fate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of beauty's independence from commodification emerges through concrete particulars (canyon frost, glass furnace warmth, decoded ledger). The final image of "seeds of light planted deep in her luminous, surviving heart" borders on explicit metaphor but remains grounded in prior glass-artist imagery. The line "beauty existed independent of those transactions, wild and unchained as canyon frost at dawn" states theme somewhat directly rather than letting the ending image fully carry it. The scorched-testament motif recurs purposefully but the thematic resonance occasionally tips toward assertion over dramatized insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Elena notices temperature shifts, light behavior, and pattern mathematics through her glass-artist lens. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("the pause she had sought revealed itself not as emptiness but as the space where transformation happened") in ways that feel imposed rather than voice-organic to a working artist under stress. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close embodiment ("She began to retrace the symbols") to wider reflection without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops diminish momentum: "beauty existed independent of those transactions" is restated as "beauty's survival despite the hands that tried to own it"; "someone steadily adaptive" echoes the earlier attribute declaration. The phrase "scorched testament" appears three times with slight variations but without clear escalation of meaning. Figurative density is high throughout ("stars...their resonance drifted through her still, harmonizing") without always serving pressure. Template cadence appears in several "She [verb]" constructions. Information density is generally strong but scaffold phrases like "the space where transformation happened" read abstract.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The frost-as-cipher concept offers a fresh synthesis of natural pattern and human code. The glass-artist lens filtering survival and pattern-recognition feels specific rather than generic. The patron-as-information-smuggler twist is functional but the mechanism of his death ("his own poison somehow found his cup") reads convenient rather than inevitable. The transformation from approval-dependent to self-directed artist follows a familiar arc; the canyon frost provides the distinctive angle that elevates it above template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena appears throughout and her choices (studying ledger, decoding via frost, deciding to create new series) drive key turns. The glass-artist attribute shapes her perceptual lens and final decision. "Luminous" functions more as descriptive label than constraint; her glass-working skill doesn't limit or complicate her decoding work in ways that create friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ledger strip is handled multiple times: pulled from satchel, studied by starlight, compared to frost patterns, decoded, then pocketed. It enables the central reversal (discovering she was marked "valuable and expendable") and shapes the final artistic decision. The object's charcoal nature allows the smudging detail but doesn't create unique constraints beyond being a cipher to solve.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Scorched testament" appears three times but functions primarily as thematic echo rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. The concept labels Elena's transformation and the ledger's nature but removing the exact phrase wouldn't break the story's causal logic. It resonates thematically but doesn't constrain choices the way a material object or embodied trait would.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Steadily adaptive" is shown through on-page actions: adjusting cloak, shifting position, breathing into palms against cold, and paralleled with her glass-working method of responding to temperature. The trait enables her survival and decoding success. It's demonstrated rather than merely labeled, though the connection between physical adaptation and emotional transformation is somewhat asserted in the line "This was how she worked with glass too."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Retrace" drives the story's central reversal: Elena retraces the ledger symbols using frost patterns as cipher, which unlocks the patron's smuggling operation and her own marked status. This action is specific, causally loaded (changes her knowledge and options), and directly shapes the ending decision to create new work. The verb choice is apt for both physical frost-following and investigative decoding.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frost patterns are signaled early ("frost began forming on the rocks"), their mechanics matter (branching formations sharing "algorithmic logic" with smuggler's code), and they enable the decoding breakthrough. The method is specific to this setting and constrains the solution path—only at dawn, only in this cold canyon, could this cipher key appear. The parallel between natural mathematics and human secrecy is integral to the thematic and plot resolution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The canyon setting provides cold that requires adaptation, isolation for reflection, and—crucially—the environmental conditions (frost at dawn) that enable the cipher solution. It pressures Elena physically and supplies the tool for her breakthrough. The "quiet" and "under stars" attributes establish tone and Elena's reflective state. Removing this setting would require substantial plot restructuring since the frost-cipher depends on it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "three days ago" poisoning establishes backstory context and the "after surviving" frame sets emotional stakes. The night-to-dawn timeframe structures the story's rhythm and enables the frost appearance at the climactic moment. However, the temporal pressure is atmospheric rather than urgent—no deadline forces faster action, and Elena's pacing feels contemplative rather than constrained by the clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Purpose in the pauses" is stated explicitly and shapes Elena's decision to come to the canyon. The motivation drives the setting choice and connects to her final insight about "the space where transformation happened." It's somewhat tell-heavy ("She had come to this canyon to discover purpose in the pauses") but the frost-decoding sequence dramatizes finding meaning in stillness. The desire creates friction with her prior approval-seeking but the conflict is more resolved through reflection than tested through competing wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tone maintains a consistent contemplative, slightly elevated register that modulates from night's stillness ("constellations wheeling in their ancient patterns") through dawn's revelation to the final resolved clarity. "Drifting resonance" appears in "their resonance drifted through her still" and characterizes the piece's overall cadence—meditative forward movement without sharp tonal breaks. The tone charges the final image's quiet certainty but could be described as "luminous contemplation" just as accurately, suggesting some interchangeability.</comment>
