<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation crystallizes clearly—preserving forgotten names—and her actions are consistent (tending orchids, climbing to the restoration chamber, performing the ritual). However, interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction; she moves through her task without visible internal friction or competing impulses. The daughter's lost name provides emotional weight, but the choice to restore feels preordained rather than earned through on-page struggle. The final weeping reads as cathartic release without prior resistance that would make the surrender costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early (glass-orchid caretaker, opal library, "today"). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (the cracked tube seals, names take root in orchids, deserted marvels become "less deserted") with felt cost visible in Mira's tears and the acknowledgment that foxglove regret will always bloom. The accumulative design—stacks of extinct feelings, corridors of glass orchids, the restoration ritual—coheres and the final cadence shift reweights the dominant stake (preservation of forgotten names). One meaningful deepening is present when the song gathers strength and the names emerge, narrowing the library's desolation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The opal library is vividly rendered with purposeful specificity: walls of translucent shimmer, spiral corridors, moonlight staircase, foxglove section. Micro-setting qualifies—the cracked bamboo tube placed on the altar of echoes directly enables the restoration ritual and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (stacks → spiral staircase → apex chamber). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's caretaker focus (crystalline petals, colors humans stopped perceiving, the glow of sealing fracture). The environment constrains choice by requiring the climb to the restoration chamber and supplies the echoes that enable the closure effect.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when Mira carries the cracked tube "that spread a little wider each morning," forcing the restoration attempt. The ritual (humming the lullaby, gathering extinct emotions, sealing the fracture) narrows options by committing her to this act of recovery. Agency is clear: Mira chooses to climb, to sing, to perform the procedure. Cost is legible in her tears and the acknowledgment that regret persists even as hope emerges. One meaningful tightening is present, though the accumulative design means escalation reads as density increase rather than causal reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—the tension between loss and preservation, forgetting and recovery—emerges organically from the glass orchids, extinct feelings, and the restoration ritual. The final image (names taking root in transparent petals, foxglove regret sharing space with hope) offers a resonant answer without moralizing: what is lost can be held safe, though sorrow persists. Subtext operates in the museum of extinct feelings and the particularity of spring rain/copper pennies taste. The piece resists tidy resolution—regret will always bloom—embracing complexity. No thematic echo or thesis statement mars the ending; the daughter's name hummed into glass petals carries the weight without assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, third-limited, with stable distance and a distinct lyric texture in diction ("diamond-hard and achingly simple," "indifferent waters," "purple-throated"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Mira notices crystalline details, extinct phenomena, the library's architecture. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the ritual, wider during the journey). However, elevated register is pervasive ("phonemes had dissolved like sugar," "solidified moonlight") and occasionally drifts from caretaker lexicon into literary ornament. No head-hopping. The prose reflects Mira's contemplative state, though under peak pressure (the restoration) the diction remains equally elevated rather than compressing toward immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high (each sentence advances atmosphere or ritual). However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without respite: "sugar in time's indifferent waters," "diamond-hard," "moonlight carved from solidified," "purple-throated," "parched earth accepting rain," "rainbows of sound and color." This density creates a steady hum rather than peaks and valleys. Minor paraphrase loop: "deserted marvels" appears twice in proximity, and "extinct feelings/emotions" recurs without evolving pressure. Stock metaphor: "water through cupped hands." The closure image is vivid but the surrounding texture competes for attention rather than propelling toward it. No grammar errors; syntax varies purposefully.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—a library of extinct feelings, glass orchids holding forgotten names—offers a fresh angle on memory and preservation. Specificity (opal walls, foxglove regret, bamboo wind chime, spring rain/copper pennies taste) elevates the material beyond generic fantasy. However, the emotional arc (lonely caretaker restores lost daughter's name and finds hope) follows a familiar template: solitary figure performs ritual, weeps, gains bittersweet resolution. The museum of extinct feelings is imaginative but remains backdrop rather than constraint that fundamentally alters tactics. Transformation test: the core emotional journey could function in other settings with adjusted imagery. No proximity echoes of famous lines; voice and world cohere.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Glass-orchid caretaker: Present early (paragraph 2), develops through tending/climbing/ritual (three beats), and shapes closure (she hums the name, watches it take root). Her role constrains her daily movements and enables the restoration procedure. However, her choices feel predetermined—there is no on-page moment where she weighs alternatives or faces friction between competing duties. She moves systematically from tending to restoration without visible cost beyond tears. Setup + Development + Payoff gates met, but causal pressure is gentle; the role enables rather than forces the turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Wind chime bamboo tube cracked: Introduced early (paragraph 3), reappears in the restoration chamber (paragraph 7–9), and directly enables closure (it seals, sings, releases names). The crack "spread a little wider each morning" signals urgency and fragility. Handled on the page (placed on altar, glows, drinks in song, sings). The object's transformation (cracked → sealed/singing) is the mechanism through which names are preserved. Setup + Development + Payoff all present; causal and closure linkage strong. Cost: the fracture's progressive worsening creates pressure to act. Irreplaceable—the daughter's voice is trapped within this specific tube.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Deserted marvels: Functions as atmospheric descriptor (towers, fountains, archive) but does not constrain Mira's choices or alter tactics. The library is full of marvels, yet their "deserted" quality is not tested—Mira does not encounter obstacles or competition. At closure, the marvels become "suddenly less deserted," which reweights the premise slightly, but this is told assertion rather than dramatized shift. The concept colors tone but remains ornamental to the dominant stake. Present across the text but swappable with "forgotten wonders" or similar without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Gently systematic: Appears in paragraph 2 ("gently systematic precision") and paragraph 11 ("gently systematic as always"). The trait describes Mira's manner but does not visibly constrain or enable a choice under pressure. No moment where systematic care conflicts with urgency or where gentleness prevents a more forceful action. Label-only trait that characterizes voice but lacks on-page tradeoff. Present in setup and closure echo, but middle development (a choice shaped by this trait with cost) is absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Light: Central to the restoration ritual (paragraph 8: "light the dormant frequencies," "gathered strength," "cracked bamboo began to glow," "fracture sealed itself with golden light," "seed of light"). The action of lighting—coaxing sound back into existence via melody and gathered emotion—is the mechanism that seals the tube and releases names. Signaled in setup (library captures "light of centuries"), drives the climax, and produces the closure effect (names materialize as light seeds). Not easily swappable; the verb "light" ties to the library's opal shimmer and the conceptual work of illuminating the forgotten. Causal pressure and closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>By the echo of a long-forgotten song: Introduced at paragraph 8 ("She began by the echo of a long-forgotten song—her daughter's lullaby") and is the method that enables restoration (the melody travels backward, gathers extinct emotions, seals the fracture). Present in middle and payoff but not clearly signaled in setup—Mira's work with orchids and the archive does not establish song/echo as her tool until the ritual begins. The method is specific and irreplaceable (the lullaby she still remembers), and it directly produces the closure effect. Two gates (development + payoff) strongly met; setup absent. Causal and specificity high, but late signal caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Opal library above clouds: Anchors setting from the opening line, shapes Mira's journey (spiral staircase, restoration chamber at apex), and supplies the resources (crystalline walls that refract sound/color, altar of echoes, stars that remember first sounds) necessary for the ritual. The library's architecture constrains movement (must climb to the apex) and its properties (walls refract, orchids hold names) enable the closure. Micro-setting qualifies—the altar and echoes are tools. Present in setup, development (climb, foxglove section), and payoff (walls refract the recovered names). Environment meaningfully shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Across the museum of extinct feelings: Functions as metaphorical frame and spatial descriptor (chambers, halls, galleries of obsolete emotions) but does not create a time pressure or window. "Across" suggests traversal, yet no clock or deadline tightens Mira's choices. "Today" anchors the present action, but the museum's expanse is atmospheric rather than a constraint. The phrase appears in setup (paragraph 2) and colors tone but does not return or shape tactics. Swappable with "through the archive of lost emotions" without structural loss. Present but ornamental; timeframe remains vague.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To preserve the sound of forgotten names: Stated explicitly in paragraph 5 ("to preserve the sound of forgotten names"), motivates the entire ritual, and is fulfilled at closure (names emerge and take root in orchids). The motivation drives Mira's climb and restoration attempt; her tears at success demonstrate felt cost. Friction between desire and cost is present but understated—she weeps, but the path from motive to action is smooth. The motive is tied to her daughter's lost name, adding personal weight. Setup + Development + Payoff met; dramatized in the ritual and its emotional payoff. Minor deduction for lack of visible internal conflict or alternate pull during the attempt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Foxglove regret: Introduced in paragraph 6 as a section of the library ("regret bloomed like foxglove—beautiful, purple-throated, and quietly poisonous"), modulates tone (bittersweet sorrow of lost precious things), and returns at closure (paragraph 10: "foxglove regret would always bloom here...but now it shared space with something that might...resemble hope"). The tone is coherent and charges the final image by acknowledging persistent sorrow alongside recovery. However, the foxglove remains a metaphor rather than a constraint that shapes tactics. Tone does not shift under pressure—it maintains lyric melancholy throughout. Setup + Payoff met; middle modulation absent. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but does not alter choices.</comment>
