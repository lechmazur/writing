<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's perceptiveness is established early and drives her discovery, but her interior remains abstract through much of the piece ("richly perceptive in ways that frightened the canyon elders" tells rather than shows contradiction in action). The final choice to remain silent and whisper truth person-to-person forecloses her singing voice with visible cost, earning the ending. However, the emotional progression feels smooth rather than contradictory under pressure—she moves from curiosity to horror to resolve without simultaneous competing impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph (who, where, when). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mira's choice of silence forecloses her ability to sing freely, a visible cost tied to her mother's fate and the canyon's hunger. The lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture—progressive revelations tighten her understanding until the seashell delivers the key knowledge that narrows her options. One quibble: the elders' conspiracy is told through vision rather than tested on-page, softening the escalation slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus, seven ravines, and phosphorescent moss create vivid spatial grounding. The whispering seashell functions as micro-setting, warming in her palm and delivering her mother's voice at the crucial moment—constraining her choice by providing the knowledge that changes everything. Sensory detail is purposeful (stars pulsing, canyon groaning) and filtered through Mira's perceptual priorities. The setting charges the final image: the nexus groans with hunger as she walks away, making her renunciation tangible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—why some people echo—is signaled in the first three paragraphs and drives all of Mira's actions. One meaningful tightening occurs when the seashell reveals "The echo is not reflection. The echo is extraction," which narrows her options from discovery to survival. The canyon's subsequent memory-vision raises the cost by showing the elders' complicity, forcing her choice between singing freely (and being harvested) or silence (losing her gift). The escalation is causally clean and driven by Mira's agency (singing into the canyon to seek answers). The resolution—choosing silence and whispering the truth—is earned by prior causality with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: the canyon as parasite, echoes as extraction, and the conspiracy of silence all converge without assertion. The final line—"Some silences, she now understood, were the only songs worth singing"—reweights the premise without moralizing, offering a resonant paradox rooted in her sacrifice. The seashell half and the act of singing/not-singing carry thematic weight throughout. No Thematic Echo penalty; the ending image does the work. Minor note: "reed-blown melancholy" in the penultimate paragraph feels slightly authorial rather than earned from scene pressure, but it does not break thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited on Mira; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and mythic-lyric, appropriate to the canyon-singer frame ("serpentine nexus," "phosphorescent moss," "universe hummed its secret song"). The voice modulates under pressure—early curiosity gives way to accelerating dread as revelations accumulate. However, some passages drift toward exposition that paraphrases what the reader has just inferred ("They were not blessed or cursed. They were being harvested"), which flattens immediacy slightly. No dialogue on the page, so those bullets are N/A. The perceptual signature (hearing "layered harmonies of intention") is consistent but could be more embodied in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance knowledge or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing lines frame the arc well. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "They were not blessed or cursed. They were being harvested" restates the seashell's revelation without adding pressure; "the webs of intrigue stretched back generations, a conspiracy of silence" recycles "webs of intrigue" from the second paragraph without new stakes. The phrase "something like hunger, something like loss" in the penultimate paragraph is a template-cadence construction. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence. No artifacts touch the closure beat itself, which remains clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The canyon-as-parasite premise transforms the haunted-place trope through specific mechanics (echoes as extraction, elders' complicity). The seashell half as both inheritance and revelation device feels fresh. The ending's paradox—silence as song—is earned in hindsight rather than convenient. The piece commits fully to its logic without retreat. Minor ding: the "richly perceptive" protagonist discovering a hidden conspiracy is a familiar template, though the particular synthesis (acoustic harvesting + generational complicity) lifts it above median execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's choices create every major turn: singing into the nexus to seek answers triggers the seashell's revelation; her interpretation of the canyon's memories drives the conspiracy discovery; her final decision to stop singing and whisper person-to-person is the story's closure act. Present in all three gates (setup, middle choice, ending). Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Her agency is the story's spine.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The seashell appears in the opening (hidden by her mother, found by Mira) and delivers the pivotal line "The echo is not reflection. The echo is extraction" at the story's turn. It warms in her palm as a concrete signal, then she tucks it away at the end. Two gates clear (setup, middle revelation); closure participation is present but passive (she tucks it away rather than it shaping the final image actively). Causal pressure is high in the middle beat, but the ending could charge it more directly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Webs of intrigue are named early ("shown her the webs of intrigue that connected the seven clans") and return when she sees the Council of Seven's conspiracy. The concept shapes her understanding of the elders' complicity and motivates her final choice to "unravel the webs." Present in setup and payoff; middle development is implied but not dramatized in a distinct beat. It functions more as thematic backdrop than as a constraint that alters tactics on the page. Swappable with "conspiracy" or "hidden alliance" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Richly perceptive" is introduced in paragraph two and enables Mira to hear "layered harmonies of intention" and "read these transformations" in the canyon's echoes. It drives her ability to extract the seashell's message and interpret the canyon's memories. Present in setup and middle; the trait enables key beats. However, no visible tradeoff or cost is tied to the perception itself—she never misinterprets or suffers from over-sensitivity. The trait enables rather than constrains, which limits its upper range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Ensure" appears late (final third: "she could ensure others learned the truth") as her chosen action after the revelation. It defines her post-discovery stance and shapes the ending's direction (whispering person-to-person). Missing setup and middle gates; late arrival caps potential. However, the action is causally active in the closure—her decision to "ensure" others know is what forecloses her singing voice and drives her walk toward the settlement. Not easily swappable; "warn" or "tell" would lack the same commitment to systemic change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Progressive disclosure structures the entire narrative: the canyon teaches "simple truths" first, then "harder knowledge," and finally "the deepest revelations." The method is signaled early (paragraph five) and shapes every beat—Mira's singing attempts, the seashell's delayed message, the vision of the Council. The mechanics matter: each layer of knowledge narrows her options until the final revelation forces her choice. Present in all three gates and drives escalation. High causal pressure and closure linkage; the method is the story's engine.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus is anchored immediately ("seven ravines wound together") and recurs throughout. It provides resources (the canyon's memories, the echo mechanism) and applies pressure (the canyon's hunger). The setting's mechanics—echoes returning transformed, the canyon feeding on voice—constrain Mira's final choice (she can never sing freely again). Present in all three gates. The nexus groans at the end, charging the final image. "Under starlight" is present but decorative; the nexus itself does causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"While the universe hums its secret song" appears in the opening and returns once in the middle ("the universe continued its secret humming"). It establishes tone and scale but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time. The story unfolds in a single extended night, but no clock pressure is felt—Mira has time to sing, listen, interpret visions, and walk. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than tactical. Present in setup; weak development and no payoff participation. Swappable with "under ancient stars" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to learn why some people echo" is explicitly stated early ("the question that had haunted her since childhood") and drives every action: her listening, her singing into the nexus, her use of the seashell. The discovery answers the question and immediately creates a new conflict (survival vs. voice). Present in all three gates. Friction between wants (understanding) and costs (becoming like her mother) is embodied in her mother's disappearance and the elders' waiting. The motivation is indispensable; remove it and the story has no engine.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Reed-blown melancholy is explicitly named late ("Reed-blown melancholy settled into her bones") but the tone is established early through diction ("ancient light," "the silence took her," "whispering seashell half"). The tone modulates subtly—early wonder gives way to dread, then to resolute sorrow. It charges the final image: her walk away from the nexus carries elegiac weight. Present across the arc and coherent through turns. The explicit label in the penultimate paragraph is slightly on-the-nose but does not break the tonal work done elsewhere.</comment>
