<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and evolves from silent courier to participant, with embodied choices (rebuilding the cairn, adding her letter) that foreclose her prior stance. The ghost's yearning is conveyed through atmospheric pressure rather than stock haunting beats. Internal contradiction appears in her reticence versus her final vocal commitment, and the change is earned by accumulated understanding. Minor slip: "warmly observant eyes" is label-heavy and the emotional progression could compress slightly, but the closure choice remains motivated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren's decision to protect the chain and add her voice reweights her eleven-year silence with visible cost (breaking her defining trait). The accumulative lens holds—stones, letter, sea glass accumulate meaning and pressure—culminating in her spoken vow and the cairn rebuild. Orientation anchors who/where/when early. One deduction: the ghost's "presence" remains abstract until late, slightly delaying full stakes legibility, and the "brief luminescence" at the end flirts with convenience though it reads as thematic echo rather than plot solution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lantern room constrains choice through its abandonment (no keeper to receive the letter) and charges the final image (sea glass on the lamp's base as "remembered"). Sensory detail is filtered through Maren's professional attention (rust, bird's nest, dust motes as underwater creatures). The cairn—a micro-setting object—matters causally: she reads it, then rebuilds it with new meaning. Deduction: the "haunted" quality remains atmospheric rather than spatially specific, and the room's layout is vague during the key cairn interaction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the letter chain when there is no keeper—signals early and tightens through discovery (stones, reading letters, feeling the presence). Maren's agency is decisive: she rebuilds the cairn, adds her letter, and commits vocally. The cost is legible: her silence, defining her for eleven years, is forfeited. One tightening suffices at this length. Minor issue: the ghost's yearning complicates but does not test Maren's resolve in a concrete exchange; the pressure is largely internal and accumulative rather than interactive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—vessels of care passed through time, light that persists beyond individual keepers—emerges from the letter chain, cairn language, and Maren's shift from courier to author. The final image (sea glass glowing, chain carried onward) reweights the premise without stating a moral. Subtext operates in Maren's reluctance, the ghost's unspoken longing, and the cairn as silent message. No thematic echo or late sermon. One slip: "Some vessels, she understood now, were meant to be passed on" leans slightly toward abstraction, though it remains anchored in prior particulars and the immediately following "And some lights never truly go out" is concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable; perceptual signature (cataloging every change, warmly observant) is consistent. Diction matches a reticent skipper's idiom; her single line of dialogue feels weighted and earned. Filter verbs ("felt," "thought") are voice-motivated and minimal. Deduction: "luminescent weight of strangers' gratitude" and "ache of carrying light you cannot keep" in her added letter push toward elevated lyricism that slightly exceeds her established register; the prose at peak moments is more ornate than her prior silence suggests, though the effect serves closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, sentence openings shift, and information density is high (each paragraph advances understanding or pressure). No loops or scaffold. Clarity is maintained through the cairn sequence and letter reading. Deductions: "luminescent weight," "warmly observant," "haunted lantern room" cluster stock adjective phrases; "the particular quality of silence that settles into abandoned places" is generic; "grew heavy in her pocket" is a bodily cliché. These slip into the 7.2–7.9 band but do not obscure closure, so no artifact cap applies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—reticent skipper breaks silence to protect a multi-generational letter chain in an abandoned lighthouse using cairn language—feels specific and earned in hindsight. The ghost-as-yearning and cairn-as-message are fresh inflections on lighthouse lore. Deduction: the haunted lighthouse keeper and anonymous chain-letter concepts are familiar; transformation occurs through Maren's arc and the cairn language, but the ghost remains more atmospheric motif than fully realized pressure. No close echoes of famous work, and the emotional truth (silence that speaks) anchors freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's reticence is setup (eleven years silent), middle development (she climbs, reads, understands), and payoff (she speaks, rebuilds cairn, adds her letter). Her choices—reading the chain, speaking to the presence, adding her voice—create the key turns. Her trait (reticence) is the cost she pays. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; irreplaceability is high (only a silent courier breaking silence carries this weight).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sea glass appears twice: found on the lamp's base mid-story, then placed atop the rebuilt cairn with new meaning ("remembered"). It charges the final image and recurs with reweighted significance. However, it is not handled or used in two distinct beats—it is discovered, then repositioned in one continuous cairn sequence. The lyric reprise (faint glow at start and end) reweights the stake, but mid-scene causal work is thin. Present in closure, but swappable for another small token without structural collapse.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The letter chain is setup (Maren has carried it for decades), development (she reads it, understands its purpose), and payoff (she adds her letter, commits to continue it). It shapes stakes (no keeper to receive it) and tactics (she must decide its fate). Her final choice—adding her voice and carrying it onward—would fail without this exact element. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability are all strong. The chain is indispensable to the story's logic and resonance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is signaled early ("her warmly observant eyes cataloging every change") and enables her reading of the cairn and comprehension of the letters. However, it functions more as perceptual filter than constraint with cost. The trait does not visibly limit or trade off another capacity; it is label-present but not pressure-tested. One functional beat (cataloging changes guides her understanding), but no second beat where observation creates friction or cost. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Protect" is setup (cairn stones signal it), development (Maren reads the plea "Protect what remains"), and payoff (she vows "I'll protect it" and acts to continue the chain). The action redefines her options: from passive courier to active guardian. Major turns trace to this commitment. Removing "protect" would require rewriting the stakes and closure. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, but the action itself is slightly abstract (protect a chain vs. a concrete physical challenge), keeping it just under indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stone-stacking is setup (her father taught her the language), development (she reads the spiral cairn "Protect what remains"), and payoff (she rebuilds it with new meaning, adding sea glass for "remembered"). The method constrains her understanding and enables her response. Two beats: reading and rebuilding. However, the mechanics are vague (we learn three flat stones, one pointed, seven spiral, but not how "remembered" is read from sea glass atop). Swappable for another coded message system with minor edits, so not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room is setup (described early), development (pressure strengthens as she reads, "room felt occupied"), and payoff (brief luminescence as she leaves, sea glass remains). It supplies atmosphere and the cairn as resource. The abandonment (dark lamp, no keeper) creates the stakes. However, the room's spatial specifics do not alter her tactics; the haunting is felt rather than interactive. Present across beats and in closure, but the exact room could be replaced by another abandoned lighthouse space. Essential mood, replaceable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the lamp flickers out" anchors the story's starting condition (three months dark, lamp cold) but does not function as a live timeframe that tightens decisions. The phrase "When she finished, the room was black, the lamp long flickered out" confirms prior state rather than imposing a new time constraint. No clock pressure; time is vague (evening to dark). The timeframe is setup but not developed or paid off with urgency. Functional but replaceable with "abandoned lighthouse" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To bottle the feeling of safety" is setup (implied by the chain's history), development (Maren realizes "To bottle the feeling of safety" as the chain's purpose while reading), and payoff (she adds her own words, perpetuating that bottled safety). The motivation drives her choice to protect and continue the chain. Friction appears between her silence and the need to speak. The desire is dramatized in her reading and final commitment. Strong causal link and closure participation; the exact phrasing is slightly abstract but the motivation is irreplaceable to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tone—luminescent ache—is coherent from the opening (dark lighthouse, reticent skipper) through turns (reading letters, aching chest) to the final image (faint glow, gratitude older than memory). Modulates with pressure: quiet observation, rising ache during reading, soft resolution with persistent glow. The ending's "brief luminescence" and "message for whoever might climb those stairs next" charge the final image without breaking the established melancholy-hopeful register. Strong tonal control and closure linkage; tone is indispensable to resonance, though one figurative cluster ("luminescent weight") slightly overstates.</comment>
