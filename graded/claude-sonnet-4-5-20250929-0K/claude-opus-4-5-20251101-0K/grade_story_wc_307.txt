<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elowen's motivations are clear and rooted in his unique condition—his backward aging drives the urgency to pass on his knowledge. Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("strange grief of youth, emotions growing rawer"). The choice to withhold is embodied across eleven months and earns the closure beat when Vara understands. Minor deduction: Vara's emotional progression remains somewhat muted; her reaction to the revelation could show more contradictory impulses in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal linkage. The story teaches its pattern early (the pool-rings demonstration) and pays it off when Vara grasps the interference principle; the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Vara's understanding crystallizes her path and Elowen's vanishing becomes the second stone she must meet. Orientation anchors are clear by paragraph one. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pool demonstration reweights the entire training arc, and cost is legible: Elowen fades toward the unborn, Vara inherits the burden. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating rock, sycamores, meditation pool, and magnetic grotto beneath create a vivid, layered micro-setting. The pool actively constrains and shapes the key demonstration: dropping the stone into still water becomes the method of teaching. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("silver-bright under the stars," "sycamore hush"). The grotto's magnetic lines anchor the platform and later become the conceptual pool Vara must work with, charging the final image. No spatial confusion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Vara must learn to make her vanished people reappear. The pressure coheres across eleven months of training and tightens when Elowen finally reveals the method via the pool demonstration; this deepening reweights all prior waiting and transforms her understanding from absence-as-subtraction to absence-as-interference. The resolution is earned by Vara's readiness and Elowen's designed withholding. Cost is legible: Elowen will vanish, Vara must execute alone. Agency is decision and future action, with visible trade-offs on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pool-rings image: vanishing as collision, delayed revelation creating deeper knowing, and the teacher woven into the lesson. The final paragraph offers a resonant, non-literal answer—Vara will throw the second stone—that reweights the entire arc without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture and silence (the eleven-month withholding, the tightening chest). The story invites reflection on pedagogy, erasure, and presence without collapsing into abstraction. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV anchored in Elowen with clean focalization; psychic distance tightens during the demonstration and Vara's trance. Voice is distinct and controlled: "sycamore hush," "backward into the unborn," rhythmic and layered without opacity. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext—Vara's patience, Elowen's recognition of her readiness. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Minor deduction: a few passages edge toward elevated diction ("manifest as presence") that slightly exceeds the grounded tone elsewhere, but the effect remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clear, propulsive, and information-dense. Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are distinct. The pool demonstration sequence is concise and visually precise. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Minor deductions: "the strange grief of youth, emotions growing rawer" edges toward告 tell where embodied detail could sharpen, and "crossed the threshold—her pupils widened" uses a dash where stronger syntax could integrate the sign. Figurative language is controlled and coherent throughout. Overall strong line-level craft with no artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The core synthesis—backward aging teacher, vanishing-as-interference, pedagogy through delayed revelation, teacher as living demonstration—feels specific and non-obvious. The pool-rings method transforms familiar "ripple effect" imagery into a functional teaching tool with conceptual heft. Emotional truth (the grief of reversed youth, the weight of impending absence) anchors the speculative elements. Risk-taking is evident in the unconventional aging direction and the quiet, image-driven closure. The story commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat. Proximity check clear; no template echoes detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elowen's backward aging is present from paragraph two, drives his urgency to teach in the middle (the tightening chest, "by tomorrow, I'll be younger still"), and charges the closure when he tells Vara to throw the stone that meets him at the edge. His choices—withholding for eleven months, revealing now—create the key turn. The condition is causally active across all three beats and irreplaceable: forward aging would not create the same demonstration or cost. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto is seeded early (paragraph two: "magnetic grotto under starlight"), anchors the floating platform throughout, and reappears in the closure when Vara recognizes "the grotto beneath us...its magnetic lines—they're the pool." It constrains the setting (enables the floating rock) and enables Vara's final tactic (she will use the magnetic heart to restore her people). Two distinct beats plus closure participation; causal pressure and specificity present. Minor cap: the grotto is described but not physically handled on the page; its role is conceptual-infrastructural rather than tactile-interactive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Delayed revelation is the story's spine. It is named and dramatized in the opening framing, shapes Elowen's withholding across eleven months (middle beats), and is articulated and justified at closure: "delayed revelation creates the deepest knowing." The concept alters Vara's tactics (she had to wait, to feel the absence) and charges the final image (she will practice until patterns become instinct). Cost is visible: time, patience, and Elowen's fading. Indispensable; removing it breaks the entire narrative arc. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is embodied in Elowen's eleven-month withholding and his method of teaching through the pool demonstration rather than direct statement. It enables the central action (the withholding) and constrains his pedagogy: he cannot simply tell, he must show at the right moment. The trait is visible in two beats (the waiting, the reveal) and charges the closure rationale. Moderate causal pressure; the trait could be swapped for "teaches indirectly" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability. Still, it shapes tactics and is paid off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Withholding is the hinge action: it drives the eleven-month training arc, creates Vara's readiness, and is justified at closure ("you needed to want it beyond reason"). The story turns on this choice; without it, there is no delayed revelation, no demonstration of absence, and no earned understanding. It is causally active across all beats and charges the final image when Vara inherits the method. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost connection. Removing withholding would require a fundamentally different story structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The pond-rings method is seeded in paragraph eight ("shallow meditation pool"), demonstrated in the key teaching beat (paragraphs 10–14), and reappears at closure when Vara says "remember the rings. Throw the stone that meets me at the edge." The mechanics matter: rings moving outward and inward, interference patterns, collision creating visibility. It shapes Vara's tactic (she must send a wave to meet her people at the edge) and is irreplaceable—no other image carries the same dual-direction logic. Strong causal pressure, specificity, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating rock meditation platform is present from the opening line, anchors all action, and returns at closure ("the platform swayed gently beneath them, held by invisible forces"). It constrains the scene (isolation, height, the magnetic grotto beneath) and charges the atmosphere. The setting enables the undisturbed demonstration and reflects the precarious balance of the teaching. Two beats plus closure participation; moderate causal pressure. Minor limitation: the platform could be replaced with another isolated location (mountaintop, tower) without breaking the story, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through the trance" is named in paragraph nine ("Enter the trance") and frames the pool demonstration (paragraphs 10–14); Vara's perceptual shift is marked ("she crossed the threshold—her pupils widened"). The trance state enables her to see the interference patterns that she would miss in ordinary perception. It shapes one key beat (the revelation) and is paid off when she whispers her understanding while still in trance. Moderate causal role; the trance is functional but could be replaced with "deep focus" or similar without major structural change. Present in setup and middle; light closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vara's desire to make the vanished reappear is established in paragraph four (her village erased, her people declared nonexistent) and drives her eleven-month training. The motivation is dramatized in her patience, tested by the withholding, and fulfilled at closure when she grasps the method and commits to practice. Friction is present: she must endure delay, and the cost is that she will eventually be alone when Elowen vanishes. The motivation is causally active across beats and charges the final commitment. High specificity and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Sycamore hush" is introduced in the opening paragraph ("the ancient sycamores whispered their perpetual quiet"), recurs in paragraph six ("his voice carrying the sycamore hush"), and charges the final image ("The sycamores whispered below, patient as centuries"). Tone is coherent and modulates subtly: quiet throughout, tightening slightly during the demonstration, then returning to stillness at closure. The hush reflects the patient pedagogy and the floating isolation. Strong lyric reprise that reweights the opening image; moderate causal pressure as tone shapes pacing and atmosphere without directly altering choices.</comment>
