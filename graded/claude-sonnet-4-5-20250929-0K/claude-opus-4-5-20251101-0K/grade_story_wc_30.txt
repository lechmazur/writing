<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority shows embodied specificity—her strength fluctuating with moon phases is rendered through physical sensation ("feeling the weight of her mechanical shell") and shapes her stance ("liminal state she had learned to embrace"). Her motivation to preserve contradictions evolves from "nearly broke her" to acceptance, earning the final choice. Minor slip: the fisherman's question "Why do you keep doing this?" invites a slightly over-articulated reply that edges toward thematic summary rather than pure dramatized pressure. Internal contradiction operates cleanly when she questions her own migrating identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words (tidal atrium, titan-gear, post-collapse temporal state). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accrues pressure through sensory detail, moon-phase rhythm, and the fisherman's recurring delivery, then crystallizes at closure with Mira's decision to remain and her realization that "today held infinite space for wonder." The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she accepts the tomorrow-less cycle with visible cost (no future, only preservation of contradictions). One persistent weakness: the temporal collapse premise is declared but never dramatized as a live constraint that alters a tactic on the page; it functions as backdrop rather than active pressure. Causal linkage is present but soft—fisherman arrives, Mira sorts, reflects, he leaves—without a meaningful tightening that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tidal atrium functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: "tidal waters rose higher, touching her titan-gear's feet, and she adjusted her stance with the unconscious grace of long practice." Wintersun light and water rhythm are filtered through Mira's professional attention and recur purposefully. Spatial choreography is clean (intake desk, lower shelves, glass ceiling). The setting constrains her work (water-resistant materials, tide schedule) and mirrors her fluctuating state. Sensory hierarchy reflects her priorities: hydraulic hum, saltwater lapping, light through glass. The bamboo creel and titan-gear exoskeleton are handled on the page with tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (preserve migrating identities) but pressure remains ambient rather than escalating. The fisherman's arrival, Mira's sorting, and their exchange do not narrow options or introduce a felt cost that alters her tactics. The piece deepens thematically—Mira's acceptance of her own migrating identity—but lacks a causal turn or tightening that forecloses a live alternative. The final stance ("she would remain, tending contradictions like a garden") is Earned Stasis, yet the endurance feels pre-decided rather than tested on the page. No reversal or complication forces a trade-off; the cycle is described as unchanging from the opening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (identity as flux, preservation as acceptance of contradiction) emerges through concrete particulars: photographs with multiple names, Mira's moon-driven strength, the tidal rhythm. The final image—"tending contradictions like a garden, finding beauty in the impossible persistence of memory"—reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in Mira's reflection on her own migrating selfhood and the fisherman's ritualized routine. Minor slip: "wonder is how we remember why survival matters" and "preservation enough" edge toward thematic summary in the penultimate paragraphs, slightly reducing resonance. The piece resists tidy resolution and embraces complexity without false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through Mira's professional and philosophical lens. Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "smelt them, using the old archival term," "titan-gear calibrated to the same gravitational pulls." Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven; the fisherman's laconic delivery contrasts with Mira's reflective precision. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during interior reflection, pulling back slightly for the fisherman's exchange. One minor register drift: "the impossible persistence of memory" in the final paragraph elevates slightly above the established lexicon. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with strong momentum. Opening line ("The tidal atrium had no tomorrow anymore") anchors voice and stakes. Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or concept. Minor loop at closure: "The moon would shift. Her strength would change. The tides would rise and fall" repeats the cyclical pattern already established without adding pressure. Template cadence appears briefly in the penultimate paragraph ("Tomorrow might never come, but today held…" / "And that, she decided…") but does not obscure causality. Figurative language is generally coherent; "migrating identities… like watercolors left in the rain" is apt. No filter-verb stacks or major artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The titan-gear librarian in a tidal archive offers a fresh synthesis of speculative setting and archival labor. "Smelting" as preservation through contradiction is a specific, non-obvious method. Wintersun and moon-phase strength add texture. The temporal collapse premise is less developed—"tomorrow disappears" functions as backdrop rather than driving on-page conflict. Emotional truth (Mira's acceptance of her own flux) avoids generic templates. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat, though the stakes remain contemplative rather than urgent. Risk-taking is moderate: the lyric accumulation and quiet ending are coherent but not structurally bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira (titan-gear librarian) is present throughout, frames the opening, and makes the final choice to remain and preserve. Her decision to "smelt" the documents (accepting contradictions) is signaled early and enacted on-page. Her realization about her own migrating identity deepens the stake. However, her choices do not create a key turn or narrow options—she arrives at a stance she already holds. The titan-gear attribute is ornamental to her core decisions; removing it would not break the closure logic. Setup, development, and closure participation are present (all three gates), but causal pressure is limited. Band: functional across beats but not indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The bamboo creel appears in two distinct beats: fisherman's arrival (he carries it, sets it down, Mira lifts a photograph from it) and his departure (he gathers the empty creel). It anchors his ritual and signals the migrating identities' physical delivery. The creel's weathered texture and emptying at the end create a purposeful arc. However, it does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—Mira's stance would hold without this specific container. The creel is present in setup and middle, with a lyric reprise at closure (fisherman's "Same time next cycle?"), but its function is atmospheric rather than causal. Band: shapes one turn (delivery) with purposeful reprise, but swappable with another container.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Migrating identities (core concept) shape the dominant stake: Mira preserves documents where "individual identities bled into one another." The concept is dramatized through the photograph with multiple names and Mira's reflection on her own flux. It drives her method (accepting contradictions) and the final realization that "the migrating nature of selfhood was not a tragedy to be mourned but a flexibility to be embraced." The concept appears in setup (photographs), middle (Mira's interior reflection), and closure (her acceptance of her own migration). It alters her stance and tactics (she stopped trying to untangle conflicting records). Band: essential across beats and ending, drives two beats and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Moon-phase strength is labeled early ("During full moons, she could relocate entire shelving units single-handed") and the current waning crescent places her "between strength and vulnerability." However, this trait does not constrain an on-page action with cost. Mira's sorting and stance adjustment are described, but her fluctuating strength does not alter a tactic or create a trade-off in this cycle. The trait is present in setup and mentioned briefly at closure ("The moon would shift. Her strength would change"), but it remains ornamental—removing it would not break the story logic. Band: functional but replaceable, no visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Smelt" (the action of distilling truth by accepting contradictions) is signaled early as "the old archival term" and frames Mira's method. She enacts it by "carefully scanning each fragment into the archive's memory, preserving contradictions without resolving them." The action is present in setup (fisherman asks "Can you preserve them?"), middle (Mira activates sorting mechanisms), and closure (her final stance to "tend contradictions like a garden"). However, the smelting does not create a turn or tighten options—it describes her established practice rather than a choice under pressure. Band: shapes one beat and contributes to closure, but swappable with "preserve" or "archive" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Accepting contradictions" is signaled early ("smelting requires accepting that all versions might be equally true") and shapes Mira's method across beats. She learned this "through bitter experience" after trying to untangle records. The method drives her middle choice (sorting without resolving) and the final realization that her own identity's flux is "not a tragedy to be mourned but a flexibility to be embraced." It appears in setup, middle, and closure, and its mechanics matter: the method redefines her approach and charges the final image. Band: essential across beats and ending, drives two beats and contributes to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tidal atrium pressures Mira's work: she keeps water-resistant materials on lower shelves, adjusts her stance as water rises, and times her tasks to the tide schedule. The setting is present in the opening ("saltwater lapped in its daily rhythm"), middle (water creeping up shelves), and closure (water touching her feet, wintersun painting patterns). The atrium's tidal cycle mirrors Mira's fluctuating strength and the cyclical "today" without tomorrow. Removing this specific setting would break the story's rhythm and central metaphor. Band: indispensable, drives beats and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after tomorrow disappears") is established in the opening and creates the story's premise: "only today, cycling endlessly." Mira reflects on "three cycles after the great forgetting" and the fisherman asks "There's no tomorrow to preserve these for." However, the collapsed future does not tighten a decision or tactic on the page—it functions as backdrop rather than active constraint. The timeframe is present in setup and closure ("Tomorrow might never come, but today held infinite space"), but it does not alter Mira's moves within this cycle. Band: shapes one thematic beat (no tomorrow = preservation's meaning shifts) with purposeful closure reprise, but causal role is limited.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation ("to preserve wonder in routine") is dramatized through her choice to continue archiving despite no future audience. The friction between survival (routine) and meaning (wonder) is stated explicitly ("Routine is how we survive... wonder is how we remember why survival matters") and enacted in her decision to remain. The motivation is present in setup (her station, her work), middle (fisherman's question pressures her to articulate it), and closure (her final acceptance that "today held infinite space for wonder"). The motivation drives her stance and charges the final image. Minor slip: the articulation is slightly over-explained rather than purely shown. Band: essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Wintersun serenity is established early ("morning light—wintersun pale and gentle") and sustained through descriptive choices: "soft vibrations," "gentle gold and silver," "unconscious grace of long practice." The tone modulates subtly with Mira's reflection (contemplative acceptance) and the fisherman's pragmatic exchange, then deepens at closure with "something like peace" and "watching the wintersun paint patterns through the water-streaked glass." The tone charges the final image by making the acceptance feel earned rather than forced. Coherent through turns, no jarring register breaks. Band: indispensable, tone shapes the ending's emotional charge.</comment>
