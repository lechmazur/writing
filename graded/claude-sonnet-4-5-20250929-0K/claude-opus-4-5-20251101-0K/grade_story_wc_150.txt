<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's journey from skeptic to believer is signaled clearly, but the transformation lacks sufficient internal contradiction or struggle—she shifts from "find proof that the old stories were lies" to restoration with minimal embodied resistance. The moment of understanding at the sundial ("understood with sudden clarity") reads as epiphany rather than earned conflict. Micro-choices during wandering (gathering materials, stripping branches) show purposeful action, but the cost of completing her family's interrupted journey remains abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of descent and discovery early, and the sundial restoration reweights the orchard's meaning with visible action (apples glow, shadows move). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (underground, lantern, catacombs). The closure unit—Mira climbing out with seeds and the base, committed to continuation—is a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (abandoning skepticism, accepting mystery). One meaningful deepening occurs at the sundial discovery; the week of excavation adds texture but not additional pressure turns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly realized: roots threading through skulls, pale fruit, tokens on branches. The sundial base as micro-setting object constrains the central choice (rebuilding it) and charges the final image (strapped to her pack). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"air tasted of soil and sweetness and something older than memory"—and filtered through Mira's professional excavation frame. Spatial choreography remains clear across chambers and tree rows.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restoring the interrupted family pilgrimage. The piece signals this early and tightens once at the sundial discovery, where Mira shifts from disproof to completion. The rebuilding action (gathering branch, binding wire, placing gnomon) shows protagonist agency, but the resolution feels undercosted—no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path accompanies her decision. The glowing apples provide atmospheric payoff but not a trade-off that narrows options or forces a renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—faith as wonder rather than certainty, continuation through darkness—emerges organically from the orchard's particulars and the sundial's function (generating time, not measuring it). The final image (seeds in pocket, sundial strapped to pack, teaching her children) offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The piece resists tidy resolution: "wonder, as warmly curious devotion to mysteries that did not demand answers." One small slip: "Behind her, in the darkness below, the orchard continued its patient work" reads as slight over-articulation of the theme already embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled. Diction is elevated but consistent with Mira's educated perspective ("diaspora returnee," "warmly curious wonder"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tight during the sundial epiphany, wider during the week of excavation. One register slip: "to prove that life persists, that roots can grow through bones and transform ending into beginning" reads as authorial summary rather than Mira's interior voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied rhythm and strong imagery. Minor loop detected: "She had come to excavate a tomb" (paragraph 4) echoes "The tomb she had come to excavate" (near end), rephrasing the same content without added pressure. Template cadence in the rebuilding sequence: "She began to rebuild. Through purposeful wandering, she gathered… She found… When she placed…" uses parallel stems across four sentences without taught pattern. Information density is high in sensory beats but thins during the week-long excavation summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The underground orchard premise is fresh and the sundial-without-sun concept offers a non-obvious metaphor for faith in darkness. Emotional specificity elevates familiar diaspora-return material: tokens marking how far each pilgrim came, the great-great-grandmother planting with burial-dirty hands. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications (light from bone, time in timelessness). One note of derivative framing: the skeptic-becomes-believer arc follows a well-worn template, though execution is specific enough to transform it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira as diaspora returnee drives multiple beats: descent with grandmother's map, discovering her family's interrupted pilgrimage markers, deciding to complete rather than disprove. Her choices alter tactics (rebuild vs. excavate) and the ending hinges on her transformed stance. Present in setup, middle, and closure with causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sundial base appears at discovery (third day), is handled during rebuilding (placing gnomon), and is strapped to Mira's pack at closure with reweighted meaning (she will plant new trees). It constrains the central choice and charges the final image. Present in all three gates with strong irreplaceability—its function (tracking faith through darkness) is specific and cannot be easily swapped.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interrupted journeys shapes stakes throughout: tokens marking pilgrims' retreat points, Mira's mother fleeing at the second chamber, Mira's realization she must complete the journey. The concept alters options (disprove vs. restore) and directly informs closure (seeds and sundial carried forward to continue the line). Present in all three gates with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" appears twice as a label: "warmly curious wonder she had thought lost" (early) and "warmly curious devotion" (ending). It frames her stance but does not constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost. The wandering and gathering flow from this trait but could occur with other motivations. Present in setup and closure with thematic resonance but limited beat-level pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rebuild is the central action: gathering branch, binding wire, placing gnomon. This act triggers the orchard's glow and completes the family journey, redefining Mira's purpose from excavation to restoration. Present in middle and closure with strong causal pressure. Swapping "rebuild" for another verb would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Purposeful wandering" is signaled explicitly: "let her feet choose the path," "Through purposeful wandering, she gathered materials," discovering chambers "her grandmother's map had not shown." It shapes the method of both discovery and collection but does not create friction or cost—wandering succeeds without constraint. Present in setup and middle with functional involvement but limited resistance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is essential: roots through bones provide the central image and thematic foundation, the clearing with four trees creates the altar space for the sundial, tokens on branches mark pilgrimage progress, and pale fruit glowing supplies the transformation beat. The setting constrains movement (descent, chambers) and supplies resources (branch, copper wire). Present across all beats and indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Three days" to discover the sundial and "another week" excavating are mentioned but do not tighten decisions. Time accumulates texture (continuity, devotion) but does not pressure Mira's choices—no deadline, no urgency. Present as a frame but does not alter tactics. The piece could function with vaguer time markers.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Restoring lost faith is dramatized through Mira's shift from seeking disproof to completing the journey. The motivation is tested at the sundial discovery ("understood her motivation with sudden clarity") and drives the rebuilding action. Internal friction is present but undercosted—acceptance comes readily. Present in all three gates with strong causal linkage to closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Cautious enchantment" modulates coherently: initial "breath caught… not from fear, but from… wonder," discovery with "warmly curious wonder," and final "wonder, as warmly curious devotion." Tone supports pressure shifts—caution during descent, enchantment at the sundial, devotion at closure. It charges the final image and remains consistent through turns without flattening into static mood.</comment>
