<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is consistently rooted in reclaiming her scattered identity, with the heartbeat-counting habit embodying her need for proof of existence. The porcelain shard and mother's memory provide concrete emotional anchors. However, the climactic "defragmentation" moment relies heavily on abstract metaphor rather than dramatized internal conflict—watching ink patterns does not foreclose choices with visible cost. The final acceptance reads more as declared epiphany than earned transformation through contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images (opal light, ink patterns, snow, heartbeats) toward a final reconfiguration where Mira stops counting and walks out "carrying her failures like lanterns." Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she has endured the ritual and integrated her ghost with felt cost (the weight of reclaimed grief). Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (observatory, 3:47 AM, Mira alone). The ink-reading method arrives late but the piece teaches its pattern early enough to support the ending's coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The opal observatory is vividly rendered with "curved walls that shimmered with trapped light" and becomes a pressure vessel for the ritual—snow muffles the world until "the observatory felt like the only place that existed." The porcelain shard functions as micro-setting, handled twice (palm, chest) and charging the final beats. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's solitary focus. The setting directly enables the defragmentation method (observation table, refracted light) and the final image of walking into snow completes the spatial arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming scattered identity fragments—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is weak: Mira arrives with a plan, pours ink, watches patterns, and succeeds without meaningful resistance or cost that alters tactics. The ritual unfolds as intended with no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. The ending's weight rests on thematic assertion ("carrying her failures like lanterns") rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening shift is sufficient, but the ink-watching lacks the pressure needed to enter high bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the broken teacup shard, the false death certificate, the archived digital ghost. "Wisdom was not found in success. It was found in the broken pieces we carry" arrives late but is earned by the prior imagery rather than imposed. The mother's face in ink and the shift from counting-as-proof to heartbeats-as-music provide a resonant answer to the central question. Minor issue: the final paragraph edges toward summary ("carrying her failures like lanterns") where a single charged image would have been stronger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with strong perceptual signature: the heartbeat-counting habit, the way Mira reads patterns in ink, the solitary ritual design. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent. However, some lines drift into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-rooted: "communion with her own scattered self," "defragment her ghost," and "archived griefs and abandoned hopes flowing back" read more lyric-essay than lived interiority. The prose serves the piece's contemplative mode but occasionally abstracts where concrete sensation would anchor harder.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. However, the piece carries noticeable scaffold and paraphrase loops: "She needed those failures back" directly after explaining the digital ghost; "This was midnight solace" tells what the prior paragraph showed; "fetched what she came for" in the penultimate paragraph is repeated by "walked out...carrying her failures" two paragraphs later. Figurative language clusters densely in the ink-pattern sequence without always clarifying the mechanics. Stock phrase "carrying her failures like lanterns" in the final line dulls an otherwise strong ending. Deduction: −0.8 for loops and density lapses, plus −0.3 for template phrasing in closure vicinity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of clerical-error resurrection, digital ghost as metaphor, and ephemeral ink divination offers a fresh angle. The opal observatory and porcelain shard are specific, grounded details. However, the core emotional arc—learning to accept failure as wisdom—is a familiar template, and the ink-reading method remains abstract rather than transformed through unique mechanics. The piece commits to its premise but does not follow implications into truly unconventional territory; the ritual succeeds as planned without fresh complication. Mid-band: recognizable originality without bold risk that redefines the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's status as death-certificate-error survivor frames the entire premise and drives her need to reclaim the digital ghost. The backstory appears early (paragraph 3) and her false-death directly motivates the observatory ritual. However, her choices on the page are limited to executing a pre-formed plan; the survival element does not create a key turn or constrain a choice in the present action. Present in setup and payoff (she proves she is alive), but missing a middle beat where this identity forces a tactical shift.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The porcelain shard appears in three beats: held in her palm early, recalled in backstory (broken teacup/mother's death), pressed to her chest near the end, and pocketed at closure. It carries emotional charge (twelve years of unasked wisdom) and the final gesture recurs with reweighted meaning. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains a symbolic anchor rather than a functional object. Strong reprise, but lacks causal pressure to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The digital ghost concept is introduced early (paragraph 3), defines the stake (reclaiming archived identity), and is resolved on the page ("The digital ghost was gone"). It shapes the ritual's goal and reappears in the defragmentation sequence. However, the mechanics remain abstract—"archived griefs" and "scattered self" are metaphors without concrete constraint on her actions. The concept frames rather than pressures; removing it would require rewriting the premise, but it does not narrow her options within the scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heartbeat-counting appears in four beats: establishing her habit (paragraph 5), mid-ritual (seventy-six through seventy-eight), again (ninety-four through ninety-six), and cessation at the end ("uncounted for the first time in years"). The trait embodies her existential anxiety and its cessation signals closure. However, it does not constrain an action or create a tradeoff on the page; it is an emotional barometer rather than a mechanic that alters choice. Lyric reprise with closure linkage, but lacks causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Defragment" is named mid-story (paragraph 8) and occupies the central ritual sequence where Mira pulls back memory fragments through ink patterns. It defines the method and appears at closure ("defragmentation" complete when ghost dissolves). However, the action itself is passive observation—she watches patterns form—and could be replaced with similar metaphors (reassemble, reintegrate) without structural loss. The term shapes the concept but does not drive a turn; the ritual proceeds as intended without complication.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Spilled ink patterns are introduced mid-story (paragraph 7), used in the central ritual (paragraphs 8–11), and referenced at closure ("ink dried into new patterns"). The method is specific and visually distinct. However, it arrives late (past the 40% mark), is not signaled earlier, and functions as ambient backdrop rather than constraining her choices—she watches rather than manipulates. The mechanics remain abstract ("patterns that exist between intention and accident"). Late arrival and ornamental role limit the score despite closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The opal observatory under snow is established in paragraph 2, supplies the observation table and refracted light essential to the ink method, and provides isolation ("the only place that existed"). Snow muffles the world and recurs at closure when Mira walks out. The setting directly enables the ritual and charges the ending image. It appears early, shapes the middle action (curved walls, trapped light), and anchors the final beat. Strong integration across all three gates with clear causal and atmospheric contribution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the radio static clears" opens the story (3:47 AM) and bookends at closure ("The radio remained quiet"). However, time does not tighten decisions or track a live clock—the ritual unfolds at contemplative pace without urgency. The radio's clearing is atmospheric framing rather than a mechanic that alters tactics. Present in setup and payoff, but missing middle pressure; does not constrain choice or escalate stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "fetch wisdom from failure" is stated early ("She needed those failures back," paragraph 4) and drives the entire ritual: reclaiming archived griefs, finding mother's unasked wisdom in the porcelain shard, accepting broken pieces. It shapes the defragmentation goal and is fulfilled at closure ("wisdom...preserved in failure"). However, the desire is told and thematically asserted more than dramatized through conflicted choice—she arrives with the plan and executes it without friction between want and cost. Strong thematic presence but lacks on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Midnight solace is embodied throughout: the 3:47 AM timestamp, snow-muffled silence, solitary communion, and the contemplative ritual tone. The phrase is named explicitly (paragraph 10: "This was midnight solace") and modulates appropriately—urgency in early counting, stillness during ink-watching, release in the final walk. Tone remains coherent through turns and charges the ending image (walking into snow, heartbeats uncounted). The explicit naming is a minor tell-not-show, but overall the tonal control is strong and integral to closure.</comment>
