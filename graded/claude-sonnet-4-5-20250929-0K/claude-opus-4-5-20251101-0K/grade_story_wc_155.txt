<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clearly established and her interior state is grounded in concrete contradictions—corporate work that "hollowed her spirit" versus the ache she feels before the fragment. The recovery of joy is dramatized through her work on the wall and culminates in a genuine laugh. However, the epiphany arrives through reflection and metaphor rather than through a difficult on-page choice that forecloses a path with visible cost; the protagonist observes and creates but does not face a meaningful decision that alters her options under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Mira enters the fog-bound ruins, works on her mural, and experiences a shift in understanding. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the first several paragraphs without clear spatial grounding by ~120 words, triggering a −0.3 penalty. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira resolves to return and continue her practice, reweighting her relationship to art. However, the cost is largely conceptual and the final image ("she would continue to heal the breach") leans on summary rather than a concrete on-page moment that makes the price undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The fog-bound orchard district is vividly rendered with skeletal trees, crumbling murals, and perpetual mist that creates a consistent atmosphere. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Mira's artistic perception. The setting enables her escape from commercial work and provides the canvas for her light-painting, constraining her practice to this hidden sanctuary. The fresco fragment—a small object—functions as micro-setting by charging the final turn when it "seemed lighter now," meeting the 9+ gate criterion of an object that constrains choice or charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mira's need to recover joy in her art—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when she integrates the fragment's essence into her mural and laughs genuinely, a moment that reweights her understanding. However, this turn is contemplative rather than driven by a difficult choice under external pressure; the escalation is internal and textural, and no visible price is paid that narrows her options. The piece meets the baseline for accumulative design but does not reach the felt-cost threshold for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Mira's struggle: joy as practice rather than destination, art as communion versus commerce. The fresco fragment's laughing woman functions as a charged motif that shifts meaning when it "seemed lighter" after Mira's creation, a purposeful reprise. The final image—"she would continue to heal the breach"—offers a resonant answer to the central question without overt moralizing. However, "the breach between what art could be and what the world demanded it become" edges toward thematic statement rather than remaining implicit in the action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, with narrative distance controlled throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira's artistic lens filters detail through light, color, and creative purpose. Diction is generally strong—"fold of a daydream," "whispers" of pigment—though occasional elevated phrases ("pensive mirth," "communion") drift slightly above the grounded voice established elsewhere. No dialogue is present; interior thought remains clear and character-specific. Under peak emotional pressure (the laugh, the fragment warming), the prose maintains its texture without collapse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. However, several passages loop conceptually: "joy was not a destination but a practice" is restated as "recovered through devotion to one's craft" within two sentences; "the daydream began to release her" is followed by "softening into the approaching dawn of waking consciousness," a paraphrase. The phrase "specialized tools that projected luminescence onto surfaces, leaving traces that glowed in darkness" could compress to "light-projection tools" without clarity loss. These scaffold moments do not touch the closure beat directly but accumulate to −0.6 within Q7 under the paraphrase-loop and density checks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The combination of light-painting, neural implant knowledge network, and fog-bound ruins offers a fresh synthesis of speculative and artistic elements. The emotional arc—recovering creative joy—transforms a familiar premise through specific world detail (projection wand, luminous murals in perpetual mist). However, the core emotional journey (artist rediscovering passion away from commercial pressures) follows a well-worn template, and the neural implant functions mainly as access convenience rather than as a transformative complication. The specificity of the light-painting technique and the fog-locked setting provide enough freshness to lift the score into the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her choices—entering the daydream state, working on the mural, integrating the fragment's essence—drive the narrative. She appears early, is involved in all major beats, and shapes the closure through her realization and commitment to return. However, her agency is largely contemplative; no difficult choice with visible tradeoffs narrows her options on the page. The element is essential to the story but trends toward observation rather than decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The fresco fragment is introduced early, handled physically (carried, pulled out, studied), and returns with reweighted meaning when it "seemed lighter" after Mira's creation. It appears in at least three distinct beats: initial description, mid-scene study when Mira recognizes the painter's joy, and the final moment when it releases "essential weight." The fragment enables Mira's integration of ancient and modern techniques and charges the closure image. It is causally active and irreplaceable, though its mechanical role (how it enables the integration) remains implicit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The phrase "exposed film revealing its hidden images" appears once as a simile for Mira's light-painting process. It colors the description but does not constrain tactics or shape stakes; swapping "exposed film" for "developing photograph" or "emerging vision" would require only minor edits. The concept is ornamental rather than structurally integral, and it does not reappear or reweight meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Light-painting is introduced early, described with specific tools (projection wand, luminescence), and enables Mira's work in the fog-bound district where traditional paint would fail. It constrains her practice to this setting and is causally active in the central beat when she creates the mural. However, no visible tradeoff or cost tied specifically to this method appears on the page; the technique is enabling rather than limiting. It shapes one key turn and is present at closure but does not impose a felt price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Display" as an action is implicit throughout—the mural "began to display itself with increasing clarity"—and the final image describes glowing figures. However, the verb "display" is not foregrounded as a decisive act; the mural's revelation is gradual and contemplative rather than a single turning-point action. The element is functionally present and shapes the ending but could be reframed as "reveal" or "illuminate" with minimal structural impact. It participates in closure but is not indispensable in its exact form.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The knowledge network is introduced in the middle third, described as guiding Mira to the district and whispering techniques. It enables her access to historical methods and is mentioned again near the end ("would guide her deeper"). However, its mechanics remain vague, and it does not constrain or complicate any choice; it functions as convenient access rather than a method with tradeoffs. Present in two beats but swappable with "research" or "archive study" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district is introduced in the opening paragraph, vividly rendered with fog, skeletal trees, and crumbling murals. It constrains Mira's practice by providing sanctuary from commercial pressures and a canvas for light-painting in perpetual twilight. The setting is causally active in multiple beats: it draws her repeatedly, shapes her method (light in fog), and charges the closure when the mural remains "glowing softly in the perpetual twilight." The fog and ruins are indispensable to the story's logic and atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Within the fold of a daydream" appears in the opening and frames Mira's entry into the ruins as a deliberate liminal state between sleep and waking. The phrase recurs obliquely ("the daydream began to release her") at closure. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a clock; Mira's session is open-ended, and no pressure from the daydream state itself constrains her work. The element provides atmospheric framing but does not alter tactics or create urgency. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to rediscover lost joy is introduced early ("had forgotten how to feel joy in her work") and dramatized through friction: corporate commissions that "hollowed her spirit" versus the ache she feels before the fragment. The motivation drives her repeated visits to the ruins, her integration of the fragment's essence, and culminates in her genuine laugh and resolution to continue. The final image—"she would continue to heal the breach"—ties directly to this motivation. The element is essential, causally active across beats, and shapes closure, though the cost remains largely conceptual rather than a visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tone of "pensive mirth" is established obliquely through phrases like "bittersweet but nourishing" and "the laugh escaped her, surprising in its genuineness." The piece maintains a contemplative, melancholic atmosphere that modulates when Mira experiences her breakthrough. The tone charges the final image with its mix of sadness (the lost district, the fog) and hope (the glowing mural, the resolution to return). However, "pensive mirth" as an exact phrase does not appear, and the tone is more consistently pensive than mirthful; the mirth emerges only briefly at the climax. The element is present and coherent but not sustained across the full arc.</comment>
