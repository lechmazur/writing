<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior is vivid and specific—her hands still when Theo names her mother, the pocket-sun flares with her emotional chemistry—but the final shift from "trap" to "participate" arrives through summary reflection rather than a hard embodied choice under pressure. Theo functions more as philosophical guide than pressure source; his seven years of observation and the shell-as-answer insight feel generous rather than conflicted. The protagonist's core contradiction (measuring love to prove moments matter vs. needing to live them) is present but resolved via dialogue epiphany instead of a costly action that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece anchors quickly (Mira, nexus, pocket-sun, twilight) and holds a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: density accrues through shell-work, Theo's entrance, the mother-wound glance, and the final reweighting of "presence as participation." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (a conceptual repricing of her life's work), but the cost—giving Theo the shell, leaving differently—remains somewhat abstract and asserted rather than dramatized with visible forfeiture. One meaningful deepening occurs when Theo names the trap/attention split, shifting Mira's stance, which suffices for this length under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ember nexus is sensory and specific (geothermal whispers, sulfurous air, magma chorus, heat shimmer) and the pocket-sun's glow modulates with Mira's emotion, charging the scene. The nautilus shell and its light-fractals constrain Mira's focus and anchor the final exchange. Spatial choreography is clean—Theo crosses into heat, his shadow falls on the workbench—and the twilight descent marks time without stalling momentum. The setting does more than backdrop; it embodies the alchemical/romantic fusion at the story's heart.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (can presence be measured/captured?) is signaled early and pursued through shell calibration and Theo's challenge. Pressure tightens when Theo names the mother-wound and reframes capture as attention, forcing Mira's revaluation. However, the escalation is primarily conceptual dialogue rather than a choice that costs Mira a live option on the page; giving away the shell after the insight feels like a gesture of understanding rather than a sacrifice that narrows her research path or relationship. One meaningful deepening occurs, meeting the length requirement, but the cost remains more felt than visible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the shell's spiral geometry, pocket-sun synthesis, and the trap/participation opposition. The final insight—"the weight of presence was simply love, paying attention"—risks overt summary but is earned by the prior metaphor cluster (capture vs. devotion, columella as central truth). The story resists moralizing by keeping Mira's choice ambiguous (she still leaves, transformation incomplete), and Theo's challenge creates genuine complexity. The ending reweights the opening's "romantic impossibility" through the shell's transfer, a quiet but resonant answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited focalization through Mira's perceptual lens (she notices logarithmic spirals, alchemical fire, wavelengths). Diction is elevated and consistent—"convergence of ancient thermal vents," "density she needed to capture"—matching a scholarly alchemist's register. Dialogue carries subtext (Theo's "you'll return differently" both warns and seduces) and advances the thematic argument without feeling expository. One minor slip: "scientifically romantic" and "palette of resolve reforming" edge toward prompt-label phrasing, but the voice remains coherent under pressure and the final lines modulate naturally into quieter reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (each line advances character, metaphor, or thematic argument). However, several passages loop or paraphrase: "She thought of her work—her entire life's purpose compressed into a single impossible question" restates what the prior paragraphs have shown, and "All of it present, all of it weighted with directed spontaneity" is a near-synonym stack. The metaphor cluster (spiral, density, weight, presence) recurs with purpose but occasionally tips into decoration ("golden fractals," "palette of resolve"). Figurative language is dense in the closure beat without muddle, yet the template cadence ("What if I told you... What if that's already...") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("emotional chemistry," "revaluation happening behind his eyes") slightly dull immediacy. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and register drift touching mid-story beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The alchemist-scientist fusion and ember nexus setting offer fresh specificity, and the nautilus columella as a teaching object is purposeful rather than ornamental. The core insight—presence requires participation, not capture—transforms a familiar "live in the moment" premise through the shell's geometry and Mira's vocational lens. However, the scientist-learning-to-feel arc and the mentor figure who supplies the key realization are well-worn templates; the story executes them with care but does not subvert or surprise. The final image (shell transfer, twilight descent) feels earned but not inevitable in hindsight, as the turn hinges on Theo's dialogue gift rather than a choice Mira makes under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira (pocket-sun alchemist) is present throughout and her vocation shapes the metaphor system (synthesizing pocket-suns from starlight, calibrating rays). However, her alchemical work is descriptive setup; the key turn—deciding to go "not to trap anything" but to "give moments their proper weight"—is conceptual reframing rather than an alchemical action. The attribute appears in setup and thematic closure but does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost tied to alchemical practice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The nautilus shell columella curl appears in three beats: initial calibration (she turns it so rays penetrate chambers), Theo takes it and shifts her understanding, and she presses it into his hands at closure. Its logarithmic spiral and central column concretely embody the theme (staying central while spiraling outward). The shell constrains Mira's focus and the final transfer reweights it as a study object for Theo. Strong setup, middle involvement, and closure linkage with thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"A palette of resolve" appears once explicitly ("a palette of resolve reforming with new colors") in the penultimate passage. It functions as a metaphor for Mira's internal shift but does not shape tactics or choices on the page—her resolve to leave was already stated, and the reframing is conceptual rather than action-driven. Present in closure image but ornamental; swappable with "her understanding reformed" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Scientifically romantic" is labeled by the mentor and shown through Mira's metaphor system (measuring love in wavelengths, loss in half-lives). It colors her interior voice and justifies the elevated technical diction. However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost—her scientific rigor and romantic attachment both push her toward the Academy, and the trait does not create friction or tradeoff in her final decision. Consistent setup and voice integration but no on-page price tied to the duality.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Revalue" appears explicitly when Theo's expression shifts ("a revaluation happening behind his eyes") and structurally when Mira recalibrates her approach from capture to participation. The revaluation is the story's conceptual hinge, enabling the closure shift. However, it is delivered via Theo's dialogue insight rather than an action Mira performs under pressure, and the verb itself is used once as description. Present in setup (implicit in her research question) and drives the ending; middling causal agency.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"By returning differently" is signaled early (Theo: "you'll return differently") and echoed in closure ("She would return differently because leaving required transformation"). The method frames the departure/return arc and Mira's final understanding, but its mechanics—what "differently" will mean—remain abstract assertion rather than demonstrated cost. The phrase recurs and charges the ending image but does not shape middle tactics or choices beyond thematic framing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ember nexus is anchored early (thermal vents, geothermal whispers, magma chorus) and persists across beats. It supplies the pocket-sun's charged environment and the sulfurous air that holds Theo's words. The nexus dims "as if listening" when tension peaks, modulating atmosphere with pressure. It provides resources (heat, light) and context (alchemical sanctuary) but does not force a spatial choice or alter tactics—Mira could conduct this conversation elsewhere. Strong atmospheric integration; modest tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "moment a secret is whispered" is signaled ("the heartbeat between confession and consequence," "the moment after a whispered secret") and structures the scene as a single extended conversation at twilight. Time tightens subtly (twilight descends, pocket-sun dims) and the compressed window intensifies intimacy. However, no live clock forces a choice—Mira's departure is "tomorrow" but that deadline does not press tactics within the scene. The timeframe is present and thematically charged but does not materially narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To capture the density of presence" is stated explicitly and drives Mira's research (three years acquiring the shell, synthesizing pocket-suns, studying why moments weigh more). The motivation is tested when Theo reframes capture as participation, creating friction between her method and goal. Closure hinges on redefining the desire. However, the friction is resolved through dialogue insight rather than a choice that costs her the research or the relationship. Strong setup, middle conflict, and ending reconfiguration; modest on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Directed spontaneity" is asserted in the closure passage ("all of it weighted with directed spontaneity, unplanned yet inevitable") and fits the story's accumulative design—details accrue spontaneously yet resolve a prepared question. Tone is lyric-philosophical throughout, modulating from technical focus to emotional vulnerability when Mira's voice cracks. However, the phrase itself is ornamental and the tonal modulation is subtle rather than a charged shift that reweights pressure. Present in ending; modest structural contribution.</comment>
