<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is vivid and embodied ("ancient teeth," the fragment pulsing warm), and her manipulation of the other immortals shows agency under pressure. The final choice to step through feels motivated by established traits. However, the other immortals (Aldric, Thessaly, Korvash) remain largely interchangeable—their reactions to Vera's intrigue lack distinct internal conflict, reading more as ensemble decoration than individual crucibles. The change from boredom to vitality is stated rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the final beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly within the first 120 words. The drive lens reads as Causal: Vera's intrigue → spatial mutiny crescendo → threshold crossing, with motivated ellipsis. Closure is a Decisive Change (stepping through with the fragment burning away, boredom cracking) with visible cost (the fragment consumed, the escondite abandoned). One meaningful tightening occurs when the storm reaches crescendo and forces the doorway open. The cost is legible on the page ("boredom that had calcified Vera's soul began to crack and fall away"), though the final image leans abstract rather than anchored in a concrete sensory particular.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail ("crystalline walls refracting light that had no earthly origin," "colors existed here that the prismatic escondite had only pretended to contain"). Spatial choreography remains clear across the central atrium and threshold. The escondite constrains Vera's initial state and the magnetic fields carve the doorway that enables her escape, charging the closure. However, the "space beyond space" at the end remains generic ("hushed thunder," "light that held no color yet contained them all") rather than particularized, and the body/tool/recurring-object specificity that would elevate to the 8-band is absent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (discovering what happened after Maricel's goodbye, breaking free of stagnation) is signaled early and tightens when the storm disrupts the fragment, revealing it as a map. Vera's intrigue—whispering to the other immortals—drives the escalation causally. The threshold crossing is her agency, and the cost (fragment burning away, escondite abandoned) is visible. One meaningful tightening occurs at the spatial mutiny crescendo. However, the turn from intrigue to crossing happens largely off-stage; we're told "The spatial mutiny reached its crescendo" rather than shown a decisive moment where Vera's choice narrows options with a visible price paid in real time.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—immortality's curse is refusal to change, not endless life—emerges from Vera's concrete struggle and the fragment's transformation from curse to map. The final image ("what came after goodbye was simply the next hello") reweights prior material without overt moralizing, though it edges close to a thesis statement. Subtext operates in the fragment's pulsing guidance and Korvash's "You've freed us" line. However, the ending reflection ("The boredom that had calcified Vera's soul began to crack and fall away") tells rather than shows the transformation, and the echo of Maricel's smile remains abstract rather than a charged particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Vera; psychic distance is controlled and the perceptual signature (dimensionally aware, ancient, aching for change) is consistent. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated ("membrane-thin boundaries," "hushed thunder"). The three other immortals' voices converge (Aldric, Thessaly, Korvash speak in indistinguishable registers), but they are briefly on-stage and Vera's interiority remains distinct. Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Minor slip: "began to intrigue" (paragraph 9) uses "intrigue" as an intransitive verb in a way that reads slightly artificial for the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and lengths create visual and sonic texture ("The solar storm began on what she calculated was a Tuesday"). Information density is high; most lines advance multiple jobs. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Grammar and pronoun references are clean. Figurative language ("dimensions folded like origami," "hushed thunder") is vivid and coherent, though "hushed thunder" borders on oxymoron without clear resolution. One minor scaffold: "And for the first time in forever, she wasn't bored" repeats the boredom motif stated two sentences earlier, but the effect is closure-charging rather than redundant, so no deduction applied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of immortal ennui, dimensional prison, and cursed-map-fragment is specific and non-obvious; the fragment transforming from curse to guide is a strong inflection. The "spatial mutiny" concept and prismatic escondite offer fresh angles. However, the emotional arc—bored immortal finds purpose through cosmic threshold—echoes familiar transcendence templates, and the resolution (goodbye as door, not wall; transformation over permanence) feels conceptually interesting but emotionally abstract. The piece commits fully to its premise and takes structural risk with the multi-immortal cast, but the other immortals remain interchangeable, reducing the synthesis's felt inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vera is present throughout, drives the intrigue that precipitates the mutiny, and makes the threshold-crossing choice at closure. Her boredom shapes the opening stake and her transformation charges the ending. Mentioned in all three gates (setup, middle intrigue, threshold crossing) with causal pressure and closure linkage. The attribute "bored immortal" is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The fragment appears early (worn for two millennia), is handled when the storm illuminates it as a map (middle beat), and burns away at closure, its curse fulfilled. Three beats with causal involvement and closure participation. However, it is not handled or used in a tactile, scene-specific way beyond "pulsed warm"; its transformation is told rather than shown through object-state changes that constrain choice. Strong setup and payoff, weaker middle embodiment.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Spatial mutiny" is named and drives the storm-disruption escalation; dimensions strain, the escondite collapses, and the doorway is carved. Present in setup (opening paragraph's dimensional awareness), middle (the mutiny building), and payoff (the threshold). However, the mechanics are abstract—"dimensions straining," "folding like origami"—without concrete choices that the mutiny constrains or enables. It reweights the premise but does not visibly narrow Vera's tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Dimensionally aware" is stated early ("perceive the membrane-thin boundaries") and frames Vera's imprisonment. It signals the spatial mutiny and her perception of the threshold. However, it does not constrain a single on-page action with visible cost; it functions as world-building and POV coloring rather than a trait that forces a trade-off. Present in setup and conceptually active at closure, but no middle beat where the trait narrows options or imposes price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Intrigue" is signaled midpoint ("She began to intrigue"), drives Vera's whispers to the other immortals, and precipitates their willingness to follow through the threshold. Two beats with causal linkage to closure. However, the intrigue itself is summarized ("Whispers to Thessaly...Careful words to Korvash") rather than dramatized in scene, weakening irreplaceability. A different action (direct confrontation, bargaining) could achieve similar results with modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Magnetic fields are present early (solar storm, paragraph 3), disrupt the amulet fragment (middle beat), and carve the doorway at closure. Three-gate coverage with closure linkage. However, the mechanics remain vague—fields "surged," "reorganized," "carved"—without specificity that shapes Vera's attempts or tactics. The method enables the climax but does not constrain intermediate choices; "dimensional storm" or "cosmic resonance" could swap in with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite is introduced immediately, its crystalline structure and color-shift described vividly. It traps Vera (setup stake), sings and collapses during the storm (middle escalation), and reforms empty at closure, charging the final image. Three gates with closure participation. The escondite supplies the constraint (imprisonment) and the resource (spatial instability that allows escape). However, its properties do not shape intermediate tactics; Vera does not navigate or manipulate the escondite's geometry in scene. Strong setup and payoff, weaker middle involvement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The solar storm begins early ("what she calculated was a Tuesday"), drives the magnetic disruption across multiple beats, and creates the threshold doorway at closure. Three-gate coverage with strong causal pressure. The storm tightens the timeline by forcing the mutiny and narrowing Vera's window. However, the timeframe does not function as a live clock that alters on-page tactics beat-by-beat; we're told "The storm will pass" and "reached its crescendo" without intermediate moments where elapsed time constrains a choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vera's desire to discover what happened after Maricel's goodbye is introduced early (paragraph 5), dramatized when the fragment reveals the map, and fulfilled (reweighted) at closure when she finds "transformation" rather than Maricel. Three gates with closure linkage and causal pressure. The motivation drives her intrigue and threshold crossing with visible cost (fragment consumed, understanding gained). Friction between want (find Maricel) and cost (accept transformation, not retrieval) is present. Strong integration across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" is named once in the text (the space beyond) and implied in the opening's "profoundly, achingly bored" quietness. The tone—silent resonance, subdued intensity—is coherent and modulates as the storm builds. However, the phrase itself appears only at closure rather than threading through earlier beats to teach the pattern. The tone charges the final image but does not constrain earlier choices or recur with reweighted meaning. Setup is implicit, middle absent, payoff explicit; two-of-three gates with lyric resonance but limited beat involvement.</comment>
