<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is embodied and distinctive ("her joints protesting with familiar ache"), and her choice to stay exhibits commitment with cost. However, the internal contradiction feels declared rather than dramatized—the armor-to-smallness arc is told in summary without on-page micro-choices showing contradictory impulses in action. The spiritual curiosity that drives her presence reads more as static trait than evolving pressure, and the final renunciation (never leaving) lacks a present competing pull to foreclose with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (who, where, when within opening lines). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: stardust sweeping → lantern ritual → dawn descent forms a coherent pattern with cadence shift at closure. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Mira's refusal to leave is reweighted through the final image of lantern glow and shared vigil. Cost is conceptual (abandoning the world's trajectory) but legible in "waiting for a world that had forgotten how to look up." One meaningful deepening (meteor as arrival, not failure) tightens the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The yellow lantern glass constrains perception and charges the final image ("glowed like a small captured sun"), satisfying the 9+ gate test. Spatial choreography is clean (ladder, platform, railing, dome). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "moss grew...with patient deliberation," "owls nested in the broken scopes." The station functions as micro-setting, shaping Mira's stance and crystallizing her choice to remain. Setting anchors early and modulates from cold metal to honeyed warmth, mirroring internal progression.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding meaning in cosmic indifference) is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when the meteor's death becomes "arrival," reweighting the initial question. However, escalation is textural rather than a narrowing choice—no present complication forces a trade-off on the page. The final stance crystallization (smallness as strength) feels earned by prior reflection but lacks an on-page reversal or visible cost that forecloses a live option. Agency is endurance, valid under Earned Stasis, yet the lack of a present competing pull mutes the price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (stillness as flourishing, smallness as strength) emerges organically from image and action—the lantern transforms falling into flying, moss grows deliberately. The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: the station "hummed with ancient peace" and the world "had forgotten how to look up" charges the question without stating a thesis. Minor slip: "sacred art of flourishing stillness" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic echo, restating rather than deepening. The piece resists tidy resolution and honors ambiguity (alone yet alive), earning high-band entry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: Mira "traced the path...with weathered fingers," "felt its journey as if it were her own pulse." Diction remains consistent and character-particular. The extended reflection on vulnerability and smallness fits BRR allowance (taught pattern, anchored in present sweeping ritual). Minor register drift: "primal elegance" and "tender exposure of an open heart" in late paragraphs introduce elevated phrasing that clashes slightly with the tactile, grounded voice established earlier. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; imagery does double work (lantern as tool and thematic anchor). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at meteor sightings and slowing for reflection. Paraphrase loop detected: "Here, she was small. Here, her life was a single breath..." repeats conceptually without added pressure (−0.3). Template cadence: "Some things endured...Some things found..." at closure reads as parallel structure but borders on scaffold (−0.2). No filter-verb stacks or metaphor muddle. Clarity and momentum remain intact, but the loops prevent entry to higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The cosmic-janitor frame offers a fresh angle, and the yellow lantern glass as transformation tool feels specific. However, the emotional arc (noise to stillness, armor to vulnerability) follows a familiar contemplative template without a sharp, non-obvious inflection. The meteor-as-arrival insight is elegant but not structurally surprising. Transformation test borderline: swap station for lighthouse, stars for waves, and the arc holds largely unchanged. No proximity echoes or surface novelty chasing; the piece commits fully to its premise with quiet integrity, landing solidly mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira sweeps (setup), climbs and traces meteors (middle), and descends to sleep (ending). Her decision to stay frames the piece, but no on-page reversal tests that commitment with a competing pull. The janitor role enables ritual but doesn't constrain a choice under pressure. Present across beats, causally functional, yet swappable for "lone astronomer" or "station keeper" without structural loss. Two-gate presence (setup, ending) with middle development as routine rather than pivot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Yellow lantern glass appears in three beats: introduced with founder backstory, used mid-scene to transform meteor light ("warm, honeyed, alive"), and glows "like a small captured sun" in the final image. The transformation it enables (cold to warm, falling to flying) is specific and irreplaceable. It charges the closure and ties to the core concept. Early signal, causal use, closure linkage present. Could score higher if the middle use constrained a tactical choice rather than serving as poetic observation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Flourishing stillness" is named on-page ("This was what she had discovered") and thematically present throughout (moss, owls, Mira's deepening roots). However, it operates as thematic overlay rather than shaping on-page stakes or altering tactics. No choice hinges on choosing stillness over motion; it's the premise she already inhabits. Functional as concept but doesn't narrow options or create visible tradeoff. Swappable with "tranquil endurance" or similar abstractions.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious and hungry for meaning" is stated in exposition ("She had arrived as a young woman, spiritually curious...") but never constrains an on-page action or creates visible cost. It explains why she came decades ago, not what she does now. Label-only trait. No middle beat where curiosity drives a tactical choice or trade-off. Setup gate met, development and payoff absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Empathize" is named explicitly ("learned to empathize with the universe itself") and demonstrated when Mira feels the meteor's journey "as if it were her own pulse quickening." The action enables her insight (death as arrival) and frames her final stance. However, it's observation-driven rather than decision-shaping—she empathizes, then reflects, but no choice pivots on that empathy. Present in setup and ending with thematic weight, yet the middle doesn't hinge on it. Two gates, lyric reprise, but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Tracing the path of falling stars" is signaled early ("traced the path...with her weathered fingers"), demonstrated mid-scene ("Mira traced its descent with practiced reverence"), and echoed at closure ("tomorrow night...she would be there, tracing their paths"). The method is specific and recurring, shaping her ritual. Yet it's observational—no beat where the tracing constrains a choice or alters tactics under pressure. Three-gate presence with lyric coherence, but the mechanics don't drive turns. Functional, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The shooting star tracking station is introduced immediately, provides spatial structure (ladder, platform, dome, railing), and its "overlooked" status grounds the conflict (world turned inward, Mira stayed). The open dome enables meteor observation; broken scopes house owls; moss grows between stones. Setting shapes Mira's isolation and her choice to remain. It's not merely backdrop—the station's abandonment is the condition she transforms into flourishing. Early anchor, middle texture, closure participation via "station hummed with ancient peace." Essential to premise and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Through the hush of an overlooked era" appears in late paragraph as thematic frame ("the overlooked era continued its quiet vigil"). The thirty-year abandonment is stated but doesn't tighten on-page decisions—no clock pressure, no historical shift encroaching. Time is atmospheric rather than tactical. The timeframe justifies Mira's solitude but doesn't constrain her choices or escalate stakes within this night's action. Setup via exposition, vague middle presence, ending cameo without causal force. Functional as context, replaceable in mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To find strength in vulnerability" is explicitly stated ("vulnerability had once terrified her...this smallness had become her strength") and thematically present in her choice to stay exposed to cosmic indifference. However, it's told in summary—no on-page beat where vulnerability creates friction or costs her a safer option. The motivation explains her arc but doesn't drive a present choice under pressure. Setup and ending via reflection, middle absent as lived conflict. Label-present, not dramatized with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Primal elegance" is named once ("Dawn approached with primal elegance") and tonally embodied in the elevated, reverent diction throughout ("luminous descent," "tender exposure," "ancient peace"). Tone is coherent and modulates slightly—contemplative in sweeping, charged during meteor sighting, hushed at closure. However, "primal" reads as aspirational label more than lived texture; the prose leans lyric-formal rather than raw or elemental. Tone charges the final image but doesn't shift meaningfully under pressure. Coherent, static mood with late anchor.</comment>
