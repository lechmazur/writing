<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is richly embodied through specific gestures (walking backwards, touching the paperweight) and her conflict between professional duty and compassion drives authentic pressure. The decision to mentor Kael feels earned by the tea-leaf analysis moment and her recalled exile experience, though the final beat's "combative tenderness" articulation edges toward diagnostic self-awareness. Thessaly remains functional but somewhat flat, existing primarily to prompt Mira's realizations. Minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated thematic stance in the penultimate paragraph, but the core contradiction between offering "armor" versus "comfort" creates genuine tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph and establishes reversible exile stakes early. Closure arrives through Mira's annotation act—a Decisive Change that forecloses one path (leaving Kael exiled) with visible cost (her own vulnerability to judgment, the weight of responsibility)—under a primarily Causal lens with Accumulative texture. However, the cost feels more asserted than demonstrated in the final image; the wax seal and tomorrow's promise carry conceptual weight but lack the sharp sting of immediate forfeit. The tea-leaf divination beat provides a meaningful tightening that narrows Mira's options, and the exile-reversal decision flows from established causality, but the ending drifts slightly toward summary ("ready to teach him") rather than a charged present-tense image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The forgotten library is vividly rendered through selective detail (marble floors, grimy window, dust-clogged halls) and the paperweight constrains Mira's reflective moment, anchoring memory to present tactile experience. The afternoon light slanting through the window and caught shadow create atmospheric specificity that supports the exile/reflection theme. The setting does not, however, meaningfully constrain the peak choice—the annotation could occur in any archivist workspace—preventing entry to the 8+ band. Spatial choreography (Thessaly emerging from shelves, teacup placement) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to reverse Kael's exile—is signaled early and pressure tightens through the tea-leaf analysis, which narrows Mira's uncertainty into resolve. The decision moment carries conceptual cost (responsibility, future scrutiny) but the visible price remains somewhat abstract; we see her sign the document but the immediate sacrifice or trade-off is diluted by the forward-looking final paragraph. The restriction ("minimum two years") adds a concrete constraint, yet the climactic beat leans on summary ("tomorrow...ready to teach") rather than a present-tense forfeiture that alters her situation on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the recurring motifs of broken reflections, reversible exile, and the walking-backwards habit, culminating in "broken things could still reflect light—differently, imperfectly, but reflecting nonetheless." The concept of "combative tenderness" and "love that demands growth rather than permits stagnation" is dramatized through Mira's annotation restrictions and her refusal to parade Kael as reformed. Minor deduction for Thessaly's late-paragraph articulation of "combative tenderness," which borders on thematic echo, though it is framed as a callback to an earlier conversation. The swing image at the end provides a quiet, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, and Mira's perceptual signature (noticing dust, shadows, mirror-dust) is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue between Mira and Thessaly carries subtext and advances the decision without feeling expository. However, some interiority edges toward over-articulation—"It sounds like combat" and the explicit "armor" versus "comfort" framing—reducing the trust in image and implication. Filter verbs ("felt her throat tighten," "watched her finish") are present but not excessive. The prose modulates well under pressure, though a few beats lean on scaffolding ("She thought of the timeframe...") that could be tightened.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high, though some beats carry mild redundancy: "The afternoon shadow caught in glass seemed to pulse with judgment" is vivid but slightly over-written given the prior paperweight description. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph's triple "every day" construction, applying −0.3. The tea-leaf analysis paragraph integrates exposition cleanly without stalling momentum. A few stock phrases ("throat tighten," "years, nested like") and the phrase "armor" versus "comfort" border on abstraction but remain anchored in scene. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shard-mirror archivist premise and reversible exile system offer a fresh synthesis, and the tea-leaf divination as pattern-recognition tool transforms a familiar trope into occupational credibility. The walking-backwards habit is specific and character-particular. However, the mentor-deciding-student's-fate frame is well-worn, and while the "combative tenderness" angle adds texture, the story does not fully escape the template of redemption-through-mentorship. The swing metaphor and exile-as-silence constructions are evocative but not entirely surprising. Risk-taking is present in the reflective pacing and the emphasis on internal choice over external confrontation, earning modest bonus consideration within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira, the shard-mirror archivist, is introduced early and her professional role (cataloguing broken reflections, understanding patterns) directly enables the tea-leaf analysis beat that crystallizes her decision. The annotation act is the story's climactic choice, and her archivist identity supplies both the method (pattern recognition) and the stakes (her own reversed exile). The role constrains her approach—she cannot merely pardon Kael; she must analyze and impose conditions—and it charges the final image of sealing with her sigil. The element is indispensable to the story's logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The afternoon shadow caught in glass (paperweight) appears early, anchors a reflective beat where Mira remembers Kael's destructive touch, and returns in the penultimate beat as it "had shifted, stretching toward evening, toward change," reweighting the motif of transformation. However, the object is not handled or used in a way that constrains Mira's tactics; it remains primarily symbolic rather than causally active. Two-beat involvement and lyric reprise earn mid-band credit, but the lack of causal pressure or closure-specific cost limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Reversible exile is introduced early, frames the central stakes, and governs the peak decision. The concept's mechanics (council recommendation, conditional mentorship, restricted access) shape Mira's annotation choices and impose visible constraints. The closure hinges on reversing Kael's exile with specific restrictions, and the story explores the moral calculus of second chances versus accountability. The element is essential to escalation and ending, with the reversal document and sigil serving as the decisive act. Only the slight abstraction of "timeframe...measured not in days but in silences" keeps it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Walking backwards when nervous is introduced in the opening paragraph, establishes Mira's character-specific response to pressure, and resurfaces in the final beat's anticipation of Kael "walking whatever direction his nerves demanded," creating a lyric callback. However, the trait does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics; it functions as characterization and thematic parallel (both Mira and Kael share the habit) but lacks causal pressure. Early signal and closure reprise earn mid-band credit, but the absence of cost or tactical consequence limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Annotate is signaled early as Mira's task, drives the middle reflection (what to write), and constitutes the climactic action in which she records her recommendation, imposes restrictions, and seals the document with her sigil. The annotation act is irreplaceable—no other action could fulfill her role as archivist or formalize the exile reversal with the same specificity. The element appears in at least three beats (opening task, decision moment, sealing) and directly shapes the closure, with visible cost in the restrictions she imposes and the responsibility she assumes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method (analyzing tea-leaf geometry) is introduced just past the midpoint when Thessaly offers the cup, explained through Mira's interior reflection, and directly enables her decision by revealing Kael's inward conflict and circular waiting. The mechanics matter: triangles pointing inward and nested circles provide the specific evidence that shifts Mira from uncertainty to resolve. However, the method arrives relatively late (~40% mark) and is used in only one extended beat, limiting its integration across the story. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage elevate the score despite late introduction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library is introduced in the opening line, establishes the professional and physical context (marble floors, dust, shelves, Mira's desk), and recurs throughout as the site of decision. The setting supplies the teacup and paperweight as tools, and its "forgotten" quality mirrors the exile theme. However, the library does not meaningfully constrain Mira's peak choice—she could annotate the record in any archivist workspace—and the micro-setting (desk, window) is descriptive rather than tactically active. Present across all beats with thematic resonance, but lacking the specific pressure that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe (hush as an empty playground swing drifts) appears as a metaphor in the middle reflection ("moments like the hush...") and returns in the final line ("a swing drifted in evening silence"), creating a lyric frame. However, it does not function as a live clock or constrain Mira's decision-making; the story's present unfolds in a single afternoon without urgent time pressure. The swing image charges the ending thematically but remains symbolic rather than causal. Late first appearance and ornamental use limit the score to mid-band despite the purposeful reprise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation (to mentor resilience quietly) is articulated in the middle dialogue beat, drives Mira's choice to impose conditional mentorship rather than full pardon, and shapes the specific restrictions she writes (no parade, no symbol, "just give him the tools"). The desire is dramatized through friction: she rejects Thessaly's "tenderness" label and reframes it as "armor," and she recalls her own reversed exile, making the mentorship both personal and professional. The motivation is indispensable to the closure's form and cost, with visible consequence in the annotation's conditions.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Combative tenderness is named explicitly in the dialogue ("Combative tenderness, you called it once") and enacted through Mira's decision to impose strict restrictions while granting the reversal—love that "demands growth rather than permits stagnation." The tone modulates from anxious retreat (opening) to decisive action (annotation), and the final image balances hope (Kael's return) with wariness (imperfect reflection). However, the explicit naming of the tone in dialogue reduces subtext, and the tonal charge at the ending is somewhat diluted by forward-looking summary. Present across beats with coherent pressure, but not fully embodied in the final image.</comment>
