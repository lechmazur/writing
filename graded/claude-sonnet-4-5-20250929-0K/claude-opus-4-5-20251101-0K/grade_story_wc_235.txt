<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vera's interior life is richly rendered through concrete details—tracing the scroll, reading entries—and her jealousy of past selves creates genuine internal contradiction. The transition from "chronicler's curse" to accepting chaos as narrative shows earned development. However, the final turn toward "ready to stop fearing and start writing toward" her grave feels slightly under-motivated given the intensity of temporal confusion established earlier. Embodied emotion is strong ("something sharp twist beneath her ribs") but the resolution could bear more visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (Vera, ranger cabin, post-grave discovery). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Vera's understanding deepens through layered reflection on scrolls, building to "the chaos was the narrative" realization. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she stops fleeing temporal confusion and commits to writing toward her known ending. The cost is legible: she accepts living between versions of herself, foreclosing the option of linear certainty. One micro-concern: the grave discovery happened three weeks prior, creating slight temporal distance from immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cabin's rough-hewn table, birch bark, mountain wind, and meadow with headstone create vivid atmosphere. The scroll itself functions as micro-setting, constraining her understanding across time. Sensory details like "scent of birch and snow" and the cabin groaning against wind are purposefully deployed. The meadow holding "her headstone like a secret" charges the spatial relationship. Minor cap: while setting enables reflection, it doesn't constrain a pivotal on-page choice as tightly as needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—regaining temporal coherence and present-moment wholeness—is clear from the opening. Pressure accumulates through her jealousy of past selves and recognition that "the chronicler's curse" has alienated her from lived experience. The tightening comes when she realizes "the chaos was the narrative," shifting from resistance to acceptance. Agency is present: she chooses to write about the jealousy and plans tomorrow's ridge climb. The cost (living with temporal confusion) is felt but could be more viscerally dramatized in a concrete forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Vera's struggle: documentation versus experience, the cost of observation, accepting endings. "Feral nostalgia" as "savage, untamed longing... for having once been whole" roots abstraction in specific sensory terms. The image of "catching water in a net" versus "the reaching" offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final line's "memory she hadn't made yet" elegantly reprices temporal confusion as richness rather than curse. No thematic echo or explicit thesis statement mars the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with Vera's perceptual signature—she notices handwriting texture, dream architecture, temporal markers. Diction stays character-appropriate: "feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder," "chronicler's curse" feel like her professional lexicon. One minor slip: "jade of her exhaustion" (should be "jaded" as adjective, not noun) creates brief confusion. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during scroll-reading and opening during landscape observation. No head-hopping; filter verbs are voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with strong rhythm variation and information density. Opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Minor loop detected: "the dreams bled backward and forward" is restated as "temporal chaos" within three lines. "Jade of her exhaustion" is likely a misuse (jade as noun for jaded). Some sentences do double duty well ("The grave would still be there... marking an ending she was finally ready to stop fearing"). Figurative language is controlled except for one mixed register moment. No major scaffold or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination of lucid dream chronicling, temporal confusion, and finding one's own future grave offers fresh synthesis. "Feral nostalgia" and "jealous of past selves" provide specific psychological texture beyond stock time-travel tropes. The birch bark scroll as physical dream journal grounds the fantastical premise. Risk-taking in the non-linear temporal structure heightens stakes. However, the "chronicler who forgets to live" theme has some precedent in metafiction; transformation comes through the mountain ranger setting and the specific temporal mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera as lucid dream chronicler is established early, shapes her perception throughout (reading scrolls, recognizing handwriting), and her decision to "write about the jealousy" and plan tomorrow's climb constitute agency. Her professional identity directly enables the temporal confusion and her final acceptance. Present in all three gates (setup, middle beats, closure participation) with causal pressure—her chronicling both created the problem and offers the solution.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll appears in opening beat (handling, reading), returns in middle section (older scroll with nineteen-year-old handwriting), and she strips fresh bark to write new entry near the end. The scroll's materiality (crackling, brittle, dark with age) grounds temporal layers physically. It constrains her understanding and enables the final turn—writing on fresh bark becomes acceptance. Present across three beats with evolving significance and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Feral nostalgia" is defined mid-story and drives Vera's emotional state—jealousy of past selves embodies it. The concept shapes her recognition that she's lost present-moment wholeness. However, it functions more as thematic coloring than tactical constraint; the story would largely work with "nostalgia" alone. Present in setup (research notes) and thematically charged at closure, but middle development as choice-driver is weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Chronological confusion is established early ("dreams bled backward and forward"), manifests in her reading scrolls from indeterminate times, and constrains her perception throughout ("stopped trusting the evidence of light"). It drives her disorientation and the need for resolution. The attribute enables the jealousy mechanic and shapes her final acceptance. Present across all three gates with visible cost (loss of linear certainty), though could constrain specific tactical choices more directly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Soaring appears as remembered/future dream flight, generates jealousy ("envied the Vera... who could dream of flight"), and she plans to climb the ridge tomorrow to "remember how her dream-self had felt, arms spread against the wind." Present in setup and implied at closure, but the action itself doesn't occur on the page. It functions as symbolic desire rather than realized event. Middle development and on-page execution are absent; score capped accordingly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Jealousy of past selves is signaled early, dramatized in the scroll-reading beat ("She was jealous of the version of herself who had written these words"), and drives her recognition of the chronicler's curse. The method shapes her emotional progression and contributes to the insight that distance from experience is the core problem. Present in setup and development; closure participation is thematic rather than tactical. Mechanics matter: the jealousy makes temporal confusion emotionally concrete.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mountain ranger cabin is established immediately (rough-hewn table, groaning against wind), provides isolation context ("came three months ago to distill chaos"), and supplies the birch tree for fresh bark. The window frames the meadow/grave view. Setting enables reflection and provides physical anchors (table, window, ridge). Present across beats but functions more as atmospheric container than tactical constraint. The cabin doesn't force specific choices, though the isolation premise is load-bearing for the reflection-heavy design.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Three weeks had passed since she'd stumbled upon her own grave" anchors the timeframe early and the grave functions as persistent pressure throughout—it's the inciting rupture that fractured her "temporal understanding." The ending explicitly references it: "The grave would still be there when she returned." The timeframe shapes her emotional state and the stakes (living between her beginning and known ending). Present in setup, pressures middle reflection, and charges closure image with undeniable weight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To distill chaos into narrative" is explicitly stated as her reason for coming to the cabin and drives her scroll-reading and writing. The story tracks her realization that "the chaos was the narrative"—a direct inversion of this motivation with felt cost (abandoning control). Present in setup and thematically resolved at closure. However, the motivation is more told than dramatized through conflicted choices; it functions as frame rather than generating on-page friction with competing wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Jaded wonder" is precisely executed: "with jaded wonder" appears explicitly, and the tone threads throughout—world-weary expertise ("chronicler's curse," eleven years of documentation) layered with genuine awe ("something like wonder beneath the jade of her exhaustion"). The tone modulates with pressure, tightening during jealousy beats and opening during the final acceptance. Coherent through turns and charges the final image ("smelling exactly like a memory she hadn't made yet"). The tone is indispensable to voice and emotional texture.</comment>
