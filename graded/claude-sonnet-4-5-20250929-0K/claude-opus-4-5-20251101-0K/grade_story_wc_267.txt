<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's sensory confusion from nerve regeneration creates a unique perceptual lens and her internal conflict between safety and song is embodied through physical choices. The bellhop's risk to communicate constrains his method and adds genuine stakes. The decision to turn the bolt feels earned by the synesthetic music imagery and grandmother's memory, though the final motivation could be more contradictory—the choice trends slightly too clean given the life-or-death stakes for the village.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under a Causal lens: bellhop's dust message → Mira's investigation → discovery of the bolt mechanism → choice to remove it, each step narrowing options. Closure lands on-page as Decisive Change (she begins turning the bolt) with felt cost: risking the storms and village safety for voice. The final image "chosen to stop remaining silent" makes the before/after legible with undeniable stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, frost-covered piano, and dust on the spiral staircase all constrain discovery and charge the atmosphere. The synesthetic cold-as-keening-note filters setting through Mira's damaged nerves effectively. The piano bench bolt functions as micro-setting, anchoring the mechanism revelation. The snow and fortress walls recur with evolving meaning from protection to prison, supporting the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—safety versus song—signals early and tightens through the bellhop's risk, the bolt discovery, and Mira's choice. One meaningful reversal when she understands the mechanism imprisons her grandmother's voice, narrowing options from abstract cost to concrete action. The turn to remove the bolt is protagonist-driven agency with legible price: potential return of killing storms. Pressure coheres under the causal lens and the cost is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the piano, bolt mechanism, and dust-written plea rather than statement. "Unpardonable silence" operates as concept and irony: the truly unpardonable silence is the one that continues. The bellhop's fog-drawn words and Mira's synesthetic perception of cold-as-music embody the theme without meta-commentary. The ending offers resonant answer through action (turning the bolt) rather than articulating a moral, reweighting "remain" from command to renunciation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with Mira; no head-hopping. Her synesthetic perceptual signature (pain as colors, cold as keening note) is character-particular and filters setting consistently. Diction stays within her experience. The bellhop's silence is motivated and his communication through dust/fog feels earned by the constraint. Minor density issue: "seraphically mundane" registers slightly precious for the narrator's idiom, though it remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do double work. "Azure walls drinking in the endless white like a bruise that refused to heal" is vivid and specific. Minimal scaffolding. One minor loop: "Silent Choir" appears three times in quick succession in the third and fourth paragraphs without evolving meaning between mentions. The final image propels cleanly. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dust-written plea and bolt-as-captured-voice mechanism offer fresh synthesis of the silence-cost premise. Synesthetic nerve regeneration as perceptual lens is specific and non-obvious, charging the music imagery. The bellhop's method of communicating around the pact shows ingenuity. The transformation test holds: changing names and setting would lose the cobalt fortress's specificity and the nerve-damage filter. Risk-taking in the final image (open ending with storms returning) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Bellhop appears in three beats: landing gesture, dust message "REMAIN," fog-drawn "BOLT. HOLDS. VOICE." His choice to risk communication creates the key reversal—Mira wouldn't discover the mechanism without his dust message. His waiting at the end pressures her final choice. He's causally essential to the middle turn and ending pressure, present across the arc with visible risk tied to his actions.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Piano bench bolt appears in four beats: discovery under bench, Mira holding it, understanding it holds voice, and gripping it to turn at closure. It's the mechanism that enables the ending choice and its loosened state proves someone tried before. The bolt is irreplaceable—no other object could serve this function. Removal drives the climactic action with clear cost (storms may return). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unpardonable silence" frames the stakes early (fortress demands it, breaking it means consumption by walls) and returns inverted at closure ("truly unpardonable only when they continued"). It shapes the bellhop's tactics (dust/fog workarounds) and Mira's final choice carries its cost. The concept operates both as constraint (prevents speech) and theme (what silence costs). Present in setup, middle pressure, and ending reweight with conceptual cost visible.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Seraphically mundane" describes the bellhop's face but doesn't constrain or enable action with cost—it's atmospheric description. The trait appears once without evolving or creating a tradeoff. The bellhop's choices stem from his silence and risk-taking, not from his facial appearance. Swappable with "unremarkable" or "ordinary" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Remain" appears as dust message, chapter concept ("chosen to remain"), and inverted final line ("stop remaining silent"). The village's choice to remain (endure vs. live) creates the central tension. Mira's decision turns on whether to remain or act. The word anchors the bellhop's plea, her grandmother's sacrifice, and the closure image. Major turns trace directly to this action/non-action, and it's irreplaceable—no synonym carries the same weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dust-message method signals in paragraph five ("discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase"), used again with fog on glass. The mechanic matters: dust disappears with footsteps, creating urgency and showing risk. The method enables discovery of both the plea and the mechanism explanation without breaking the silence rule. It's specific to the constraint and shapes two key beats, though late fog introduction (final third) slightly weakens integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cobalt fortress supplies the protection mechanism, houses the piano/mechanism, and its walls threaten consumption for speaking. Snow/cold pressure the survival stakes throughout. The music room's isolation enables the discovery scene. Setting provides both resource (dust for messages) and constraint (walls enforce silence). Present from opening, pressures middle investigation, and the fortress exterior frames the final image with snow still falling.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Nerve regeneration appears in opening (misfired sensations) and returns as "regenerating nerves sent a message that felt like music" before the choice. It provides the synesthetic lens (cold as sound, pressure as color) that charges the music imagery. However, it doesn't create a ticking clock or tighten the decision window—the timing is Mira's choice, not imposed by her condition. Functional but not driving escalation through time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Understand the cost of safety" motivates the climb to the music room and frames her reflection on the village's trade. The cost becomes concrete when she learns the mechanism imprisons voices. Her choice dramatizes the friction between safety (storms) and its price (silence/hope). The motivation drives investigation and final action with visible tradeoff. Present in setup, middle discovery, and climactic choice with embodied cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Frostbitten hope" tone emerges in "bruise that refused to heal," "hollowed-out existence, frostbitten hope that never quite thawed," and "warmer stirred beneath... frost-touched cousin: faith." Tone modulates from cold stasis through discovery to the ending's qualified warmth ("chosen to stop remaining"). The tone charges the final image without false uplift—snow keeps falling but choice was made. Coherent across pressure points and integral to thematic resonance.</comment>
