<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's interior journey from brittle isolation to purposeful cultivation is concrete and earned through the reincarnation memory and her reinterpretation of Korvash's gift. The chain-of-souls insight triggers a credible shift from preservation to creation, with micro-choices (placing the sundial, writing the guide) that foreclose her seven-hundred-year stasis. Embodied emotion appears in the tears and the "fierce" awakening crack, though some interiority leans toward summary ("isolation had calcified around her heart"). The final renunciation of solitude carries visible cost—she abandons her role as memorial-keeper to become a bridge—and the small creatures' presence dramatizes the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is prompt: who (Mira), where (tidal library above cloudline), and when (three weeks after the reincarnation memory) anchor by the second paragraph. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the reincarnation memory reweights Mira's purpose, the brass sundial's reinterpretation deepens it, and the stone circle's activation delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid) where her isolation transforms into welcome with felt cost—she relinquishes her memorial role. One meaningful tightening occurs when she places the sundial and the pattern resolves into winged shapes, narrowing her understanding and opening a new path. Cost is legible: "no longer a relic of extinction, but a bridge."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tidal library is vivid and purposeful: shelves ebb and flow, manuscripts arrive on mist currents, the central pool shows memory, and the stone circle hums with atomically reflective surfaces that fracture light into possibilities. The setting constrains Mira's choices—she must descend to the foundation, place the sundial at the circle's center—and the cloud currents carry the newborn creatures upward, charging the final image. Sensory detail (hum, iridescent scales, chirping frequency) is filtered through Mira's seven-hundred-year perspective. The micro-setting (brass sundial, stone circle) functions as both tool and environment, shaping the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating isolation into something else—is signaled early and tightens when Mira reinterprets Korvash's command from endurance to creation. One meaningful reversal occurs when the sundial triggers the stone circle, birthing the small creatures and reweighting her purpose from preservation to cultivation. Agency is renunciation: she abandons her vigil as memorial-keeper with the cost of releasing her role as "last contemporary." The pressure is Accumulative—the reincarnation memory deepens, the sundial's placement intensifies, and the creatures' arrival crystallizes a new stance. No explicit antagonist, but the centuries-long misunderstanding of her purpose creates friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the brass sundial shifts from memorial to doorway, the stone circle from preservation tool to birthing mechanism, and Mira's isolation from cage to preparation. The final image—small creatures dreaming while Mira watches as bridge rather than relic—offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a moral. Subtext operates in Korvash's cryptic line ("Time is not a cage... a door") and in Mira's tears, which dramatize the cost of her realization. Independence is dramatized as courage to build new connections, not absence of connection, with the manuscript she writes functioning as a guide rather than a sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, filtering all detail through Mira's seven-hundred-year perspective. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices leviathan shadows, ancient stone surfaces, and the frequency of the small creatures' chirps. Diction stays consistent—elevated but not anachronistic ("brittle awakenings," "atomically reflective," "calcified around her heart")—and modulates with emotional intensity at the closure beat. The single line of dialogue ("Time is not a cage...") carries subtext and advances plot by reframing the sundial's purpose. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the climactic placement and hatching sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Information density is high—most lines advance character understanding or setting logic—though some phrases lean toward ornament ("manuscripts that arrived on mist currents and departed with the dawn"). Clarity holds throughout; spatial choreography (spiral stairs, central pool, stone circle, cloud floor) tracks cleanly. Minor figurative density in the opening paragraph ("tidal library," "ebbing and flowing," "isolation had calcified") does not obscure causality. No loops or scaffold detected. The final image ("bridge to something beautifully, impossibly alive") recharges the extinction motif without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The combination of tidal library, reincarnation memory, and stone-circle birth of new creatures transforms familiar extinction-and-rebirth material through specific world logic and Mira's misinterpretation arc. The brass sundial as translation key—time as door rather than cage—feels earned in hindsight. The turn from preservation to cultivation avoids the expected "lone survivor endures" template. The small creatures are not leviathans reborn but something new, which sidesteps convenience resurrection. Fresh inflection: Mira's role as bridge rather than memorial-keeper, and the guide manuscript she writes to welcome future keepers. Risk-taking is moderate but effective; the accumulative structure and lyric closure heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira, contemporary of extinct leviathans, drives all key beats: reinterprets the reincarnation memory (first third), reinterprets Korvash's sundial gift (middle), places the sundial to activate the stone circle (climax), and writes the guide manuscript (closure). Her choices alter tactics from passive preservation to active cultivation with visible cost—renouncing her role as relic. Present in setup, development, and payoff; beats: memory realization, sundial placement, guide writing. Causal pressure narrows her options from endurance to creation. Closure linkage strong: she becomes bridge. Specificity high: her seven-hundred-year chain-of-souls identity is irreplaceable. Cost: abandons memorial vigil.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Brass sundial introduced early (Korvash's gift), reinterpreted mid-story ("not a command to preserve... to translate"), placed at stone circle center to trigger birth (climax), and its shadow marks "not hours but generations" (closure). Beats: memory of Korvash, reinterpretation insight, physical placement, shadow image. Causal pressure: sundial's placement enables the stone circle activation. Closure linkage strong: final paragraph mentions its glint and shadow. Specificity: Korvash's personal gift with cryptic instruction. Cost: releasing it from memorial shelf to functional use. Early signal, three beats, closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Brittle awakenings" frames the reincarnation memory insight in paragraph two and returns at the climactic crack ("brittle awakening cracked open fully") when Mira's purpose shifts. It shapes her understanding: each new life "cracked away pieces of connection until only duty remained." The concept alters her tactics from preservation to cultivation with felt cost. Present in setup and closure; middle development implicit. Lyric reprise reweights the stake. Swappability moderate—"fragmented rebirths" could substitute. Causal pressure moderate: the concept explains her isolation but does not directly constrain physical choices. Closure linkage present but not indispensable to plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atomically reflective stone surfaces introduced early, used mid-story to "show not reflections but possibilities, paths not taken, futures still available," and at climax when light fractures through them to cast winged shapes. Beats: initial description, mechanics explanation, light-fracture birth. Causal linkage: the reflective property enables the sundial's activation effect. Closure participation: shapes resolve into creatures via this trait. Swappability moderate—"magically reflective" could substitute with minor edits. Cost tied to trait unclear; the reflective quality is described more than it constrains Mira's choices. Early signal, two functional beats, closure involved but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Coexist" appears late (second half): small creatures "learn to coexist with the library's rhythms, riding the mist currents, nesting in the spaces between ancient texts." The action frames the resolution but does not drive earlier beats. Mira's final realization centers on welcoming rather than mourning, which ties to coexistence. The creatures' coexistence with the library dramatizes the thematic shift. Late first appearance limits causal pressure. Closure linkage moderate: the ending shows Mira watching over them, embodying coexistence. Swappability moderate—"inhabit" or "thrive within" could replace it. Cost connection weak; coexistence is outcome, not choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stone circle introduced early ("ancient stone circle hummed its eternal note"), mechanics explained ("surfaces atomically reflective, bouncing light... showed possibilities"), and activated at climax when Mira places the sundial ("hum deepened... light fractured... patterns resolved into shapes"). Beats: descent to circle, sundial placement, birth of creatures. Causal pressure strong: the method enables the entire climactic turn and creature birth. Closure linkage: the method's success redefines Mira's purpose. Specificity high: the circle predates leviathans and requires the sundial trigger. Cost: Mira must understand and enact the method correctly or remain isolated. Early signal, multiple beats, indispensable to plot.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tidal library above cloudline anchors all action: shelves ebb and flow, central pool shows memory, spiral stairs lead to stone circle foundation, cloud floor surrounds the structure. Setting constrains Mira's choices—she must descend to the foundation, use the circle—and supplies resources (manuscripts, mist currents that carry creatures upward). Beats: opening anchor, memory pool, stone circle activation, creatures nesting in shelves. Causal pressure: the library's structure and tools enable the plot. Closure: creatures explore and nest, Mira writes a new manuscript. Specificity high: the tidal, above-cloud mechanics are irreplaceable. Cost: the setting isolates Mira for centuries, shaping her misunderstanding. Present throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Timeframe "three weeks ago, the library's central pool had shown her what she truly was" anchors the inciting insight and creates urgency for Mira's reinterpretation. The seven-hundred-year backstory frames her isolation but the three-week window tightens the present decision to act. The timeframe shapes her understanding that "this awakening felt different" and pressures her to break the pattern now. Cost: if she does not act, the cycle continues. Beats: inciting memory, reinterpretation, sundial placement. Causal pressure moderate: the timeframe motivates but does not mechanically constrain the climax. Closure: she acts within this window. Early signal, shapes one major choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation "to translate isolation into independence" is dramatized through Mira's reinterpretation arc: she believed her purpose was preservation but realizes it is cultivation. Friction between want (connection) and cost (abandoning memorial role) drives the climax. Beats: reincarnation memory reweights isolation, sundial reinterpretation reframes independence, creature birth enacts translation, guide manuscript cements it. Causal pressure strong: the desire to escape isolation drives the sundial placement. Closure: she achieves independence as bridge-builder, not relic. Specificity high: translation (not escape or replacement) is thematic and tactical. Cost visible: she renounces seven centuries of preserved grief. Early signal, beats throughout, indispensable.</comment>
