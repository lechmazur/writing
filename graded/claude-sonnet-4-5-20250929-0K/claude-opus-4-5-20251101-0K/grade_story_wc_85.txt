<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's guilt is embodied through ritual behavior and the carved hand discovery, but her interior voice occasionally slips into therapy-speak ("the weight of unspoken words," "tempered regret") that flattens peak moments. The choice to speak aloud and commit to reconstruction arrives with visible cost and forecloses her prior evasion. Motivation is clear and intensifies coherently, though the final turn feels somewhat preordained rather than wrested from contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis—Maren's decision to reconstruct what she destroyed forecloses her old path with visible cost (loss of detachment, acceptance of unpayable debt). The piece operates under a Causal lens with accumulative texture: the letter revelation → nightly penance → carved hand discovery → spoken confession → commitment to repair. Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph (who, where, when). One meaningful tightening occurs when the carved hand crystallizes her withheld truth and forces the vocal confession, narrowing options from silent evasion to active atonement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore provide concrete spatial grounding with purposeful detail (blue tiles catching amber light, driftwood in silver piles). The carved hand functions as micro-setting that charges the final image and constrains Maren's choice—she places it on the terrace tiles as a permanent reminder. Sensory selection serves mood effectively (sieved hush, whisper of wood against wood), though the beach as "sculptor's retreat" feels convenient rather than discovered through Maren's professional lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Maren's need to confront her complicity in the girl's erasure) is signaled early and tightens through the carved hand discovery. One meaningful pressure point: the hand's "desperate precision" forces Maren from silent evasion to spoken confession, which then narrows options to active reconstruction. The resolution is earned by Maren's agency—her choice to use her skills in reverse—with visible cost (she deserves no absolution, only honest work). No antagonist required; the pressure is internal and accumulative, coherent under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (complicity, the weight of willful ignorance, attempted repair) emerges organically from Maren's profession and the carved hand's symbolism of stopped time. The ending offers a resonant answer through action rather than statement: she will reconstruct what she helped destroy, knowing it won't be enough but will be true. Subtext operates in the sieved hush (silence as both penance and the space for truth) and the wooden fingers clutching the broken watch hand. Minor slip: "truth was the only currency she had left that wasn't counterfeit" borders on thematic echo, though it's more implicit summary than overt sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present (Maren notices carving craftsmanship, frames her work as "manufacturing false memories") but occasionally shifts into elevated register during reflection ("tempered regret," "withheld truth") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. No dialogue present, so those bullets don't apply. Narrative stance modulates appropriately from detached description to embodied grief at the confession moment. Filter verbs ("realized," "understood") appear but don't severely dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with good sensory specificity ("sieved hush," "driftwood accumulated in silver piles"). However, several loops and near-paraprase clusters: "weight of unspoken words" → "withheld truth" → "swallowed her confession like a stone" recycle the same concept across three paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence in the backstory block ("She had believed... She had never told... She had not asked") creates rhythmic monotony. The carved hand description is vivid and propulsive, and the final paragraph avoids overwriting, but mid-story scaffold weakens momentum. Deduct −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template stems that don't touch closure but accumulate through the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise (black market genealogist who erases identities confronts her complicity) offers a fresh angle on guilt and repair narratives. Execution is competent but relies on familiar beats: the triggering letter, the nightly ritual, the found object that crystallizes resolve. The carved hand with broken watch is evocative but borders on symbolic convenience—it arrives precisely when needed to catalyze the turn. Emotional specificity (Maren weeping for the first time since childhood, her understanding that she *had* sensed cruelty) elevates the material above template, though the arc follows a recognizable redemption contour without bold structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's identity as black market genealogist frames the premise, her guilt drives every beat, and her decision to use her skills in reverse provides the closure turn. Present early, causally active throughout, and indispensable to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The watch hand clutched in the carved wooden fingers appears in the discovery beat, is interpreted ("time stopped"), placed on the terrace tiles at the end as a reminder, and charges the final image. Signals stopped time/moments demanding attention; causal role in crystallizing Maren's resolve; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Sieved hush" appears twice as the silence between waves that allows Maren to process and finally speak her confession. It provides atmospheric texture and frames the confession beat, but its mechanics (wave pullback + wind dying) don't constrain tactics or alter options—it's more thematic echo than pressure device. Present in setup and at the confession turn; lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake modestly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Manufacturing false memories is Maren's profession, backstory reveals her past work erasing the girl, and the ending commits her to reversing that skill. The trait enables the inciting harm and shapes the resolution with visible cost (she must reconstruct what she destroyed, knowing it won't be enough). Causally active across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Quell" appears in Maren's reflection: "The words did not quell her guilt—nothing could do that entirely." The action is named but not dramatized as an attempt; instead the text immediately pivots to what the confession *did* do (loosen the grip). Present at a key turn but more summary than scene pressure; swappable with "erase" or "resolve" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sifting through driftwood carvings is Maren's nightly ritual, introduced early, and the method delivers the carved hand that triggers her turn. The mechanics (examining fragments, finding the hand) are shown on the page and shape the middle beat. Setup, development, and payoff all present; the method is causally necessary.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace at dusk opens and closes the story, provides spatial grounding, and Maren places the carved hand on its tiles as the final act. Dusk coloring (amber light, darkening horizon, first stars) tracks time and mood. The terrace functions more as framing device than constraint on tactics, but its return at closure with the placed object reweights the opening image purposefully.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Under the weight of unspoken words" is articulated as Maren's pressure state and the words she finally speaks. The phrase appears in setup and at the confession beat, but timeframe as a ticking constraint isn't dramatized—three weeks of ritual have passed without urgency. The weight is more thematic than temporal; it doesn't alter tactics beat-to-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Discovering the weight of the withheld truth drives Maren's arc from silent evasion to spoken confession to reconstruction commitment. The motivation is seeded early ("she needed to discover the weight"), tested through the carved hand, and resolved with visible cost (honest work, no absolution). Friction between the desire to know and the cost of knowing is dramatized across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tempered regret saturates the piece from the opening ritual through the final paragraph's explicit statement. Tone modulates appropriately (detachment → embodied grief at confession → quiet resolve) and charges the ending image (she sits with her grief, willing to carry its full weight). Coherent across turns, though the final paragraph's direct naming of "tempered regret" slightly undermines the show.</comment>
