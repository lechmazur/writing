<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Herald's motivation is clear and consistent—lighthouse keeper, storm communicator, bridge between ages—and her devotion never wavers. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("shadowed elation," "otherworldly routine") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The prophetic utterances feel ornamental; they don't emerge from a dramatized internal conflict or force a visible tradeoff. No secondary character pressure tests her commitment, and the ending renews the routine without forecloses any live option or revealing a cost paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates imagery and thematic weight across the lighthouse ascent, but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options or changes knowledge. The ending returns to the established routine with gentle rain—resonance is gestured at ("new dawn shaped by ancient shadows") but the closure lacks a decisive reconfiguration or conceptual repricing with felt cost. The prophetic declarations and storm "conversation" remain abstract; no dramatized consequence or forecloses path makes before/after legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and jade-green walls are vivid and recur purposefully. The glass lantern wick and lens mechanism anchor key beats, and the final rain ties setting to action. Sensory detail (stars pressing, dormant electricity humming) is selective and voice-filtered. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the ascent and lamp-room sequence, and the setting constrains the Herald's nightly task, grounding the otherworldly premise in tactile ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: maintain the compact between humanity and weather. The Herald's action—lighting the wick, calling the storms—is consistent with her goal, but no on-page complication forces a trade-off or narrows options. The storms answer, the rain falls "exactly where she had called them," and she will "climb again" tomorrow. No visible price is paid; no live alternative is foreclosed. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation would require a density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; here the beat remains steady from ignition to dawn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—ancient ways versus digital modernity, light and shadow as partners—emerges organically from the premise and recurs in image (emerald arrows, shadowed elation, dawn shaped by ancient shadows). However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("the old compact...remained unbroken," "new dawn shaped by ancient shadows") rather than letting the rain and her descent offer a non-literal answer. The prophetic voice ("a child will be born...and she will grow to plant forests") adds texture but remains ornamental; it doesn't test or complicate the Herald's commitment. No counter-reading or ambiguity charges the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-close; the Herald's perceptual signature (storms as alive, shadows as partners, laughter as thunder) is distinct and consistent. Diction ("symphony of thunder and joy," "shadowed elation," "co-conspirators in a destiny") is elevated and voice-motivated, fitting the quasi-mythic register. However, several filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("she could feel the weather systems gathering," "she felt the familiar shadowed elation"), slightly dulling immediacy. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the prose texture reflects the Herald's reverent, ritualistic stance throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied and vivid ("Green light erupted through the lens, fragmenting into a thousand emerald arrows"). However, multiple lines loop conceptually: "otherworldly routine" appears three times, "ancient shadows" recurs without added pressure, and phrases like "as she always did" and "as they always did" stack template cadence across adjacent paragraphs. The prophetic declarations ("The eastern shores will need rain by Thursday...a child will be born...") feel ornamental, not propulsive. Figurative language is dense but controlled; no major clarity breaks. Information density is moderate; some beats (kneeling, positioning the wick) advance setup without complicating stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—lighthouse keeper who speaks to storms through light—offers a fresh angle on weather magic and lost knowledge. The emerald lens and "total internal reflection" mechanism add specificity. However, the emotional arc (devoted keeper renews ancient compact) and the resolution (storms answer, rain falls, she will climb again) follow a familiar template: solitary guardian preserves forgotten wisdom against modernity's amnesia. The prophetic voice and "shadowed elation" provide texture but don't transform the underlying structure. No bold risk at closure; the ending reaffirms the status quo without a non-obvious turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; her ascent, wick-lighting, laughter, and prophetic call drive the sequence. She appears in setup, middle (lighting the wick), and ending (descent, rain fulfillment). However, her choices (climb, light, call, descend) do not narrow options or face a complication; she executes the routine without reversal. No visible cost or trade-off emerges from her decisions. Beat involvement: three distinct beats (ascent, ignition, dawn watch). Causal pressure is low; the action is ritual, not conflict-driven. Closure linkage: she descends with "a full heart" but the ending reaffirms routine rather than altering it.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glass lantern wick is handled in two beats: lifted from its silver cradle (mid-story) and struck to ignite the beam (climax). Its crystalline structure "containing...a thousand lightning strikes" is specific and irreplaceable. It enables the storm-calling tactic and charges the moment of ignition ("the wick blazed with an intensity that made the stars themselves seem dim"). However, it does not return with reweighted meaning at closure; the ending focuses on rain and the Herald's descent. Present in setup (described), development (handled and positioned), and payoff (ignited to summon storms). Causal: enables the central action. Cost: implicit (requires care, alignment) but not dramatized as a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Otherworldly routine" is named three times and shapes the Herald's motivation and the story's structure (nightly ascent, ritual ignition, dawn watch, repeat). It frames the premise and recurs in the ending ("The routine was otherworldly, yes, but it was hers"). However, the concept is largely thematic; it does not create a visible on-page constraint or complication. No moment tests the routine's cost or sustainability. Setup: paragraph two. Development: paragraph nine ("This was her otherworldly routine"). Payoff: penultimate paragraph. Beat involvement: one (the routine is described and then reaffirmed). Causal pressure: minimal; the routine is backdrop, not a lever that alters tactics. Specificity: high (lighthouse, midnight, storms) but the "otherworldly" label remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Accidentally prophetic" is named once (paragraph seven: "her voice accidentally prophetic as always") and illustrated in the same beat with specific predictions. It does not recur or constrain a later choice. The trait is label-only; no on-page consequence or trade-off follows from her prophetic utterances. Setup: absent until mid-story. Development: mentioned and demonstrated in one beat. Payoff: the rain fulfills her call, but causality is unclear (storms "listened and adjusted their paths" vs. she predicted what would happen). No visible cost or friction tied to the trait. Swappable: she could simply "call the storms" without the prophetic flourish. Ornamental use dominates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Steer" appears in paragraph two ("steer the storms home") and is dramatized in the ignition beat ("This was how she steered them, not through force but through conversation"). The storm-calling is the story's central action, and the ending fulfills it (rain falls "exactly where she had called them"). However, the act of steering is unopposed; no complication tests her ability or forces a tactical shift. Setup: paragraph two. Development: paragraphs five and six (aligning the wick, igniting the beam). Payoff: final paragraph (rain arrives as called). Beat involvement: two (preparation, ignition). Causal pressure: moderate (the action enables the ending outcome). Cost: none dramatized; she succeeds without sacrifice or error. Irreplaceable within the premise but not tested by friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Through total internal reflection" is explained in paragraph five: "the beam would travel, bouncing within the emerald's crystalline lattice until it emerged transformed." The mechanism is specific and signals how the lighthouse communicates with storms. However, it appears only in setup (exposition) and is not revisited or tested. The ignition beat focuses on flame and green light, not the reflection mechanics. Setup: paragraph five. Development: absent (the lens is positioned, but reflection mechanics are not shown). Payoff: absent (the beam is launched, but internal reflection is not reprised or charged). Beat involvement: one (exposition only). Causal: the method enables the premise but is told, not dramatized. Swappable: "through light" or "through the lens" would convey the same causal role with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse recurs throughout: jade-green walls, spiral stairs, glass dome, lamp room, emerald facets, emerald lens, emerald arrows piercing the sky. It provides spatial anchors (ascent, lamp room, descent) and constrains the Herald's nightly task (she must climb to the lens to light the wick). The setting charges the final image: her descent at dawn, the lighthouse standing as "a bridge between ages," and rain falling "exactly where she had called them." Setup: opening paragraph. Development: the climb and lamp-room sequence. Payoff: descent and enduring role. Beat involvement: three or more (climb, ignition chamber, watch, descent). Causal: the lighthouse's height and lens are necessary for the storm-calling. Specificity: high (emerald, crystalline, jade-green).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"After the last print newspaper crumbled to dust" anchors the timeframe in the opening paragraph and recurs thematically (humanity "forgot how to read the skies," "the world had moved on to digital feeds"). However, it remains backstory; the post-print era does not constrain a present choice or tighten a decision on the page. No scene beat tests the friction between old ways and new technology. Setup: paragraph one. Development: paragraph eight (brief reflection on digital forecasts). Payoff: absent (the ending does not reprise or charge the timeframe). Beat involvement: one (exposition and brief reflection). Causal pressure: none; the timeframe is context, not a lever. Swappable: "in a future age" or "after modernity forgot" would serve the same thematic role. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated in paragraph four: "Her motivation had never wavered...To shape a new dawn using ancient shadows required patience and faith." The phrase recurs in the ending: "a new dawn shaped by ancient shadows." It frames her goal and is visibly pursued (lighting the wick, calling the storms, delivering rain). However, the motivation is declared, not tested by on-page friction or trade-off. No moment dramatizes a conflict between shaping the dawn and another want or cost. Setup: paragraph four. Development: implicit in the ignition sequence. Payoff: final line reprises the phrase. Beat involvement: two (declaration, reprise). Causal: the motivation drives the action. Cost: none visible; she succeeds without sacrifice. The lyric reprise reweights the premise but adds no new pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Shadowed elation" is named in paragraph ten ("she felt the familiar shadowed elation fill her chest") and characterized as "a strange joy, tinged with melancholy...yet bright with hope." The tone is coherent across beats: joy in the ignition ("she laughed, as she always did"), melancholy for what was lost, hope for what might be salvaged. The final image modulates to quiet fulfillment ("aching legs and a full heart," "gentle and nourishing" rain). However, the tone is stated more than enacted; the Herald's laughter and declarations do not shift under pressure. Setup: implicit in "Laughing storm herald" (paragraph one). Development: paragraph ten (named and explained). Payoff: the ending sustains the tone. Beat involvement: two (ignition joy, dawn fulfillment). Causal: the tone colors her stance but does not constrain a choice. The final modulation is gentle, not charged by a decisive turn.</comment>
