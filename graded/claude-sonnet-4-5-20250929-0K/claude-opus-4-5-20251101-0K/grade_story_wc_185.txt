<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vera's characterization is strong: her ripple-marks serve as both physical history and embodied knowledge now made obsolete, creating genuine internal conflict. Her micro-choices (examining ice patterns, whispering into the stone, deciding to map for others) reveal a hierarchy of values—preservation of silence over personal escape. The final stance is earned through accumulated pressure rather than epiphany, and her decision to map the refuge forecloses solitary retreat with visible cost. Minor slip: the beings' indifference is asserted rather than dramatized through failed communication attempts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Vera plants herself in the eye of the storm with visible cost—she cannot stop the beings but claims territory worth holding. The accumulative lens holds throughout; each descent beat tightens spatial options until the bloom chamber crystallizes all prior pressure. Orientation anchors immediately (mapkeeper, caves, three months post-arrival) and causality remains tight: ice spiral → gap → new chamber → stone response → mapping decision. Cost is legible in her shift from solo refuge-seeker to guide for the overwhelmed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The harmonic caves constrain every choice: wall vibrations guide Vera's descent, ice formations reveal draft patterns, and the bloom chamber's geometry creates the acoustic shelter that enables her final stance. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priority—she reads caves through touch and sound before sight. The frozen-wave walls and crystalline growths emerge causally from the beings' disruption. Micro-setting (the body's ripple-marks, the stone's warmth) charges the final image when she presses palms to walls in acknowledgment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding refuge from overwhelming frequencies) is signaled immediately and tightens through spatial descent: junction → narrow gap → uncharted chamber → discovery. The reversal when the stone absorbs sound rather than echoing it provides genuine escalation under the accumulative lens. Agency is clear: Vera's professional knowledge (reading ice cracks, recognizing draft spirals) drives each move, and her final choice to map for others rather than hoard the refuge forecloses personal sanctuary with on-page cost ("hammered repose…earned exhaustion").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the conflict between existence and cohabitation, the cost of adaptation versus preservation. The bloom of hush functions as both literal shelter and metaphor for finding stability within upheaval without retreat—Vera does not conquer but claims the eye. The echo stone's progression (amplified → fractured → absorbed) traces the thematic arc without stating it. Final image ("The quiet held her, and she held it back") offers non-literal answer to the central question of how to survive change, reweighting the grandmother's legacy and the mapkeeper's purpose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: professional precision in "ripple-mark," "bloom of hush," technical observation balanced against lyric compression in "hammered repose" and "pregnant with the absence of noise." POV remains stable; knowledge stays character-bound (Vera interprets via touch and sound, never claims the beings' intentions). Perceptual signature is consistent—she reads environment as text (crack patterns like braille, spiral suggesting draft). Distance modulates purposefully: clinical during assessment, compressed-lyric at closure. The phrase "hammered repose" enters naturally through her embodied state rather than as authorial imposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean with high information density and purposeful rhythm variation. Sentence openings vary; paragraphs create visual breath. Strong specific verbs (groaned, squeezed, tingled) anchor action. Minor slip: "gently luminous" appears three times in similar constructions, creating slight template echo. The phrase "sounds like struck metal sustained beyond natural decay" effectively conveys alien quality. Figurative language (frozen waves, water meeting oil) serves clarity rather than ornament. No loops or scaffold detected; momentum builds steadily through spatial descent to closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Premise transforms familiar refuge-quest through specific synthesis: energy beings as ambient disruption rather than antagonists, professional obsolescence through environmental change, acoustic geometry as solution. The ripple-marks and echo stone particularize the mapkeeper beyond generic fantasy cartographer. Risk in choosing accumulative pressure over confrontation pays off at closure. Slight dock: the "energy beings descended from upper atmosphere" setup leans toward familiar SF templates, though execution through sensory disruption (tooth-ache frequencies, thermal disruptions) adds fresh texture.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vera's choices create every key turn: following the ice spiral, squeezing through the gap, testing the stone, deciding to map for others rather than hoard refuge. Her professional knowledge (reading walls, interpreting cracks) enables the discovery. The final mapping decision forecloses personal sanctuary and redefines her purpose from preserver of old knowledge to guide through new reality. Present in setup, drives middle discovery, and shapes closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stone appears in three distinct beats: carried but unused (establishing obsolescence), tested in bloom chamber (reversal when it absorbs rather than echoes), pulsing as she maps (acknowledgment and closure charge). Its function evolves from tool to proof of discovery to witness. The inherited grandmother connection adds specificity. It constrains her prior attempts (unreliable echoes) and enables the bloom discovery, then charges the final image when it warms in response to her purpose.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bloom of hush is the story's structural spine: named in opening, drives Vera's descent goal, discovered at midpoint reversal, and provides the spatial solution that enables closure. Its mechanics (perfect acoustic absorption through geometry) dictate tactics throughout. The concept redefines from mythic phenomenon to tangible refuge, then gains social dimension when she chooses to share it. Removal would collapse plot logic, stakes, and thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Gently luminous" describes both the stone and the light it casts. It signals the stone's conjured nature and enables navigation in deep chambers, but does not constrain a key choice—Vera could map by headlamp alone. The quality gains slight resonance when stone's glow "paints the frozen waves" at closure, but this is atmospheric rather than causal. Present in setup and closure but middle function is descriptive.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Conjure" appears twice: the grandmother conjured the stone from first resonance; Vera will conjure a path for others. The verb carries specific meaning (creation from cave essence) and links inheritance to new purpose. It redefines Vera's role from recorder to active creator at closure. Removing it would require only modest rewording (inherit/create), placing it mid-band, but the magical-technical fusion adds thematic charge to her mapmaking as act of will rather than mere documentation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Examining ice crack patterns is the pivotal method that leads to discovery: Vera reads fractures as pressure/temperature story, identifies the spiral formation, and follows its direction to the gap. The skill demonstrates professional expertise in action and provides causal link between junction and bloom chamber. Signaled early through ripple-mark reading, executed at key turn, and its success enables all subsequent action. Could be replaced with another tracking method but the ice-specific detail integrates with thermal disruption worldbuilding.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Harmonic caves are indispensable: their acoustic properties create both problem (frequencies shift walls) and solution (bloom chamber geometry). The setting supplies every constraint (crystalline growths seal passages, ice forms from thermal disruption, wall vibrations guide navigation) and the resource that enables closure (perfect absorption). Vera's profession exists because of the caves' unique properties. The frozen-wave formations and draft patterns are causally tied to beings' arrival. Setting pressure is continuous and closure would be impossible elsewhere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The three-month timeframe establishes disruption scale (forty years obsolete vs. three months of change) and creates urgency through accumulated desperation ("musicians driven mad," "children who could not sleep"). It constrains Vera's knowledge—maps are recent casualties, not ancient history. The "after arrival" framing shapes all tactics (she must navigate changed topology) and provides the pressure that drives her to the deepest refuge. Present throughout as context; not a ticking clock but a lived duration with mounting social cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Finding "the quiet in the storm" is dramatized through every choice: retreating deeper, seeking bloom of hush by name, testing the stone for silence, feeling relief when sound disappears. The motivation carries internal friction—she seeks refuge but chooses to share it, forfeiting exclusive sanctuary. Her professional identity (mapkeeper needing silence to work) makes the drive character-specific rather than generic escape. The phrasing recurs at closure ("found its eye and planted herself there") with reweighted meaning: not escape but strategic position.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Hammered repose" appears once at the bloom discovery as embodied sensation: "peace that had been beaten into existence through struggle, rest that tasted of earned exhaustion." The phrase captures tonal balance—hard-won calm rather than easy relief—and modulates from earlier anxiety (teeth aching, need to breathe) to the final quiet holding. Tone remains coherent through pressure: clinical professionalism during assessment, compressed determination during descent, lyric stillness at closure. The specific coinage charges the final image without mechanical repetition.</comment>
