<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and her actions consistent, but interiority leans toward abstraction ("surrounded by the whispers of those who came before"). The discovery-epiphany at the grove feels slightly announced rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final renunciation—leaving the seed rather than harvesting a cure—has weight, but the step from "accumulated intention" to understanding feels more told than shown through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story anchors quickly (pilot, planet, countdown) and delivers a clear RR: Maren grasps that resilience is practice, not substance, and leaves her seed with visible cost (she cannot take the source home). The causal chain from water flow → hidden valley → artifact contact → voice-trigger → epiphany holds under a Causal lens with one meaningful tightening when gravity inverts. The cost is legible in her decision to plant rather than harvest, though the epiphany mechanism (touch = voice chorus) arrives conveniently late without prior setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard planet's floating arches, inverted gravity, and silver grove are vivid and purposeful. The "whirling silence" before inversion and the detail of artifacts littered in roots ground the final beat. The environment constrains Maren's navigation (razor-sharp rock, water currents) and charges the closure image (seed planted among tokens). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding resilience to save her family's orchards—is signaled early and tightens when Maren discovers her grandmother's artifact, then deepens when she realizes the source cannot be taken. The gravity inversion creates urgency but functions more as spectacle than tactical constraint. The final choice (plant, not harvest) forecloses the easy solution with visible cost, though the path from touch to understanding compresses agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "Resilience isn't found. It's grown from what breaks." The image of broken things planted in hope recurs and reweights at closure without moralizing. The gathering of echoes as collective longing transformed into life offers a non-literal answer. The final line ("a new voice joined the gathering of echoes") resonates without stating a thesis, though "one broken thing at a time, one hope planted after another" edges toward abstraction in the penultimate section.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, and Maren's perceptual signature—tracing underground rivers, reading energy in soil—is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("whirling silence," "accumulated intention") that feels slightly imposed rather than voice-motivated. The phrase "knowledge that would save her orchards" in the penultimate paragraph leans expository. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with varied syntax. "Whirling silence" recurs purposefully. Minor template cadence in the opening beats: "She was an intrepid orchard pilot… Her small vessel… For three years, Maren had searched…" uses similar declarative stems. The phrase "hope, and that hope had seeped into the soil, into the roots, into the very stones" shows slight paraphrase loop (hope → hope). Information density is high; no major loops touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of floating-arch planet, gravity inversion, and collective-echo resilience is fresh. The twist that the source is accumulated intention rather than a harvestable substance offers a non-obvious angle. The frame of a pilot navigating by water flow during gravity shifts is memorable. However, the "broken things learn to grow" wisdom and the grandmother-artifact-as-epiphany-trigger follow familiar genre beats without full transformation. The story commits to its premise and follows implications cleanly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maren (intrepid orchard pilot) is present throughout, frames the search, and makes the final choice to plant rather than harvest. Her piloting skill (navigating by water flow, timing the inversion) shapes the approach but not the peak turn, which hinges on touch and epiphany rather than piloting decision. The character creates the closure choice with visible cost, satisfying two gates (setup, payoff) and contributing causally to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken arrow tip appears in setup (among artifacts), triggers the voice-chorus discovery when touched (middle turn), and is referenced in the closure beat when Maren places her seed beside it. It carries her grandmother's crest, making it irreplaceable and charging the final image. The element drives two distinct beats and shapes the ending with felt cost, meeting all three gates and showing strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The gathering of echoes is signaled early (seeker tradition), dramatized when Maren touches the artifact and hears layered voices including her grandmother's, and directly enables the epiphany that collective longing creates resilience. It reappears in the final line ("a new voice joined the gathering of echoes"), reweighting prior material. The concept shapes stakes (what Maren seeks) and the final understanding (resilience as practice, not substance) with undeniable conceptual cost: she cannot take it home. All three gates met with strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Accelerates plant growth is introduced late (when Maren realizes "the artifact accelerates plant growth") and described rather than shown constraining a choice. The mechanism (accumulated intention seeping into soil) explains the planet's resilience but does not enable or prevent an on-page action with visible tradeoff. The trait is told in summary and arrives after the 40% mark, capping it at 4.6; slight closure participation (Maren plants her seed expecting growth) lifts it modestly within band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Discover (the action) structures the entire arc: Maren searches, finds the hidden valley, discovers the artifacts and her grandmother's token, and realizes the source's nature. The discovery at the grove is the story's hinge, altering her understanding and forcing the final choice. The action is irreplaceable—removing it breaks the causal chain—and shapes the closure directly. All three gates met with strong beat involvement and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Navigating by water flow is signaled early ("traced the underground rivers… no compass could predict"), enables entry to the hidden valley ("letting the subterranean current guide her"), and returns in the exit ("following the water flow outward"). The method matters tactically (surrender vs. fighting the current means destruction) and constrains her path. It shapes two beats and the closure movement, meeting all three gates with causal involvement, though the final exit mentions it without fresh complication.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches is present throughout, frames the search, constrains navigation (razor-sharp formations, no compass), and provides the hidden valley where closure occurs. The arches shape tactics (water-flow navigation, timing the inversion) and the setting's unique gravity inversion charges the discovery beat. The environment is irreplaceable and integral to the closure image (silver grove, ancient trees, planted seed). All three gates met with strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The gravity-inversion timeframe is signaled early ("twelve minutes until gravity inverted") and tracked ("Five minutes until inversion"). The inversion occurs on-page during the discovery, creating the floating moment when Maren understands. However, the countdown does not tighten her choices—she lands, walks, discovers, and floats without the clock forcing a tradeoff. The element shapes one beat (the inversion itself) and charges the discovery image but does not constrain tactics with visible cost, meeting two gates (setup, payoff) with modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>To find the source of resilience is stated early ("For three years, Maren had searched"), linked to her dying family orchards, dramatized when she discovers the grove and her grandmother's artifact, and drives the final choice (plant, not harvest). The motivation is present across beats and shapes the closure with visible cost (she cannot take the cure home). Friction appears when she realizes the source cannot be harvested, forcing a renunciation. All three gates met with strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Whirling silence is introduced early ("that peculiar stillness that preceded the gravity shift") and recurs in the final valley description and the closing line. The tone is coherent and modulates with the discovery (wonder, realization) without flattening. The phrase charges the closure image ("in the whirling silence of the hidden valley") by reweighting the initial description. The tone element shapes two beats and participates in closure, meeting all three gates with purposeful recurrence and closure linkage, though it does not constrain a choice with cost.</comment>
