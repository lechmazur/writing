<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mei-Lin's interiority shows spiritual curiosity and grief-pattern recognition, but her agency remains observational until the encounter. The old woman's transformation is dramatized through breath patterns, yet her interior contradiction (daughter's forgiveness) is asserted rather than earned through conflicting impulses. The past-life monk backstory provides motivation but doesn't constrain present choices with visible cost. Embodied emotion appears in the woman's weeping, but Mei-Lin's own struggle or cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—breath patterns, jasmine, and luminous threads build toward a final image that reweights the premise of unused love. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of "luminous residue" spiraling upward reconfigures the opening question ("where does unused love go?") with conceptual cost made visible through the woman's release. One meaningful deepening occurs when breath darkness transforms into luminous threads, narrowing the protagonist's understanding and charging the final photograph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Twilight viaduct with jasmine, fog, and iron railings is anchored early and filters through Mei-Lin's lens-focused perception. The camera obscura constrains her method (inverted display, breath visibility) and charges the final image when she captures "luminous residue." Sensory detail—amber glow, foggy lucidity, breath fog—supports the spiritual-curiosity POV without catalog excess. Spatial choreography is clear: viaduct path, jasmine cluster, apparatus positioning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discovering where unused love is stored, signaled in the monk's drowning memory. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mei-Lin reads the woman's breath and offers the camera obscura ritual, narrowing options from passive observation to active healing attempt. The woman's participation and breath transformation constitute a micro-reversal that validates the premise. Agency is decision (approaching the woman) and method (breath instruction), with cost legible in the woman's open weeping and Mei-Lin's solitary continuation—though the protagonist's personal price remains light.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—unused love finding release—emerges through breath patterns, the jade pendant backstory, and the camera obscura's revelatory function. The final image (luminous residue spiraling upward) answers the opening question non-literally, reweighting prior material. However, "Forgiveness implied separation…love released returned to its source" edges into stated moral rather than letting the image speak. Mei-Lin's insight ("some answers only become visible when we stop demanding sharp focus") is borderline thematic echo. Subtext operates in the woman's silent weep and breath fog, but the ending paragraph over-articulates theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-close with Mei-Lin's perceptual signature: light trails, breath halos, inverted images. Diction elevates ("pilgrim of sparks," "watercolor ambiguity," "foggy lucidity") in a way that reads voice-motivated rather than arbitrary, though "spiritually curious observation" is on-the-nose labeling. Dialogue is minimal, functional, and carries subtext ("Your breath carries someone else's sorrow"). No head-hopping. Psychic distance stays controlled. Final paragraph's "spiritual curious" and wisdom summary ("some answers only become visible…") slightly over-explain, but the core voice holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several lines loop: "spiritually curious observation" appears twice, "unused love" recurs without fresh pressure, and the final paragraph stacks summary ("she would continue," "Kwan Yin's Tear had been lost," "some answers only become visible"). Template cadence in the closing: "She was [noun]…She was [noun]…She was [noun]" across three beats. Mixed metaphor: "sparks from an unseen fire" when sparks *are* fire. Stock phrasing: "invisible geography of human longing." Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems, −0.3 for mixed metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Camera obscura as spiritual tool and breath-pattern reading offer a fresh synthesis. Past-life memory (jade pendant, monk drowning) and "pilgrim of sparks" frame the quest with specificity. However, the core emotional arc—stranger helps mourner release grief through ritual—follows a common template (wise healer meets sufferer). The ending's continuation ("she would continue her pilgrimage tomorrow") and wisdom summary reduce risk. Transformation test: the plot could function with a different mystical device and a different grief object without major revision, suggesting moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Camera obscura artist: present early (setup), drives the encounter beat when Mei-Lin invites the woman to look through the lens (development), and captures the final image (payoff). However, her artist role is more observational than choice-driven until the encounter; the key turn is offering the apparatus, which is functional but not deeply character-specific. Two-gate minimum met, causal pressure moderate, closure linkage present. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, minus late agency (observational first half) −0.5, swappability (another mystical practitioner could replace) −0.5, ornamental backstory about "lifelong obsession" −0.3. Baseline 3.0 + net 2.8 = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's Tear: mentioned in backstory (setup) and invoked in the final paragraph as a thematic callback (payoff), but absent from the middle encounter beat (no development). The pendant is lost to the river and does not constrain present choices or alter tactics. Its purpose "survived across lifetimes" in the camera obscura, but this is asserted rather than dramatized. Two-gate minimum (setup + payoff) allows ≤6.0; lyric reprise reweights the quest theme. Early signal +0.4, payoff mention +0.5, swappability (any mystical heirloom could serve) −0.6, summary-only use −0.5, ornamental backstory −0.3. Baseline 3.0 + net 1.1 = 4.1, round to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Pilgrim of sparks: signaled early ("she was a pilgrim of sparks"), motivates Mei-Lin's twilight walks and luminous-trail tracking (development as repeated method), and appears in the closure ("luminous residue…spiraling upward like sparks"). However, the concept is more thematic label than on-page constraint—Mei-Lin's tactics (camera setup, breath instruction) don't visibly change because she's a "pilgrim." Three-gate presence, but causal pressure is light. Early signal +0.6, two beats (walks, final image) +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, label-only trait −0.8, swappability (another seeker metaphor) −0.5. Baseline 3.0 + net 2.2 = 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Spiritually curious: appears as explicit label ("spiritually curious observation," "spiritually curious, always wondering") rather than dramatized trait. It motivates Mei-Lin's three-month practice and her approach to the woman, but the trait is told rather than shown through a specific on-page choice with cost. Setup present (early label), development weak (no middle choice constrained by curiosity vs. another value), payoff weak (curiosity mentioned but doesn't shape final act). Early signal +0.3, one beat (approach decision) +0.4, label-only use −0.6, summary recounting −0.4. Baseline 3.0 + net 1.8 = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Heal: central to the encounter beat (Mei-Lin instructs the woman to "breathe out what belongs to her"), drives the woman's transformation, and Mei-Lin reflects on "learning to heal the world one exhalation at a time" in the closing. Three-gate presence. However, the healing is more demonstration than struggle—no failed attempt or cost to Mei-Lin's own state. Early signal (implicit in grief-pattern reading) +0.4, two beats (instruction, transformation) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure (narrows woman's options) +0.8, cost weak (woman weeps, but Mei-Lin's cost is future continuation, not present) −0.3, swappability (another mystical release could replace breath instruction) −0.4. Baseline 3.0 + net 3.7 = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Revealing through breathing changes: introduced in the middle beat (Mei-Lin watches breath patterns through the camera), mechanics explained ("exhalations carried darkness…luminous threads"), and enacted when the woman's breath clears. Two-gate presence (development + payoff); no setup in the opening beyond general "breath patterns" reference. Late first appearance (second half) −0.4, two beats (observation, instruction) +0.9, closure linkage (breath clears, luminous residue) +1.0, mechanics matter (inverted lens, slow breathing) +0.6, swappability moderate (another release ritual could serve) −0.5. Baseline 3.0 + net 3.3 = 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Twilight viaduct in bloom: present early (setup), provides the jasmine cluster where the woman stops (development), and the final image captures jasmine with the viaduct arching overhead (payoff). Three-gate presence. The setting supplies atmosphere and the inverted jasmine image aids the breath ritual, but it doesn't constrain Mei-Lin's choices—she could perform the healing elsewhere. Early signal +0.6, two beats (woman stops at jasmine, final photograph) +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, causal pressure weak (atmosphere > constraint) −0.4, swappability (another twilight location with flowers) −0.5. Baseline 3.0 + net 2.9 = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>After the past life memory surfaces: the monk's drowning memory is recounted as backstory ("Three nights ago, she had remembered drowning"), providing motivation for Mei-Lin's present quest. However, the timeframe is not a live constraint—no urgency or deadline pressures her choices on this particular evening. Setup present (backstory), no middle development (memory doesn't alter tactics during the encounter), payoff weak (closing paragraph mentions the pendant's survival "across lifetimes" but doesn't reweight the timeline). Two-gate minimum (setup + weak payoff) allows ≤6.0. Early signal +0.3, one beat (motivation) +0.4, summary-only −0.5, no closure pressure −0.4. Baseline 3.0 + net 1.6 = 4.6, cap at 4.6 for missing development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>To find where unused love is stored: the quest is explicit in backstory ("where does unused love go when we die?"), drives Mei-Lin's three-month pilgrimage and the encounter choice ("This was where unused love accumulated"), and the final image answers the question (luminous residue spiraling upward). Three-gate presence. However, the motivation is more thematic than conflicted—Mei-Lin faces no on-page friction between this desire and another cost. Early signal +0.7, two beats (quest walks, encounter answer) +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure (shapes her approach) +0.6, cost weak (continuation rather than sacrifice) −0.3, told motivation in backstory −0.4. Baseline 3.0 + net 3.4 = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Foggy lucidity: announced early ("that state of foggy lucidity where truth becomes visible"), sustained through the fog imagery and inverted camera display, and the closing sentence returns to it ("allow the world to blur into truth"). Three-gate presence. The tone supports the mystical-realist frame and charges the final image's soft clarity. However, it remains stable rather than modulating with pressure—the tone doesn't tighten or shift during the encounter beat. Early signal +0.6, two beats (fog description, inverted lens moment) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, modulation weak (static mood) −0.5, coherence through turns +0.5. Baseline 3.0 + net 3.6 = 6.6.</comment>
