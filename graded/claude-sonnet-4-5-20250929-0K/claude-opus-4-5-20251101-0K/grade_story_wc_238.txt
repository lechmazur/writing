<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and embodied through physical action (the perfume bottle, the electromagnetic apparatus), and Eleanor's manifestation shows concrete supernatural constraint. However, the central choice—to perform this exorcism—feels pre-determined rather than tested under pressure; Marcus arrives already committed, executes the plan without meaningful internal friction, and succeeds without visible cost to himself. The apology is delivered, but no path is foreclosed for the protagonist. Eleanor's emotional arc is more complete than Marcus's.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes clear anchors (archive, Marcus, Eleanor) early and follows a causal sequence: Marcus arrives, Eleanor manifests, the electromagnetic ritual succeeds, Eleanor is freed. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Marcus carries out both demon and dream, walks into "ethereal gray morning," but what has he lost or renounced? The ending gestures toward grace and imperfection but doesn't land a decisive change or charged reconfiguration with on-page price. The orchard destruction arrives as a ticking clock but doesn't constrain the ritual's success or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sheet music archive is vivid and purposeful: "dust and forgotten symphonies," "yellowed manuscripts," and the fluorescent lights flickering in Eleanor's presence all ground the supernatural in tactile detail. The archive's "deepest corner" provides spatial progression, and the orchard outside frames the time limit. The perfume bottle and copper apparatus are handled objects that constrain action. The archive itself doesn't force a tactical choice, but the sensory hierarchy (Marcus's focus on the apparatus, Eleanor's conducting gestures) reflects urgency and profession.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing Eleanor—is clear from the outset, and the electromagnetic ritual provides one meaningful tightening: the darkness is pulled from her soul. However, Marcus faces no opposition, internal or external; the procedure works as planned, Eleanor is freed, and the orchard's destruction (the ostensible time pressure) doesn't actually complicate the ritual. The "imperfect miracle" is asserted rather than demonstrated through visible trade-offs or escalating cost. Success without friction flattens the pressure curve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of imperfect miracles and overdue apologies emerges organically from Marcus's action and Eleanor's release, avoiding overt statement until the final exchange. The perfume bottle and unfinished symphony provide concrete anchors. However, the final paragraph ("Some apologies arrived thirty years late...") edges toward summary moralizing rather than letting the image of Marcus carrying "both the demon and the dream" speak for itself. The theme is coherent but not fully dramatized at closure—we're told grace exists "between failure and redemption" instead of seeing its cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is stable and distinctive, blending ecclesiastical diction ("cassock," "doctrine") with noir texture ("gossip-column exorcist," "the papers had called it a heart attack"). Marcus's perceptual signature—seeing spiritual mechanics through metaphor and electromagnetic principle—is consistent. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Eleanor's "You always advises through metaphors" has a grammatical slip ("advises" for "advise") that feels unintentional rather than voice-specific. Psychic distance is controlled, and the prose modulates appropriately between reflection and action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the opening (archive, Marcus's reputation, the mission established in three paragraphs). However, several lines lean toward purple: "her voice like wind through hollow reeds," "a sound like paper tearing," "darkness emerged...like smoke from a extinguished candle" stack similes without clear differentiation. The phrase "a extinguished" is a grammatical error. Metaphoric density in the middle third ("space between notes," "nothing is ever truly lost") risks decorative clustering, though the closure paragraph regains propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of exorcism-via-electromagnetism and the gossip-column priest offers a fresh angle, and the sheet music archive as supernatural anchor is specific. However, the emotional core—a guilt-driven apology thirty years late—follows a familiar redemption template without a sharp transformation. The orchard destruction, a potentially bold constraint, doesn't force a trade-off. The risk of blending noir, Catholic ritual, and steampunk mechanics is notable, but the execution feels careful rather than daring; no choice upends expectation or costs Marcus something irretrievable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus (gossip-column exorcist) drives the plot: he initiates the visit, delivers the apology, performs the ritual, and decides to finish Eleanor's symphony. His professional identity (unorthodox methods, tabloid fame) is signaled early but doesn't constrain his choices on the page—he could be any guilt-ridden exorcist here. The trait shapes tone more than tactics. Present across all three gates (setup, middle action, closure decision), but the "gossip-column" aspect remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The antique perfume bottle appears in three beats: Marcus presents it to Eleanor, it becomes the vessel for the demon, and he carries it out at closure. Its function evolves from emotional anchor (Eleanor's mother's keepsake) to demon trap, and its presence in the final image charges Marcus's departure. Removing it would require a different demon-containment mechanism and weaken the apology's tangible proof. Strong integration, though the bottle's properties (why it can hold a demon) are asserted rather than prepared.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept of "imperfect miracles" is stated explicitly by Marcus ("Imperfect miracles are all I've ever managed") and echoed by Eleanor and the closing paragraph. It provides thematic frame but doesn't constrain the ritual's success—Marcus's miracle works as intended, freeing Eleanor completely. The "imperfect" quality is told rather than shown through visible cost or compromise. Present in setup (Marcus's warning), middle (ritual proceeds), and closure (theme summary), but lacks on-page friction or trade-off that would make imperfection felt.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marcus's habit of advising through metaphors is noted by Eleanor ("You always advises through metaphors, Marcus. Even now") and demonstrated once: "Nothing is ever truly lost...Sometimes things simply wait in the space between notes, hoping someone will play them again." However, this metaphor doesn't constrain a choice or enable the ritual; it's conversational texture. The trait is present in setup and middle but doesn't drive a beat or shape closure. Swappable with direct speech.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The action "reconnect" is literalized through the electromagnetic apparatus: "Through induced currents...spiritual energy could be redirected." Marcus physically reconnects Eleanor's severed work (her demon-infected masterpiece) to free her. This action is the ritual's mechanism and drives the climactic beat. Removing it would collapse the exorcism. Present in setup (Marcus explains the principle), executed in the middle turn (generator activated, darkness pulled), and implicit in closure (Eleanor freed). Strong causal role, though the mechanics are asserted late.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method "through induced currents" is explained and enacted: Marcus uses copper wires, magnets, and a generator to create electromagnetic fields that pull the demon from Eleanor. It's signaled in the middle ("Through induced currents, he'd learned, spiritual energy could be redirected") and executed on the page. However, it's introduced at the moment of use rather than prepared earlier, so it reads partly as a convenience. Present in middle and closure participation (the ritual succeeds via this method), but missing early setup.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The sheet music archive provides vivid atmosphere (dust, yellowed manuscripts, towering shelves, flickering lights) and houses Eleanor's unfinished symphony, which Marcus retrieves at closure. The archive's "deepest corner" structures spatial progression. However, the setting doesn't constrain Marcus's choices—the ritual could occur in any space with Eleanor's presence. The archive enriches tone and supplies the final object (the manuscript) but doesn't pressure tactics. Present across all gates with lyric reprise (opening description, ritual location, final retrieval), reaching mid-band via atmosphere and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "during the hush before the orchard's trees are cut down" is signaled midway ("Outside, the world held its breath. The orchard beyond the archive's windows stood silent...development crews waiting for dawn") and referenced at closure ("the first chainsaw roared to life as dawn broke"). However, this clock doesn't tighten Marcus's decisions—the ritual succeeds before the deadline matters. The orchard is Eleanor's anchor, but its destruction doesn't force a trade-off or alter tactics. Present in middle and closure but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to deliver an overdue apology is the story's engine: "He was here to apologize to a ghost." It drives his arrival, the perfume bottle's return, the spoken apology ("I'm sorry...I was young and arrogant"), and his decision to finish Eleanor's symphony. The apology is dramatized on the page and costs Marcus thirty years of guilt, though the story doesn't show him renouncing something else to be here. Present in setup (stated mission), middle (apology spoken during ritual), and closure (carrying out Eleanor's final request). Strong integration with visible action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tone blends "ethereal" (Eleanor's translucent form, flickering lights, ghostly kiss) with "grit" (Marcus's tabloid reputation, the cassock brushing dusty boxes, copper wires and generators). The prose sustains this hybrid through concrete supernatural detail and noir-inflected voice. Tone modulates appropriately: reflective in the opening, tactile during the ritual, elegiac at closure ("ethereal gray morning"). However, the "grit" softens in the final third—no sweat, failure, or mess complicates the miracle's landing. Present across structure, but the balance tilts ethereal by the end.</comment>
