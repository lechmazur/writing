<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and her sensory perception (seeing harmonics as color) creates a specific lens. The journey through recordings dramatizes her shifting understanding through embodied attention (weeping at the wind recording). However, the final "realization" about connection being woven from attention arrives as an articulated insight rather than through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the climactic bell-ringing feels more like enactment of understanding than a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each recording stations Mira through accumulates density and shifts her understanding of connection. Orientation anchors (Laboratory, three days post-blackout, Mira alone) land cleanly within the opening. The closure—ringing bells with the lens as reminder—registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), reweighting her stance on connection with the cost implied in "trusting the resonance to find its way home" without demanding response. One deduction: the "artificial pilgrimage" frame is declared but not visibly constrained by the stations; she moves freely without friction or stakes testing her commitment to the route.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds is vividly specific (phonograph horns, oscilloscopes, glass tubes like organ pipes) and the golden light motif charges multiple moments. The carbide lens functions as both tool and recurring object, focusing sound in station beats and thrown spectrum in the climax. Spatial choreography (basement to bell tower ascent) tracks cleanly. The lens constraining her hearing and reappearing as a physical talisman at closure pushes this into the high 7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—is signaled early and tightens through the pilgrimage stations. Each recording deepens her questioning (mother's call, whale song, empty silence) in a cumulative pressure arc consistent with the Accumulative lens. The blackout's absence as a felt loss adds secondary texture. One meaningful deepening occurs when the "perfect silence" recording forces her to hear her own presence. Cost is more conceptual than visceral: she commits to bell-ringing "without expectation," but no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—connection as attention and resonance without transactional response—emerges through the stations (mother's century-old call, whales singing without guarantee) and avoids thesis statements until the penultimate paragraph, where "texture of connection, she realized, was woven from attention" borders on summary but is anchored by prior specifics. The carbide lens and bell harmonics recur with shifting weight. The final image (vibrations thrown into the loom of the world) offers a resonant answer without moralizing, though "That was enough. That was everything" leans slightly declarative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mira; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during station listening, wider during ascent and ringing). Perceptual signature—synesthetic color from bell harmonics, grandmother's mining metaphor threading through—is distinct. Diction stays character-bound with mining and acoustic imagery. No dialogue present. One slip: "She began her artificial pilgrimage that morning, though she would not have called it that" is mild head-tilt narrator commentary, but recovers quickly. Compression in the pilgrimage sequence (five stations sketched briskly) serves accumulative rhythm without obscuring focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences layer image, action, and thematic weight (e.g., "The lens caught afternoon light and threw a spectrum across the phonograph horns"). Rhythm varies effectively between reflective beats and the propulsive final ringing. Two minor issues: "powerfully gentle in its desperation" mixes tenor awkwardly (power vs. gentleness vs. desperation), and the phrase "golden shadows" recurs three times without functional shift, trending toward motif checklist. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and advances sense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—bell ringer as synesthete, carbide lens focusing sound, artificial pilgrimage through captured frequencies, post-blackout setting—feels specific and non-obvious. The mining/acoustic parallel (grandmother finding copper, Mira finding connection) is fresh. Risk: the accumulative-station structure without external conflict or secondary character. Limitation: the "texture of connection" concept, while developed through particulars, edges toward writing-prompt abstraction; the emotional truth (reaching without expectation) feels earned but the frame ("artificial pilgrimage," "stations of the cross") is slightly imposed rather than discovered through action.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira's choices drive all key turns: designing the pilgrimage route, using the lens at each station, interpreting the recordings, and returning to ring bells with new intent. Her decision to trust resonance without expecting response reconfigures her stance. Present setup to closure, causally active across multiple beats. The passive "listening" mode during stations slightly lowers agency texture, but her interpretive acts and final bell-ringing restore protagonist drive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The carbide lamp lens appears in the opening (placed on workbench), is used functionally in multiple station beats (focusing sound over her ear), throws spectrum in the climax paragraph, and hangs as talisman in the final image. Reweighted from grandmother's copper-finding tool to Mira's focus-and-attention instrument. Three distinct beats plus closure linkage with irreplaceability (no other object could carry the mining/illumination dual logic). Specific cost: it signals her inheritance and commitment without guaranteeing outcome.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "artificial pilgrimage" is named, designed (stations through recordings), and executed on the page. It shapes her tactics (methodical listening, lens use at each station) and the sequence builds pressure toward the realization. Setup by first third, middle development through five stations, payoff in the shift from passive listening to active bell-ringing. Swappability friction: the pilgrimage frame is declared rather than demanded by story logic; "a listening session" would function nearly identically with minor edits. Cost is more thematic than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Powerfully gentle" appears once in the mother's voice recording and does not constrain or enable any subsequent choice. Label-only mention without embodied demonstration or visible tradeoff. The attribute describes an external stimulus (the recording) rather than Mira's own trait. Does not reappear or shape closure. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Propel" appears literally when the lens "threw a spectrum across the phonograph horns" and the colors "propel themselves across ancient equipment," charging the climax paragraph. Metaphorically, Mira propels her signals (bell vibrations) outward in the final act. Setup mid-story, development in the climactic light moment, closure participation as the bell's voice "shattered into prismatic harmonics" cascading outward. Two beats with thematic weight, but swappable with "cast" or "send" in most uses without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Questioning assumptions" is signaled early ("Why had she assumed connection meant touching?") and mechanics matter: each station forces her to confront a prior belief (presence, understanding, transaction). The method shapes her listening tactics (lens focus, attention to what each recording teaches) and drives the arc from assumption to realization. Three explicit questions on the page tied to distinct stations, culminating in the shift to "willingness to send signals into darkness." Essential method, causally active across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds provides the pilgrimage route (captured frequencies as stations), supplies the critical tool environment (phonograph, oscilloscopes, glass tubes), and its "forgotten basement" status mirrors Mira's search for overlooked connection. The laboratory's collection enables her journey and the equipment's presence (phonograph horns catching spectrum) charges the climax. Setup immediately, development through station choices, closure linkage when she "climbed back to her bell tower" (laboratory/tower pairing). Strong causal pressure; the specific archive logic makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the power grid stabilizes" anchors opening and the "forty-one days" blackout motivates her search (she "heard something she couldn't name" in the silence). The timeframe primes her sensitivity to connection/disconnection but does not create a live clock or tighten tactics during the pilgrimage. Present in setup, informs motivation, but does not constrain middle choices or shape the ending urgency. Functional context, not structural necessity; swappable with any recent disruption.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of connection" is the explicit dominant stake, dramatized through her pilgrimage design, embodied in the weeping at station five, and tested by her willingness to ring without expecting response. Friction: she questions what connection requires (touching? understanding? transaction?) and confronts the cost of reaching without guarantee. Setup early ("connection had become the texture she sought most desperately"), development through five stations with embodied reactions, closure when she commits to resonance "trusting the resonance to find its way home." Desire and cost visible across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" recurs three times: opening (golden light through dust-caked windows casting shadows that "breathe with warmth"), climax (afternoon light throwing spectrum), and closure (golden shadows lengthening as she rings). Tone is elegiac, warm, and meditative, coherent through the accumulative pressure and modulating slightly (warm breath to propelled spectrum to lengthening twilight). The final image—stars emerging as she rings—charges the tone with quiet persistence. Recurrence with shift, closure participation, but borders on motif checklist without unique constraint on her choices.</comment>
