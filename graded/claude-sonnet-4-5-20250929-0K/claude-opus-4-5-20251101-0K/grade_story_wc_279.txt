<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's social perceptiveness is asserted but never dramatizes competing impulses under pressure. The old man appears late and serves primarily as a sounding board rather than forcing choices with visible cost. Interior texture leans heavily on stock mystical phrasing ("vast and patient watching back," "colors that no longer existed") without character-specific embodiment. The mandala-making demonstrates craft but the final stance—listening rather than fighting—feels declared rather than earned through contradictory on-page choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by ~100 words but "the unlearning" remains abstract until the mandala beat. The piece opts for an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and the mandala pattern promise reweighting, and the final image ("mandala breathe," chalk figures on walls) offers a Conceptual Repricing where silence becomes invitation. However, the cost is conceptual only—no visible forfeiture or path foreclosed on the page. The closure unit is present but the price remains oblique, limiting upward movement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The grotto's acoustic properties and flaking tiles create purposeful texture, and mist operates as atmospheric pressure throughout. The tile flake in Mira's pocket warms and hums, constraining the mandala's center and orienting the whispers—a micro-setting element that charges the final image. Spatial choreography (curved walls, flat stone, proximity to the mandala) remains clear. The setting participates in closure when the grotto "gathers" whispers around the pattern, meeting the 9+ gate criterion of choice-constraint or closure charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"to discover meaning in the mess"—is signaled early and remains coherent. The mandala construction deepens the hush motif and the old man's arrival introduces mild friction ("You shouldn't be making that"), but his resistance softens without visible trade-off. No on-page reversal narrows options; Mira's stance crystallizes through realization rather than a pressured choice that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful intensification suffices, yet the cost at closure is conceptual and not felt on the page, capping the band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—silence as space for authentic meaning—emerges from the mandala's spiral logic and the tile flake's hum rather than thesis statement. The closing image ("silence as invitation," whimsical chalk figures) reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the mandala's "spiral logic" and "colors that no longer existed" lean on prompt-adjacent abstractions ("emergent hush," "unlearning") rather than ground truth in verifiable particulars. The piece invites reflection but the final answer hovers near the conceptual middle, resisting full ambiguity or undeniable earned wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single third-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("read faces like open books," now "read the sand") but diction drifts into elevated register during peak beats: "lilac-soft," "spiral logic," "great forgetting that preceded a greater remembering." Dialogue feels purpose-driven and the old man's idiom distinguishes him from Mira's poetic interiority. Free indirect style is clean. Purposeful compression in the hush descriptions is taught early, but several lines ("tegrated into action and thought") edge toward abstraction without concrete anchoring, limiting upward movement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings avoid template runs. Figurative density is high ("breath held too long," "petrified snow," "gauze") but remains legible until the closure beat, where "spiral logic" and "lilac unease" verge on stock mystical phrasing without grounding. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; clarity holds. Filter-verb use is restrained. The mandala description ("spirals nesting within spirals, geometries that spoke") abstracts rather than concretizes the object's visual specifics, reducing information density at a key beat. Propulsion is steady but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The whispering-grotto acoustics and mandala as listening device offer a specific synthesis. However, "the unlearning" and "emergent hush" read as prompt-adjacent abstractions rather than fresh worldbuilding earned through particular social, physical, or sensory consequences. Emotional core—finding meaning through patient attention—is durable, but the conceptual frame (civilization's noise vs. authentic silence) follows a familiar binary without transformation through lived cost or non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking in structure (lyric accumulation, mist-soaked setting) is present but does not fundamentally challenge the premise or reader expectation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira constructs the mandala, places the tile flake at its center, and draws on the grotto walls at closure—three beats. Her craft enables the voice to emerge and reframes silence as invitation. However, her choices are exploratory rather than decision-under-pressure; the old man's objection is deflected conversationally, not through a turn that narrows options. Setup and closure participation are strong; middle development lacks causal friction. The character is present across beats but not indispensable to the story's pressure curve.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tile flake appears early (Mira catches it, hears her mother's voice), returns at the mandala's center where it warms and hums, and orients the whispers toward the pattern. Three beats with evolving function. It participates in closure by enabling the mandala's voice and charging the final image. However, the flake's mechanics—why it carries her mother's voice, why it hums—remain unexplained, and the choice to use it is intuitive rather than constrained by prior cost. Solid integration but falls short of indispensability due to thin causal grounding.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "emergent hush" frames the world state and motivates Mira's journey to the grotto. It appears in exposition and thematic reflection throughout, shaping the stakes (silence vs. noise, forgetting vs. remembering). At closure, the hush is reinterpreted as "invitation" rather than destruction. However, the concept remains largely thematic rather than constraining on-page tactics; Mira's mandala-making and the old man's arrival are not pressured by the hush's mechanics. Setup and payoff are present; middle development is weaker, placing the score in the 6.0–6.9 band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Socially perceptive" is asserted in narration ("she'd read faces like open books," "she perceived [the old man] was afraid") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The trait informs her understanding but does not force a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Setup is present; no middle or closure work. Label-only use trends low; the attribute is ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Interject" is Mira's spoken rationale for making the mandala ("Someone had to interject… The silence was getting too comfortable"). It signals her intent and recurs implicitly when she draws on the walls at closure. However, the action itself—constructing the mandala—is more pivotal than the verb "interject," which functions as thematic gloss rather than a distinct, irreplaceable tactic. The element shapes one turn (the mandala) and the ending, but could be swapped for "speak," "act," or "respond" with minor edits, capping the score in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The sand mandala is introduced early, constructed in a sustained beat with concrete detail (colored grains, concentric circles, indigo sand), and serves as the mechanism through which Mira "began to understand." The mandala centers the tile flake, orients the whispers, and participates directly in closure ("watched the mandala breathe"). Setup, development, and payoff are all present. The means is specific and irreplaceable; removing the mandala would break the story's logic. However, the mandala's function—how patterns translate into understanding—remains abstract, preventing a score above 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The whispering grotto provides acoustic properties that defy the spreading hush, motivating Mira's journey. The curved walls carry whispers that "oriented themselves toward the pattern," and the mist curls throughout, creating atmospheric pressure. Flaking tiles supply the key object (tile flake). The setting constrains choice (grotto as refuge from silence) and charges the final image (chalk figures on ancient tiles, whispers gathering). Setup, development, and payoff are strong; the grotto is essential to the story's logic and pressure, placing it firmly in the 7.0–8.4 band with no major frictions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"The unlearning" is introduced as the world state ("three months ago") and frames the stakes. However, it operates as backdrop rather than ticking clock; no on-page urgency narrows Mira's window or alters her tactics. The timeframe is present in setup and closure (the unlearning "continued outside") but does not tighten decisions in the middle. Setup and thematic payoff earn mid-band placement, but lack of pressure-driven development caps the score at 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to discover meaning in the mess" is stated early and dramatized through mandala construction and her exchange with the old man. The motivation drives her journey to the grotto and shapes her final stance ("listening had begun"). However, the desire is not visibly conflicted on the page—no cost paid, no competing want that creates friction. Setup and closure participation are strong; middle friction is weak. The motivation is essential but not charged by trade-offs, placing it in the 6.5–7.0 range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Lilac unease" appears twice: once in Mira's speech tag ("her voice lilac-soft, tinged with unease") and once in the mandala's voice description ("the lilac unease that had haunted her since the silence began"). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly from opening mist-dread to closing invitation. However, "lilac" as a tonal modifier is more decorative than functional; the unease itself drives the journey, but the hue does not constrain choices or charge the final image in a way that depends on "lilac" specifically. Setup and payoff present; swappability lowers the score to mid-5s.</comment>
