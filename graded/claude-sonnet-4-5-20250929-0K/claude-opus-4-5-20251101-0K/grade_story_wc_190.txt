<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eris demonstrates consistent interiority through her acoustic expertise and grief, with embodied emotion in the storm-glass dissolution and final hum. The seventeen-year backstory and Mira's death are efficiently woven into present action without stalling momentum. Internal contradiction surfaces when she seeks "something more difficult" than revenge, driving the choice to release the vial. Minor slip: the final shift to comfort feels slightly under-motivated given the sparse on-page struggle between impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through recurring acoustic imagery and the storm-glass pattern toward a final cadence shift when Eris releases the crystals and the terrace's silence transforms. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the new quiet "opens, like a door held wide" with conceptual cost legible in the vial's dissolution and Eris's deliberate intervention. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~100 words cleanly. The tightening is subtle but present: weeks of monitoring converge in tonight's helix pattern, compelling the release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prism terrace is vividly rendered with acoustic specificity—pockets of stillness, reflected light, faceted surfaces—that directly constrains Eris's choice of location and timing for the vial's release. The storm glass functions as micro-setting, its crystal helix pattern guiding her to the convergence point. Sensory hierarchy filters through her professional ear: cable thrums, train whistles, silence "pressing against her eardrums." The terrace's drift and geometry shape the final act, charging the closure image with environmental resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: transforming the terrace's silence into comfort for the bereaved, distinct from revenge. The escalation is textural: weeks of monitoring compress into tonight's unprecedented helix pattern, which prompts the vial's release—a deliberate, irreversible act that forecloses keeping Mira's atmospheric memory. Agency is clear in the decision to dissolve the crystals, and the cost (releasing her daughter's final captured moment) is felt. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though the single tightening is quiet rather than dramatic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through acoustic particulars: silence as receptive rather than reflective, comfort without speech. The storm-glass vial recurs with shifting weight—meteorological tool, memorial object, catalyst—and its dissolution at the convergence point charges the final image without stating a moral. The piece offers a resonant answer to "how does grief find rest" through Eris's method: teaching the terrace to hold sorrow gently. Subtext operates in her humming at the end, a small sound the world now knows "how to hold gently," reweighting all prior quiet.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited, filtering all perception through Eris's acoustic expertise and grief. Diction reflects her professional lexicon ("harmonic storms," "crystalline rot," "atmospheric memory") without slipping into exposition. Perceptual signature is distinct: she reads the world through sound, noticing cable frequencies and pressure-pattern shifts invisible to passengers. Prose rhythm modulates purposefully, accelerating at the vial's opening and settling into the final hum. No dialogue present; interiority remains concrete and embodied throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally, with longer contemplative sentences balanced by crisp action beats ("She opened the storm glass vial"). Minor overwriting clusters appear: "fluidly logical" recurs decoratively, and "the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo settled over the drifting prism terrace like dust made of light" stacks metaphors without clear payoff. One paraphrase loop: paragraphs 8–9 restate the terrace's acoustic properties. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; the helix-as-staircase image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustic architecture, grief ritual, and atmospheric memory feels specific rather than generic. Eris's professional expertise (noise monitoring, cable tension) grounds the fantastical setting, avoiding tourist-catalog description. The choice to dissolve the storm glass rather than preserve it as monument transforms the "teaching silence" premise into action with cost. Risk-taking in the quiet, lyric ending elevates but doesn't fully escape the "solitary artisan transforms environment through loss" template; the emotional territory, while handled with specificity, follows a recognizable arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eris's choices drive all key turns: deciding to carry the vial instead of passengers, selecting the central platform, opening the vial to release the crystals, and choosing to hum on the return crossing. Setup is immediate (paragraph 1), development spans her weeks of monitoring and tonight's convergence, and payoff anchors the closure unit. Her agency is unambiguous and causally linked to the terrace's transformation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The storm glass appears in at least four beats: held in transit (para 3), interpreted for the helix pattern (para 6), opened at the convergence (para 8), and secured empty as she departs (para 11). Its mechanics—crystals responding to atmospheric pressure, capturing Mira's final crossing—enable the method and charge the closure. Dissolution is irreversible, adding cost. Specific properties (the unprecedented helix) constrain timing and location.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"In transit" frames the premise (Eris as gondola operator, Mira caught mid-crossing, the terrace itself drifting) and recurs in the final paragraph ("in transit once more"). It shapes stakes: movement versus stillness, carrying versus arriving. The opening and closing transit bracket the central act of catalyzing change. Moderate band: the concept is woven throughout but doesn't create a distinct tactical constraint or redefine options at closure beyond thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Fluidly logical" is used twice: once describing storm-glass patterns (para 3) and once the dissolution's unfolding (para 9, "the action felt fluidly logical"). It characterizes Eris's interpretive method but doesn't constrain a choice with visible cost; she proceeds intuitively rather than through demonstrated logical trade-offs. Present and thematically consistent, but more decorative than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Catalyze" is signaled in para 7 ("The dissolution would catalyze something...a change in how the terrace held sound") and enacted in para 8–9 when the crystals dissolve and the silence transforms. The action is irreversible, specific to the storm-glass mechanics, and directly produces the story's central turn: the terrace learns to comfort. Removing this exact action would collapse the closure. High irreplaceability; the chemical/atmospheric metaphor is intrinsic to both Mira's profession and the method Eris creates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Monitoring noise levels is established early (para 2: "seventeen years monitoring noise levels," para 5: "monitoring noise levels at this crossing for weeks") and enables Eris to identify the precise convergence point and the unprecedented helix pattern that triggers tonight's action. It shapes her professional competence and the "searching" phase that precedes the climax. Present in setup and development, with closure consequence (the terrace now holds sound differently). Solid integration but the mechanics remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace supplies the acoustic architecture essential to the story's logic: faceted surfaces create "pockets of absolute stillness surrounded by corridors of whispered echoes," the central platform's geometry enables the convergence, and its slow drift through twilight provides the temporal/spatial stage. Eris selects this exact location because its physics will amplify the catalyzed change. The terrace is present in nearly every paragraph and its properties directly constrain Eris's tactics and charge the final image. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo" is poetic but functions more as atmospheric framing than a live constraint. The train whistle is mentioned twice (opening and para 7) and triggers the profound quiet, but no clock pressure or deadline tightens Eris's choices. The terrace drifts through "perpetual twilight," further softening temporal stakes. Present and tonally resonant, but swappable with another liminal time marker without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach silence how to comfort" is stated explicitly in para 4 and dramatized through the vial's release and its consequence: silence that "did not press or demand. It opened." Friction surfaces between preserving Mira's memory (keeping the vial) and transforming grief into collective comfort (releasing it). The choice costs Eris her last physical link to her daughter's final moment. Setup, development (weeks of searching), and payoff all center this desire, though the phrasing occasionally edges toward thematic statement rather than embodied want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone is cohesive and purposeful: elevated, elegiac, precise. Diction choices ("suspended," "auroral glow," "crystalline rot," "atmospheric memory") sustain a hushed, reverent register throughout. The tone modulates subtly under pressure—terser syntax at the vial's opening, softer cadence in the transformed silence—and charges the final image (Eris humming, the world holding sound "gently"). Consistent across all beats without flattening into static mood.</comment>
