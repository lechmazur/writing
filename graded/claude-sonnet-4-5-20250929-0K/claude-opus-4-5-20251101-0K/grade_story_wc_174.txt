<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is well-grounded in his shift from commercial calligraphy to subversive puppet shows, and his choices under pressure (performing the puppet show for Vera) reveal character through action. Vera's transformation from anger to tears shows embodied emotion, and the "uncommonly serene" trait constrains her opening stance. The final gesture—both adding marks in the dust—earns a small shift with visible cost (mutual vulnerability). Minor deduction: the internal conflict could be more contradictory in real time rather than sequenced neatly through dialogue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The inferred lens is Situational/Accumulative: the argument's aftermath creates a crystallized moment where both characters reweigh their stances through the puppet show and dust-writing. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the question mark beside the listening symbol reconfigures their opposition into collaborative inquiry with felt relational cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when Marcus performs the meta-puppet show, narrowing emotional distance and forcing Vera to confront her own methods.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The radar dome's acoustic properties ("amplified every sound into whispered echoes") and curved walls constrain the scene, turning it into an arena for intimacy and confrontation. The dust floor enables the closure gesture (calligraphy and question mark), directly charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency: "meteor hush," surf crash, settling structure. The setting is not ornamental; it shapes the tone and provides the material substrate for the ending's symbolic act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Marcus's storytelling methods are ethical manipulation or revelation—is signaled early and remains coherent. The puppet show constitutes a meaningful tightening: Marcus dramatizes their conflict, forcing Vera to experience his method from the inside, which narrows her opposition and opens a path to mutual understanding. The cost is relational (Vera's tears, "that's not fair") and forecloses the prior adversarial stance. One credible deepening under the Situational lens with visible emotional price scaled appropriately.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the puppet show's meta-commentary on truth-telling methods without overt moralizing. The final dust-writing image offers a non-literal answer to the central question: listening (Marcus's character) paired with inquiry (Vera's question mark) synthesizes their opposition without stating a thesis. Subtext operates in gesture and silence throughout. Minor slip: "half-lit epiphanies" is articulated by Marcus in dialogue, edging toward thematic echo, but the phrase is character-voiced rather than authorial summary, so the penalty is light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Marcus with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit: Vera's "That's not fair" (twice) reveals her resistance and capitulation in shorthand. Perceptual signature is consistent—Marcus notices the carved faces shifting in peripheral vision, the acoustics, the dust—all filtering through his artist's attention. Voice modulates appropriately from reflective opening to pressured performance to quiet closure. Minor deduction: some dialogue ("All storytelling is manipulation") risks thesis-speak, though it remains in-character for a self-aware artist.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or conflict. Opening and closing images are strong. Minor deductions: "the thing that had driven them apart tonight and kept pulling them back together" is slightly abstract scaffolding that could be cut; "though she would later deny it" is a brief future-tense intrusion that weakens immediacy. The phrase "meteor hush" recurs three times, verging on over-reliance, but each use recontextualizes the image, so it reads purposeful rather than looped.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The meta-puppet-show—an artist performing his own relationship conflict as a puppet show for his journalist partner—offers a fresh synthesis of the ethical-storytelling premise. The decommissioned Cold War radar dome as intimate arena is non-obvious and purposeful. The dust calligraphy paired with a question mark avoids tidy resolution while remaining specific. Minor cap: the "artist vs. journalist" pairing and the "truth vs. beauty" theme are familiar; transformation comes through the puppet-show recursion and the charged setting, but the emotional arc itself (argument → performance → mutual understanding) follows a recognizable template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus (urbane calligrapher) is present throughout and makes two key choices: performing the puppet show and writing the listening character in the dust. Both choices alter Vera's stance and shape the closure. Early signal is strong (introduced in the title beat). Causal pressure: the performance narrows emotional distance. Closure linkage: his dust calligraphy anchors the final image. Swappability is low—his specific background as calligrapher-turned-puppeteer is load-bearing for the closure gesture. Deduction: his urbane past is told rather than shown; we see only the puppeteer in action, so the "calligrapher" element feels partly ornamental until the dust-writing payoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story stick is handled in the opening beat (Marcus carries it), mentioned again when he and Vera discuss inherited craft, and picked up by Vera mid-scene ("She took the story stick from his lap, examining the carved faces"). Three touches across beats, but none constrain a choice or alter tactics. It does not return in the closure image. The stick is present and thematically resonant (inheritance of subversive storytelling) but remains functionally replaceable—any symbol of craft continuity could serve the same role. No visible cost or causal pressure tied to the stick itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Half-lit epiphanies" is articulated by Marcus in dialogue ("The full light blinds. Complete darkness teaches nothing. But this space between...") and operationalized through the puppet show's indirect revelation and the dome's literal half-light. The concept shapes stakes: Marcus's entire method depends on partial illumination to slip past defenses. It constrains the closure image—both characters work in dim light, writing marks that are incomplete yet understood. Cost: Marcus admits his method is manipulation, Vera admits her despair-spreading; both pay relational vulnerability. Deduction: the phrase is spoken on the page, edging toward thematic echo, but it remains character-voiced and motivates the ending, so penalty is modest.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene" describes Vera at the opening ("uncommonly serene now, her anger spent") and constrains the scene's emotional baseline: the argument has already crested, creating space for dialogue rather than escalation. The trait enables Marcus's choice to perform rather than defend. Visible tradeoff: Vera's serenity is earned by spent anger, a cost already paid off-page but legible in her opening line ("I shouldn't have said you were corrupting people"). The trait is present in the setup and shapes one key beat (the decision to engage rather than flee), but does not return or evolve. Swappability: moderate—"calm" or "exhausted" could function similarly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "reverse" action appears twice: thematically in Marcus's dialogue ("each had to reverse their certainties, to write in the other's language") and enactively in the closure (Vera adds her question mark beside Marcus's calligraphy—a journalist's symbol beside an artist's). The reversal redefines their opposition into collaboration. Causal pressure: the puppet show's reversal forces Vera to cry and reconsider. Closure linkage: the dust marks are a literal reversal of their prior stances. Cost: mutual vulnerability. Deduction: the thematic articulation ("reverse their certainties") is slightly on-the-nose, though it remains character-voiced. The enacted reversal at the end is earned and specific.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Marcus's method ("subversive puppet shows in seedy bars") is signaled early (backstory in paragraph ~5–7) and demonstrated on-page when he performs for Vera. The method shapes the central conflict: Vera challenges its ethics, Marcus defends and enacts it. Mechanics matter: the puppets' indirection is the story's hinge. Closure participation: the dust-writing is a quieter cousin of the puppet method—symbolic performance that slips under rational defenses. Deduction: the "seedy bars" setting is told in backstory but never visited on-page; we see the method only in the dome, so the bar context feels ornamental. Strong setup and middle development; closure linkage is thematic rather than mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is present from the opening and constrains multiple choices: its acoustic amplification heightens intimacy ("whispered echoes"), its curved walls provide the stage for puppet-show shadows, and its dust floor supplies the material for the closure gesture. The setting is not postcard; it pressures the scene by isolating the characters and turning their conflict into a charged ritual space. Early signal, middle development (shadows on curved walls), and closure participation (dust calligraphy). Specificity: the dome's Cold War history and satellite-tracking past subtly echo the story's theme of signal and reception. High integration with minimal swappability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"In the hush left behind by a heated argument" frames the entire scene temporally and emotionally. The timeframe is present from the opening ("exactly where he had left her twenty minutes ago, when their argument had crested") and governs tone throughout. The spent-argument window enables dialogue rather than shouting, constraining tactics. The "meteor hush" recurs three times, modulating from post-argument stillness to final understanding. Cost: the hush is a caesura with relational vulnerability. Deduction: no live ticking clock tightens decisions; the timeframe is more atmospheric container than active constraint. Strong setup and tone-shaping; modest causal pressure on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation ("to explore ethical storytelling") is articulated in dialogue ("This was his motivation stripped bare") and dramatized through the puppet show and his defense of subversive methods. The desire is conflicted: he admits "You weren't entirely wrong" and performs a meta-show that exposes his own complicity. Friction between want (ethical revelation) and cost (manipulating even Vera) drives the scene. Closure: his dust calligraphy is a quieter, more collaborative method—partial resolution. Deduction: the phrase "motivation stripped bare" is slightly authorial; the motivation is otherwise well-dramatized through choice and argument. Two-gate participation (setup, middle conflict); closure linkage is thematic synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is introduced early ("the silence held the quality of meteor hush") and recurs at the closure ("smiled in the meteor hush, finally understanding"). The tone is coherent: quiet, charged, post-impact stillness that modulates from wary calm to collaborative understanding. The hush constrains the scene's register—no shouting, only murmured dialogue and symbolic gesture. Closure linkage is strong: the final "meteor hush" reweights the opening stillness with mutual recognition. Cost: the hush is both caesura and charged poise. The tone shapes pressure and charges the final image without ever breaking into static mood. High specificity and irreplaceability; the metaphor is sustained and earns its recurrence.</comment>
