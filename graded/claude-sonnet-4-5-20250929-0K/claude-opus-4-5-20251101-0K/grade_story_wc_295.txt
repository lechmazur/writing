<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular (dream chronicler processing Marcus's cryptic telegram through her professional lens). Her choices show genuine progression from isolating her visions as "phantoms" to committing to publication and shared burden. However, the final shift feels slightly under-motivated—the decision to "publish her findings" and "share the burden" emerges more from thematic necessity than from dramatized internal conflict. The embodied emotion is strong in early beats (pressing the telegram, breath fogging) but thins toward the resolution where insight arrives through summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through layered images (telegram, stars, temple inscriptions) that converge in translation. Orientation anchors cleanly by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (decision to publish, share burden) with conceptual cost visible on the page (Marcus's failure reweighted as her new responsibility). However, the cost feels more asserted than dramatized—"lighter in sharing" tells rather than shows the trade-off. The "gradual lightening at the horizon" passage weakens propulsion by stating the closure effect before delivering it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The observatory setting supplies concrete constraints: the dome's rotation, the eyepiece, the cold air fogging breath, the tracking mechanism. The telescope and its adjustments anchor Mira's investigation and recur across beats with functional specificity. The telegram with pressed daylily acts as micro-setting, handled multiple times and charging the final image when pressed into the journal. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting drives the central action (charting stellar patterns) and charges the ending when Mira steps into "nascent light" with her tools gathered—environment constrains and enables her choices at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the inscriptions to understand Marcus's death and the family burden—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stellar patterns align with the temple photos, narrowing Mira's options to either publish or carry the secret alone. However, the escalation is more intellectual discovery than pressure-driven choice; coincidence (Marcus left photos, the stars happen to match) solves rather than complicates. The final decision to publish feels thematically inevitable but lacks on-page friction or visible trade-off that would demonstrate agency under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (shared burdens, isolation as destroyer) emerges organically from the translated inscription and Mira's contrast with Marcus's solitary obsession. The daylily telegram and variable stars function as motifs that accumulate meaning across beats and charge the closure when Mira gathers her papers. The ending offers a resonant answer ("distributed across time and space, light enough to bear") without overt moralizing. However, "What breaks one may bend many" risks platitude, and the final paragraph's "midnight solace of finally understanding" edges toward thematic echo. The piece invites reflection through specific images rather than abstraction, earning its resonance despite minor slips.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: "daylily-pressed telegram," "the mathematics of suffering," "midnight solace" all feel voice-consistent. Diction remains controlled and purposeful throughout, with vocabulary apt for a chronicler-astronomer. However, some passages drift into elevated register that feels slightly external to Mira's present pressure: "nascent light," "tentative songs against the retreating darkness." The penultimate paragraph ("When understanding dawns...") shifts into commentary mode rather than staying inside Mira's perception. No dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance is mostly clean, with minor slips toward narrator intrusion in the philosophical passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high, with most sentences advancing situation or interiority. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and the opening/closing lines anchor and resolve effectively. However, several passages loop or paraphrase: "She had thought they were mere phantoms...Marcus had known otherwise" is stated then restated in the next paragraph; "the message was about shared burdens" is explained twice in successive sentences. The metaphor "scattered ink drops" contradicts the astronomical context. Minor filter-verb stacks ("began to write," "felt it now") dull immediacy in peak beats. The "gradual lightening at the horizon" passage is overwritten for the moment's needs, slowing propulsion just before closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of lucid dreaming, astronomy, and ancestral inscriptions is specific and non-obvious, with the variable-star correspondence earning freshness through careful setup. The closing image (telegram pressed in journal, stepping into light) feels inevitable in hindsight. However, the core emotional arc—sibling's death driving protagonist to decode secret and choose connection over isolation—follows a familiar template. The "shared burdens" wisdom risks platitude despite being filtered through stellar mechanics. The piece transforms its premise through specificity of detail (Delta Cephei's four-day cycle, daylily pressed between pages) but doesn't fully escape the derivative emotional calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's profession (lucid dream chronicler) is signaled early and shapes her final choice to "heal with words" and merge dream journals with astronomical findings. However, the chronicler trait is more backdrop than driver—her key actions (charting stars, translating inscriptions) don't require dream-work specificity. The attribute enables the ending (publication decision) but doesn't constrain earlier beats with visible cost. Present in setup and payoff; functional development in middle is thin.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The telegram appears in four distinct beats: unfolded on desk (setup), picked up mid-observation, pressed thumb against daylily (reflection), and pressed into journal at closure. It carries Marcus's cryptic message and the daylily motif charges across uses. The final reprise reweights it as a seed of connection rather than mystery. The object enables key turns (decoding attempt) and shapes the ending image. Strong integration across arc with clear closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Shared burdens is signaled through Marcus's telegram ("Share the burden, sister"), translated inscription ("What breaks one may bend many"), and Mira's closing decision to publish rather than carry secrets alone. The concept shapes the dominant stake and final choice with felt cost (publishing vulnerability vs. protective isolation). However, it functions more as thematic payload than tactical constraint—no middle beat shows Mira testing or wrestling with sharing before the ending commits her. Setup and payoff strong; middle development thin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Heals with words" is introduced late (final third: "This was her gift...to heal with words") and labeled rather than demonstrated through prior constraint. The trait enables the publication decision but arrives as explanation for an action the story has already committed to, rather than shaping earlier tactics. No visible cost tied to this specific attribute—Mira's writing is described as transformative but never tested or limited on the page. Ornamental use; late arrival caps potential.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Witness" appears explicitly in "she would witness what he could not complete" and structures the night's observation work (charting luminosity, cross-referencing photos). The action drives the translation discovery and justifies the publication choice (bearing witness publicly vs. privately). However, "witness" as a verb is somewhat generic—observing/recording/charting would be functionally identical. Present across beats with causal weight, but modest irreplaceability prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Variable stars (Cepheus, Delta Cephei) are signaled in the opening (telescope alignment), supply the method for decoding (luminosity variations mapped to temple inscriptions), and shape multiple beats (adjusting tracking, charting fluctuations, cross-referencing). The four-day cycle detail and "heartbeat across light-years" metaphor make the method specific and irreplaceable. Marcus's belief that "stellar patterns corresponded to temple inscriptions" is explained and then proven through Mira's work. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage (the stars' message "remained inscribed").</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory supplies concrete resources (telescope, dome rotation, eyepiece, tracking mechanism) that enable the decoding work and constrain Mira's actions (cold air, midnight hours). The setting recurs across beats with functional specificity and charges the ending when she "closed the telescope" and stepped outside. Spatial choreography is clean and the environment shapes both tactics (how she decodes) and the final image (transition from dome to nascent light). Essential across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"When understanding dawns" structures the timeframe explicitly and the story tracks night-to-morning progression (midnight observation, "hours passed," "first gray fingers of morning," birds' songs). However, the clock functions more as backdrop than pressure—no urgent deadline tightens decisions. The dawn arrival coincides with insight ("gradual lightening at the horizon of consciousness") but feels symbolic rather than causal. Present across arc; shapes tone and closure metaphor but doesn't constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The desire to decode temple inscriptions is dramatized early (Marcus's obsession, glyphs haunting Mira's dreams, telegram's "Find them through the variable stars"), drives every middle beat (charting stars, cross-referencing photos), and pays off in the translation discovery. Friction emerges between Mira's prior dismissal ("phantoms of an overactive mind") and her growing commitment, with Marcus's death supplying emotional cost. The motivation shapes stakes, tactics, and closure choice (publish the decoded wisdom). Strong causal integration with visible cost throughout.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Midnight solace is evoked through controlled tone: "the dome's cold embrace," "breath fogged," "night's work complete," and the closing phrase "midnight solace of finally understanding." The tone modulates purposefully from grief (Marcus's death) through determination (observation work) to tentative peace (stepping into nascent light). It charges the final image when solace arrives as earned resolution. However, the tone is somewhat one-note contemplative throughout—modest emotional range despite pressure. Coherent and closure-linked but lacks dynamic modulation under stress.</comment>
