<comment>Miriam's motivation is clear—paleontologist seeking ancient echoes—and her choice to release them is earned by thirty years of drawing incomplete fossils. The time-borrowing mechanic provides embodied cost (warming pendant, exhaustion, traded tomorrows), though the final seated moment feels more resolved than the renunciation warrants. Interior contradiction is present (belief/disbelief shift, yearning for completion vs. awareness of personal cost) but the peak choice lacks visible struggle; she dissolves the cage without hesitation. Grandmother's voice completing its sentence provides emotional payoff, but Miriam's own change reads more as confirmation than transformation with foreclosed paths.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images of incompleteness (fossils, interrupted melodies, trapped echoes) and the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Miriam hears the completed echo and draws a completed cadence, reweighting her life's work from cataloging death to witnessing restoration. Cost is legible: traded future time, exhaustion, pendant cooling. Orientation anchors (canal, towers, Aldros sleeping) arrive early. One meaningful deepening occurs when Miriam understands echoes are imprisoned, not born, which reframes her quest and leads directly to the cage-opening action. The because/therefore chain is clean within the accumulative frame, though the pendant's mechanics (how it sculpts time) remain abstract.</comment>

<comment>Canal system, obsidian towers, courtyard suspended above city, and Aldros as mountain range provide vivid spatial anchors. Upward-spiraling water and altered sound/light during the giant's nap constrain Miriam's window of opportunity and create sensory distinction. The crystallized-sound cage is a micro-setting object that directly enables the climactic choice. Sensory hierarchy reflects Miriam's illustrator's eye (light bending, acoustic chambers, melody's incompleteness pulling at her chest). The pendant warming against her sternum functions as body-setting that tracks her time-borrowing and charges the final cooling moment.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake signaled early: find the place where echoes are born to address a lifetime of drawing incompleteness. One meaningful tightening: discovering echoes are imprisoned, not born, which narrows her action to release rather than witness. The cage-dissolving choice is driven by Miriam's agency (borrowed time, touch), though it unfolds without visible resistance or complication. Cost is legible on the page: exhaustion, cooled pendant, unknown remainder of life. The interrupted-cadence realization deepens understanding but doesn't force a tactical shift or moral calculus; Miriam acts immediately upon comprehension without weighing alternate paths.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of incompleteness emerges organically from fossils, interrupted melodies, and trapped echoes without thesis statements. The infinity symbol and "time is a loop" operate as motifs that constrain (borrowing limits) and charge the closure (completed echo returning). Miriam's life work reweights from recording extinction to enabling completion, a conceptual repricing that arises from specific images rather than abstraction. The final drawing of "a completed cadence, rising like breath toward home" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Grandmother's voice completes its sentence in the final third, landing the thematic loop with felt cost (Miriam's traded time) rather than convenient epiphany.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited holds throughout with stable psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is character-specific: illustrator's eye notices light bending, feathered impressions, spiraling forms. Diction remains consistent ("sculpt it like clay," "acoustic chambers," "crystallized sound") with occasional elevation ("truncated notes," "cadence") that fits her profession. The pendant-warming anchors elided time-borrowing without filter-verb stacks. Free indirect style is clean ("She believed her now"). Brief reflection on grandmother and fossils anchors in present sensory cues (pendant heat, melody pull) without flattening momentum. Voice modulates appropriately from wonder to exhaustion.</comment>

<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Information density is high—most lines advance character understanding or world detail. Two minor paraphrase touches: "Not breaking but completing, becoming the silence they had always been meant to become" restates the dissolution concept; "seeking their origins" echoes "return to its source" from two paragraphs prior. Figurative language is controlled and voice-appropriate ("silver threads stitched through the sky," "wet clay," "trapped birds"). Opening line anchors stakes and voice; final line recharges the cadence motif with image rather than summary. No scaffold or pronoun drift. One weak nominalization: "a yearning she had never named" could be sharper, but the phrase serves character hesitation.</comment>

<comment>The time-borrowing mechanic via infinity pendant offers a specific synthesis of constraint and agency; the giant's nap as ticking clock is fresh world-building. Interrupted cadence as both acoustics and emotional incompleteness integrates concept with character motivation. The cage of crystallized sound holding unborn echoes is a vivid, non-obvious image. Miriam's profession (illustrator of extinct creatures) ties thematically to her quest without feeling arranged. The story commits fully to its lyric-accumulative premise and avoids hedging. Risk: blending speculative elements (time-sculpting, giant, floating canals, sound-cage) with quiet interiority succeeds without obscuring clarity, elevating within the 7-band (+0.3 adjustment).</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Natural history illustrator frames Miriam's perspective (drawing fossils for thirty years) and her recognition that extinct species are interrupted cadences. The profession shapes what she notices (feathered impressions, spiraling shells, illustrator's eye aching at bent light) and provides thematic resonance at closure when she draws "the shape of a completed cadence." It does not drive a key tactical choice during the quest itself; observation informs understanding but the cage-opening decision stems from time-borrowing ability, not illustration skill. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure drawing; two gates plus lyric reprise justify mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Infinity symbol pendant introduced early (grandmother's deathbed gift, "not decoration but instruction"). Handled physically across multiple beats: pressed against sternum, warming with each time-borrow, heating as she approaches the cage, burning during the release action, cooling afterward to signal exhaustion. The pendant enables the core mechanic (time-sculpting) and its temperature state tracks cost throughout. Returns with reweighted meaning at closure: cooled pendant signals depleted future, contrasting earlier warmth. Drives two major beats (time-borrowing to navigate canals, time-sculpting to dissolve cage) and participates in ending's cost legibility. High irreplaceability: the infinity loop ties to grandmother's "time is a loop" instruction and frames the thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Interrupted cadence is the story's conceptual spine. Introduced early via the melody that "stopped, like a sentence without its final word," the incompleteness pulls at Miriam's chest and clarifies her life's work: "every extinct species... were all interrupted cadences, songs that stopped before their ending." The concept directly shapes stakes—finding where echoes are born becomes understanding why they're incomplete—and alters tactics: discovering they're imprisoned (interrupted mid-flight) rather than born changes her goal from witness to liberator. Appears in or shapes the ending when Miriam draws "the shape of a completed cadence" and grandmother's voice finishes its sentence. Reweights prior material (thirty years of fossil drawings) with undeniable thematic and emotional cost. Indispensable: remove the interrupted-cadence frame and the story's logic collapses.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Sculpts time itself: signaled early ("those who understand this can sculpt it like clay"), demonstrated in at least two beats (pulling hours forward to navigate canals, slowing/stretching time to dissolve cage bars). The ability enables Miriam's approach and the climactic release, creating visible cost (warming pendant, exhaustion, traded future). However, the mechanics remain abstract—how time becomes "malleable in her hands" or "wet clay" is asserted rather than shown through specific constraints or tradeoffs. The trait could be replaced with a more concrete magical ability (e.g., "unweaves sound") without major structural loss, capping score below 7.0. Present in setup, middle, and ending; two beats plus closure participation justify mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Uncage: the story's fulcrum action. Setup: Miriam seeks the place "where echoes are born"; midpoint realization reframes the quest—echoes are imprisoned, not born. The cage of crystallized sound holding trapped echoes is introduced in the final third but prepared by accumulated incompleteness images. Uncaging (dissolving bars, releasing echoes) is the decisive action that pays off thirty years of drawing extinct songs and completes the interrupted cadences. The action drives the closure: echoes spiral upward, Aldros smiles, grandmother's voice finishes, Miriam draws the completed cadence. Irreplaceable: any other action (e.g., listening, harmonizing, amplifying) would not resolve the imprisonment or thematic incompleteness. Cost is visible (exhaustion, depleted time). Causal pressure high; indispensable to closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Borrowing time: method signaled early in dream revelation ("pulling hours forward like thread from a spool") and dramatized across beats. Miriam borrows "perhaps a month's worth already" to navigate canals, then borrows again to "sculpt the seconds around her like wet clay" and dissolve the cage. The pendant heating tracks each use, providing embodied cost. The method shapes her approach (she can act during the giant's nap by extending her window) and the ending (cooled pendant, unknown remaining life). Mechanics are somewhat abstract (how borrowing works vs. stealing, what "tomorrow" means in a time-loop cosmology) but the cost and tactical use are clear. Present in three beats (prior uses, canal navigation, cage dissolution) and directly enables closure action, justifying low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Rooftop canal system weaving between towers: Miriam balances on narrow stone edges, follows upward-spiraling water, navigates between obsidian towers to reach the suspended courtyard. The canals provide a vertical maze that requires time-borrowed navigation and creates atmospheric pressure (narrow edges, sky-high danger). The setting supplies the acoustic chambers where echoes are trapped and frames the fantastical world (giant as mountains, gravity-defying water). However, the canals do not constrain a key choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome; they function as traversable space rather than obstacle. Present in setup and middle; shapes atmosphere and provides access but does not pressure the climactic decision (cage-opening). Mid-6s for atmospheric integration and access-framing without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Across a giant's nap (three days exactly): timeframe is signaled early, creates world-rule pressure (sound and light behave differently), and frames Miriam's window of opportunity. Aldros sleeping is mentioned at opening, middle ("Above the city, Aldros shifted in his sleep, and Miriam thought she saw him smile"), but the three-day clock is not tracked or tightened. No sense of hours passing, urgency mounting, or the nap ending. The timeframe provides atmospheric constraint (world holding its breath) and gentle closure participation (Aldros smiles) but does not drive tactical choices or escalate pressure. Present in two beats (setup, closure smile) but static rather than dynamic. Lyric reprise (opening mention → closure smile) elevates slightly, but missing tightening caps score at upper-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>To find the place where echoes are born: motivation introduced early ("She needed to find that place") and grounded in thirty years drawing fossils of extinct creatures. The yearning is embodied ("incompleteness pulled at something deep in her chest") and drives her canal navigation. Midpoint realization reframes the goal: echoes aren't born but imprisoned, shifting her desire from witness to liberator. Friction between want (find/understand echoes) and cost (borrowed time, exhaustion, unknown future) is clear. The motivation directly shapes the ending: releasing echoes completes her quest and reweights her life's work. Present in setup, middle realization, and closure; drives two beats (navigation, cage decision) with visible cost. High integration justifies mid-7s.</comment>
