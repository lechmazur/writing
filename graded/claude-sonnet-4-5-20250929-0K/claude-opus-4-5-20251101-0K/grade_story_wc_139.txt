<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's core contradiction—honest child of a con artist seeking to understand fair exchange—drives her choices cleanly. Her interiority stays concrete ("the mathematics of a fair trade that never quite balanced") and her final choice to retrieve the ink pot is earned by the scene's pressure. Mr. Chen's "waiting actively" is less embodied; his shift feels declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The characterization is strong but stops short of 8+ because the secondary character's arc is told more than shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative elements. Orientation is clean (Maya, funeral home, present day established by ~80 words). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maya accepts that "fair trades don't balance. They transform," taking the ink pot with visible cost (Mr. Chen gives up his grandfather's artifact, her father gets something real, Maya finds "her own mathematics"). One meaningful tightening occurs when Mr. Chen places the pot in her hands after she reframes the exchange. Cost is legible on the page in the final image and Mr. Chen's "we're even" carries weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room is vividly rendered (formaldehyde, chemical perfume, steel counter, fluorescent light) and pressures the conversation through its association with death and preservation. The ink pot's physical presence (clouded glass, dark residue) charges the final exchange. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting does not constrain a tactical choice during the scene, which holds it below 8.0, but it charges the thematic resonance of the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Maya seeks to understand if debts can be settled and fair trades exist. The pressure tightens when Mr. Chen reveals he's been "waiting for Marcus to come himself" and Maya reframes her father's request as genuine need. Her agency is clear ("He asked. I chose") and the final exchange forecloses reconciliation through theft, accepting transformation instead. One meaningful deepening occurs; the cost is visible (Mr. Chen gives away his only piece of home). Lacks a second reversal or complication that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the ink pot's journey: debts as transformation rather than zero-sum balance. The final image—Maya holding the pot in streetlight—offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a moral. "Fair trades don't balance. They transform" risks abstraction but is earned by the specific exchange and Mr. Chen's "we're even." The piece resists tidy resolution (her father will die, Mr. Chen has lost something irreplaceable) while finding a hard-won equilibrium. Subtext operates cleanly in Mr. Chen's waiting and Maya's distinction between being sent and choosing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Maya with a distinct perceptual signature ("the mathematics of a fair trade," "invisible wounds"). Dialogue feels natural and advances stakes; Mr. Chen's lines carry subtext ("You're not lying" / "I never lie" exchange crystallizes her rebellion). Diction remains consistent with Maya's analytical lens. Minor slip: "deathly vitality of the recently departed before decay set in" reads slightly elevated for the moment's pressure, but the phrase serves the theme and doesn't break voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean with varied rhythm and high information density. Opening anchors stakes and voice efficiently. The ink pot's description does double duty (physical object and thematic weight). Two minor issues: "that particular expression she had seen on immigration lawyers, on border agents" is a small list that could be tighter, and "liquefies rigid thinking" in the penultimate section reads slightly abstract/prompt-adjacent. No loops or scaffold; clarity and propulsion are strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The con-artist's-honest-daughter premise is familiar but freshened through the funeral-home setting and the specific moral calculus (asylum papers vs. stolen heirloom). The liquefaction metaphor feels somewhat imposed rather than inevitable. The final reframing ("fair trades don't balance, they transform") is earned in hindsight but doesn't surprise. Solid synthesis of elements into a coherent whole without reaching exceptional originality.</comment>
