<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—welding the door shut, building the transmitter, broadcasting the counter-frequency. Her internal contradiction between desperation and cautious hope drives the peak choice to transmit, though her competence could have been balanced with more visible struggle or cost during the building phase. The final stance (vigilance, scanning for the next battle) earns the closure through prior causality. Minor: the emotional progression from isolation to triumph reads slightly too smooth; more visceral doubt or micro-hesitation during the broadcast would deepen the embodied tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (basement, Mira, charts, signal). The causal chain is clean: signal discovery → isolation of pattern → faculty division → counter-transmission → signal decay. The closure lands on-page with visible cost (the war continues, she must keep fighting) and the Causal lens holds throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the door pounds and the clock runs down, narrowing her window. The cost at closure is conceptual (endless vigilance) rather than visceral loss, which slightly mutes the final image's charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The basement setting (burnt coffee, old electronics, grimy window) is vivid and purposeful, grounding Mira's isolation. The transmitter and charts function as micro-setting elements that constrain and enable her choices. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her astrophysics lens. The quad procession visible through the window effectively stages external pressure without requiring a scene change. However, spatial choreography of the transmitter setup and the exact mechanics of welding the door remain slightly abstract; one more concrete anchor (e.g., specific tool, heat, sparks) would ground the action further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—stopping the tricksters' manipulation before the station is demolished—is signaled early and tightens cleanly with the midnight deadline. The reversal when the signal "stutters" and the procession falters demonstrates protagonist agency; Mira's broadcast directly causes the shift. The cost is conceptual (she must remain vigilant, the tricksters will return) and visible on the page in her final scanning action. The escalation from isolation to transmission to signal decay follows a clear because/therefore chain. Minor: the opponents (Dean Morrison, the tricksters) remain largely off-stage abstractions; one on-page confrontation or adaptation by the tricksters during her broadcast would sharpen the pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars: manipulation versus agency, division as a cultivated crop, the loneliness of fighting unseen wars. The final image (Mira scanning for the next frequency, "a war nobody else knew was being fought") reweights the victory as provisional and isolating without stating a moral. The counter-frequency strategy (uncertainty vs. certainty, curiosity vs. righteousness) operates through concrete action rather than abstract philosophizing. The line "the silence that followed was the most human sound" neatly inverts the subsonic threat. No thematic echo or sermon mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with close distance; Mira's perceptual signature (astrophysics lexicon, chart annotations in crimson, subsonic hum "in her teeth, her bones, the liquid of her eyes") is distinct and consistent. Dialogue is minimal and functional (Morrison's panic, the chanting). Register remains controlled, though phrases like "cosmic entities that fed on chaos and division" and "a society tearing itself apart" drift slightly toward exposition. The psychic distance tightens effectively during the broadcast ("The tricksters knew. They were paying attention now"). Voice modulates with intensity without artifice. Minor: a few filter verbs ("she felt," "she heard") could be cut for immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, conflict, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence openings are diverse. The opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, two adjacent lines in the second paragraph ("They were tricksters, cosmic entities..." and "They were using the university's own transmitter...") repeat the structure "They were [noun phrase]" without added pressure, creating a minor paraphrase loop. The phrase "a sound that wasn't sound" borders on stock mysticism. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are strong, with strategic telling that compresses backstory efficiently. Zero major scaffold or loop artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cosmic-trickster premise is a recognizable trope (malevolent entities, campus cult, lone truth-seeker), but the execution transforms it through specific details: subsonic frequencies embedded in radio astronomy, the gravity lens relay via Proxima Centauri, the counter-frequency modulation strategy. Mira's role as celestial signal interpreter rather than generic scientist adds particularity. The ending resists tidy resolution (the tricksters will return) and avoids heroic triumph, which feels earned. However, the broad arc (lone expert defeats unseen manipulators via technical ingenuity while authorities pound on the door) follows a familiar template, and the emotional calculus (isolation, vigilance, bittersweet victory) is well-trodden. The transformation is solid but not startling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's role as celestial signal interpreter shapes every beat: she decodes the signal, identifies the tricksters' method, builds the counter-transmitter, and broadcasts the dissonance. Her specific expertise (astrophysics, stellar drift mapping, subsonic frequency isolation) is indispensable to the plot. The character creates the key turn (the counter-frequency broadcast) and her final choice (scanning for the next frequency) closes the story. Removing this exact role would break the logic and stakes entirely.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The astronomical charts appear in the opening beat (spread across the console, marked with crimson annotations) and return when Mira traces the signal's origin through three relay systems and a gravity lens. They are consulted again during the broadcast ("The astronomical charts fluttered in the sudden electromagnetic field") and in the final beat ("She pulled out fresh astronomical charts and began scanning for the next frequency"). The charts constrain her method (she uses them to learn the signal's grammar) and charge the closure (scanning again signals the ongoing war). However, their specific properties (concentric circles, declination lines) are mentioned but not causally leveraged; any reference material could serve a similar function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Power plays are present in the faculty division (Aldridge's cult vs. Morrison's board), the tricksters' manipulation, and Mira's counter-move. The concept shapes the dominant stake (who controls the community's beliefs and actions) and Mira's tactic (using the same subsonic method to disrupt the tricksters' control). However, the power dynamics remain largely abstract and off-stage; the procession and board vote are reported rather than dramatized. One on-page confrontation or negotiation would ground the concept in specific choices and visible costs.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" is explicitly labeled ("Her plan was cautiously hopeful at best") and embodied in her actions: she builds the transmitter "on theoretical physics and desperation in equal measure," she knows the tricksters will return ("patient as starlight"), and she commits to an ongoing vigil rather than claiming victory. The trait constrains her final stance (vigilance, not celebration) and charges the closure with realistic limits. However, the label is stated rather than shown through contradictory impulses in the broadcast beat; we see the caution in the aftermath but not tested as a live tension during the key choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira's interference via counter-frequency broadcast is the story's climax and the direct cause of the signal's decay and the procession's faltering. The action is prepared across multiple beats (decoding the signal's grammar, building the transmitter, powering it up) and executed on-page ("Mira began broadcasting her counter-frequency, modulating it through the patterns she'd decoded"). The specific method (introducing dissonance, transmitting uncertainty instead of fear) is irreplaceable and tied to her expertise. The action redefines options for the community and the tricksters, and its consequences (spoiled harvest, ongoing war) shape the closure. Swapping this action would require rebuilding the entire causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies are introduced early ("a subsonic frequency embedded beneath the normal radio waves"), their mechanism is explained (bypassing conscious perception to embed in emotional centers), and Mira's counter-strategy depends on using "those same frequencies against them." The method shapes her transmitter design and the broadcast's effect (stuttering the tricksters' mathematical precision). However, the subsonic mechanics are told rather than shown; we never perceive the frequencies through Mira's body or witness their effect on another character on the page. The method is causal and specific but remains slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The university radio station (WXHU, basement of Harrington Hall) frames the entire story and supplies the key resource (the transmitter). The setting's isolation (basement, welded door, grimy window) enables Mira's plan and heightens the pressure when Morrison pounds on the door. The quad visible through the window stages the procession without requiring a scene change. The station's impending demolition (midnight deadline) drives the urgency. However, the station's specific features (console, broadcast equipment, electromagnetic field) are described but not causally leveraged; the conflict could play out in any isolated workspace with a transmitter. One more station-specific constraint or resource would deepen the integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe ("as the community divides") is signaled early ("Three weeks ago... Now") and dramatized through the faculty split (Aldridge's cult, Morrison's board vote). The midnight demolition deadline creates urgency and tightens Mira's window ("Forty-seven minutes"). The division is visible in the procession and the door-pounding. However, the community's division is largely backdrop rather than escalating pressure; we see its state (already divided) but not its progression. The clock matters, but the division's evolution does not alter Mira's tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to outwit the tricksters is established early (they are "cosmic entities that fed on chaos and division") and drives every choice: isolating the pattern, building the transmitter, refusing to open the door, broadcasting the counter-frequency. Her desire is conflicted by desperation ("theoretical physics and desperation in equal measure") and tempered by realism (the tricksters will return). The motivation shapes the closure (she continues the fight) and is paid off with visible cost (endless vigilance, isolation). The specific target (tricksters, not just "aliens" or "invaders") is irreplaceable and tied to the thematic question of manipulation versus agency.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tone blends ethereal (subsonic hum "in her teeth, her bones, the liquid of her eyes," "something vast and ancient," "patient as starlight") and grit (burnt coffee, old electronics, welding the door shut, "Frankenstein creation of salvaged parts"). The ethereal charged with physical cost peaks in the broadcast beat ("a sound that wasn't sound, a pressure that pushed against the walls of her skull"). However, the balance tips slightly toward exposition in the middle (explaining the tricksters' history, the signal's architecture) and the ethereal becomes more declarative than felt. The final image ("her reflection ghosting across the screen like something not quite earthbound") lands with both elements but feels slightly detached. Modulation with pressure is present but could tighten.</comment>
