<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's philosophical collector identity is embodied through her patient handling of seeds and rope, with clear interiority anchored in concrete action. The final choice to seek the weavers emerges from her established trait of preservation through transformation, though the decision feels somewhat inevitable rather than torn. Minor slip: "infinitely patient" is stated rather than tested under meaningful pressure. The fulgurite glass functions more as thematic marker than characterological constraint.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through rope-decoding, fog cycles, and seed-to-knowledge parallels, culminating in the invitation/test discovery that reweights Mira's solitary collection practice into communal seeking. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes her shift from passive preservation to active transmission with visible cost (abandoning her solo method). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Mira, dock, collection pouch, harbor). One meaningful deepening occurs when the rope's final knot sequence transforms from fishing lore into a weaver summons, narrowing her path forward.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The golden dock functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: fish oil and salt spray anchor the weaver knowledge, snow accumulation marks duration, fog cycles bracket her transformation. Spatial choreography is clean (dock edge, coiled rope, overturned dory). Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira's priorities: tactile rope detail dominates during decoding, visual fog stages her isolation. The fulgurite at her throat constrains one micro-choice (touching it before standing) and the dock's weathered planks echo the rope's encoded durability, but the harbor itself remains backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving ancient methods before the last weaver dies) is signaled early and drives all choices. One meaningful tightening: the rope's final knot sequence shifts from technical information to personal invitation, forcing Mira from collector to participant with visible cost (she must leave her established practice to find the hidden weavers). The fog cycles and snow accumulation create atmospheric pressure but don't alter tactics. Minor issue: no on-page loss or resource constraint tests her patience claim; the decoding succeeds without friction or mistake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (knowledge survives through transformation, not stasis) emerges organically from rope knots, seeds-as-instructions, and fulgurite glass without stated moral. The final image offers resonant answer: Mira's shift from solo preservation to communal transmission enacts the theme. Fulgurite recurs purposefully: "chaos made permanent, destruction become preservation" charges her understanding that "old methods survived not in spite of change but through it." Subtext operates in the rope's encoded invitation and the weavers' deliberate hiding. One slight hedge: "Perhaps that was the true philosophy" nearly tips into meta-commentary but recovers through the concrete image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices through a collector's lens (spiral patterns, branching deltas, seed-philosophy parallels). Psychic distance is stable third-limited with purposeful compression during decoding hours. Diction remains character-consistent: "philosophical arguments made tangible," "tactile grammar," "oceanic hush" fit her reflective idiom. Minor rhythm issue: several paragraphs begin with "The" + noun (rope, oceanic hush, fog, snow, final knot, lighthouse beam), creating subtle template cadence in the second half. No dialogue to assess; focalization is clean with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance understanding or atmosphere. Rhythm modulates well between patient decoding and the standing-departure beat. Two line-level issues: paraphrase loop at "The secret weavers were not gone. They had simply hidden themselves" restates the same content without added pressure (−0.2). Template-cadence stems across four sequential paragraphs beginning "The [noun]" in the final third dull momentum slightly (−0.4). Figurative language ("philosophical arguments made tangible," "island of worn wood suspended in gray nothing") is controlled and voice-appropriate, avoiding overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The seed-collector examining encoded rope offers a specific synthesis of preservation methods, and the weavers-in-hiding twist transforms familiar "last keeper of knowledge" material through the invitation-test knot pattern. Fulgurite as "chaos made permanent" is a vivid particular. Two frictions: the core emotional arc (solitary scholar finds hidden community) follows a widely used template without sharp transformation; the risk is modest—no bold structural choice or challenging moral calculus. The harbor fog and golden dock provide texture but remain somewhat interchangeable with other liminal spaces.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: present by paragraph one. Development: her collector lens shapes how she reads the rope (seed-philosophy parallels). Payoff: the ending decision to seek weavers and offer "what she had spent her life collecting" directly flows from her collector identity. Causal pressure: the trait enables the decoding but doesn't create visible friction or cost; she succeeds without struggle. Closure linkage: her offer of "patience to let ancient things grow again" ties collector identity to the invitation. Swappability: a scholar or archivist could fill the role with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced late (paragraph ~10, past 50% mark). Development: Mira touches it twice (once mid-decoding, once before standing) but the touches don't alter tactics. Payoff: the fulgurite's "chaos made permanent" metaphor appears in her final reflection, reweighting preservation-through-transformation theme. Cost: no visible price tied to the object itself; it functions thematically rather than causally. Late arrival (−0.6) and ornamental middle use (−0.5) lower the score; thematic reprise at closure provides modest lift.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: introduced paragraph three; stakes clarified by paragraph four (Henriksen was one, knowledge will vanish). Development: the concept pressures every decoding choice and provides the rope's content (fishing techniques, weather prediction). Payoff: the final knot sequence reveals weavers are hidden and waiting, transforming Mira's solitary quest into communal transmission. Causal pressure: the weavers' encoded knowledge shapes what she learns and the invitation she receives. Irreplaceability: removing the weavers would erase the story's central conflict and closure turn.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: stated in paragraph two ("infinitely patient, as all true collectors must be"). Development: patience is described ("hours passed," "continued to coax") but not tested by friction, failure, or competing urgency. Payoff: her offer of "patience to let ancient things grow again" bookends the trait. Cost: no on-page tradeoff where patience forecloses an option or incurs sacrifice; the decoding succeeds smoothly. Label-only (−0.3) and lack of dramatized constraint (−0.5) keep the score mid-low despite thematic echo at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced paragraph five ("began her work"). Development: coaxing meaning from knots drives the entire middle section; the action shapes every beat of discovery. Payoff: the final knot sequence's invitation is the culmination of coaxing, and her closing vow to "coax" the weavers into transmission echoes the method. Causal pressure: the action generates all new knowledge and the plot turn. Irreplaceability: "decode" or "read" could substitute with minor tonal shift, limiting the score slightly below 8.5 despite strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: rope introduced paragraph four; knot-decoding begins paragraph five (~20% mark). Development: the method structures the entire middle—over/under/through patterns, spiral-to-delta progressions, midpoint fishing lore, final invitation sequence. Payoff: the rope's final teaching (weavers' location) directly enables closure. Causal pressure: without knot-decoding mechanics, no discovery or turn occurs. Irreplaceability: the knot language (tactile, non-verbal, encoded in twist and turn) is intrinsic to the weaver premise and Mira's patient collector method. Two beats of distinct decoding (+0.9) and closure linkage (+1.2) elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph one anchors dock, snow, fish oil stains. Development: the dock's edge positions Mira for rope handling; snow accumulation marks time; golden color (fish oil/salt) ties to weaver fishing knowledge. Payoff: "golden dock" returns in the final paragraph, and the dock becomes an "island...suspended in gray nothing" that mirrors her isolation before seeking the weavers. Micro-setting credit: the dock constrains her kneeling position and the weathered planks echo durability theme. Swappability: beach or pier could serve similarly (−0.4); the dock doesn't force a tactical choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Setup: fog mentioned paragraph one, rolls across in paragraph four. Development: fog cycles bracket Mira's work (thickens to isolate her, thins to reveal fragments, returns at departure), creating atmospheric rhythm. Payoff: "fog rolled back...one final time" appears in the penultimate paragraph, charging her departure. Time pressure: the fog marks duration but doesn't impose a live deadline that alters tactics; she works "hours" without urgency. The timeframe shapes mood more than decisions. Lyric reprise (fog's return) provides modest closure lift but lacks causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: stated paragraph two (seeds as "philosophical arguments") and paragraph nine (knowledge "would vanish entirely"). Development: the motivation drives her decoding patience and reverent rope handling; fulgurite reminds her "why preservation mattered." Payoff: her final decision to find weavers and "offer them what she had spent her life collecting" enacts the motivation with visible cost (leaving solo practice). Friction: no on-page conflict between preservation and another want; the desire is univocal. Told weight (−0.3) and lack of competing impulse (−0.4) lower the score despite clear causal presence across beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "oceanic hush" introduced paragraph five; silence motifs throughout (snow falls "in silence," fog muffles, waves "hold their breath"). Development: the tone modulates subtly—intensifies during isolation ("gray nothing"), breathes during comprehension, deepens at departure. Payoff: "snow and silence and the faint impression" in the final image sustains the hush as the dock keeps "its own secrets." Coherence: tone remains stable through discovery without flattening into static mood. The hush charges the contemplative closure and harmonizes with Mira's patient method. No tonal rupture under pressure; quiet ending fits the established register.</comment>
