<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is internally consistent and embodied through concrete actions (trailing fingers, unwinding thread, gathering it back). The choice between sanity and certainty is established early and paid off in her reclamation of the gallery. Interior texture remains specific ("rational enchantment, she understood now") though some moments lean toward abstraction. The final stance—sitting in the reclaimed space—feels earned by the prior fever-state and her active negotiation with the building.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis: Marina claims the gallery by weaving a stable geometry within chaos, and "the walls stopped shifting" demonstrates visible cost (containment within the smaller sinew structure). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—fever symptoms layered into architecture, thread marking pattern, mirrors multiplying—with a decisive cadence shift at "the gallery settle[d]." Orientation is clean (fever dream architect, optical illusion gallery, present action). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes connection has "tension...strain of material pulled between fixed points," altering her tactics from wandering to deliberate gathering.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The optical illusion gallery is vividly realized through functional details: painted shadow doorways, tilted floors that stay level, mirrors angled to fragment identity. The sinew thread acts as micro-setting, constraining her path and enabling the final weaving. Sensory selection reflects urgency (walls "that existed only when observed directly"). The thread's presence in the closure image—creating "a structure within the structure"—charges the ending and demonstrates setting elements shaping the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming/understanding the gallery) is signaled early and tightens through one major reversal: the mirrors show not fragmented identity but the web of connections she's traced, shifting her goal from discovery to deliberate reclamation. The gathering of thread narrows options (she can't wander indefinitely) and the final knotting forecloses the chaotic state with visible cost: her architecture is now "smaller, contained entirely within the web." Agency is clear—her weaving creates stability—and the price (containment, a bounded home) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: connection as tension rather than warmth, architecture as negotiation, rational enchantment as "physics observed from unusual angles." The sinew thread accumulates meaning from binding books to binding realities to describing stable geometry. The ending offers a non-literal answer: connection is "real, strange, and finally still," reweighting the opening ambition to "control space." One slip: "It was better: real, strange, and finally still" edges toward summary rather than letting the image do the work alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: "rational enchantment," "the systematic magic of perception creating what it observed." Diction remains consistent and architecturally precise. One register slip: "the texture of connection humming through every thread" uses "texture" literally and metaphorically in close succession, creating minor strain. Psychic distance is well-controlled, staying tight to Marina's perception. No dialogue to evaluate. The final paragraph's explanatory tone ("unaware that Marina had negotiated peace") slightly softens the prior control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. Minor loop: "realistically imaginary" appears identically in two contexts without reweighting between uses. Template cadence in the mirror-room paragraph: "They showed...had absorbed...had wandered...had left...had become" stacks past-perfect constructions. One metaphor strain: "erupt into multiplicity" uses explosive imagery for what's actually a static reveal in mirrors. Propulsion is generally strong, though the penultimate paragraph's three sequential "The" openers create brief monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of illness-as-architecture and sinew thread as material anchor is specific and non-obvious. "Rational enchantment" and "realistically imaginary" risk prompt-echo but are integrated into action. The transformation from ambition-driven design to fever-claimed building to deliberate reclamation through weaving offers a fresh angle. One safety hedge: "chose sanity. Certainty had been overrated anyway" tells the reader how to value the choice rather than trusting the dramatized arc. The final image of "threads that bound reality to something stable enough to call home" feels earned and memorable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina drives the key turn: her realization in the mirror room shifts her from passive discovery to active gathering, and her final weaving creates the closure. Present in setup (opening line), development (thread-laying, mirror revelation), and payoff (knotting the geometry). Her agency is clear and her choices narrow options. Reaches solid mid-band but not indispensable—another architect with different history could execute a similar arc with adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sinew thread appears in at least four beats: pocket introduction, tying to pillar, unspooling trail, mirror-room web realization, gathering, and final weaving. It enables her navigation, reveals the pattern she's created, and provides the means for the closure geometry. Specificity matters: animal tendon, translucent strength, book-binding heritage. The thread's presence in "threads that bound reality" at the ending charges the final image. Nearly indispensable—removing it would collapse both the method and the closure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rational enchantment is named and explained ("the systematic magic of perception creating what it observed") and shapes her understanding that the gallery exists through attention. It informs her tactic: weaving a stable geometry that "existed independent of perception." Present in setup (fever revelation), development (observation-dependent walls), and payoff (creating structure that mirrors can't distort). Solid causal role but somewhat interchangeable with similar framing concepts. The cost linkage is present but indirect.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Realistically imaginary" appears twice: the doorway that "revealed itself as painted shadow, realistically imaginary in every detail except depth" and later the gallery "realistically imaginary in every beam and corner." The first instance constrains action (she can't pass through). The attribute enables the central problem (navigating unstable space) and is present at closure when the building "had become her fever made manifest, realistically imaginary." Two-beat involvement with one clear constraint; reaches mid-band but the second use is more descriptive than action-forcing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Erupt" appears once, in the mirror room: "watched her reflection erupt into multiplicity." This revelation triggers the turn from wandering to gathering, making it functionally important. However, the action is passive observation rather than Marina's doing, and the moment could be rewritten with "shatter," "multiply," or "fracture" without major structural change. Present in a key beat but not irreplaceable; the mirror revelation itself is essential, but "erupt" specifically is not.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Weaving patterns is signaled early (thread unwinding to mark path), demonstrated in the middle (realizing she's "weaving patterns between versions of herself"), and executed at closure ("By weaving patterns with the gathered sinew, she created a structure within the structure"). The method's mechanics matter: it creates stable geometry that perception can't distort. It shapes her final tactic and provides the means for resolution. Strong beat involvement and closure participation, approaching essential territory.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The optical illusion gallery provides resources (Escher prints, Riley vibrations, mirror room) and constraints (shifting walls, tilting floors, painted doorways). It pressures choices by rearranging as she moves and supplies the mirrors that trigger her realization. Present throughout: setup (seventeen years ago, before sickness), development (navigating deceptive rooms), payoff (settling into stability). The gallery's specific properties—illusions designed to show seeing isn't believing—charge the ending where she reclaims it by creating something perception can't distort.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"As memories alter their own foundations" appears in the opening paragraph describing how rooms rearrange. The timeframe is metaphorical rather than a literal clock. It informs the instability Marina navigates but doesn't tighten decisions through urgency. Her fever "had broken three days ago" establishes when but not a countdown. The memory-timeframe shapes atmosphere and world logic but lacks the pressure of a ticking constraint. Functional presence without strong tactical impact; no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of connection" is stated explicitly: "Her motivation to discover the texture of connection had driven her here." She learns connection "had weight and weave and resistance...not warmth but tension," and the ending delivers "the texture of connection humming through every thread." Present in setup (stated motivation), development (realization), and payoff (sensory fulfillment). One friction: the motivation is told more than dramatized through conflicting wants. The cost—accepting bounded containment—ties to it but the desire itself doesn't create much on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Unsettling calm appears early: "the visions persisted with an unsettling calm that made her doubt the breaking." The tone modulates appropriately—calm navigation of impossible space, no panic—and charges the closure: "felt the gallery settle around her...finally still." Coherent throughout with purposeful modulation. The tone enables her methodical approach (weaving rather than fleeing) and the ending's resolution to stillness pays off the opening's "unsettling calm." Solid integration with closure linkage, though "unsettling" becomes less present in the final third.</comment>
