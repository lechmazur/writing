<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's vigilance is concrete and her patient decoding is well-established through the three-month timeline and the sundial discovery. Her choices to recruit twelve specific people and orchestrate the blackout demonstrate agency under pressure. The interior voice remains consistent throughout, though the competence borders on flawless—her meticulous planning encounters no meaningful internal contradiction or doubt that might deepen the characterization. The final stance (returning to her post) feels earned but the lack of visible struggle or cost in her decision-making keeps this from the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with accumulative patterning in the recruitment phase. Orientation anchors (Maren, Eastern Gate, twilight blackout) land cleanly in the opening. The closure—Maren's return to her post with revolution set in motion—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The because/therefore chain (discovery → recruitment → blackout → messengers departing) holds, though the middle recruitment phase is summarized rather than dramatized, creating a causality gap between setup and payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The luminous fort's glass panels, the Eastern Gate, and the Astronomer's Tower provide clear spatial anchors. The blackout functions as a constraint that enables Maren's plan, directly affecting tactics. The bronze quill holder and the twin sundials are handled concretely—placement "completing a circuit" charges the final tower beat. However, the counterfeit mint beneath the Eastern Tower is told rather than shown, and the fort's interior geography (corridors, courtyards, towers) remains somewhat generic despite the premise's architectural specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exposing the Duke's counterfeit operation to spark revolution—is signaled early and remains coherent. The blackout provides one meaningful tightening that narrows the window for action. However, the escalation is largely mechanical: Maren executes a plan without on-page resistance, adaptation, or friction. The messengers departing and the "foundations cracking" reference future consequences rather than present cost, leaving the immediate price of her choices abstract. No reversals test her commitment; theplan unfolds as designed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "cradle of sparks" conceit threads through concrete images (the quill holder, twelve recruits, friction imagery) and the theme of patient truth versus tyranny emerges from Maren's actions rather than statement. The final image—"twelve sparks waited to become a fire"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The contrast between borrowed light (glass panels) and earned sparks (friction, patience) is elegant. Minor deduction: the astronomer's backstory and the "vigilant woman who spent her nights reading angles in moonlight" edge toward thematic self-explanation in places, though they remain grounded in scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with Maren throughout; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—"the lens through which she saw the world" as vigilance, "precision she applied to everything"—is character-specific and controls what she notices. Diction is consistent and purposeful ("intrigue could move freely," "truth wrapped in shadow"). The distance modulates appropriately during reflective beats versus action. One minor slip: "the kind of mind that saw opportunity in incompletion" briefly adopts omniscient commentary about the dead astronomer rather than filtering it through Maren's inference, creating a momentary POV leak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well and information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or stakes. The opening and closing images bookend effectively. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "vigilance was not merely her duty—it was the rhythm of her heartbeat, the lens through which she saw the world" restates the same idea across two clauses; "intrigue could move freely, slipping through doors" also loops the concept. The metaphor density is high but controlled. Template cadence appears in the recruitment summary: "A cook who remembered... A stable hand whose... A scribe who..." which flattens momentum in a key explanatory beat. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase and template artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of lock sentinel, coded sundial, and silent revolution is specific and non-obvious. The astronomer's "calmly inventive" solution—using an abandoned sundial as a cipher key—feels fresh. The piece avoids stock revolutionary tropes by centering patience and architectural literacy over swords. However, the core frame (hidden royal corruption exposed by patient civil servant) is familiar, and the execution, while polished, does not transform it through surprising moral calculus or risky structural choices. The revolution's success is promised rather than tested on the page, reducing the boldness of the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren as vigilant lock sentinel shapes the premise (access to all doors), the middle action (unlocking gates for messengers), and the final image (returning to her post). Her vigilance is not merely observational—it drives her three-month investigation and the recruitment of twelve allies. The specific trait (guardian of "every door, every chest, every secret compartment") enables the blackout plan and the closing irony: "No one would think to suspect the lock sentinel, the woman who guarded doors rather than opened them." Her choices create the key turns. Cost is conceptual (future risk) rather than immediate, keeping this below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder appears in three beats: discovery behind the loose stone, carrying it to the tower, and placement in the sundial's center to "complete a circuit." Its etched numbers are the cipher key that unlocks the astronomer's message. However, its mechanical function—how placement "completes a circuit"—remains vague, and the object does not return with reweighted meaning at closure; it simply fulfills its setup role. The holder is essential to the plot's middle logic but does not charge the final image or constrain a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"The cradle of sparks" appears as the astronomer's message label for the fort and returns in the closing image ("twelve sparks waited to become a fire"). It names the stakes (hidden mint as corruption's fuel) and the thematic conceit (sparks from friction vs. borrowed light). However, it functions primarily as metaphor rather than altering on-page tactics or choices. The concept is present in setup and payoff but does not constrain middle action—Maren's plan would work identically if the message used different phrasing. Lyric reprise without causal pressure in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Calmly inventive" is attributed to the dead astronomer and informs the coded sundial solution, which Maren then deciphers. The trait shapes the backstory logic (the astronomer hid evidence rather than confronting the Duke directly) but does not constrain Maren's on-page choices—she inherits the solution rather than demonstrating the trait herself. The attribute is functional to the plot's premise but label-only for the living protagonist. No visible tradeoff or cost tied to inventiveness on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Intrigue as the action mode is signaled early ("intrigue could move freely") and structures the middle (recruiting twelve allies, timing the blackout with the guard change, unlocking doors for evidence-carrying messengers). The method—silent conspiracy rather than open confrontation—is essential to the revolution's design and the final irony of Maren's continued loyal appearance. However, the intrigue unfolds in summary (the twelve recruits, the engineer's blackout) rather than dramatized scenes of persuasion or risk. The action is causally necessary but not tested under pressure on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The coded angles in the half-painted sundial are introduced early (the painted portions mark specific angles measured against the quill holder's numbers) and recur at the climax when Maren places the holder in the tower's complete sundial twin. The method is specific and its mechanics matter to the plot—the angles "spelled out a message that had waited fifteen years." However, the decoding itself happens off-page (Maren "had spent three months" doing it), and the tower placement feels ceremonial rather than tactically urgent. The method shapes the premise and closure but not middle attempts under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The luminous fort at twilight frames the opening and closing images (glass panels catching dying sun, then holding "the last light like a promise"). The blackout—loss of lamps—creates the window for intrigue and directly enables Maren's plan. The Eastern Gate, Astronomer's Tower, and the fort's "thousand glass panels" provide spatial anchors. The setting supplies both resource (darkness, unlocked doors) and thematic contrast (borrowed light vs. earned sparks). However, the fort's interior geography remains somewhat generic; the counterfeit mint beneath the Eastern Tower is told rather than shown as a space that pressures choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The unexplained blackout is the inciting condition, timed "perfectly with the changing of the guard" to enable the messenger departures. It creates urgency (one-hour duration mentioned) and the tactical window. However, the timeframe is not tracked beat-by-beat—we do not feel the clock tightening Maren's moves. The blackout functions as a switch (on/off) rather than a live countdown. The lamps "began flickering back to life" at the end, confirming the window closes, but the duration does not alter Maren's tactics on the page. Setup and payoff present; middle pressure absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to spark a silent revolution drives Maren's three-month investigation, her precise recruitment of twelve allies, and the orchestrated blackout. The desire is enacted on the page (unlocking doors, placing the quill holder, ensuring messengers depart) and the final image (returning to her post while revolution spreads) crystallizes the cost of sustained vigilance. However, the motivation is not visibly conflicted—Maren never doubts the plan or weighs competing goods. The friction between her loyal appearance and subversive action is thematic rather than felt as internal struggle. Dramatized in choices but not in friction between wants and costs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Winking hush" as tone is legible in the prose's controlled irony: "No one would think to suspect the lock sentinel" and the quiet confidence of "she had opened something tonight that no lock could close again." The tone modulates from patient observation (opening) to quiet triumph (closing) without breaking into overt celebration. However, the tone remains fairly static—steady, knowing assurance—rather than shifting under pressure. The "winking" quality is present in the thematic ironies (guardian who opens, borrowed light vs. sparks) but does not charge the final image with tonal surprise or reweighting. Coherent but one-note.</comment>
