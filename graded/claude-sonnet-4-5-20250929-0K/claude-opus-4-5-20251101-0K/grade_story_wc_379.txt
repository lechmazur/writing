<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's trait as "discerning thrift-store curator who could tell a genuine memory from manufactured nostalgia" is established through telling rather than embodied choice under pressure. Mrs. Okonkwo shows stronger interiority through her physical reactions (tightening hands, trembling fingers) and the reveal of her relationship to Delphine. The granddaughter remains off-page, reducing the stakes of the final promised meeting. Maren's micro-choices (bringing her here, offering to facilitate reunion) feel inevitable rather than constrained by competing values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational elements. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (courtyard, dawn, three days since locket found). The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the locket opens, the granddaughter's seventeen-year pilgrimage is made legible, and Mrs. Okonkwo's grief shifts from calcified to speakable. Cost is felt—seventeen years of silence crystallize into a pending reunion—but the decisive meeting remains off-page, weakening the closure's immediacy. The phrase "Then let's hear them" promises future action rather than completing present transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The courtyard is anchored with sensory detail (potted citrus, weathered benches, cobblestones, tarnished clasp) and constrains the meeting by serving as the site of accumulated stories and the locked mailbox. Dawn's "suspended moment when colors bleed from gray to gold" and the strengthening light track emotional progression. The locket's hidden catch—a physical puzzle that shapes the revelation—elevates the object-as-setting function. Micro-setting (the mailbox, the locket clasp) drives both mystery and resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: unlocking the mystery of the locket and mailbox to heal estrangement. Pressure tightens when Mrs. Okonkwo identifies herself as Delphine's caretaker and the granddaughter as hers, then the locket opens to reveal the key. The escalation is clear but relies heavily on revelation rather than protagonist agency under conflicting pressure. Maren's role is facilitative—she observes, listens, offers—but does not face a trade-off that forecloses a path with visible cost. The promised Thursday reunion defers the highest-stakes choice off-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—listening heals by making pain shareable—emerges from the courtyard ritual, Mrs. Okonkwo's pilgrimage, and Maren's patient curation. The locket and mailbox serve as nested metaphors for sealed grief. The line "Listening healed not because it erased pain, but because it made pain speakable, shareable, lighter" borders on explicit thesis but is immediately followed by embodied action (holding, weeping). The final image of the granddaughter walking toward the thrift store offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing, though "memory waited to be reclaimed" leans slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited through Maren; POV distance is stable and perceptual signature is controlled ("She rejected donations that carried no story," "heard something else beneath the words"). Dialogue feels purposeful and advances plot, though Mrs. Okonkwo's lines ("You want to hear about Delphine") occasionally veer into convenient exposition. The phrase "She came to the courtyard each morning because this was where the old women gathered" reads as summary telling rather than dramatized habit. Register remains consistent; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean with strong rhythm control and sensory specificity ("morning dew on the iron benches," "her thumbnail finding a hidden catch"). Minor scaffold: "The courtyard held its breath" and "The courtyard exhaled" frame the piece symmetrically but risk cliché. The phrase "She leads her life far from here" and "leads their guilt like a dog on a leash" reuse the verb "lead" awkwardly within proximity. One paraphrase loop: "made pain speakable, shareable, lighter" followed immediately by "she had been drawn to this work, this place, this particular morning" stacks declarative rhythm without propulsion. No major line-level artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The nested mystery structure (locket within coat, key within locket, letters within mailbox) offers a fresh angle on estrangement and reconciliation. The thrift-store curator as conduit for neighborhood storytelling is specific and voice-driven. However, the core emotional arc—long-estranged family member holds the key to closure all along—follows a familiar template. The transformation lies in the courtyard ritual and the listening-as-healing frame, which elevate the material but do not fully escape the premise's predictability. Risk-taking in pacing (slow revelation, quiet ending) is intentional and coherent.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maren as "discerning thrift-store curator" is present throughout and makes two key choices: tracing the coat's donor pattern and offering to bring the granddaughter. Her discernment constrains the mystery (she "understood through neighborhood storytelling") and enables the reunion offer at closure. However, her trait is more label than embodied friction—we see her observe and facilitate but not reject a donation or wrestle with competing curatorial values on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The locket is handled in four beats: Maren traces its clasp (opening), holds it toward Mrs. Okonkwo (middle), Mrs. Okonkwo takes and opens it (climax), revealing the key (closure). Its refusal to open drives the mystery; its hidden catch rewards patience and becomes the pivot for unlocking the mailbox. The locket's physical properties (tarnished clasp, hidden thumbnail catch) are specific and irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The locked mailbox is signaled early (paragraph two), reappears when Mrs. Okonkwo sits beside it, and shapes the central mystery. Its seventeen-year seal constrains all prior attempts at reconciliation and the key inside the locket makes closure legible. The mailbox itself does not constrain a middle choice—Maren and Mrs. Okonkwo cannot act on it until the key is revealed—but it anchors stakes and the final image ("let's hear them... Together, at dawn").</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Leads through following" is illustrated when Maren watches the granddaughter hesitate weekly, does not force entry, and waits until the locket donation signals readiness. The trait appears in "following... through patience, through the quiet courage of those willing to sit in uncertain spaces and listen" (final paragraph). However, it reads more as theme statement than embodied constraint—Maren does not face a pressure moment where leading would solve faster but cost trust. The attribute is present but not tested under friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Hear" drives the story: Maren "heard something else beneath the words," Mrs. Okonkwo speaks of letters "never heard," and the resolution is "Then let's hear them." The action recurs across beats and charges the closure promise. However, the climactic "hearing" (reading the letters) is deferred off-page, weakening irreplaceability—Maren could have proposed "read them together" with similar effect. Strong thematic resonance but not fully causal at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Through neighborhood storytelling" is signaled early ("the neighborhood knew Maren") and enacted when Maren "understood through neighborhood storytelling what no direct conversation could reveal." Mrs. Okonkwo's oral history of Delphine is the method's clearest dramatization. The storytelling shapes Maren's tactics (she does not confront the granddaughter directly) and makes the final reunion legible. The method is present in setup, middle reasoning, and closure framing, though the mechanics remain partially abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The courtyard is anchored with dawn light, cobblestones, citrus trees, iron benches, and the locked mailbox. It serves as the ritual gathering place and frames the opening and closing images ("held its breath," "exhaled"). The space constrains the meeting by being the site where "stories accumulated like morning dew." However, the courtyard does not supply a resource or barrier that alters tactics in a middle beat—it functions more as symbolic container than active pressure. Strong setup and closure presence; lighter middle involvement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"When the outside world intrudes" appears once: "Car horns rose beyond the courtyard walls, and somewhere a radio crackled news of distant conflicts, sandstorms sweeping across continents." The intrusion is lyric texture rather than tactical pressure—it does not tighten decisions or alter Maren's or Mrs. Okonkwo's choices. The timeframe (dawn, three days since finding the locket, weekly Thursday visits) tracks but does not create urgency. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maren's motivation "to prove that listening heals" is stated explicitly in the phrase "Maren understood why she had been drawn to this work, this place, this particular morning. Listening healed not because it erased pain, but because it made pain speakable." The motivation drives her choice to facilitate reunion and is dramatized when she holds Mrs. Okonkwo. However, the phrasing leans toward thesis statement rather than enacted friction—Maren does not face a competing want (e.g., protecting someone from pain) that would test her belief. Told clearly but not conflicted on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Sandstorm calm" tone is established through the suspended dawn moment, "vibrant space between night and day," and "the calm that precedes revelation." The courtyard exhales as the sun rises. Tone modulates subtly—quiet patience in the opening, rising tension when Mrs. Okonkwo's hands tighten, release when she weeps—and charges the final image of the granddaughter's walk. Coherent and purposeful, though the sandstorm metaphor itself appears only once as radio background rather than recurring motif.</comment>
