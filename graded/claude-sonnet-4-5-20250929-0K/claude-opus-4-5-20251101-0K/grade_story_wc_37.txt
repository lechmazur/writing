<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is consistently embodied through scattered memory and song, with clear micro-choices (swaddling windows with petals, pressing against mica). Her final transformation—"remember nothing of herself and everything of her people"—is earned through prior causality and carries visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (memory keeper who keeps them poorly) but could be more actively shown in competing impulses during peak moments. The move from individual to distributed consciousness feels conceptually strong but emotionally distant in execution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the woven dawns spreading, other voices joining, cost made explicit in "remember nothing of herself." The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear pattern teaching (songs, mica, light threads) and a decisive intensification when the web of light pushes outward. Orientation is clean within the first 120 words. One minor causality slip: the "darkness pressed harder" moment needs clearer mechanical stakes to justify why it doesn't succeed in breaking through.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse and mica windows are vividly established with purposeful detail (translucent panes, phosphorescent glow, endless night). The mica windows constrain Elara's tactics—she uses them as memory vessels and light conduits—and charge the final image when they become transmission thresholds. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The "mirror world" setting remains somewhat abstract; grounding one additional physical constraint (temperature, air quality, something tactile) would elevate the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindling the dying realm) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful deepening: Elara's discovery that memories live in the mica, enabling the light-web. Her agency (singing, swaddling windows) forecloses isolation and transforms the greenhouse into a transmission node with visible cost. The "darkness pressed harder" beat adds external pressure but remains somewhat abstract. Escalation is driven by protagonist action under the Accumulative lens, and the cost—loss of individual selfhood—is unmistakable on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of distributed memory and communal rekindling emerges organically from the mica windows, songs, and Elara's transformation. The final image—"remember nothing of herself and everything of her people"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. One purposeful recurrence: the songs shift from "scattered like seeds" to embedded wisdom that spreads community-wide. Minor deduction: "This was the price. / This was the gift." edges toward thematic statement, though the prior image earns it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single POV with stable third-limited distance and a distinct perceptual signature (memory fragments, song-as-anchor). Diction remains consistent and purposeful, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. One register slip: "nascent light" and "distributed consciousness" drift slightly elevated for a character described as scattered; the rest of the lexicon is grounded. Psychic distance shifts are intentional and serve the emotional arc.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean with strong propulsion and vivid images. Paraphrase loop in opening: "Her memories scattered like seeds in wind, fragments of faces and names drifting beyond her grasp" restates the same idea in adjacent clauses without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in middle section: "She saw figures… their hands… their voices…" runs a parallel structure without variation (−0.4). No figurative muddle or major artifacts at closure. Information density is high; momentum is sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise (light-as-woven-tapestry sustained by communal song) offers a fresh synthesis. The mica-as-memory-vessel turn is specific and non-obvious. Emotional arc and thematic question cohere as a singular vision. One friction: the "mirror world" frame remains underdeveloped—removing it would not fundamentally alter the logic, suggesting it's more atmospheric than structural. Transformation is present but the premise could stand further risk-taking in world mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara (scattered memory keeper) drives all key turns: begins singing, presses palm to mica, swaddles windows with petals, and transforms into distributed consciousness. Present in setup, middle choices, and closure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mica windows appear in at least four distinct beats: initial observation, trembling response to song, memory revelation, swaddling action, and final transmission threshold. They constrain tactics (Elara must use them as looms) and charge the closure image ("thresholds through which accumulated memory flowed"). Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Woven dawns shape the central stake and tactics throughout. Early signal (the realm's past practice), middle development (Elara replicates the process via mica and petals), and closure participation (dawns spreading, knitting communities). Removing this concept would collapse the story's causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Knits communities together" is dramatized on-page: the light-web links window to window, other voices join, and the final image shows communities reunited. The attribute constrains Elara's approach (she cannot do it alone) and pays off at closure. Could score higher with a second visible cost tied to this trait in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Swaddling action is pivotal: Elara wraps mica windows with silver petals, creating vessels where light takes root. This specific gesture is framed as instinctive weavers' preparation, shapes the light-web's formation, and directly enables the ending. Swappable only with significant structural rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Forgotten songs are signaled early (Elara "remembered the songs. Always the songs"), drive the mica's response, enable memory recovery, and spread to other voices at closure. The mechanics matter: songs are preserved in mica, require voice to activate, and must be shared to succeed. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night is established early, pressures choices (dying trees, no natural light), supplies resources (silver petals, mica windows), and frames the final transmission moment. The space itself becomes a crucible for rekindling. Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mirror world is present in setup and closure but remains somewhat abstract. It frames the "endless night" and "woven dawns" but doesn't tighten decisions with a live clock or unique mechanic. The timeframe operates more as atmosphere than constraint. Functional but the story's core logic wouldn't break without this exact label.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation to rekindle a dying realm is dramatized through Elara's actions (singing, swaddling, persisting) and tested by the cost she pays (selfhood dissolution). Friction between individual memory and communal need is clear. The want is consistent and drives all major choices with visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tone of "bound release" (constraint yielding to liberation) is coherent: darkness pressing, old songs unlocking memory, light finally spreading. Modulates with pressure from opening stillness through discovery to spreading dawn. The paired closing lines ("This was the price. / This was the gift.") explicitly name the tone shift, which charges the final image but edges toward direct statement.</comment>
