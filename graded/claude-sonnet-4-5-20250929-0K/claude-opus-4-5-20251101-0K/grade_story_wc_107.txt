<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is concrete and rooted in her glassblowing craft, with embodied gestures like touching the bookmark and pulling the lever. The self-narration device serves character function but occasionally flattens genuine contradiction—her "theatrical loneliness" is articulated rather than lived in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to descend the mountain is motivated by accumulated pressure, though the renunciation of solitude could carry more visible micro-hesitation to earn the cost. Father-abandonment backstory anchors present stance but occupies substantial wordcount without altering a present micro-choice until the pocketing moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (control room, seventeen years, Elena). Closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elena commits to descend, pockets the bookmark, and begins drafting plans—options crystallize with felt cost (abandoning "simple cold of isolation"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the red light flickers, shifting her from contemplation to action. Cost is legible in the final image: she trades solitude for community risk. The lens holds; density and cadence increase toward the ending, reweighting the thawing motif.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting (abandoned control room, mountain bunker, melting ice) applies consistent pressure: frost-covered console, dripping water, calving ice shelves mark seasonal transition and urgency. Spatial choreography is clean; Elena moves from console to floor drafting. The red light constrains her hope and enables the restoration plan. Sensory detail is purposeful (breath visible, ice weeping) and filtered through her craft lens. The bookmark and control panel anchor micro-setting choices. Environment charges the final image: water eroding ice parallels her thawing resolve.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore the bunker to house safe inquiry, overcoming inherited despair. One meaningful tightening: the red light's flicker proves batteries survive, narrowing options from abandonment to restoration. Elena's agency drives the turn (pulling the lever, deciding to descend). The cost is legible: she must abandon years of solitary craft and risk community. Coincidence does not resolve; her decision to seek others is earned by accumulated pressure (melting ice, functioning power, father's bookmark). Escalation is modest but sufficient for this length under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (inherited despair vs. renewal through purpose) emerges from concrete particulars: cracked bookmark, red light pulse, glass containment vessels. The thawing motif evolves from literal (ice melting) to metaphorical (Elena's heart) without overt statement until the self-narration in the penultimate beat, which edges toward declaration but remains character-voiced. Subtext operates in gesture (touching the bookmark, pocketing it as compass). The ending offers a resonant answer—beginning again with safe walls for dangerous questions—without a stated moral. Father's abandonment provides counter-pressure; Elena inherits skill but rejects his despair, a non-binary thematic stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with close psychic distance. Elena's self-narration device is taught early and serves voice consistency, though it occasionally drifts toward expository interiority ("finding that speaking aloud transformed loneliness into something almost theatrical"). Diction is controlled and purposeful, matching her artisan background ("silica," "volatile compounds"). The prose modulates with emotional intensity: shorter beats at the lever-pull, longer reflection in backstory. Filter verbs ("felt," "heard") are acceptable and voice-motivated. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature is craft-focused (glassblower's lens on containment, boundaries). The narration device occasionally platforms theme rather than pursuing goal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in action beats; backstory blocks are less propulsive. One paraphrase loop near the bookmark introduction: "cracked leather" and "split but not separated" restate durability without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in self-narration stems ("the glassblower examines," "the thoughtfully spirited protagonist") recurs three times but reads voice-motivated, not artifact (no deduction). Minor filter-verb stacks ("felt the ice beginning," "heard the thunder") in reflective beats do not dull immediacy. No mixed metaphors. Clarity and momentum are strong; strategic telling compresses seventeen years efficiently.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The contemplative-artisan-restores-abandoned-facility premise is familiar; transformation occurs through the self-narration device and glassblowing-as-metaphor for safe inquiry. The thawing-heart motif is well-executed but not novel. Emotional specificity (inherited skill vs. inherited despair) avoids generic templates. The bookmark as "compass pointing toward everything her father had given up" is a fresh inflection. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat, though the synthesis feels more careful than surprising. No close echoes of famous lines. Risk-taking is modest; the self-narration device is unconventional but does not heighten stakes beyond voice texture.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character present throughout. Setup: introduced immediately. Development: touches bookmark, pulls lever (key turn), decides to descend. Payoff: pockets bookmark, drafts plans in ending. Drives two beats (lever-pull, descent decision) and shapes closure. Causal pressure moderate; her choices enable restoration plan. Specificity high (glassblower identity constrains method). Cost visible (abandons solitude). Swappability low; occupation matters to containment metaphor. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, cost +0.4 = ~10.0 range; minor reduction for observation-heavy middle passages −0.3 per rubric; her contemplation occasionally delays decision pressure. Final: strong integration, some observational drift.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Object present in three beats: withdrawal from satchel (early), placed on console (mid), pocketed as compass (ending). Setup clear. Development: she touches it twice, but it does not constrain a middle choice—she reflects on its durability without the object altering tactics. Payoff: pocketing it reweights prior material as directional symbol. Lyric reprise (first third → last beat) reweights stake with cost. Early signal +0.5, two functional beats +0.6 (touching is passive), closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.4, cost connection +0.3 = ~8.7 range; reduced for middle beat being observational rather than decision-driving −0.8, and for summary-only integration in key moments −0.5. Swappability moderate; any father's artifact could serve. Final: purposeful reprise, limited causal work in middle.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Concept (thawing heart) present throughout. Setup: literal ice melting introduced early. Development: metaphorical layer emerges in self-narration ("frozen heart begins its own thawing"). Payoff: final paragraph declares theme explicitly ("the thawing had begun"). Shapes stakes (seasonal transition forces choice) and tactics (restoration becomes possible as ice melts). Cost tied to concept: warmth of community vs. cold of isolation. Early signal +0.6, one beat (lever-pull enabled by thaw) +0.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, cost +0.4 = ~9.2 range; reduced for late explicit articulation in self-narration (thematic echo in final third) −0.7, and for concept being more thematic resonance than on-page pressure multiplier −0.8. Swappability low; metaphor is title-level. Final: strong thematic integration, modest tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Attribute (thoughtfully spirited) appears twice in self-narration as label: "thoughtfully spirited protagonist" and implied in "contemplative glassblower." Setup: first third. Development: does not constrain a middle choice; remains descriptor. Payoff: not present in ending. Label-only use; no visible tradeoff where thoughtfulness costs speed or spirit costs caution. Early signal +0.4, zero beats with cost 0.0, no closure linkage 0.0, ornamental −0.8, swappability high −0.6, label-only −0.6. Cap at 4.6 for missing closure participation per rubric. Final: decorative trait, no dramatic function.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Action (abandon) present at closure. Setup: father's abandonment introduced early (first third). Development: Elena's counter-choice to abandon solitude emerges mid-story. Payoff: "abandon her solitude as her father had once abandoned his hope" and decision to descend. Major turn traces to this action; it redefines options (isolation → community). Early signal +0.7, two beats (father's past, Elena's future) +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost +0.5 = ~11.3 range; reduced for father's abandonment being backstory rather than on-page action −0.8, and for Elena's abandonment being declared intent rather than completed act −0.6. Swappability low; thematic antithesis matters. Final: strong thematic and causal integration, not yet enacted on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Method (dramatically narrating mundane tasks) taught immediately: "And now," she announced... "the contemplative glassblower removes her coat." Setup clear. Development: recurs in three beats (coat removal, bookmark examination, power switch, final choice). Does not constrain attempts or alter tactics; serves voice texture and loneliness management. Payoff: "End of prologue" in final line uses method to frame closure. Early signal +0.7, three mentions +1.4, closure linkage (framing device) +0.7 = ~8.8 range; reduced for ornamental function (does not shape problem-solving) −0.9, for being voice device rather than story engine −0.7, and for brief final mention being cameo rather than causal −0.4. Swappability moderate; interior monologue could replace. Final: consistent voice method, no tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting (abandoned control room) present throughout. Setup: immediate ("control room had been silent for seventeen years"). Development: console provides lever and red light (key turn enabler); space offers restoration goal. Payoff: Elena drafts plans on dusty floor in final beat. Setting pressures choice (bunker's survival enables restoration plan) and supplies resource (solar batteries). Spatial choreography clear. Early signal +0.7, two beats (lever-pull, floor drafting) +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.4 = ~11.2 range; minor reduction for some postcard description (monitors, dials) that does not alter tactics −0.4. Final: essential to plot and closure, strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Timeframe (during ice melting) present throughout. Setup: "Spring had finally reached the mountain bunker" in first paragraph. Development: melting ice signals urgency (roads passable, others might come) and enables restoration (batteries thaw). Payoff: "calving ice shelves" and "patient work" of water in ending. Time tightens decisions moderately; season change is backdrop more than live clock. Early signal +0.6, one beat (lever-pull enabled by thaw) +0.4, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +0.8, cost connection +0.3 = ~8.8 range; reduced for vague duration (no scene clock) −0.5, for time being atmospheric more than tactical constraint −0.6, and for seventeen-year gap being backstory anchor rather than present pressure −0.4. Final: strong atmospheric integration, modest tactical urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation (craft safe zones for inquiry) introduced early: "glass vessels... meant to contain volatile compounds, to create safe zones for inquiry." Setup clear. Development: shapes restoration plan (convert bunker into laboratory). Payoff: "safe walls for dangerous questions" in ending, sketches workstations. Desire is dramatized through actions (wiping console, pulling lever, drafting plans). Friction present: solitude comfort vs. community risk. Early signal +0.7, two beats (lever-pull, plan drafting) +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, cost +0.5 = ~10.3 range; reduced for told exposition in middle ("She wanted to build something different") rather than full enactment −0.6, and for friction being more declared than embodied in contradictory impulses −0.5. Swappability low; glassblowing metaphor ties to motivation. Final: strong integration, some telling over showing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Tone (weighty lightness) present throughout. Setup: self-narration device establishes playful frame ("dramatic pause") amid serious stakes. Development: modulates through grief (bookmark), hope (red light laugh), resolve. Payoff: "absurdity and beauty of beginning again" in final line balances weight and lightness. Coherent through turns; cadence shifts support pressure without static mood. Early signal +0.6, modulation across beats +0.8, closure linkage (final line charges image) +1.0, specificity +0.5 = ~8.9 range; reduced for occasional drift toward declarative seriousness that undercuts lightness ("abandoned his belief that humanity deserved to survive") −0.5, and for tone being more executed in voice than pressuring the closure stakes −0.4. Final: skillful tonal balance, charges ending with measured hope.</comment>
