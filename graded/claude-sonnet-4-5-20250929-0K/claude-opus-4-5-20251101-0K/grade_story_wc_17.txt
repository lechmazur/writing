<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clearly rooted and drives her choices through the discovery sequence. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between scientific cartographer and mystical dreamer, embodied in her choice to set aside sensors for diaries. However, the character arc resolves through realization rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost—she will "continue the cartography" without demonstrable alteration or renunciation. The grandmother's influence and Helena's mirror-work provide depth, but Mira's final stance feels like confirmation rather than transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal scaffolding. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph. The discovery sequence builds through layered reveals (diaries → film negative → sensor readings → final understanding) that reweight the opening question about what walls dream. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the realization that "walls did not dream of the past...they dreamed of exactly this moment," with conceptual cost visible in the burden of legacy Mira accepts. One meaningful deepening occurs when the film negative shows Helena's identical gesture, tightening the generational link and charging the final commitment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage functions as more than backdrop: the thick growth signals temporal distance from the climate shifts, the collapsed fireplace preserves the diaries, and filtered light enables examination of the film negative. The setting constrains discovery through physical access (pushing through curtains of green, extracting from ash and root systems) and the acoustic properties of stone anchor Mira's professional methodology. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—cool stone, vibrations, evening winds—filtered through her professional perception without catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding what walls dream about, signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the film negative reveals Helena's identical gesture, narrowing Mira's self-understanding and binding her to a multi-generational project with visible commitment cost ("she would continue the cartography"). The stake remains coherent under the accumulative lens as each artifact—diaries, negative, sensor readings—adds density rather than creating reversals. Agency appears in the choice to read, extract, and commit rather than merely document, though the escalation is more deepening than narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: walls as witnesses, the burden of legacy, consciousness persisting in what we build. The film negative and Helena's journals provide concrete anchors that avoid abstraction. The final image—"walls did not dream of the past...they dreamed of exactly this moment—of being understood at last"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stated moral. The piece resists tidy resolution by accepting burden alongside gift, and the sensory perception shared across generations (grandmother, Helena, Mira) creates thematic coherence without false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is clear in Mira's professional filter (vibrations dismissed by others, acoustic sensors, mapping terminology) blended with mystical receptivity. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("Legacy's burden settled on her shoulders like the weight of accumulated stone") that feels slightly imposed rather than character-organic during peak discovery beats. The narrative voice modulates appropriately between technical observation and wonder, though some phrases ("sensitively perceptive since childhood") tell rather than dramatize the trait through perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Information density is high in the discovery sequence where diaries, negative, and sensor data layer efficiently. Minor scaffold appears in parallel constructions ("Helena had been...Helena had written...Helena had given") that create slight momentum drag in the middle section. The opening and closing images are strong, particularly "Walls remembered" and the final dream reversal. Figurative language occasionally stacks ("living tunnels of green and shadow," "fossils in sediment," "weight of accumulated stone") but remains mostly coherent and voice-appropriate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The core synthesis—echo cartography as literal archaeology of sound, walls with embedded recording filaments, generational transmission of perceptual gifts—feels specific and purposeful rather than generic post-apocalyptic discovery. The film negative showing identical gesture provides a fresh inflection on legacy themes. However, the emotional arc (discovering predecessor's work, accepting inherited mission) follows a recognizable template, and the climate-shift frame functions primarily as backdrop rather than transforming the core material. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat, but the central pattern reads as competent execution of a moderately fresh concept rather than bold synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's profession frames the opening, enables the sensor reading climax, and provides vocabulary throughout ("acoustic memories," "echo cartographer," "recording filaments"). Her choice to set aside sensors for diaries creates one key turn, and the final decision to "continue the cartography" flows from professional and personal stakes converging. Present across all three gates with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The film negative appears mid-story in the fireplace discovery, is physically handled ("held it toward the filtered light"), reveals Helena's gesture in a beat that tightens Mira's understanding of legacy, and is tucked into her pack with closure significance ("alongside Helena's diaries"). Used in three distinct beats with clear causal pressure and closure linkage, though it could theoretically be replaced with another preserved artifact showing the same gesture.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Legacy's burden" is named explicitly, embodied in Helena's written phrase, dramatized through the sensor readings of accumulated voices, and reweighted in the final realization as "not burden alone—it was also gift." The concept shapes Mira's decision to continue the work and forecloses the path of simple documentation. Strong setup, development through Helena's phrase, and payoff in the gift/burden synthesis with felt cost of commitment.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The attribute is stated ("sensitively perceptive since childhood") and shown through Mira feeling vibrations others dismiss and understanding her grandmother's claims. However, it functions more as background explanation than active constraint—no visible tradeoff or cost emerges from this sensitivity in the present action. The trait enables perception but doesn't force difficult choices or create friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Glimpse" appears in the opening discovery ("glimpsed something that made her breath catch") and in the penultimate paragraph ("Tomorrow she would glimpse new corridors"). The first use triggers the diary discovery that drives the middle sequence; the second frames ongoing commitment. Present in setup and payoff with causal involvement, though the action itself is replaceable with "see" or "discover" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries in the fireplace are discovered early, extracted carefully, read to reveal Helena's philosophy, and provide the conceptual frame ("burden of legacy") that Mira resolves at closure. The method is specific (fire preserved some pages, destroyed others; the selection creates gaps) and shapes what Mira can learn. Mechanics matter: ash and debris require careful extraction, curled pages remain legible, the fireplace location ties to the collapsed archive structure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage structures the entire sequence: thick growth signals centuries of abandonment, curtains of green must be pushed through to reach the chamber, the collapsed fireplace preserves diaries in root systems, gaps in ivy allow light for examining the negative, and evening winds provide atmospheric closure. The setting's post-climate transformation is causally integrated (climate shifts drove humanity into megastructures, ivy reclaimed corridors), and the passage itself—once a government archive—justifies the presence of Helena's materials.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The climate shifts frame the entire world (reshaped coastlines, drove humanity into megastructures, explains ivy overgrowth and "centuries" of abandonment) and position Mira's profession as post-catastrophe necessity. Helena's work predates "the first major climate shifts," creating clear before/after structure. However, the timeframe functions primarily as backdrop context rather than creating immediate temporal pressure or constraining present choices—no ticking clock alters Mira's discovery tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The desire to "discover what walls dream about" is stated early, traced to grandmother's influence, pursued through sensor work, and answered in the climactic realization that walls "dreamed of exactly this moment—of being understood at last." The motivation creates friction between professional cartography and mystical seeking (she sets aside sensors for diaries) and drives the choice to continue the work. Desire is dramatized through physical actions (pressing palm, activating sensors, extracting diaries) with visible commitment cost at closure.</comment>
