<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's curiosity trait is asserted but not tested under pressure; her professional competence operates without visible struggle or cost. Margaret's emotional progression from decades of guilt to peace is compressed into one scene without dramatized resistance. The interiority relies on summary statements ("She was persistently curious by nature") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to "help wheel her back" lacks agency—Vera observes and translates but doesn't forfeit or risk anything on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraphs. The closure unit—Margaret's forgiveness releasing Ruth's pulse—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is told rather than shown: we're assured Margaret "can sleep" without witnessing what she has sacrificed or foreclosed. The Drive Lens is Situational (grief reaching breaking point summons the dead), yet the final beat resolves via off-stage emotional transaction. No Orientation Test penalty applied; the piece teaches its metaphysical premise early and holds spatial logic, but the closure effect remains asserted rather than dramatized with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The atrium is vividly rendered—mist pooling "like spilled milk," marble that "had witnessed a century of final breaths"—and the sanatorium history seeds the thin-space premise. However, the environment supplies atmosphere without constraining a choice: Vera's method works identically anywhere, and the fog never narrows her options. The hearing aid as micro-object shapes the method but doesn't evolve or complicate the action. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("reeling into something sacred"), but spatial choreography (fountain, wheelchair, room 412) remains postcard staging rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Margaret's need for forgiveness—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal: Vera listens, translates, and the pulse "softens" without reversal or complication. No tightening narrows Vera's options; the hearing aid works on first attempt, and Ruth's response is cooperative rather than conflicted. The phrase "incidental heroism" names the lack of agency: Vera "hadn't sought to save anyone" and becomes a bridge "without intending to." Closure arrives via告sentiment rather than a choice that forecloses a live path. One small deepening occurs when the pulse strengthens at "jealous" and "afraid," but this is observational rather than a turn driven by protagonist decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of incidental heroism and bridging the living/dead emerges through Vera's work rather than overt statement, and the final image of her "listening for the next signal" avoids moralizing. However, the thematic question—what it costs to protect vulnerable voices—is posed but not tested: Vera experiences no friction, renunciation, or price. The phrase "invisible work, the kind that left no record except in the hearts that finally found rest" is elegiac but borders on abstraction. The hearing aid as recurrence charges the method but doesn't shift meaning at closure. Subtext operates in Margaret's halting confession, yet the ending asserts peace rather than letting the image do non-literal work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Vera; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the atrium encounter, wider in the opening setup). Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "reeling into something sacred," "the dead call when grief reaches its breaking point." Margaret's dialogue ("They said you could help") carries naturalism and goal pursuit. Filter verbs ("Vera felt") appear but remain voice-motivated. One register slip: "electromagnetic echoes of the hearts that depended on them" reads slightly expository for Vera's lived interiority. No head-hopping; narrative certainty matches Vera's knowledge except for the assured claim that Ruth "went peacefully," which Vera infers but presents as fact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings avoid template runs. Information density is high in the setup (sanatorium history, Vera's method, Margaret's backstory compressed efficiently). Minor scaffold: "She was persistently curious by nature, which made her both effective and lonely" tells rather than shows the trait under pressure. The phrase "the thread between the sisters finally complete its circuit" mixes metaphors (thread/circuit). No loops or paraphrase cycles. Opening line anchors stakes and voice; final line recycles "listening" motif without fresh charge. Figurative language is controlled but occasionally stacks: "fog pooled like spilled milk," "edges had gone soft as cloth," "hush deepened, reeling into something sacred" within close proximity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—contact tracer for hearts using a hearing aid to detect pulses of the dead—offers a fresh metaphysical frame, and the sanatorium-turned-assisted-living setting is specific. However, the emotional arc (decades-old guilt resolved through mediated conversation) follows a familiar template, and Vera's competence without struggle or moral calculus flattens the synthesis. The phrase "incidental heroism" names the concept rather than transforming it through grounded choice. "Persistently curious by nature" and "invisible work" read as prompt-adjacent abstractions. The proximity to paranormal-romance conventions (gifted mediator, forgiving ghost, peaceful closure) is executed cleanly but not subverted. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece operates safely within its genre.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Vera appears throughout and her role as contact tracer frames the premise, satisfying setup and development gates. However, her choices are observational (placing the hearing aid, translating pulses) rather than decision-pressure that narrows options. She "hadn't sought to save anyone" and becomes a bridge "without intending to"—the text explicitly disclaims agency. At closure, she walks away "already listening," a return to baseline rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Functional but replaceable: another mediator with a different method would serve identically.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The photograph appears in three beats: Margaret clutching it at the fountain, described ("two women on a beach, arms linked"), and released in her lap after forgiveness. Setup and payoff gates satisfied; middle development is static (it remains in her hands without altering tactics). The release signals emotional shift but the photograph itself doesn't constrain a choice or charge the final image—it's a prop for Margaret's arc rather than an active force. Causal role is secondary to the hearing aid; swappable with another keepsake (letter, ring) without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Incidental heroism is named explicitly in the final third: "This was incidental heroism, Vera knew. She hadn't sought to save anyone tonight." It frames Vera's stance but doesn't shape on-page stakes—Vera's method and Margaret's need drive the plot regardless of whether the heroism is incidental or intentional. The concept appears as thematic label rather than constraint or tactic. Missing middle development; closure mentions it but doesn't dramatize a cost tied to the incidental nature. Present and thematically consistent, but replaceable: the story functions identically if Vera's work is deliberate rather than incidental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Curiosity is asserted in one sentence ("She was persistently curious by nature, which made her both effective and lonely") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. Vera's decision to kneel, listen, and translate doesn't arise from curiosity testing her limits—she's already certain of her method. The trait is told as background rather than dramatized under pressure. Missing middle development and closure participation; the attribute exists as character summary without visible tradeoff. Late label (appears after the 20% mark as exposition) and ornamental use lower the score further.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Assure" appears twice: Vera tells Margaret "She's here" and later "She understands... She's been waiting." These moments shift Margaret's emotional state from desperation to confession to peace, driving the middle and closure beats. The action is causal—without Vera's assurance, Margaret might not speak her apology—and it appears at the pivotal turn. However, the assurance is reactive translation rather than a choice with cost: Vera reports what the pulse signals, and the hearing aid's cooperative response makes the assurance effortless. Swappability test: another verb (translate, confirm, relay) fits nearly as well, suggesting mid-high integration rather than indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hearing aid method is introduced early (Vera "had discovered her method by accident... certain devices retained impressions") and used in the key middle beat (she places it against her ear, hears Ruth's pulse). Setup and development gates satisfied; it shapes the encounter's mechanics and appears at closure when it "had gone silent." However, the method faces no friction—it works on first attempt, the pulse responds cooperatively, and no alternative tactic is needed. The mechanics (electromagnetic echoes, pulse patterns) are explained rather than tested under constraint. Causal role in two beats, but the hearing aid could be replaced by another object (watch, necklace) with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The atrium is established immediately ("mist-clad atrium at twilight") and returns in the final paragraph (Vera alone among ferns and fog). Tone contribution is strong: the haze, marble, sanatorium bones create the thin-space atmosphere. However, the setting supplies mood without constraining choice—Vera's method works identically in any location, and the fog/fountain/wheelchair positioning is choreographic rather than tactical. The atrium doesn't pressure Margaret's confession or alter Vera's options. Lyric early-to-final reprise reweights the dominant stake slightly (Vera's solitary work in liminal spaces), lifting the score into mid-band, but missing middle development and causal pressure cap higher reach.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"When the dead call" timeframe is signaled in the opening ("Tonight, the call had come") and governs the premise: grief summons contact. However, time operates as background condition rather than live clock—no urgency tightens Vera's or Margaret's choices, and the encounter unfolds without temporal pressure. The phrase "when the living finally learned how to listen" recurs at closure but as thematic echo rather than stake reweighting. Missing middle development (time doesn't narrow options mid-scene) and the timeframe is swappable (the story functions identically if set "when loneliness peaks" or another trigger). Present in setup and referenced at payoff, but ornamental to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation "to protect vulnerable voices" is stated late (final third: "protecting the voices too faint to protect themselves") rather than dramatized through conflicted choice. The desire is coherent with her actions (translating Ruth's pulse, helping Margaret), satisfying functional presence, but it's told as summary rather than tested under pressure. No friction between this want and a competing cost—Vera's work succeeds without sacrifice or moral calculus. Missing setup (not signaled in opening paragraphs) and middle development (the motivation doesn't shape a tactical decision). Closure reference is ornamental; the phrase appears in reflection rather than driving the final image or action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reeling hush" tone is established in the opening (atrium "held its breath," fog pooled, marble remembered "final breaths") and sustained through the encounter ("The atrium's hush deepened, reeling into something sacred"). The tone modulates appropriately: quiet observation during setup, sacred intensity during Margaret's confession, solitary calm at closure. It charges the final image (Vera in thickening mist, "already listening") and coheres across turns without static repetition. One slight register slip: "electromagnetic echoes" reads technical against the lyric hush, but recovers quickly. The tone is intrinsic to the metaphysical premise and would fail if replaced by, say, clinical clarity or urgent dread, demonstrating strong irreplaceability.</comment>
