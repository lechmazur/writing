<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Erasmus is rendered through concrete particulars—his patient observation of cormorants, the leather pouch ritual, the nightly walks—that give him texture and motive. The internal contradiction between his solitary fluency in dead languages and his commitment to a decades-long garden project creates authentic tension. Micro-choices (selecting vetch pods, crushing them at the prescribed hour) reveal hierarchy of values. The final stance—continuing until "the battlefield bloomed or he joined the reef"—is earned by prior causality and forecloses retreat with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Erasmus stands alone on the blooming jetty, "tending a garden that existed mostly in the future," with the cost undeniable in his isolation and the open-ended commitment. The accumulative lens is taught early (reef's dissolution → flower growth → seed dispersal ritual) and held through the final image, which reweights the opening phosphorescent flowers and seed collection. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first two paragraphs. One meaningful deepening occurs when the reef's generous decay feeds resurrection, shifting the stake from mere ritual to ecological resurrection with visible cost (his years, his solitude, the uncertain outcome).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The blooming jetty functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: phosphorescent flowers on every plank create the visual and conceptual anchor for the garden-in-waiting. The glowing water, rusted wire, shattered stone at the headland, and the subsurface currents the birds describe all constrain Erasmus's choices (timing, seed selection, drop point). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: he notices nitrogen content, mineral deposits, temperature gradients—a gardener's and linguist's hierarchy. The jetty's "narrow vastness" recurs and tightens meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resurrect the battlefield through patient ecological intervention—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening: the reef's death releases nutrients that enable unprecedented growth, reframing the project from symbolic gesture to practical possibility and raising the cost of failure. Agency is enacted through nightly seed dispersal, species rotation, and the choice to continue "until the battlefield bloomed or he joined the reef," foreclosing retreat. Pressure accumulates through the birds' predictions, the visible new shoots each morning, and the open-ended timeframe. The resolution is earned by Erasmus's persistent micro-choices under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—death on immense scale creating conditions for unprecedented growth—emerges through reef dissolution, phosphorescent flowers, battlefield reclamation, and Erasmus's patient seed ritual without overt statement. The final image offers a resonant answer: the coachman "fluent in languages of the dead, tending a garden that existed mostly in the future" reweights prior material (the dead reef, the mass grave, the extinct village) as generative loss rather than mere absence. Subtext operates in the cormorant's "stones grinding underwater" and the heron's "wind through broken windows." The piece resists false equivalence—war's destruction is not redeemed, only slowly metabolized by green things.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: elevated diction ("blooming jetty," "narrow vastness," "submerged concord") matches Erasmus's linguist mind and sustains pressure without drift. Focalization remains stable third-limited; his perceptual signature filters setting through linguistic and botanical priorities (guttural consonants, nitrogen content, seed rotation). Psychic distance tightens at closure. No dialogue; all interaction occurs through bird calls rendered as "stones grinding underwater" and "wind through broken windows," maintaining voice coherence. Purposeful compression (three years collapsed into "not since the reef died") and patterned elision (the war, the village's extinction) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (the opening line establishes time, place, Erasmus's role, and the phosphorescent anomaly). Rhythm varies purposefully; longer accumulative sentences ("Calcium, phosphorus, the accumulated life...") contrast with short declarative beats ("Each evening he performed this ritual"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor filter-verb presence ("he had learned," "he watched") does not dull immediacy given the reflective mode. The phrase "narrow vastness" recurs three times but earns its reprise by charging the final image. One small slip: "resurrection it would never witness" edges toward summary-tell where image would suffice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—dead-language fluency enabling cross-species negotiation to reclaim a WWI battlefield via reef nutrients—is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of familiar tropes (lone survivor, ecological restoration, interspecies communication) through Sumerian bird-speech and the reef's generous decay feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (no human dialogue, protagonist as gardener-linguist, closure as open-ended commitment) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor dock: the "war → battlefield → garden" arc echoes template redemption narratives, though the piece particularizes it through coral chemistry and avian semiotics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening sentence; frames all beats. His choice to crush vetch pods "at this hour, in this season" and continue "until the battlefield bloomed or he joined the reef" drives the closure unit and forecloses retreat with visible cost (isolation, indefinite commitment). Causal across three beats: nightly walks, seed selection informed by bird calls, dispersal ritual. Closure participation: the final image centers his stance. Cost tied to character: his years, his solitude, the garden "that existed mostly in the future."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Signaled early ("leather pouch...thirty-seven varieties"). Used in two distinct beats: mid-scene when he opens the pouch and selects vetch, and implicitly in the rotation ("tomorrow...the clover pods, then the thistle"). Returns with reweighted meaning at closure: the collection embodies his methodical long-term project and the "promise of something green rising from ground that had drunk too much blood." Causal: the pods' contents enable the battlefield's reclamation. Specific cost: choosing the right species at the right time determines success or failure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Signaled late (the phrase "submerged concord" appears only in the final third). Shapes one key turn: "maintaining a concord that predated human memory" frames the birds as participants in an ancient system, raising the stakes of Erasmus's participation. Payoff at closure: the final line invokes "submerged concord with a world still learning to speak," reweighting the entire bird-communication project as reconnection to a pre-human order. Not causal in middle beats; functions primarily as thematic anchor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Present from paragraph two; taught through specificity (Sumerian for cormorants, Akkadian for terns, Linear B for herons). Enables two beats: asking about nitrogen content and water chemistry, confirming tomorrow's clover rotation. Causal pressure: without this ability, Erasmus cannot predict currents or time seed release. Cost: the text implies years of "patient observation" to learn the languages. Closure linkage: the final image emphasizes "fluent in languages of the dead," foregrounding this trait as the pivot of his entire project. Irreplaceable; the story hinges on this exact skill.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Signaled early (paragraph five: "how he would fertilize the battlefield"). Central to two beats: crushing vetch pods and releasing seeds into the glowing water, then the rotation plan (clover, thistle). Defines the closure: "tending a garden that existed mostly in the future" reweights the action as patient, uncertain work with no guarantee. Causal: the fertilization depends on reef nutrients, bird-predicted currents, and seasonal timing. Cost: years or decades with no assured outcome. Not swappable; the story's logic collapses without this exact action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Taught early (paragraph three: "noting how they tilted their heads...how they responded with specific calls"). Mechanics matter: the birds map subsurface currents, temperature gradients, and "precise conditions each seed required," enabling Erasmus to time and place his dispersals. Shapes two beats: the mid-scene cormorant exchange about nitrogen and the heron's confirmation of tomorrow's rotation. Causal pressure: without bird-call fluency, the garden project is guesswork. Closure: the final image's "carrying news of seeds and tides to whatever listened beneath the darkening waves" underscores this method as the story's hinge. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Present from the opening line; the jetty's phosphorescent flowers and weathered rails anchor every beat. Constrains choices: Erasmus releases seeds "into the glowing water" at a specific hour because "the terns had told him where the current would carry seeds." The jetty as platform enables the ritual and charges the final image: he stands "alone on the blooming jetty," the glow intensifying as darkness falls. Micro-setting that alters tactics (timing, drop point). The twilight timing matters causally (current patterns shift with the light).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Signaled in paragraph one ("not since the reef died") and reinforced in paragraph six ("The reef's death had released something"). Shapes one key turn: the reef's dissolution supplies the calcium and phosphorus that enable the phosphorescent flowers and, by extension, the garden project. The temporal anchor "after the reef dies" defines the new chemistry and ecological possibility. Closure linkage: "the dead reef continued its slow dissolution, feeding a resurrection it would never witness." Not a live clock, but the aftermath tightens the project's logic and charges the generative-loss theme.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dramatized from paragraph one (nightly walks, seed dispersal ritual) and paragraph five ("This was how he would fertilize the battlefield"). Friction arises on-page: the garden "would take years to fully establish, perhaps decades," yet "time had become irrelevant," a contradiction that reveals Erasmus's acceptance of the cost. The motivation shapes the closure choice: continuing "until the battlefield bloomed or he joined the reef" forecloses retreat. Visible cost: isolation, indefinite commitment, the garden existing "mostly in the future." Not told-only; enacted through ritual and micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Coherent from the opening ("narrow vastness of the twilight sea") through the final image. Modulates with pressure: the glowing jetty and dissolving reef create expansive constraint, phosphorescence framing infinite process within planks and pilings. The oxymoron "narrow vastness" recurs three times, charging the final image: Erasmus's solitary stance on the jetty evokes boundless patience compressed into nightly ritual. The tone supports the accumulative lens and the theme of generative loss. Not static; the glow intensifies as darkness falls, tightening the mood at closure.</comment>
