<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Selene's interiority is vivid and her motivation clear, but Kira's arc feels rushed—her transformation from hollow to anchored lacks intermediate micro-choices that would show internal contradiction under pressure. The phrase "particular starvation of someone forbidden from her own purpose" reads slightly diagnostic. Selene's choices drive the ceremony, but Kira's hesitance-to-commitment happens in a single beat without visible struggle, reducing the earned quality of her final smile.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The closure lands on the page—Kira is transformed, the cosmic verse gleams, and the cost (permanent exile from the provinces) is stated and felt. The drive lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the ritual follows because/therefore logic while the final image reweights "exile as homecoming." One friction: the escalation from Kira's arrival to her transformation compresses too quickly, eliding the intermediate struggle that would deepen the tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The twilight garden is vivid and tonally consistent—"starlight pooled like spilled mercury," obsidian pillars, jasmine. The moonstone dust and stylus function as micro-setting objects that constrain the ritual's execution. The garden's position "at the edge of the world, beyond the Magisters' reach" directly enables the forbidden choreography and charges the closure image of dancing "until dawn threatened." Sensory detail is filtered through Selene's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Kira's choice to become permanently anchored and exiled—is clear and present from her arrival. The tightening occurs when Selene warns "you will never belong to the provinces again either" and Kira extends her arm without hesitation, foreclosing the path back. However, this single pivot feels thin; the story would benefit from one additional complication or micro-reversal during the ritual itself to test Kira's commitment under immediate physical or emotional cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory as resistance, exile as homecoming, embodiment against erasure—emerges organically from action and image rather than statement. The cosmic verses as "unburnable, unbanning, eternal" offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the nostalgia ban without moralizing. The final image (dancing forbidden history, verses gleaming) reweights prior material cleanly. One slip: "They can ban memories, but they cannot ban the ocean" borders on thematic echo, though it's delivered in scene and tied to the immediate situation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Selene with clean focalization. Perceptual signature is distinct—"observing gaps," motion-as-mathematics, tide-dancer idiom. Dialogue feels natural and advances plot; Kira's lines carry subtext (hunger, desperation). One friction: the phrase "spontaneously anchored to the cosmic rhythm" reads slightly expository and could be more concretely embodied. Diction remains mostly within voice, though "cosmic alphabet" leans slightly elevated for the moment's immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Opening and closing images are strong. However, several figurative constructions in the opening paragraph ("obsidian grace," "starlight pooled like spilled mercury," "ocean's breath") cluster without clear pattern-teaching, creating mild overwriting. The phrase "child she had been and the dancer she might become" paraphrases the prior "spaces between certainty and fear, between training and instinct" without adding new pressure. One minor loop: "The cosmic verses gleamed" in the final paragraph echoes prior mentions without fresh charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of memory ban, tide dancing, and body-inscription offers a fresh synthesis. The story commits fully to its lyric-ritual premise. However, the central turn—forbidden art preserved through exile, student seeks master—follows a recognizable template. The "nostalgia ban" and memory-as-contraband provide a distinctive world detail, but the emotional arc (hollow → filled, exile → homecoming) resolves into familiar territory without a non-obvious inflection that would elevate originality into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Selene's tide-dancer skill shapes two key beats: observing Kira's gaps to assess readiness, then executing the cosmic verse choreography that transforms her. The skill is present in setup (seven seasons of exile practice), development (precise assessment), and closure (dancing together). Her expertise directly enables the ritual and charges the final image. The element is irreplaceable—generic "teacher" would not carry the same embodied, motion-based logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The moonstone dust appears in three beats: Selene withdraws it, explains its binding function, and mixes it to create the ink. It constrains the ritual (last essence from burned temples) and ties to the closure stakes (permanent anchoring). However, its presence in the final image is not charged—the verses gleam, but the dust itself is not reprised or reweighted. Swappability is low (the lunar-temple provenance matters), but closure linkage is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elective exile frames Selene's entire stance and reappears at closure ("choosing exile as homecoming"). It shapes the garden's location (beyond Magisters' reach), her waiting posture, and the ritual's permanent cost for Kira. The concept anchors the dominant stake and is indispensable to the story's thematic logic: remove it and both the setup (why Selene is here) and the closure (Kira's transformation into permanent outsider) collapse.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Spontaneously anchored" describes the ritual's effect—permanent connection to tides and moons—and is central to the transformation. It appears in setup (Selene's own marked arms suggest prior anchoring) and is explained as the verse's consequence. However, the trait is told rather than dramatized: we don't see Kira experience the anchoring's immediate constraint or cost on the page. The final paragraph's "depths where there had been hollowness" implies the change, but the anchoring's mechanics remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Fledge" is introduced early ("You've come to fledge") and returned at closure ("You are fledged"). It frames Kira's transformation from hollow to dancer and ties to the bird-testing-wings image. The action is thematic rather than physical, which reduces its causal weight—Kira doesn't perform a distinct "fledging" gesture. However, the metaphor coheres across the arc and charges the final teaching moment, making it difficult to swap without loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"By observing gaps" is stated early ("By observing gaps, Selene had always found truth") and applied once to assess Kira's readiness. The method is not shown constraining the ritual itself or shaping the final image. It reads more as character note than active mechanic. The concept is present and plausible, but could be replaced with generic "assessment" without breaking the plot. Missing middle development and closure participation cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The twilight garden anchors the setting throughout: obsidian pillars frame Kira's entrance, cold stones ground Selene's dance, jasmine and starlight charge the atmosphere. It enables the forbidden choreography (beyond Magisters' reach) and appears in the closure ("together they wrote forbidden history across the stones"). The garden is irreplaceable—its position and features directly constrain and charge the action. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The nostalgia ban is present in setup (backstory, Selene's exile cause) and frames the stakes (memory as contraband). It shapes Kira's hollow state and the ritual's permanent cost. However, the timeframe "after" is static—there's no dramatized enforcement pressure or ticking clock within the scene itself. The ban functions as premise rather than active complication. Its presence is necessary but does not tighten decisions in the present action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The desire to pen cosmic verse is Kira's stated goal ("I heard you write on skin"), Selene's ritual action (inscribing with silver stylus), and the closure's visual proof (verses gleaming). The motivation is dramatized through Kira's choice to extend her arm and tested by Selene's warning of permanent exile. The want generates visible cost and ties directly to the final image. The element drives at least two beats and is indispensable to the transformation arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Obsidian grace" is present in the opening line and recurs in the garden's obsidian pillars, creating a visual-tonal motif. Tone is consistent—lyric, ceremonial, weighted—and modulates under pressure (the ritual's intensity, Kira's gasp). The final image's "gleaming" verses and dancing-until-dawn carry the established grace forward. However, "obsidian" as descriptor feels slightly ornamental in some uses. The tone charges the closure but does not constrain a choice, placing it in the high-mid band.</comment>
