<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's interior is concrete and embodied through physical traces (chalk dust on fingers, chest tightening). His contradictory impulses—the compulsion to document what he will forget versus the mercy of forgetting—are rendered in scene rather than summary. The micro-choices (photographing the markings, gathering driftwood) carry visible cost and reflect his hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of certainty feels earned, though the precognitive mechanism itself remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: Marcus, fog sculpture garden, present morning with a task. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece deepens through layered images (chalk wearing down, fog sculptures shifting, driftwood trail) that converge at the stone map. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marcus understands why prophecies erase themselves and accepts the mercy of forgetting with visible cost—he photographs knowing it will corrupt. The escalation is a meaningful tightening via density increase, and the cost is legible in the final image of returning empty-handed with only ghost dust.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden is vivid and purposeful: shifting fog caught in invisible nets, driftwood as salt-bleached markers, flat stone at center. The environment constrains Marcus's search and supplies the material (driftwood, stone) for his method. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through his urgency. The fog lifting at the end charges the closure by making the sculptures dissolve into ordinary mist, mirroring his forgetting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: locate something important before the fog lifts. The tightening occurs when Marcus completes the chalk map and sees the shape of all future partings—a deepening that reweights his understanding of his gift. His agency is present in the micro-choices (arranging driftwood, drawing with chalk) and the final renunciation (photographing knowing it will fail). The cost is visible: he loses the chalk stub and returns empty-handed, his prophecy already slipping away.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the chalk wearing down, fog sculptures dissolving, the corrupted photograph. The core question—whether capturing time's passage is bearable—is answered non-literally through the map of partings and the mercy of forgetting. The final image (ghost of chalk dust, ache of something beautiful forgotten) offers resonant repricing without moralizing. The metaphor of unwatched videotapes and the mother's closet add texture without forcing the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and apt; Marcus's perceptual signature is distinct (he notices echoes, residues, the texture of visions). The prose carries a lyric cadence that modulates with emotional intensity without becoming opaque. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. The diction remains within Marcus's plausible lexicon (junkyard prophet, precognitively forgetful) and the syntax reflects his mind under pressure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines ("Each piece...creating a path" / "The method felt right") that restate without added pressure, triggering −0.2. Figurative language is purposeful (fog as living things, time as unwatched videotapes) without muddle. No loops or template cadence runs in peak beats. Propulsion is steady through the chalk-drawing sequence to the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise (precognitive amnesia) is fresh and the transformation is specific: prophecies that erase themselves as mercy rather than curse. The fog sculpture garden and chalk-as-method are particular to this voice and world. The turn (understanding why forgetting is mercy) feels earned in hindsight. The risk—centering a story on a protagonist who forgets his own visions—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The emotional specificity (tidal longing, grief of familiarity) avoids generic templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus frames the story, makes the choice to follow the driftwood trail, draws the chalk map, and accepts the mercy of forgetting. His decisions create the key turns: arranging markers, completing the map, photographing it knowing it will corrupt. He appears in setup, middle, and closure. Causal pressure is present but moderate—his choices enable rather than force the revelation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Chalk is present early (stub in pocket), used in two distinct beats (carrying it, drawing the map), and central to closure (wears down to nothing as he writes). It signals his practice, constrains the map's completion, and its exhaustion charges the final image. Cost is visible: when the chalk is gone, the visions might stop. Irreplaceability is high—the worn stub carries history and the prophecy depends on its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept shapes stakes on the page: Marcus clings to echoes (chalk dust, chest tightening, driftwood trail) to follow what he's forgotten. It structures his method and constrains his tactics. The concept is dramatized through action (following vibrations like a deaf man, photographing knowing it will corrupt) rather than merely stated. It participates in closure when he chooses to photograph despite knowing the futility.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The trait is established early and constrains multiple actions: he must use driftwood markers because he forgets the path, must photograph knowing he'll lose it, cannot remember whose funeral he attended. The tradeoff is visible—he gains visions but loses their content immediately. The trait enables the central irony (prophecies erase themselves as mercy) and is causally active at closure when he feels the vision slip away.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The action ("locate something") drives the opening stake, structures the middle search (driftwood trail), and is completed when he finds/creates the chalk map. The major turn traces to this action: locating leads to understanding why prophecies erase. Swappable with "discover" or "find" with minor edits, so mid-band. It shapes two beats but could be more irreplaceable in its mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (driftwood as directional markers), its mechanics matter (each piece points to the next, creating a path his forgotten self mapped), and it shapes his attempt to reach the garden's center. He gathers the markers at the end, already unsure why he arranged them—closure linkage is present. The method constrains his search and enables the discovery. Cost is moderate: the method succeeds but leaves no lasting memory.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The garden is present in setup, supplies the fog sculptures that shift and dissolve (mirroring Marcus's forgetting), provides the stone for the chalk map, and its fog lifting at closure marks the end of the vision window. The setting pressures the choice (before the fog lifts) and charges the final image (sculptures fade into ordinary mist). The invisible nets and driftwood are specific resources that alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe appears as texture ("hush of old videotapes left unwatched," mother's closet of home movies, accumulating unwatched hours) and motivates his desire to capture the sound of growing older. It's present in reflection and shapes his emotional stance but does not create a live ticking clock that alters on-page decisions. The fog lifting provides urgency but is not tightly linked to the videotape metaphor. Lyric resonance is present but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation is dramatized: Marcus wants to "capture the sound of growing older, to hold it in his hands and examine it before it, too, forgot itself." This desire drives his funeral attendance, his search in the garden, and his decision to photograph the map. Friction between the want (to capture) and the cost (unbearable knowledge) is present and shapes the closure realization. The motivation crystallizes three weeks ago and is active across beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tidal longing is coherent throughout: the grief of familiarity, ache of something beautiful forgotten, yearning implicit in following echoes. The tone modulates appropriately—calm in the garden search, intensifies during the chalk drawing, softens to melancholy at the end. It charges the final image ("carrying nothing but the ghost of chalk dust...and the ache of something beautiful, forgotten") without becoming static or overwrought.</comment>
