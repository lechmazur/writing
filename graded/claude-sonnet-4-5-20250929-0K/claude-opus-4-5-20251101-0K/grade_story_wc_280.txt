<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Madeline's interiority is consistently filtered through her synesthetic perception (applause as "crimson and gold"), creating a character-specific lens. Her motivation to help the woman is grounded in remembered parallel experience ("she had seen it in mirrors during her mortal years"). However, the woman remains passive throughout—she gasps, watches, studies the coin—without making a meaningful choice that alters her state, weakening the relationship-as-crucible test. The ghost's agency drives all beats, but the lack of a two-way pressure exchange or visible cost in Madeline's decision caps the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (ghost, orchard, twilight) land within the opening. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Madeline weaves temporal echoes that build rising nostalgia and reweight the woman's stance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the woman's shift from despair to possibility, visible in her straightened posture and "pale green and silver" rhythm), and the cost is legible—Madeline accepts she will never receive applause but finds purpose in this recursive performance. One tightening (the woman's grip loosening, shoulders straightening) is sufficient at this length. Minor penalty: the woman's transformation happens largely off-stage in reaction rather than through an on-page choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard/maze setting is vivid and purposeful: "sacred ground" where "years had twisted back upon themselves" enables Madeline's magic. Sensory detail is filtered through synesthetic POV ("words tasting of copper and pine"). The apple tree functions as micro-setting, recurring from 1721 to present and charging the final image. Spatial choreography (woman beneath tree, ghost descending, voices drifting through leaves) remains clear. The maze's liminal hour—twilight after tours end—creates atmospheric constraint that allows the ghost to "taste the living world again," directly enabling the plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Madeline seeks to "lure possibility from the brink of despair." The woman's despair radiates in "deep indigo waves," establishing the problem. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woman's grip on the tarot coin loosens and her shoulders straighten—a visible shift in posture under the accumulative pressure of the echoes. However, escalation is driven entirely by Madeline's uncontested action; the woman never resists, complicates, or makes a choice that raises cost. The resolution feels granted rather than earned through the woman's agency, and no visible price is paid by either character beyond Madeline's acceptance that "applause would never return."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: crossroads as possibility rather than endings, performance as ongoing gift, encores found in helping others. The tarot coin image recurs with reweighted meaning ("not endings. Never endings"). Madeline's final acceptance—"this, she decided, was close enough"—offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a moral. Nostalgia accumulates from layered timelines (1721, 1892, 1956) and charges the ending. Minor penalty: the woman's transformation verges on convenient—she receives wisdom without on-page struggle—and the thematic statement "The coin shows crossroads, not endings" borders on direct articulation, though Madeline's whisper operates at a liminal register.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third limited to Madeline; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: synesthesia colors all observation ("crimson and gold," "deep indigo," "pale green and silver"), and diction stays within a theatrical register ("encore-seeking," "curtain call," "crescendo"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at key beats ("The ghost descended, drawn by purpose older than memory"). The woman's unspoken interiority is respected—we see only her visible reactions. Free indirect style is clean. Minor strain: "producing echoes" reads slightly abstract for Madeline's concrete sensory filter, and the phrase "to lure possibility from the brink of despair" edges toward elevated diction that a centuries-old performer might use but risks register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively: short declaratives ("But tonight, something shifted") alternate with longer lyric cadences. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("shoulders curved inward like parentheses," "timeline spiraled like a tangle of silver threads"). However, scaffold and template patterns appear: "She had been... Now she was..." and "the moment before X" constructions recur. Paraphrase loop: "tragic could transform, that endings could become beginnings" and "crossroads, not endings" restate the same thematic point. The phrase "rising nostalgia" appears as a label rather than being fully dramatized through rhythm. These artifacts cluster in thematic beats and dull momentum slightly, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ghost-helping-living premise is familiar, but the synesthetic lens and fractured-timeline mechanic offer a fresh angle. The theatrical past (performers among apple trees) is specific and purposeful. However, the emotional arc—grief transformed by supernatural intervention—follows a well-worn template, and the woman's passive reception of wisdom limits originality. The tarot coin and orchard setting feel chosen to fit prompt elements rather than arising organically from character need. The ending's quiet acceptance is earned but not surprising. Transformation test: swap the ghost for a wise stranger and the orchard for any liminal space, and the emotional arc works largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Madeline appears in the opening, drives all middle beats (descending, weaving echoes, whispering), and shapes the ending through her acceptance and decision to return. Her choice to help creates the turn in the woman's posture and her final realization charges the closure image. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Cost is present but oblique—she accepts the applause will never return but finds "close enough" purpose. Minor penalty: her decision to act faces no visible obstacle or trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The coin is introduced early (woman "turning it over in trembling fingers"), returns at mid-beat ("She lifted the coin to the fading light, studying its painted figure anew"), and is mentioned in the final third. However, it functions primarily as a symbolic trigger rather than a constraint—the woman never makes a choice about the coin itself, and its mechanics (showing "a figure balanced between towers") are described but not used. The coin signals theme but does not enable or constrain an on-page action. Two touches but ornamental use and swappability (any object of contemplation could serve) limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fractured timeline is signaled early ("time here did not flow in a single direction") and enables Madeline's method: pulling scenes from 1721, 1892, 1956 to create overlapping echoes. It constrains her tactics—she can only work this magic in the orchard where "years had twisted back upon themselves." The concept drives the middle beat (intertwining timelines) and charges the ending (Madeline will return to this recursive stage). Causal pressure is strong, and the concept is irreplaceable—remove it and the plot mechanism collapses. Cost is implied: Madeline remains trapped in loops, and her magic depends on this specific spatial-temporal condition.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Synesthesia is introduced in the opening ("applause in colors—great swells of crimson and gold"), used to describe the woman's despair ("deep indigo waves"), applied to Thomas's words ("tasting of copper and pine"), and charges the final image ("pale green and silver—the colors of growing things"). It shapes Madeline's perceptual filter throughout. However, it never constrains a choice or imposes a visible cost—it enriches description but does not alter tactics. The trait is character-specific and consistent but remains primarily atmospheric. One gate (payoff) is met strongly; setup and development are present but lack causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Intertwine" is signaled mid-story ("The scenes began to intertwine, voices overlapping in harmonies") and directly causes the woman's shift—the overlapping echoes create the crescendo that loosens her grip and straightens her posture. The action is irreplaceable: Madeline weaves multiple timelines together to create cumulative pressure. It drives the key turn and is present in the ending's recursive promise ("she would return to this stage"). However, it appears somewhat late (past the 40% mark as the named action) and is partly summarized rather than dramatized in specific sensory moves. Strong closure linkage and causal pressure elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("By producing echoes, she began to work her strange magic") and mechanics are detailed: pulling scenes from 1721, creating voices that drift through trees, layering timelines. It enables the middle beat (the woman watches transfixed as echoes intertwine) and shapes the ending (Madeline will produce echoes for future visitors). The method constrains her tactics—she can only help through this specific temporal manipulation—and is irreplaceable. Strong setup, development through beats, and payoff. Cost is implicit: she remains bound to this recursive performance. Minor penalty: the mechanics of echo-production could be slightly more tactile in execution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The orchard is introduced early ("mystic orchard garden concealed within the maze's heart"), its history detailed (former theater among apple trees), and its sacred-ground property enables the fractured timeline. The apple tree anchors three beats (woman sitting beneath it, Madeline's 1721 memory at "this very spot," final paragraph "beneath the apple tree as stars emerged"). The maze creates spatial constraint (visitors get lost, liminal space after tours end). Setting supplies the resource (temporal overlay) that makes Madeline's magic possible. Strong setup and payoff; middle development is present but the maze itself could be more actively used in navigation or choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Timeframe is signaled immediately ("after the estate's garden tours ended, when the last visitors had shuffled away and twilight claimed the grounds. This was her hour") and establishes constraint—Madeline can only manifest when reality is "thin enough." The timeframe creates urgency in the opening and recurs in the ending promise ("Tomorrow night, after the tours ended, she would return"). However, it does not tighten decisions within the main beat—the encounter with the woman unfolds without time pressure. The temporal window enables the scene but does not narrow options once Madeline begins working. Setup and payoff strong; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation is established early through recognition: Madeline sees the woman's despair-posture and remembers "mirrors during her mortal years, during the dark season when she had nearly walked away from the stage forever." The desire drives her descent ("drawn by purpose older than memory") and shapes her method ("to show audiences that tragedy could transform"). It's tested in the middle (she weaves echoes to lure possibility) and reaffirmed in the ending (she accepts this recursive helping as "close enough"). The motivation is specific and character-rooted. Minor penalty: it faces no friction—Madeline encounters no obstacle or cost when choosing to act, and the woman's passive reception makes the luring feel convenient rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Nostalgia is established in the opening ("applause had faded three hundred years ago"), built through layered timelines (1721, 1892, 1956, "every soul who had ever found hope in this hidden place"), and crescendos explicitly ("Rising nostalgia flooded the orchard...like the moment before an audience rises to its feet"). The tone charges the final image: Madeline's acceptance that helping is "close enough" to applause. However, "rising nostalgia" is stated as a label rather than fully embodied through rhythm and image in every beat. The tone modulates with accumulative pressure and coheres through turns. Strong setup and payoff; middle could trust sensory accumulation more than declaration.</comment>
