<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's interior voice is distinctive and consistent—"the irony was professionally thorough" carries her vocational lens effectively. The transformation arc is motivated (three days ago inhaling the petal cracked her numbness), but the final state feels declared rather than dramatically tested: "affectionate detachment" and "caring for her clients while releasing them" arrive as thesis statements without visible friction or cost in action. Embodied emotion is strong in moments ("genuine tears, not the glycerin drops"), yet the chemist's embedded "compassion for her" reads as convenient omniscience—how does molecular structure whisper intent?—and the epiphany slides toward therapeutic self-awareness without messy contradiction acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean early (amber grotto, Vera, counterfeit dealer, dusk). The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Vera will continue dealing but now "differently," carrying amber dusk as proof she can feel—and the cost is present: she renounces clinical distance, accepts permeability. One meaningful deepening occurs (inhaling the petal fully transforms her defenses). The chemist's message "You are not too far gone" functions as conceptual permission rather than causal pressure, softening the turn slightly, and the piece teaches its reflective mode early enough that the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amber grotto is purposefully detailed—"held the dying light like honey holds time," "fractured it into a thousand burning fragments"—and the setting charges the final image when Vera tucks the petal into the amber wall as gift. Static electricity as perceptual filter remains abstract (sensing "residual emotions," "accumulated feelings") without concrete constraint: does proximity matter, does voltage rise with emotion intensity? Dusk as timeframe subtly tightens the reflective mood. The grotto qualifies as micro-setting that shapes the closure ritual, clearing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Vera seeks to feel again after years of numbness. The petal inhalation is the key tightening—her defenses dissolve—but it occurs through passive reception (the chemist's message does the work) rather than a choice that narrows live options. The transformation "completes itself" with minimal friction; no secondary cost or tactical shift is visible on the page. Escalation reads as internal deepening under the Accumulative lens, sufficient for mid-band, yet the final decision to "do it differently" is told rather than tested, and no on-page action forecloses a path with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—authentic feeling versus synthetic emotion, professional distance versus permeability—emerges through Vera's profession and the petal. The final image (tucking the petal into amber as gift) offers a resonant gesture that reweights "counterfeit dealer" into "wounded healer." Yet the chemist's embedded compassion and Vera's crystallized motivation ("to fuse insight with empathy") arrive as thematic Echo, nearly prompt-language, in the penultimate section, and the piece states rather than dramatizes the shift: "proof that even a counterfeit dealer could stumble into truth" tells the moral. Subtext in "half truths" and "grief's younger sibling" is deft, but the ending leans toward summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable and voice is distinctive: "professionally thorough," "grief with clear edges," "sadness that lifted by morning." Perceptual signature is consistent—electrical sensitivity colors how Vera reads the world. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during petal inhalation, slightly wider for backstory on her career). Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue present. One slip: "the chemist had known, somehow" claims unearned omniscience about another's intent without dramatized cue, a brief POV leak that does not obscure the lens but nudges distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and varied; opening line "held the dying light like honey holds time" is arresting. Information density is high in most beats. Overwriting cluster mid-story: "fractured it into a thousand burning fragments," "residual emotions that clung to this place like perfume to skin," "something heartbreaking beneath"—three figurative moves in quick succession without pattern-teaching, pushing density without always advancing pressure (−0.4). Minor scaffold: "She had sought this out, hadn't she?" is rhetorical filler. "The transformation was completing now, she could sense it" and later "The transformation completed itself" loop the concept across paragraphs (−0.3). No loops touch closure beat directly; final image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Counterfeit emotion dealer is a fresh synthesis of fragrance chemistry and emotional numbness; the amber grotto and static electricity provide specific texture. The chemist embedding compassion in molecular structure is conceptually bold but borders on magical convenience—how does chemistry encode intent?—and undercuts earned causality. The arc (numb professional rediscovers feeling) is familiar; transformation through specificity (blotter petal, static sense) lifts it, yet the ending's articulated moral and the convenient chemist-as-savior reduce inevitability. Risk-taking in voice and premise is present but not sustained through closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera is present throughout, her profession frames stakes and tactics, and her final choice (to deal "differently" and leave the petal as gift) completes the arc. Setup immediate, development across reflection and petal inhalation, closure participation clear. Causality is somewhat passive (the chemist's message drives her shift), but her renunciation of clinical distance and the ritual gift constitute agency. Strong integration, one band below indispensable due to the externalized trigger.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Blotter petal introduced early ("three days ago"), handled in beats (pulled from pocket, raised to nose, inhaled, tucked into amber wall), returns with reweighted meaning as gift. It enables the transformation (concentrated feeling cracks her numbness) and its final placement charges closure. Specificity (bergamot, vanilla, "moth's wing delicate") makes it irreplaceable. The petal drives two major beats and anchors the ending image with visible cost (she surrenders it). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Half truths" shapes Vera's profession throughout—clients want "grief's younger sibling," "counterfeits that wore off cleanly"—and the concept recurs in her plan to continue "with affectionate detachment." Setup clear, development in middle reflection on her craft, closure participation as she reframes her work. However, it remains more thematic echo than tactical constraint; no on-page choice is forced by the tension between half-truth and whole truth. One key turn shaped, mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Professionally thorough" appears three times as label ("professionally thorough in her craft," "The irony was professionally thorough"), coloring voice but not constraining action. No visible cost or tradeoff tied to thoroughness on the page; it reads as character flavor rather than functional attribute. Present and consistent, but swappable with "meticulous" or "exacting" without structural loss. Functional but replaceable, capped by label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Subsume" introduced in opening section ("subsume what remained of her former self"), drives the transformation arc, and the final state (old defenses subsumed into permeability) completes it. The verb is precise and irreplaceable—absorption rather than rejection. Setup, development (the inhale triggers subsumption), closure (transformation completes). Essential across beats; one notch below indispensable because the action is internal and told rather than enacted with visible tradeoff in a choice beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Sensing through static electricity" is Vera's gift, mentioned in opening and closing beats, filtering perception ("her gift translating chemical information into felt experience"). It enables the petal inhalation to trigger transformation and the final gratitude-sensing in amber. However, mechanics remain abstract—does she touch surfaces, is proximity required?—and it never constrains a choice or creates friction. Early seed → final reprise reweights the grotto visit, reaching lyric-resonance threshold, but swappable with "synesthesia" or "heightened empathy" without loss. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Amber grotto is setup location, provides shelter metaphor across time (hunters, hermits, lovers, Vera), and the amber wall becomes the repository for the petal gift at closure. Dusk tightens mood and time. The setting charges the final image (petal in crack, "gift for the next lost soul") and the grotto's accumulated emotional history pressures Vera's stance. Two beats (entry reflection, closing ritual) and closure linkage clear. Essential to ending resonance, one step below indispensable because spatial constraint does not alter tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"As the transformation completes" frames the entire piece—begins three days ago, Vera enters grotto "tonight," dusk deepens, "darkness finished claiming the sky," tomorrow she returns. The timeframe is tracked and tightens decisions (she must complete the ritual before leaving). However, no live clock pressure forces tactical compromise; time functions as mood scaffold rather than escalating constraint. Setup, development, closure participation all present. One key turn shaped by temporal frame, reaching upper 6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"To fuse insight with empathy" crystallizes in the penultimate section as Vera's new motivation, shaping her plan to continue dealing "differently." It is told rather than dramatized in a choice with friction: no on-page moment tests insight versus empathy as competing goods. Setup deferred (crystallizes late), development thin, closure participation as stated intent. The desire is present and frames the ending, but lacks visible cost or conflicted choice. Functional, one key turn (reframing her work), mid-band capped by summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" is articulated late but present throughout in voice—"professionally thorough," observing her own "glycerin drops," the gentle clinical distance that fractures. Tone modulates: clinical opening, softening during petal inhalation ("genuine tears"), warm resolve at close ("caring for her clients while releasing them"). The phrase charges the ending by naming the synthesis. Coherent through turns, modulates with pressure, and the final image (leaving petal as gift) enacts the tone. Strong integration, one notch below essential due to late explicit naming.</comment>
