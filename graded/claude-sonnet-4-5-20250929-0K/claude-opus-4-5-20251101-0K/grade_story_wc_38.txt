<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear—decrypting her grandmother's legacy—and her embodied processing through dance provides character-specific texture. However, the piece remains largely observational; Marina makes no difficult choices that alter her path or foreclose options with visible cost. The grandmother Elise is vividly drawn through encoded records, but Marina herself never faces internal conflict or a decision that tests competing values. The final gathering of journals feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accretes meaning through layered images (dice, dance, encrypted records) and achieves Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when Marina understands fear as encrypted strength. Orientation anchors (Marina, sunken lab, seventeen-day quest) land early. The closure reweights the premise—vulnerability becomes armor—with conceptual cost (the weight of inherited terror), though the cost remains more asserted than dramatized in a pivotal beat. One meaningful deepening occurs when dance decrypts the secrets, but no on-page reversal tightens options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is vivid and purposeful: "green-gray light," "porthole windows caked with decades of marine growth," steel tables and sealed journal cases create tactile specificity. The setting constrains Marina's access and charges the closure image of rising "toward the light" with the hangman's dice. Sensory detail is filtered through Marina's professional lens (cryptographer's focus on the journal). Minor slip: spatial choreography during the dance sequence remains abstract rather than grounded in the lab's physical layout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decrypt the legacy and understand its meaning—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The piece offers one meaningful deepening when Marina's dance translates cipher into embodied knowledge, reweighting her understanding of her grandmother's work. However, no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off; Marina encounters no obstacles, and the discovery unfolds without friction. The conceptual cost (inheriting terror) is told rather than tested in a beat where Marina must choose under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—fear encrypted as strength, vulnerability as armor—emerges organically from Elise's coded journals and Marina's inheritance without thesis statements. The hangman's dice and dance motifs recur with shifting valence, and the final image of "encrypted courage toward the light" reweights prior material. The piece resists tidy morals and embraces complexity (the "quiet rebellion" of the terrified). Minor deduction: the phrase "fear was not failure" in the penultimate section edges toward abstract summary rather than letting the image speak alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Marina with a distinct perceptual signature: she processes through "gesture and rhythm," notices cipher patterns, and filters the lab through a cryptographer's lens. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("patient work of wearing down the world"). However, occasional elevated phrasing—"liberate information," "calm defiance"—drifts above Marina's immediate register during high-focus beats. No dialogue is present (correctly not penalized). Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structures and vivid images ("breathed with the patience of forgotten things," "movements deliberate as a spider spinning its web"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor loop: "encrypted" and variations appear eight times, creating slight synonym churn around the core concept. The metaphor "each step a measured placement that disturbed neither the silence nor the sediment" is precise, but "like snow" on sediment is a small tonal mismatch (snow melts; sediment persists). No major line-level opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of WWII resistance cryptography, kinetic code-breaking through dance, and multi-generational inheritance offers a specific, non-obvious premise. The hangman's dice as cipher keys and the sunken lab coordinate sewn into a christening gown provide fresh particulars. However, the emotional arc—descendant honors ancestor's courage—follows a familiar template, and the transformation test is borderline: swap names/setting and the structure holds. The dance-as-decryption risks gimmick but is grounded enough in Marina's established method to feel organic. No close echoes of famous work detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marina is present throughout and her profession (lyrical code breaker / analyst who dances ciphers) is established early and central. She uses this method in the main laboratory scene to decrypt the journals. However, her role remains largely observational; she makes no key choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The decision to "gather the journals carefully" and bring them to the surface is frictionless. Present in closure (rising with the journals), but causally passive. Two gates (setup, closure mention); missing middle choice under pressure. Lyric reprise alone places this in mid-5s; lack of difficult decision caps it below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The hangman's dice appear in beat one (pocket, described as keys/randomizers) and return in the final paragraph ("clicked softly in her pocket—letter against letter, secret against secret"). The object is handled and its cipher function is explained, priming the reader for its importance. However, the dice are never used on the page to decrypt; Marina dances the code instead, and the dice remain inert. The final mention reweights them as a symbolic link ("grandmother reaching through time"), but they do not constrain a middle choice or enable a tactic. Two gates (setup, closure reprise) met; causal pressure absent. Swappable with another keyed object. Ceiling ~6.3 for lyric reprise; lack of use in action keeps score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Calm defiance" is named mid-story and illustrated through Elise's "quiet rebellion" (coded nightmares, precise work under terror) and Marina's inheritance of it. The concept shapes the thematic lens and is reflected in Marina's deliberate, patient movements and her understanding at closure. However, it does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics under pressure; it remains thematic rather than operational. Present across all three gates (setup as Marina's approach, developed via Elise's example, charged in closure understanding), but primarily echo rather than forcing function. Conceptual cost (carrying terror as a torch) is asserted, not tested in a beat. Mid-6s for thematic coherence without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Explains through dance" is established early ("how she had always processed it—through the body"), used in the central laboratory scene where Marina dances to decrypt the journals (pirouettes = names, arabesques = safe houses, port de bras = Elise's love), and contextualizes her career ("colleagues… found it strange at first"). The trait constrains her method (cannot decrypt through conventional analysis alone) and enables the breakthrough. Visible in closure framing (her "footsteps fell with the mysterious familiarity of a path walked in dreams"). All three gates; causal work in the main beat; specificity high (this exact method matters). Cost: the method isolates her professionally and requires physical space/time. Strong integration; 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Liberate" appears three times: Elise's intelligence "liberate[d] information that saved lives"; the journals will "liberate the stories of hundreds of unnamed heroes"; and encrypted courage rises "toward the light." The action is the story's throughline and stakes (decrypt to free hidden history). It drives Marina's quest, provides the thematic spine (liberation as both decryption and release), and charges the ending image. Present in all three gates; shapes the dominant stake. However, easily swappable with "reveal" or "uncover" at sentence level without altering structure—synonyms fit. Strong thematic integration and closure linkage keep it in 7s, but swappability and lack of unique mechanics cap it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The coded journal entries are introduced early (Marina seeks "the one she sought—leather-bound, marked with the same symbol tattooed on her inner wrist"), used as the puzzle Marina must decrypt in the laboratory (middle beat), and provide the content for the final understanding and the material she carries to the surface (closure). The cipher's dual nature (intelligence + encrypted vulnerability) is irreplaceable: lullabies as reports, love letters as inventories. Mechanics matter: requires hangman's dice, necessitates Marina's dance-decryption method. All three gates; drives two major beats (finding, decrypting); shapes closure. Specificity and causal pressure high; removing this exact method breaks story logic. 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is vividly rendered (green-gray light, porthole windows, spiral staircase, steel tables, sealed journal cases) and frames the entire action. It provides the necessary isolation for Marina's work, houses the journals she seeks, and its submerged, preserved state is causally tied to the story's archaeology-of-secrets logic. The setting's "patient" quality and marine growth mirror the theme of time and preservation. Marina's physical descent and final ascent ("rose to meet them") structure the action and charge the closure image. All three gates; spatial choreography clear; environment constrains and enables. Strong integration; one tick below indispensable because the decryption could occur in another isolated archive with edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"As a spider spins its web" appears once in paragraph two, describing Marina's "deliberate" movements. The simile evokes patience and craft but does not establish a timeframe or clock that tightens decisions. The "seventeen days" of prior visits suggests duration but does not create on-page urgency; Marina faces no deadline. The phrase functions as descriptive texture, not a temporal constraint. Setup gate met (early mention); no middle or closure participation. Ornamental use; swappable with other patience metaphors. Caps at ~4.6 for late/absent middle and closure development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To encrypt vulnerability as strength" is the story's thematic spine, revealed through Elise's method (using fear to sharpen focus) and Marina's inheritance ("vulnerability, properly encrypted, became armor"). The motivation is dramatized in Elise's example (coded nightmares, trembling hands that kept working) and understood by Marina at closure. However, Marina herself does not encrypt her own vulnerability in an on-page choice under pressure; she observes and inherits but does not enact. Present in all three gates as theme; drives understanding but not conflicted choice. Told more than tested in Marina's present action. Thematic clarity without friction between wants and costs places this in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is named once in the final ascent ("footsteps fell with the mysterious familiarity of a path walked in dreams") and operationalized throughout: the lab is forgotten yet recognizable via coordinates sewn into cloth; the dice are worn smooth by generations; the cipher is "lyrical" and requires embodied knowledge; Elise's personal code awaits Marina's particular skill. Tone is coherent—reverent, patient, elegiac—and modulates subtly (discovery, decryption, understanding). It charges the final image of inherited legacy. However, the explicit labeling in the penultimate paragraph slightly undercuts the effect. Present across the arc; purposeful; closure linkage strong. Tonal control under pressure solid but not exceptional. 7.1.</comment>
