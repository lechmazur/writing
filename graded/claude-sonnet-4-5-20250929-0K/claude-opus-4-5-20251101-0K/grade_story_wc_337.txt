<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal arc is earned: her damaged hands find purpose through unraveling rather than restoration, and the parallel between her guilt over broken masks and the spirits' knotted confessions creates authentic internal conflict. The choice to "trade silences" with Callum is motivated by specific regret, not abstract morality. Minor slip: "ground restless spirits" reads slightly label-like in the middle section, though it's contextualized by her own restlessness. The final realization—that unraveling has steadied her hands—feels causally rooted in the needle-work itself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Mira's hands stop shaking through the act of unraveling, enabling her to return to restoration with visible transformation (gold-stitched cracks instead of seamless repair). The causal lens holds—each knot loosened releases a confession, each confession eases Callum's form, and the cumulative work steadies Mira's purpose. Orientation is swift (prism sanctuary, Mira kneeling, mask fragments) and the tightening occurs when she begins threading the needle and Callum materializes, raising the cost of the exchange. One micro turn (Callum's question "Why do you do this?") deepens without fracturing the through-line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary functions spatially: starlight fractures through crystalline walls, and the geometry shifts when Mira shares her secret, grounding the metaphysical exchange in concrete setting pressure. The tapestry needle and the net are handled objects that constrain her micro-movements. Minor limitation: the sanctuary's mechanics (how it accumulates silence, why prisms store confessions) remain decorative rather than tactically essential—Mira's work would proceed similarly in any isolated space. The final image (needle catching dawn sunlight) charges the ending but doesn't depend on prism-specific properties.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mira's need to ground spirits and reclaim her craft—is signaled early and tightens when she begins unraveling. The escalation is causal: each knot she loosens releases a confession, Callum's form softens, and her hands steady in parallel. Cost is visible: she must "trade silences," confessing her own guilt to free the spirits, and the act forecloses seamless restoration—she will now "leave the cracks visible." The pressure is driven by protagonist agency (threading the needle, choosing to unravel rather than mend) and narrows her options toward acceptance rather than erasure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: unraveling as prerequisite to mending, visible cracks as honesty, and the economy of confessed guilt. The final image (gold-stitched breaks like the old masters) answers the thematic question without stating a moral. Minor decorative moment: "interlaced hush" and "lucid unrest" occasionally feel like thematic markers rather than dramatized pressure. The sanctuary's role as a space that "accumulates silence" supports the theme but borders on allegorical convenience—prisms wait passively rather than exerting narrative force.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira; psychic distance contracts appropriately when she threads the needle and loosens knots. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "ground restless spirits" reads as her professional self-concept, and "economy of confessed guilt" reflects her restorer's lens. Callum's dialogue ("You came") is spare and ghostly, distinct from Mira's interior texture. One minor register wobble: "lucid unrest" and "interlaced hush" occasionally read slightly elevated for her immediate perception under pressure, though they remain within the poetic frame the piece establishes early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally strong: "gathering it like dust in the hollow spaces where her craft used to live" delivers specificity and metaphor in one move. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the sanctuary's geometry shifts are imagistically clear. Two deductions: "interlaced hush" and "lucid unrest" are repeated as near-synonyms without added pressure (paraphrase loop), and "Her edges grew softer, less defined by guilt, more defined by acceptance" is a tell-heavy summary of Callum's transformation rather than an embodied image. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, but the middle third carries slight decorative density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of restorer-as-unraveler and knotted-confessions-in-net offers a fresh angle on guilt and repair. The inversion—finding steadiness through destruction—feels earned rather than imposed. Limitation: the prism sanctuary and starlight fracturing read as atmospheric rather than structurally necessary; swap "prism" for "mirror" or "crystal" and the logic holds. The kintsugi-inspired closure (gold in the cracks) is a known trope, executed well but not transformed beyond recognition. Risk is present in the quiet, reflective pacing, which coheres without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her choices drive all major turns: she initiates the unraveling, confesses her guilt to Callum, and decides to stitch gold into cracks rather than pursue seamless repair. The restorer identity constrains her perception (she sees silence as accumulated material, views her hands as broken tools) and her final realization—that unraveling has steadied her—grows directly from the needle-work. Setup early, developed in the exchange with Callum, and paid off in the dawn closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tapestry needle appears in three beats: drawn from her sleeve, threaded beneath knots, and catching dawn sunlight in the final image. It enables the unraveling and its "silver length worn smooth by generations" adds specificity. Limitation: the needle is a necessary tool but not irreplaceable—any fine implement would serve the same function. The final reprise (catching sunlight) reweights it as a symbol of restored purpose, but the causal work is generic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Interlaced hush" is named twice and described as "that peculiar quality of layered silences" and the sanctuary's function. It shapes the thematic frame: Mira exchanges her silence for the spirits' knotted quiet. It does not, however, constrain a tactical choice—Mira would proceed with unraveling whether or not the concept were named. The phrase charges atmosphere but remains more thematic echo than pressure lever.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira "accumulates silence" is stated early and dramatized through her collecting fragments and "gathering it like dust." The trait motivates her presence in the sanctuary and her willingness to trade confessions with Callum. Cost: she must voice her own guilt to release theirs, forfeiting the protective silence she has hoarded. The attribute is functional across two beats (setup, exchange) and tied to closure (the silence becomes "peace rather than punishment"), but it could be paraphrased as "grief" or "guilt" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Exhume what you buried in the net" frames Mira's task and drives the middle escalation: each secret she unravels loosens Callum's form and steadies her hands. The action is irreversible—once the knots are undone, the confessions are released—and it distinguishes this encounter from passive witnessing. Setup occurs when she threads the needle; payoff is visible when Callum fades and the net becomes "just rope now, nothing more." The verb "exhume" is specific but could be replaced with "release" or "unearth" without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The centuries-old fisherman's net is present from the opening paragraph, holds the knotted confessions, and its unraveling is the engine of the plot. Each knot Mira loosens releases a voice (Callum's, the woman's, fishermen's, widows', children's), and the work is irreversible. The method is signaled early, developed across multiple beats, and paid off when the net becomes empty rope at dawn. Specificity: the net's age and origin (pulled from the sea by long-dead fishermen) root the confessions in history. Limitation: the mechanics—why knots hold words, how unraveling releases them—are given rather than earned, but the method itself is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary provides spatial grounding (crystalline walls, fractured starlight, shifting geometry) and its function—accumulating silences—supports the thematic frame. The setting enables the encounter (spirits gather here, Mira enters knowingly) but does not constrain her tactics: the unraveling would proceed identically in any quiet, isolated space. The final image uses the prisms passively ("waiting for the next restless spirit") rather than as active pressure. Present across all three gates, but closer to atmospheric container than tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Across sharing a secret" is legible as the duration of Mira's confession to Callum and his to her, framing the middle exchange. The timeframe tightens slightly—dawn approaches as the net empties—but does not impose a hard clock that alters tactics. The phrase itself is oblique and more thematic than mechanical: no countdown or urgency forces faster or different choices. Setup is implicit, development occurs in the exchange, and closure is tied to dawn's arrival, but the frame is loose.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to ground restless spirits" is stated early, dramatized through the unraveling, and conflicted: she is also grounding herself. The parallel between the spirits' unrest and her own drives the exchange and charges the closure when both achieve peace. Cost: she must confess her guilt over the shattered masks, trading her protective silence. The motivation is functional and tied to closure, but "ground" reads slightly label-like in the middle section despite being anchored in her restorer identity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Lucid unrest" is named once and embodied throughout: Mira's trembling hands, the spirits' flickering forms, the sanctuary's fractured starlight, and the "economy of confessed guilt" all carry restless clarity. Tone modulates as pressure rises—sparse dialogue tightens the exchange, and the final paragraph breathes into resolution without losing the charged quiet. The phrase itself is slightly decorative, but the tonal execution (unease held in tension with purposeful action) coheres and charges the ending image of the needle catching sunlight.</comment>
