<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is vivid and concrete—her occupational lens shapes perception ("watching the aurora ripple across the ice walls like veins of living light"). The final choice to preserve the emerald feels earned by her professional relationship to death and memory. However, the peak emotional beats drift into elevated diction that edges away from embodied crisis ("the particular frequency of a soul"). Internal contradiction is present but muted; the decision path is mostly linear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (beautician mortician, grotto, mother's death). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and cadence build through reflection and ritual toward the infusion moment, which lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the emerald now pulses, the protagonist's stance toward her work shifts). The closure unit reweights her vocation with felt cost—she bears irreplaceable presence home. One pressure deepening (aurora intensifies, urgency before oblivion) suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto and aurora are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail filtered through Mira's professional attention. The emerald chip functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. However, the grotto's impossible physics ("tethered to nothing") and dissolving mechanics remain decorative rather than constraint-driven. Spatial choreography is clear; the setting enables the closure without forcing a tactical choice under duress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capture mother's essence before oblivion—is signaled early and tightens once (aurora intensifies, minutes before dissipation). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens. The resolution is protagonist-driven (Mira presses the chip to the light, wills the connection). However, no live obstacle complicates the ritual; the grotto and aurora cooperate without friction, muting the felt cost of success.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: beauty endures beyond stillness, memorialization as sacred threshold work. The emerald's transformation from broken fragment to pulsing talisman reweights the premise without overt moralizing. The final image offers a resonant answer—her work bridges presence and absence. One slip: "proof that the threshold could be crossed" edges toward thematic assertion rather than pure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable; perceptual signature is consistent (professional attentiveness, taught pattern-finding). Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the aurora encounter. However, diction elevates during peak beats ("the particular frequency of a soul," "gossamer boundary") in ways that feel authorial rather than character-bound. No head-hopping; the voice is controlled but occasionally slips register under emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, information density is high, and most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, elevated figurative language clusters in the middle section without clear payoff ("veins of living light," "gossamer boundary," "cosmic background"). Two adjacent sentences near the climax restate urgency without added pressure ("minutes before oblivion" / "diminishing… perhaps minutes"). Template cadence in the closing paragraph ("knowing that… reminded her… that her work") mildly flattens propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The beautician-mortician vocation is a fresh synthesis that grounds the threshold concept in embodied practice. The grotto ritual feels specific to this character's skillset. However, the skyborne-grotto-under-aurora frame leans on fantasy-prompt aesthetics without transforming them through lived occupational detail. The emotional arc (professional memorialization deepened by personal loss) is well-executed but not structurally novel.</comment>
