<question>1</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Elena's interiority is concrete and embodied—her compensatory shift to touch after losing smell, the patient listening posture. Margaret's grief is handled well through "storms" in her eyes and defensive finger-curl, though her arc feels more symbolic than psychologically contradictory. The final exchange about "ordinary miracles" skirts therapy-speak but stays anchored in concrete work. No profound internal conflict dramatized in the closure beat; Elena's stance is stable rather than torn.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Orientation is clean by the first two paragraphs. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: fog imagery, water-clock dripping, and the screw mechanism all recur with shifted weight. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Margaret accepts her inheritance and Elena returns to her work; the cost is Margaret's tears and the recognition that healing is witnessing, not fixing. The final image reweights the premise coherently. One meaningful deepening (the screw's metaphoric freight) tightens the dominant stake without a causal reversal, appropriate for this lens.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The water-clock shop is vividly particular and the fog/droplet motif coheres. Spatial choreography is clear: workbench, chair, windows, clepsydras. The screw mechanism functions as micro-setting—it constrains Elena's tool choice and charges the final exchange. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (Elena notices oxidation she can't smell). The "Victorian era" clamp and "Welsh valleys" ground period and locale without excess. All anchors track; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Margaret seeks restoration of a lineage instrument, Elena seeks meaning after loss. One tightening occurs when Elena diagnoses the improper cleaning—knowledge deepens but options don't narrow sharply. The screw's freeing is more symbolic release than a choice with visible trade-off. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but escalation is gentle; cost at closure is Margaret's tears and the implicit commitment to return, not a decisive forfeiture. Sufficient for the lens but lacks a second beat that raises price.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Theme (healing as witnessing, ordinary miracles, generational connection) emerges from concrete images—water drips, the freed screw, the two-thousand-baby lineage. The final paragraph edges toward direct statement: "drop by drop, life by life, story by story" and "finding meaning in what others discarded" risk summarizing the work the scene has already done. The screw's bright-metal reveal is a resonant image, but "It always worked. It just needed someone to believe it was worth the effort" is close to an on-the-nose moral. Subtext operates well in gesture (Margaret's white knuckles, Elena's patient tool selection) but the ending's thematic echo lowers the band.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyric, and texture-specific: "trembling calm," "occluded views," "poetry in their patient dripping." Distance is stable third-limited on Elena. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven and carries subtext (Margaret's whisper, Elena's "May I?"). Some diction skews elevated for continuous use—"occluded views," "emotional terrain," "fossilized in corrosion"—but remains within a literary register that the piece teaches early. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear: Elena reads bodies after losing smell, notes tension and curl. Minor: "trembling calm" recurs as both phrase and tone, risking self-annotation.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the screw-diagnosis beat. Two minor loops: "trembling" appears in "trembling hands" and "trembling calm" in close proximity; "reading between lines" is stated both in the premise paragraph and near the end ("read between the lines of broken things"). Figurative language is dense—most sentences carry metaphor or simile—but coherent and voice-motivated. No major scaffold or template cadence. Clarity is good; the final paragraph's "drop by drop, life by life, story by story" is a deliberate parallelism that coheres with the piece's lyric mode. Line-level control is strong but the density of figuration in high-pressure beats (screw cleaning, final exchange) approaches overwriting without crossing into obscurity.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—aromatherapist who lost smell now repairs water clocks—is fresh and the screw-as-metaphor for generational misunderstanding is specific. The emotional arc (healing through witnessing) is familiar but grounded in the clamp's particulars and Elena's sensory compensations. Risk is present in the lyric density and the quiet ending. One template echo: the "storms" in eyes and "thin ice" crack are stock interiority shortcuts. Transformation test: swap the water clocks for another craft and the arc holds, suggesting the occupation is more ornament than engine. Solid synthesis but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Elena (aromatherapist who lost smell) is the POV throughout. Setup is immediate (paragraph one). Development: her compensatory touch-reading of the clamp and diagnosis of the improper cleaning alter Margaret's understanding (middle). Closure: she offers the invitation to return and "help me understand," and the piece closes on her returning to work. Two distinct beats where her trait (lost smell, learned touch-reading) enables action. The loss drives her empathy but doesn't create a choice with visible cost at closure—she acts consistently throughout. Causal but not indispensable; a similar empathetic repairer could function.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The birthing clamp appears in setup (Margaret unwraps it), development (Elena examines and frees the screw mechanism), and payoff (Margaret takes it "with trembling hands"). Used in three beats with evolving meaning: artifact of lineage → frozen failure → restored inheritance. The screw's frozen state and its freeing drive the middle turn and charge the closure. Specificity: Victorian, adjustable screw, rust/old-blood tarnish. Cost tied to it: Margaret's tears and the unspoken recognition of generational failure. Strong integration; removing it breaks the closure image. Minor: the clamp itself is static after the screw is freed; no further handling charges the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Setup: "reading between lines that trembled with grief" (paragraph five). Development: Elena reads Margaret's body language (shoulders, fingers) and the screw's history. Payoff: "reading between the lines of broken things until they remembered how to speak." Present in all three phases but functions more as interpretive frame than a tactic that narrows options. It guides Elena's empathy but doesn't create a trade-off or constrain her choices under pressure. Lyric reprise at closure reweights the premise but the concept remains more thematic than causal. Mid-band: shapes understanding, not decision.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Setup: Elena "used to map emotional terrain through scent" (paragraph six). Development: she now reads "the tension in Margaret's shoulders, the defensive curl of her fingers" to map emotional state. Payoff: implicit in the final exchange where she offers witnessing. The trait enables her diagnosis and empathy but doesn't constrain a choice with visible cost—she acts consistently, no trade-off required. Present in two beats with causal work (scent loss → touch-reading → empathetic offer) but the attribute is more backstory explanation than a live constraint. Functional, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Setup: "'Sometimes it's about humanizing what's been abandoned. Making it warm again'" (paragraph eight). Development: Elena speaks "of ordinary miracles" while cleaning, personalizing the work. Payoff: the invitation to "tell me about your grandmother's two thousand babies. Help me understand why ordinary moments become miracles." The action shapes the middle and closure beats and is tied to Elena's stance. However, "humanize" as verb feels slightly ornamental—Elena's actual work is cleaning and listening, which could be described without the term. The concept is present and meaningful but not irreplaceable; "restore with empathy" would serve. Strong but swappable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>Setup: "Through occluded views—the fog outside, the tarnish on the metal, the unshed tears blurring Margaret's vision—Elena glimpsed the emotional terrain" (paragraph five). The method is named and demonstrated once in the middle. No clear payoff: the fog lifts at the end but doesn't charge the final image or constrain a choice. The mechanics (fog, tarnish, tears as occlusion) are listed but don't recur as a tactic. Present in one beat as a descriptive frame, not a method that shapes attempts. Lyric reprise absent at closure. Functional mention but not developed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Setup: opening sentence and paragraph one establish the shop and its atmosphere. Development: "her smallest tools, the ones she used for the most delicate water clock repairs" (paragraph seven)—the shop's inventory supplies the method for the clamp repair. Payoff: "The water clocks around them dripped their patient seconds" in the closure paragraph, charging the time-as-healing motif. The shop constrains Elena's tool choice and its rhythmic dripping recurs with reweighted meaning. Present in three beats with causal and atmospheric work. Strong but the shop itself could be another craft space; the water clocks (not the shop qua location) do the heavy lifting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Setup: "within the hush of morning fog" (opening sentence). Payoff: "the morning fog released its grip on the city" (final paragraph). The timeframe brackets the scene but doesn't tighten decisions or create urgency—no clock pressure, no deadline. The fog's lifting is atmospheric closure, not tactical constraint. Present in two beats (first and last) as lyric frame but doesn't alter moves or narrow options. Time is untracked in the middle; no sense of minutes passing or urgency building. Ornamental reprise without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Setup: Elena "finding poetry in their patient dripping" (paragraph one) and later "finding meaning in what others discarded" (final paragraph). Development: her speech about "ordinary miracles" (paragraph eight) and "the real healing had never been in the oils but in the witnessing" (paragraph eleven). The desire is present but not conflicted—Elena acts on it consistently without friction. No visible cost or competing want. Present in three beats but more as a stable stance than a dramatized tension. Told and enacted but not tested under pressure. Functional but not indispensable; the motivation could be "to help" with similar effect.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Setup: "trembling calm" (paragraph five) names the tone and it recurs in "trembling hands" (paragraph ten). The piece sustains a contemplative, restrained register throughout—no tonal breaks. Modulation: quiet opening, gentle intensification during the screw diagnosis, emotional release (Margaret's tears), return to calm in the final image. The tone charges the closure: "patient seconds" and "drop by drop" echo the opening's "patient dripping." Coherent and purposeful. The phrase "trembling calm" is self-aware—it names the effect rather than letting it emerge—but the execution is consistent. Strong tonal control with minor self-annotation.</comment>
