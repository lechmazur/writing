<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's gift of hearing unspoken words is established early and her chess-teaching motivation is clear, but her interiority remains largely declarative rather than contradictory. The decision to organize the window displays feels like a fait accompli rather than a choice under pressure—she's already committed at story open. Embodied emotion is sparse; we're told she carries "weight of words no one had spoken aloud" but the physical experience of her ability never complicates a choice on the page. Marcus functions as memory-motivator but doesn't apply immediate relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (mist, chess pieces, grotto, starlight) and Eleanor's reflections to build a thematic charge. Closure relies on Charged Poise—Eleanor standing on the library steps, listening to the town's unspoken doubts, affirming "Someone was" and anticipating tomorrow's quiet revelation. Cost is conceptual (risk of failure, the fragility of "hope like a fragile queen") but not viscerally felt or tied to a forfeited option on the page. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by opening paragraph). The tightening is minimal: preparation → affirmation, with no meaningful reversal or narrowing of options between.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt library, mist, and magnetic grotto create vivid atmosphere and the grotto's iron foundations enable the chess-piece staging. Sensory detail is selective and mood-consistent (mist pressing "like curious ghosts," starlight via mirrors). The grotto constrains her method (magnetic properties) and charges the final image of hope as "fragile queen, ready for the board," lifting this above postcard description. Spatial choreography is clear across locations.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—planting doubt about standardized testing via synchronized displays—is signaled early. However, Eleanor begins the story with her plan already finalized; the narrative documents preparation rather than a choice under escalating pressure. No on-page reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The tomorrow-morning timing creates anticipation but no immediate cost or tactical shift. Under the Accumulative lens, the lack of a deepening that changes knowledge or reweights the stake keeps this in mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—quiet resistance, the power of doubt as catalyst—emerges through concrete images (chess positions of sacrifice, pawns toppling kings) rather than thesis statements. The recurring chess-queen motif shifts from teaching tool to symbol of fragile hope at closure. Eleanor's method (synchronized windows, amplified quiet) dramatizes the concept without moralizing. The final image of parents thinking buried thoughts offers a resonant answer to "how does change begin" without a stated moral, though the thematic gesture is somewhat predictable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; Eleanor's perceptual signature (hearing unspoken words, chess-strategic thinking) is consistent. Diction elevates at times ("bruise on the evening," "amplified quiet") but remains within a literary-reflective register appropriate to the voice. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and wider social observation. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets don't apply. Reflection dominates but remains anchored to present stimuli (library, grotto, chess pieces) and primes the closure stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structure and vivid images ("mist parted briefly," "iron remembered and mirrors caught stars"). However, several phrases verge on stock lyricism ("cradling hope like a fragile queen"), and the recurring "unspoken words" formulation becomes template-like. Information density is moderate; some beats restate Eleanor's motivation without advancing pressure. The final paragraph's repetition of "seventeen" feels mechanical. No major loops or causality-obscuring artifacts, but figurative density in reflective passages occasionally slows momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The combination of telepathy-lite gift with grassroots activism via chess symbolism is specific, though the "quiet rebellion through art installations" frame echoes familiar templates. The twist that her gift arrived with menopause adds particularity. Emotional specificity around Eleanor's students (Marcus, the weeping girl) grounds the abstract stakes. However, the story's arc—committed activist prepares and affirms mission—offers limited dramatic surprise; the ending reaffirms rather than transforms. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits to its lyric-reflective mode but stays within safe tonal boundaries.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor as after-school chess coach frames her expertise and access to students, motivating her rebellion. Her teaching history with Marcus and the weeping girl drives her current action (organizing displays). She makes the choice to finalize preparations and affirm her mission at closure. Present in setup, middle (via memory shaping present choice), and ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto appears in three beats: entry and description, preparation table work, and the decision to leave the chess set behind as symbolic anchor. Its iron foundations enable the magnetic chess pieces, shaping her method. The grotto's mirrors catching starlight charge the image of "where rebels had always gathered," linking past and present. Returns with reweighted meaning (storage → historical continuity) at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Humble rebellion" is named explicitly and enacted through the synchronized window-display plan. It shapes her method (no marches, just questions) and motivates the choice of chess symbolism. The concept drives the dominant stake and Eleanor's stance crystallization at closure ("Someone was"). Present throughout but borderline thematic echo; the label appears on-page, reducing specificity slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Eleanor's gift of hearing unspoken words is established early and justifies her insight into Marcus, the baker, the pharmacist, and the sleeping town. However, the trait is used primarily for exposition and motivation rather than constraining a choice or imposing cost. No scene shows her gift creating a dilemma or tactical tradeoff. Present in setup and ending (listening to the town) but development involvement is weak—it informs rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Cradle" appears three times with escalating meaning: Eleanor cradles the white queen (examining the plan), cradles hope metaphorically, and the verb ties to her protective care for students. The final image—"cradling hope like a fragile queen, ready for the board"—charges closure by fusing tenderness, fragility, and readiness. The action is specific, recurring, and irreplaceable in the final beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Organizing synchronized window displays is signaled early (photographs, sketches, master schedule) and defines her method. The mechanics matter: seventeen storefronts, chess-piece arrangements, timing before the mayor's rally. It shapes her tactics (coordination, secrecy, symbolic language) and the anticipated outcome. Present in setup and middle preparation; the ending anticipates the displays' effect tomorrow, though they don't appear on-page at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The cobalt library provides atmosphere and the grotto supplies the magnetic properties that enable her chess-staging method. Mist creates the "amplified quiet" tone and isolates Eleanor's focus. The library functions as rebel meeting-place, linking past and present. The setting constrains her method (iron foundations) and charges the final image (mist parting, library steps). Present across all three structural beats with causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"The hush where past meets prophecy" is named explicitly and frames the moment as threshold between old education paradigms and new mandates. It motivates the timing (eve of the mayor's rally) and Eleanor's sense of urgency. However, the timeframe functions more as thematic backdrop than tactical pressure; no ticking clock alters her choices on-page. Present in setup framing and thematic echo at closure but weak development involvement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Eleanor's desire "to plant forests of second thoughts" is declared and dramatized through the window-display plan and her history with students. The motivation drives her preparation and her final affirmation. Friction appears in the fragility of the plan ("humble...foolish feels like breathing again") and the conceptual cost of hope as "fragile queen." Present throughout with visible stakes, though the choice itself (finalize and affirm) carries limited dramatic conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" is named and sustained across the story: mist muffling sound, the library's silence, the grotto's depth, Eleanor's method of spreading rebellion through pauses rather than noise. Tone modulates subtly with Eleanor's intensity (preparation focus, final affirmation) while maintaining coherent restraint. The final image of "amplified quiet of doubt" crystallizes the tone as strategic weapon, charging closure. Indispensable to method and theme.</comment>
