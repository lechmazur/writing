<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's proprioceptive enhancement is vividly embodied throughout ("seismograph of suffering," "terrifying clarity" of spinal curve), and her motivation to decode the colony's cruelty drives her scene choices. Her actuary background and the physical memory of torture inform her present perception. However, her arc from victim to decoder feels more declared than dramatically earned; the final choice to rewrite mercy is stated as intention rather than tested on the page with visible cost that forecloses another path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece infers a Hybrid lens (accumulative texture building toward a stance crystallization). Orientation anchors—Elena in the ultraviolet forest after escape—arrive within the opening lines. The closure is a Charged Poise: Elena buries the mask strap and commits to rewriting the equations, crystallizing her stance with the cost of remaining hunted and alone. However, the cost feels asserted rather than dramatized; no on-page trade-off or forfeiture makes the price undeniable in the final image, weakening the closure's felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is richly imagined—bioluminescent bark, violet pulses encoding data, phosphorescent soil—and grounds Elena's sensory experience. The setting constrains her movement (exhaustion, healing wounds) and supplies the mathematical structures she decodes. The mask strap as micro-object charges the ending when buried. Sensory detail is filtered through her enhanced proprioception, creating a distinct perceptual lens. Strong integration of environment with character state and closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—is signaled early and sustained. Elena's enhanced perception allows her to decode the forest's algorithm, a tightening that reveals mercy as rationed efficiency. However, the escalation is cognitive rather than pressured by choice; no on-page reversal forces Elena to trade one value for another. The decision to rewrite the system is declared, not tested against a live cost or obstacle that narrows her options in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the forest-as-computer conceit and Elena's trauma-informed decoding: mercy as optimization, justice as cruelty. The buried mask strap and the shift from "doorway to the room where they had broken her" to "maps" offer a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image—"calculating a warmer answer"—reweights prior material. However, "mathematics of mercy" edges toward prompt-language echo, and the thematic resolution leans declarative rather than fully embodied in a choice with visible stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV with stable third-limited distance. The prose carries a distinct texture—"ultraviolet pain," "seismograph of suffering"—that conveys Elena's heightened sensory state. Perceptual signature is strong: every physical sensation is a trauma doorway. However, elevated diction ("supernatural precision," "moral calculus") occasionally drifts above a tortured actuary's interior lexicon under peak stress. No head-hopping; focalization is controlled. Voice modulates with intensity but maintains consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally strong, with vivid images ("violet pain," "pewter mask strap"). Information density is high; most sentences advance character state or world logic. However, several beats stack abstract intensifiers without concrete anchors: "terrifying clarity," "supernatural precision," "cold optimization function." Minor paraphrase loop near midpoint: "the forest was a living computer" restates what the prior paragraph showed. Template cadence in trauma-reflection beats ("She had…", "They had…") appears three times consecutively, dulling propulsion. No filter-verb stacks or closure-beat artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ultraviolet-forest-as-moral-computer premise is specific and well-executed. Proprioceptive enhancement as interrogation technique is a fresh inflection. However, the core arc—torture survivor decodes oppressive system and vows resistance—follows a familiar template without a non-obvious turn. The "mathematics of mercy" frame risks abstraction; the story commits to it but does not transform the premise through an unexpected ethical calculus or sacrifice. Solid synthesis with moderate freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's survivor identity drives every beat: her enhanced perception, her ability to detect lies, her escape during penance, her decoding of the algorithm, and her final commitment to rewrite mercy. Present in setup, shapes middle decoding work, and anchors closure decision. High causal pressure and irreplaceability; the story's logic depends on her specific trauma and skills.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The pewter mask strap appears in the opening as a physical anchor to her interrogation, is traced mid-scene ("dug into her healing skin"), and is buried in the final beat as "a seed of her own transformation." Early seed and charged final reprise with lyric resonance. However, it does not constrain a middle choice or apply visible pressure; its role is symbolic recurrence rather than tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ultraviolet penance frames the escape opportunity (guards drawn away) and provides the visual/sensory field for Elena's decoding. Present in setup and integral to the setting's logic. However, its mechanics—three-day ritual, cleansing light—are described rather than tested; Elena does not navigate penance's social or temporal pressures in a choice that alters her tactics. Functional world-building without causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Proprioceptive enhancement is embodied throughout: Elena registers "every micro-adjustment," feels the algorithm "in her bones," and translates pain into data. It enables her decoding work (middle beat) and is the tool that lets her perceive the forest's equations at closure. The attribute shapes her perception and action with visible cost (exhaustion, trauma flashbacks). Strong causal integration and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Brace" recurs three times: opening ("braced herself against a phosphorescent oak"), midpoint ("Elena braced again as another wave of light"), and kneeling among roots. Each instance grounds her physical struggle and proprioceptive awareness. However, the action is reactive stabilization rather than a choice that turns the plot; it could be replaced with "steadied" or "knelt" without structural loss. Functional but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Remembering through trauma responses is seeded early ("each physical sensation a doorway to the room") and operationalized in the middle: "her enhanced nervous system translating pain into information." The method enables her breakthrough—"the mathematical truth in her bones"—and reappears at closure: "those memories served a different function… They were maps." Present across beats with causal work, though the mechanics lean declarative rather than step-by-step dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is indispensable. It structures the escape window (penance ritual), supplies the bioluminescent data Elena decodes, constrains her movement (exhaustion on shifting floor), and provides the soil where she traces equations and buries the mask strap. Present in every beat, shapes tactics, and charges the closure image. High integration and irreplaceability; remove the forest and the story's logic collapses.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the anesthesia wears off" anchors the opening moment and signals recent escape. The two-day penance countdown is mentioned but does not tighten Elena's choices or create tactical pressure. Time passes (three hours post-anesthesia, forty-seven days in the mask) but remains atmospheric rather than a live constraint that narrows her window for action. Functional framing without escalation leverage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elena's desire to discover the mathematics of mercy is stated early and pursued on the page: she decodes the forest's algorithm, traces equations in the soil, and commits to rewriting the system. The motivation drives her scene choices and culminates in her vow at closure. However, the quest is more intellectual revelation than conflicted decision with a visible trade-off; no friction between her want and another cost appears in the final beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Displaced rooted" is coherent: Elena is exiled from the colony yet embedded in the forest's data web. The tone modulates from pain-saturated opening to determined closure ("calculating a warmer answer") without losing its haunted, proprioceptive texture. However, the tone remains relatively stable—contemplative intensity throughout—without a sharp cadence shift that charges the final image. Functional coherence with moderate modulation.</comment>
