<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kira's retrocognitive trait creates embodied contradiction—she touches to remember but must renounce what she finds—and her final choice to carve Emre's name is earned by the accumulated weight of his mercy rippling forward. Internal experience (the visions) differs consistently from external behavior (the physical carving). Minor slip: the "gentle radical" label feels slightly therapeutic, and the steel arms are mentioned but never constrain a choice under pressure, limiting embodiment of her disability. The closure choice forecloses passivity with visible cost (time, exposure, effort).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates weight through layered visions (artisan → fire → soldier → children's descendants) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Kira carves the name, crystallizing her mission against erasure with undeniable cost (exposure, labor, defiance). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening: the tessera's artisan pride → the soldier's hesitation → the carved name. The cost is legible in "her steel arms aching from the work" and "slipped back into the ruins," signaling danger. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The plaza, shattered sky, and mosaic stepping stone constrain Kira's access to memory and supply the medium for her final act (carving into stone). The "fractured dome of ash and amber light" and "warm coldness" filter through her perception, grounding the post-fire setting. The tessera and stepping stone are handled tactilely across beats, and the carved name charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear (plaza → tower tile → stepping stone → departure). Minor: "warm coldness" as a descriptor appears twice but doesn't evolve; the paradox could charge more if it modulated with pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve mercy and memory against the regime's erasure, signaled early ("cradle empathy in arms of steel"). One meaningful tightening: Kira searches deeper through the stone's memory, finds the soldier's hesitation, then acts by carving his name—a decision that forecloses safety and defies the regime. The cost is visible (aching arms, slipping back into ruins under threat). Agency is decision and renunciation (she opposes the armed resistance's path). No requirement for explicit antagonist at this length; the regime's erasure pressure coheres throughout. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—stubborn human need to remember tenderness versus systemic erasure—emerges from Kira's concrete acts (gathering broken things, carving names) rather than statement. The final image (renamed stone waiting for pilgrims not yet born) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in "aberrant mercy" and the soldier's single act rippling forward through generations. Minor: "gentle radical" and "cradle empathy in arms of steel" echo prompt language slightly, but they're dramatized through scene work (gathering, carving) rather than asserted. The closure reweights prior material (all the visions) into a future-facing act of defiant preservation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds stable focal distance; diction ("retrocognitively trapped," "aberrant mercy," "warm coldness") is voice-motivated and legible within the speculative frame. Perceptual signature: Kira notices broken things, their histories, and the weight of erasure. Psychic distance tightens at peak beats (the fire vision, the carving). Minor: "warm coldness" and "gentle radical" feel slightly imposed rather than emerging from Kira's idiom; the phrase "stubborn human need to remember tenderness" in the penultimate paragraph borders on thematic statement rather than filtered perception. No head-hopping; POV modesty holds (Kira infers Emre's name from a lover's memory, not omniscience).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high (each vision does multiple jobs: world-building, stakes, causality). Clear propulsion through "knelt," "gasped," "placed both metal hands," "began to carve." Minor loop: "warm coldness" appears twice with identical phrasing; "gentle radical" is repeated without reweighting. Template cadence in the fire-vision beat: "She watched... She felt... heard... witnessed" stacks filter verbs. No major artifacts touch the closure image ("letter by letter, she carved"), but the filter-verb stack in the middle third and the repeated "warm coldness" prevent higher bands. Grammar and tense are clean; no pronoun drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The retrocognitive premise (touching objects to relive their pasts) is combined with post-apocalyptic resistance and a protagonist who preserves empathy rather than stockpiling weapons—a specific synthesis that feels fresh. The choice to carve a traitor's name into a stepping stone (overlooked by the regime) is non-obvious and grows from prior particulars. Minor: the steel prosthetic arms are mentioned but never constrain a choice, making them feel slightly ornamental. The "gentle radical" frame risks mission-statement abstraction, though it's grounded in scene work. The transformation of tropes (resistance fighter, memory magic) through Kira's tender defiance elevates the piece above template dystopia.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kira ("gentle radical") drives the closure choice (carving the name) and her mission shapes stakes throughout. She appears early, her choices create key turns (searching deeper, focusing on Emre, carving), and she forecloses the armed resistance path. The "gentle radical" label is told and slightly abstract, limiting band entry, but her actions (gathering fragments, listening to histories, carving) dramatize it. Two beats: vision-search and carving. Closure linkage strong. Swappability: another memory-keeper could perform similar acts with moderate edits, but Kira's steel arms and specific mission add some irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tessera is handled in two distinct beats: Kira picks it up (triggers the artisan's vision), then touches it again at the end (daughter's laughter). It seeds the retrocognitive mechanic early and returns with reweighted meaning (pride → laughter, bridging past and future). It does not constrain the main choice (carving happens on the stepping stone, not the tessera), limiting causal pressure. Strong early signal and charged reprise, but the tessera is not indispensable to the closure act—Kira could carve without it. The stepping stone does more causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" is named explicitly ("perform an act of aberrant mercy") and frames Kira's mission, shaping stakes (preserve compassion vs. regime's erasure). It drives the search for Emre (a soldier who showed mercy) and the closure act (carving his name is mercy toward the erased). Setup early, development via Emre's backstory, payoff in the carving. Cost: exposure and defiance. Minor: the concept is told ("aberrant mercy") rather than fully emergent from action, and the phrase feels slightly prompt-like. Strong thematic linkage but not fully irreplaceable—"forbidden compassion" or "outlawed kindness" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is named and demonstrated: Kira's touch triggers involuntary visions (tessera → artisan; stepping stone → thousand footsteps, fire, Emre). The trait enables the main action (finding Emre's name and story) and imposes cost (she is "trapped," cannot avoid reliving pain, must "gasp" and endure). Setup immediate, beats involve two distinct vision sequences, closure depends on knowledge gained via the trait. High irreplaceability: no other mechanic could deliver Emre's story without this exact ability. Causal pressure strong; visible tradeoffs (exhaustion, emotional toll, "tears freezing").</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Renaming (carving "EMRE KAYAN") is the climactic act, the pivot from gathering memories to inscribing them, and the story's resolution. Setup via "mission was to rename him," development through the vision-search that recovers the name, payoff in the carving beat and final image (renamed stone waiting). The act defines Kira's resistance method and forecloses safety. Cost visible (effort, exposure). High irreplaceability: "remember," "preserve," or "honor" would not carry the same defiant specificity. The entire narrative arc hinges on this verb; removing it collapses closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The method (chipped patterns on the stepping stone) is signaled midway ("via the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone, she traced the trajectory of his mercy") and used in one beat: Kira places hands on the stone, accesses memory, finds Emre. It enables the discovery but is not mechanically distinct from the tessera's earlier function—both are retrocognitive triggers. Setup in second half, development in one beat, payoff indirect (the stone becomes the carving surface). Moderate swappability: "via the stone's embedded memories" could replace with minor edits. Does not shape multiple attempts or constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plaza supplies the stepping stone (memory source and carving surface), the ruined fountain and tower (history), and the exposure risk (regime territory). It pressures Kira's choice (danger of being caught) and charges the final image ("strange shadows," "waited for pilgrims"). Setup immediate ("plaza had been beautiful once"), development across all beats (the fire, the barricade gap, the carving), payoff strong ("slipped back into the ruins"). The shattered sky recurs and modulates tone. Irreplaceability high: another setting would lose the layered history and the stepping-stone logic. Cost: exposure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the great fire" frames causality (regime burned the old world, erased names) and motivates Kira's mission (preservation against erasure). The timeframe is named early and shapes stakes throughout (post-apocalyptic scarcity of memory). No ticking clock or deadline; time does not tighten tactics on the page. The fire's aftermath is static backdrop rather than dynamic pressure. Setup early, thematic development, but no closure-beat urgency tied to time. Functional but replaceable: "after the regime's rise" or "after the purge" could substitute with minor thematic shifts.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To cradle empathy in arms of steel" is named explicitly and dramatized: Kira's mission is preservation of tenderness (gathering fragments, carving names) in defiance of the regime's violence. Her choice to carve rather than fight enacts the motivation. Setup early, friction between "gentle radical" path and the armed resistance creates internal coherence. Cost: effort, danger. Minor: the phrase "cradle empathy in arms of steel" feels told and slightly prompt-like; the "steel arms" motif is mentioned but never tested (no moment where the prosthetics fail or constrain). Strong thematic linkage but the friction could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Warm coldness" recurs as the shattered sky's descriptor (amber light through ash; "warm light filtering through cold absence") and charges the final image, creating tonal coherence through the piece. The paradox supports the theme (beauty amid ruin, hope amid erasure). It modulates slightly (early: setting description; late: metaphor for Kira's mission). Setup early, sustained across beats, payoff in closing line. Minor: the phrase is repeated identically twice without evolving meaning between uses. Tone coherent and purposeful, but not fully indispensable—"bitter light" or "haunted glow" could approach similar effect.</comment>
