<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-specific ("mathematics of survival," soil pH/spore patterns grounding her rationality). Her internal contradiction—craving isolation yet recognizing the need for connection—drives the choice to replicate the cure. The weeping moment when she lies successfully is embodied and earned. Minor slip: the sister's truth-telling that "could never be unheard" is told rather than shown, and the final decision to spread the cure arrives quickly without visible on-page friction between safety and risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise: Maren shifts from isolation to dangerous dissemination, reweighting psychological safety from solitude to choice. The inferred lens is Causal (smuggled eye → ability to lie → decision to spread cure), though backstory occupies ~35% and occasionally flattens present pressure. Orientation anchors promptly (ravine, platform, Tuesday). The tightening is meaningful: receiving the relic → testing it → drafting instructions narrows her world from passive survival to active risk. Cost is felt in "dangerous work" and the execution threat, though the final pivot happens in summary rather than a dramatized beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The hanging orchard constrains her isolation and survival calculus throughout: trees on steel cables over a ravine, storm losses tallied with detachment, the platform swaying. The glass eye's physical presence (cold, then warm, then nothing; housing pressed against temple) grounds the pivot. The ravine below "swallowing the storm's fury" and trees "roots reaching toward nothing, surviving anyway" charge the final image with embodied fragility. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (spore patterns, mycelia language). Minor deduction: the oilcloth wrapping and grafting supplies appear once without spatial follow-through.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—psychological safety—is signaled early and tightens when the relic arrives with execution risk. The test of lying ("I am happy") is a meaningful reversal that narrows her world from isolation-only to choice-enabled connection. The final decision to spread the cure raises external danger, though it unfolds in summary ("Tomorrow she would begin") rather than a scene-level choice with visible friction. The cost (execution threat, "dangerous work") is declared but not tested on the page. One substantive pressure point (the lie succeeding) drives the arc under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (the cost of involuntary truth vs. the grace of chosen silence) emerges through concrete particulars: families dissolving, Maren's exile, the glass eye as occlusion device, and the final image of trees surviving with "roots reaching toward nothing." The closing lines offer a resonant answer without stating a moral: silence and choice restore fractured wholeness. "Fractured, yes—but grace nonetheless" risks overt articulation, yet the specificity of the hanging orchard and the patient glass eye anchor the abstraction. No thematic drift; the premise follows its implications cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren filters the world through rational detachment, soil science idiom, and cost-benefit calculation ("mathematics of survival," "honest language of mycelia"). Voice modulates under pressure (the weeping moment compresses syntax fittingly). The single line of dialogue ("My name is Maren. I am happy.") advances plot and carries subtext (testing the device's power). Minor deduction: "families dissolve under the weight of truths never meant to surface" and "secrets spill like water through her fingers" verge on generic phrasing in the backstory block, slightly flattening the idiom during reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in action beats (the unpacking, the fitting, the weeping). Opening and closing images anchor and recharge (storm losses → trees holding on). Minor artifacts: "She thought of... She thought of..." template cadence in the decision paragraph; "psychological safety" repeated three times across the piece without evolving meaning; "the glass eye watched... patient as a seed waiting for rain" is a mixed metaphor (inorganic eye/organic seed). These issues cluster in reflective passages and slightly dull momentum. Clarity and propulsion remain strong in present-tense action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The empathy-virus premise (involuntary truth-telling) is fresh, and the hanging orchard over a ravine is a vivid, non-obvious staging. The glass eye as neural occluder integrates rational forager background with the sci-fi constraint. However, the core arc—isolated survivor receives cure, tests it, decides to share—follows a familiar template (hermit reintegration). The transformation lies in the particularity of mycelia-language voice and the hanging-trees imagery, lifting the piece above generic execution. The discredited-textbook method and Dr. Vasquez/Chen names are functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maren's rationality (soil pH, spore patterns, cost-benefit detachment) frames her approach to the orchard and the relic. Her decision to test the eye and then replicate it stems from her forager's pragmatism. She appears in all major beats (counting losses, unwrapping the eye, testing the lie, drafting instructions). The trait shapes tactics and closure participation. Cap consideration: the final choice to spread the cure is stated in future tense rather than dramatized, slightly weakening causal visibility.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass eye appears in three distinct beats: unwrapping (oilcloth, violet iris, gold filigree), fitting and testing (cold-warm-nothing sensation, the lie succeeds), and closure (watching as she drafts instructions, "patient as a seed"). Its properties (occlusion device, neural mirroring, smuggled relic) are irreplaceable and drive the arc from isolation to potential dissemination. The final reprise ("patient as a seed waiting for rain") reweights it as both tool and symbol. Small deduction: the mechanics are explained rather than discovered through failed or partial attempts.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The smuggled-relic status creates immediate stakes (execution threat) and explains the oilcloth wrapping, the anonymous note, and Maren's awareness of quarantine-lab provenance. It constrains her choice: possessing it is already dangerous; replicating it multiplies the risk. The concept shapes the ending's danger ("Tomorrow she would begin the dangerous work"). Present across setup, middle (the note: "They're looking"), and closure. Small deduction: the threat remains atmospheric rather than tested by a near-miss or active searcher on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Involuntary truthfulness is the premise that drove Maren into isolation (families dissolved, her sister's unretractable words, "secrets spill like water"). Testing the eye specifically targets this constraint: "I am happy" is a lie she could not speak before, and its success makes her weep. The trait enables the closure (choice restored). However, most of the constraint's cost is told in backstory; we do not see Maren forced to speak an unwanted truth on the page. Present at setup and payoff; middle development is summary.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Occlude" is the mechanism of the glass eye (blocking neural pathways) and the method Maren will teach others. It is signaled in the backstory block ("occlusion—literally blocking certain neural patterns"), tested when she fits the housing, and referenced at closure ("the ability to decide what parts of yourself to share and what to shelter"). The action redefines options from isolation to selective silence. Small deduction: the action is explained via Dr. Vasquez's notes rather than discovered through Maren's trial; swapping "occlude" for "suppress" or "mask" would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The discredited textbooks are mentioned twice: Maren has collected them, and they contain Dr. Vasquez's and Dr. Chen's work on neural mirroring and symbolic anchoring. She uses them to understand the eye's mechanism and plans to reproduce diagrams for others. The method shapes her confidence and the feasibility of replication. However, the textbooks do not constrain or complicate a choice on the page (she does not struggle to interpret them, nor do they fail her). Present at setup and closure; functional but not irreplaceable (she could have learned the mechanics from a data cache, a mentor's notes, etc.).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The hanging orchard over the ravine is Maren's chosen isolation (no one climbs down) and a live constraint (storm tears trees loose, ongoing losses tallied). The platform sways, the walkway rocks in gusts, the steel cables sing—visceral pressure throughout. The setting shapes her survival calculus and frames the final image: "trees held on, roots reaching toward nothing, surviving anyway" directly charges the closure with embodied metaphor. The ravine's hundred-meter drop and storm violence are irreplaceable to the isolation logic and tonal fragility. Present across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"After the empathy virus" frames the entire world state (three years post-outbreak, families dissolved, isolation as norm). The timeframe explains Maren's detachment, the scarcity of human contact, and the relic's origin (quarantine labs). It sets the cost of connection and the stakes of the cure. However, "after" is static; no ticking clock or escalating temporal pressure forces Maren's choice—she could test the eye today or a month from now. The Tuesday arrival creates a gentle inciting incident but no urgency. Present at setup and closure; shapes context more than tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Psychological safety drives Maren's isolation ("no one climbed down here. No one triggered the terrible compulsion") and her test of the eye (restoring "the luxury of silence, of thoughts that belonged only to her"). The motivation reframes at closure: safety is not just isolation but choice. The desire is dramatized in her weeping when the lie succeeds and in her decision to draft instructions despite danger. Slight deduction: the final pivot to sharing (risking her safety for others') is stated as future intent rather than enacted, so the friction between wants (safety for self vs. others) is felt but not fully tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fractured grace is coherent throughout: detached cost-tallying ("Seven Perigord blacks, gone"), broken families, "secrets spill like water," the orchard's "broken instruments" cables, and the closing acknowledgment "Fractured, yes—but grace nonetheless." Tone modulates under pressure (the weeping beat softens syntax; the final paragraph steadies into quiet resolve). The phrase "fractured grace" risks overt articulation in the penultimate line, but the image of trees with "roots reaching toward nothing, surviving anyway" embodies the tone in the final beat. The tone charges the closure image with restrained hope amid fragility.</comment>
