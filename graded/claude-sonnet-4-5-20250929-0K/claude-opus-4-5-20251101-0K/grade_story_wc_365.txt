<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her sensory-mapping ability is embodied through concrete action (touching surfaces, reading footprints). The mother's sacrifice is earned through the vision-beat revelation, and the final choice to continue the mapping work has visible cost. However, interiority leans toward exposition in places ("she understood," "finally feeling the weight") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and the cyclical surge mechanic feels more told than constrained in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with a clean vision-beat that retrospectively reframes the mother's disappearance and the shard's function. Closure lands as Decisive Change: Mira shifts from seeking her mother to continuing her mother's fatal mission, with the cost made explicit (dimensional toxicity, inevitable death). Orientation is swift (who/where/when by line three). One meaningful tightening occurs when the surge crests and the vision delivers the withheld truth, narrowing Mira's options to a sacrificial path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The spaceport repair bay is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail (frozen drones, lipstick-stained cups, magnetic coupling unit) that anchors the scene and guides Mira's sensory-mapping investigation. The setting constrains her search (she must touch surfaces to read them) and the coupling unit becomes the literal portal for the vision. Spatial choreography is clean. The bay charges the closure by embodying "forgotten ambitions" that mirror the mother's hidden sacrifice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering why her mother disappeared—is signaled immediately and tightens when the surge allows Mira to witness the past argument. The vision delivers a reversal: her mother didn't abandon her but chose a fatal mission. Agency at closure is clear: Mira steps into the rift, accepting the same toxic path. The cost is legible (she will die mapping safe routes) and forecloses survival, though the escalation occurs mostly via revelation rather than protagonist tactical struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of inherited sacrifice and the price of knowledge emerges organically from the mother-daughter parallel without thesis statement. The green shard shifts from memento to protective filter, reweighting prior material. The final image—Mira stepping into the rift "protected, purposeful"—offers a resonant answer to the withheld-truth question without moralizing. "The weight of truth...was an anchor" verges on abstraction but is redeemed by the concrete action of charting the next crossing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (Mira notices texture, layered footsteps, pressure points). Psychic distance is controlled and voice modulates appropriately under stress. The dialogue in the vision beat is functional and goal-driven, revealing the conflict without on-the-nose exposition. Minor slip: "cyclically spontaneous" feels like a prompt label inserted without dramatized constraint, and some interiority edges toward explanation ("she realized") rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense with strong opening and closing images. Sentence structure supports momentum and no loops or scaffold appear. Figurative language is controlled ("reality felt thin as membrane," "cathedral to obsolescence") and enhances rather than obscures. Minor texture note: "the weight of the withheld truth" recurs as a thematic phrase and borders on abstraction, but the surrounding concrete detail (shard pressed to heart, stepping into rift) keeps clarity high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The sensory-mapper-as-dimensional-traveler premise is fresh, and the twist that the mother was mapping safe routes (not simply vanishing) transforms the abandonment trope. The green shard as toxicity filter is a specific, non-obvious detail. However, the core "parent sacrificed themselves for a hidden noble cause" frame is a well-worn template, and while the dimensional-toxicity mechanics add texture, the emotional arc (loss → understanding → continuation) follows predictable beats. Solid execution of familiar material rather than bold synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's sensory-mapping ability drives the investigation (touching the floor to read footprints, mapping the coupling unit to find her mother's trace) and enables the vision that delivers the withheld truth. Her final choice to continue the mapping work, accepting the fatal cost, is causally rooted in this gift. Present in setup, middle investigation, and closure; irreplaceable and tied to visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The green glass shard appears in the opening as a memento and returns warm/pulsing before the vision, then is pressed to Mira's heart at closure when she understands its function as a toxicity filter. It seeds expectation, enables one beat (the surge/vision), and reweights at the end. However, its protective function is told in the vision rather than demonstrated through on-page constraint or visible cost tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds is the story's engine: Mira has done it before, the surge builds on the page, she slips into a parallel bay to witness the past, and she steps into a new rift at closure. The concept shapes her tactics (reading dimensional seams, recognizing pressure points) and the stakes (dimensional toxicity accumulates with each crossing). Present across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "cyclically spontaneous" trait is mentioned twice ("manifested cyclically spontaneous," "the cyclical surge crested") but functions mostly as a label. It signals that the surge is building and then arrives, but Mira does not struggle against unpredictable timing or make a trade-off based on this constraint. The trait is present but does not demonstrably narrow her options or impose visible cost in scene.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Redirecting through parallel universes is mentioned in Mira's past ("she'd learned to redirect her trajectory") and implied when she "found herself standing in the same bay, now alive with activity," but the action itself is not dramatized as a choice or struggle in this scene. The vision-beat turn happens to her rather than through her active redirection. Present and functional but not irreplaceable; the vision could arrive without this specific verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The parallel-universes mechanic is established early (quantum stabilizers failed, dimensions bleed together), demonstrated in the middle when Mira slips into a past version of the bay to witness the argument, and invoked at closure when she steps into the rift. The method shapes her investigation (she senses stacked realities, reads threads of light) and is causally essential to delivering the withheld truth. All three gates met.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is present from the opening, supplies the magnetic coupling unit (the literal portal), and charges the closure with its "cathedral to obsolescence" atmosphere that mirrors the mother's sacrifice. The setting constrains Mira's search (she must map surfaces to find traces) and the specific location (coupling unit) is where the vision occurs. Essential across setup, middle, and ending; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The phrase "in the murmur of half-remembered dreams" appears twice as atmospheric descriptor but does not function as a legible timeframe or constraint. Time is vague (the bay was evacuated "decades past," the mother disappeared "seventeen years ago") and no ticking clock shapes Mira's choices. Present as tone/mood but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; ornamental rather than structural.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motivation to discover the withheld truth (why her mother disappeared, what the shard means) drives every beat: Mira's investigation of the bay, the vision-reveal, and the closure choice to continue the fatal mapping work. The desire is dramatized through action (touching surfaces, approaching the coupling unit) and the final cost (accepting dimensional toxicity, inevitable death) is visible. Friction between wanting answers and accepting their price is clear and causally linked to closure.</comment>
