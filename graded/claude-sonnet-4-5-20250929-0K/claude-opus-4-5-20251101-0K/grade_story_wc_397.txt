<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior voice carries specificity ("her perception untethered from the certainty") and the stroke aftermath provides embodied contradiction. However, motivation remains largely reflective rather than tested through on-page conflicting choices under pressure. The final stance—floating in uncertainty—reads as acceptance without a visible foreclosed path or cost that would earn Earned Stasis. The parasol tip functions more as symbolic anchor than as an object whose handling reveals character hierarchy under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through layered reflection and image (ice, parasol, waiting), teaching a pattern of drift and accumulation. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise ("the waiting itself had become a kind of living"), but cost remains abstract—the Zurich appointment stays "on the calendar" without on-page forfeiture or a crystallized trade-off. The stroke provides a reversal (changed perception) but doesn't narrow options in a way that charges the final image with undeniable pressure. Orientation is clean by ~120 words, waiving that penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("groaned," "rising and falling," "cathedral of blue ice") and filters through Maren's altered perception. The ice constrains the volunteers' work (reading water, timing retrievals) and the parasol tip is handled across beats, charging the final pocket-touch. The micro-setting (body, object, environment) all contribute to the ending image. Minor: occupational detail (trawling mechanics) remains generic when a sharper procedural constraint could have tightened a middle choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Maren's choice between the Zurich appointment and this suspended Arctic existence. The stroke provides one tightening (perception shifts, reality loosens), and volunteering introduces a new texture ("fold in patience"). However, the escalation is conceptual rather than decisional—no on-page moment forces Maren to actively choose or renounce the appointment with visible cost. The final paragraph states "she was no longer certain what she was waiting for" but does not dramatize a foreclosed path or trade-off that would charge the poise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—patience, endings, and surrender—emerges organically from the ice, the parasol fragment, and Maren's loosened grip on reality. The parasol's survival "in pieces" and the volunteers' unhurried urgency provide non-literal particulars. The final image ("the waiting itself had become a kind of living") attempts to reweight the euthanasia premise without moralizing. Minor slip: "windborne solace" and "fold in patience" are repeated as phrases rather than evolved through fresh images, nudging toward thematic echo. No overt sermon, and the complexity (choosing not-to-choose) avoids binary resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Maren's altered perception. Diction is controlled and carries a distinct lyric register ("colors bleeding at their edges," "vast space between intentions"). No head-hopping. Captain Elise's single line of dialogue feels purpose-driven and advances Maren's understanding. Minor: some figurative constructions ("fold in patience," "windborne solace") recur as labels rather than being dramatized through fresh perception under pressure, slightly flattening the perceptual signature at peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied and carries high information density in many lines. Figurative language is vivid ("cathedral of blue ice," "grief without being anchored to it"). However, template-cadence and paraphrase loops appear: "She had come here to end something. Instead, she had found herself suspended" echoes the opening frame without adding pressure. Several adjacent paragraphs restate Maren's loosened grip and the volunteers' patience in near-synonym fashion. The phrase "windborne solace" appears twice without evolving. Deduction: −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems touching the closure paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of euthanasia tourism, Arctic isolation, post-stroke perception, and disaster-relief volunteering is specific and non-obvious. The parasol tip as a fragment-that-survives offers a fresh angle on inheritance and endurance. However, the emotional arc—trading terminal certainty for suspended waiting—follows a familiar contemplative template (journey to remote place → crisis → acceptance of ambiguity). The stroke's perceptual effects are told more than shown in action. Transformation test: swap the Arctic for another stark setting and the core remains largely unchanged. No close proximity to famous works.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout and her euthanasia-tourist status frames the stakes (Zurich appointment). The stroke alters her perception, and she joins the volunteers. However, her "tourist" status does not drive a key turn—she does not make an on-page choice about the appointment that forecloses a path. Setup clear, development present (volunteering choice), but closure participation is observational rather than decisional.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The parasol tip appears in paragraph three (setup), is traced at night (middle beat), and returns in the final paragraph ("parasol tip in her pocket"). The object's meaning—survival in pieces—seeds the theme and reprises at closure. However, it is not handled or used in a way that constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains symbolic rather than causally active. Lyric reprise with thematic weight, but no on-page cost tied to the object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"A fold in patience" is named explicitly and illustrated through the volunteers' unhurried urgency. It shapes Maren's understanding (middle development) but does not constrain an on-page choice—she does not face a moment where patience versus urgency alters tactics or costs her something. Closure mentions patience folding "like the waves" but as image, not causal pressure. Present and thematically coherent, but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is established early via the stroke's effects and recurs in Captain Elise's line ("You see between things now"). It enables Maren's new perspective and acceptance of drift. However, the trait does not constrain or cost her in a specific beat—no moment where her loose grip causes a mistake or forecloses an option. The attribute colors perception but does not drive a turn with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Trawling the frigid waters is named as daily work, integrated into the volunteers' rescue effort, and returns in the final paragraph ("Tomorrow they would trawl again"). It provides purposeful action that grounds Maren's physical presence and survival rhythm. The action shapes her stance (finding purpose in retrieval) and is present at closure. However, a single trawling beat with a specific choice or cost would have elevated integration; as written, it is essential backdrop rather than pivot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is signaled on day three, provides the daily structure (trawling, rescue work), and teaches Maren "a fold in patience." It is present in the final paragraph as tomorrow's plan. The method shapes her new routine and understanding but does not constrain a key choice—no moment where volunteering forces a trade-off or alters her Zurich decision. Setup, development, and closure participation are all present, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is named in the opening line, grounds all action (rescue work, nightly song, floating docks), and recurs in the final paragraphs ("the marina groaned again"). The ice's shifting and groaning provides both atmosphere and implicit constraint (the volunteers read the water, timing their retrievals). Micro-setting (the cabin window, the dinghy, the dock) all particularize choices. The setting is indispensable to tone and tactics; removing it would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After waking up changed" anchors the inciting stroke and the three-week span in Svalbard. The timeframe is present (setup) and referenced in the volunteers' third-day arrival (middle). However, time does not tighten decisions—the Zurich appointment remains "on the calendar" without a countdown that forces choice. The ending mentions "tomorrow" but as open continuation, not deadline. Time is tracked but does not escalate pressure or narrow options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maren's desire to "learn the sound of approaching endings" is stated explicitly and illustrated through listening to the ice, the volunteers, her own breath. It shapes her stance and is present at closure ("learning to hear the sound of approaching endings everywhere now"). However, the motivation is not dramatized through conflicting choices—no moment where pursuing this knowledge costs her something or conflicts with another want. The motivation is coherent and thematically charged but not tested under friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Windborne solace" is named in the final paragraph and seeded through imagery of drifting, floating, and loosened grip. Tone is coherent—elegiac, contemplative, unhurried—and modulates appropriately (the stroke's disorientation, the volunteers' calm, the final suspension). The phrase "windborne solace drifted eternal as the ice" charges the final image. Minor: the tone is consistent rather than shifting with pressure, trending toward a single sustained mood. Still, it is integral to the piece's effect and would be missed if removed.</comment>
