<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mei's grief-driven motivation is clear and her craft-based approach to capturing Lin's shadow shows problem-solving ingenuity. However, the resolution arrives without meaningful internal contradiction or cost—she succeeds fully in her goal with no visible trade-off or renunciation. The "grief cracked open like an egg, spilling not darkness but dawn" reads as an unearned epiphany that skips the struggle. The thousand cranes function more as atmospheric detail than evidence of genuine transformation earned through on-page choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation adequately (who/where/when by ~150 words) and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—grief transformed through craft and ritual. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Mei's grief becomes "light" and "presence"), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: she simply succeeds, sleeps peacefully, and the garden approves. The escalation from folding cranes to building the lantern to capturing the shadow follows a clear arc, but the final beat lacks felt consequence—no visible price paid, no path foreclosed, just luminous resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden, jasmine-scented pavilion, and glass basilica create a vivid, fantastical setting with consistent internal logic. Sensory detail is strong ("jasmine perfumed the air," "heat above summer stones") and the environment provides concrete resources (smuggled crystal, terrace for ritual). The setting charges the final image (lantern hung from the pavilion's eave), satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. Minor cap applied due to Q2 closure debt preventing full high-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—intercepting Lin's departing shadow—is signaled early and drives the action. One meaningful tightening occurs (midnight deadline, shadow appears, lantern activates), but the resolution lacks visible cost: Mei's plan works perfectly with no trade-off, failure, or complication. The phrase "nothing truly disappears, it only changes form" tells the thematic lesson rather than showing struggle. Agency is present but the escalation flattens when success arrives without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The transformation theme (grief into light, paper into birds, death into dwelling) emerges from concrete actions and the lantern image. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "transformation was complete," "Grief had become light," and the flowers "approved," replacing scene pressure with thesis statement. The crane motif is functional but late-explained ("practice transformation") rather than earned through prior tension. Theme resists full complexity by resolving into luminous affirmation without sustained ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("descended while ascending, her spirit sinking into memory"). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent throughout, with purposeful compression ("crafty where others were merely clever"). Filter verbs appear but feel voice-motivated. However, some passages drift into elevated register during emotional beats ("love that refused to let go," "luminous torment") that slightly exceed the established grounding, though not enough to break coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. The piece avoids major loops, though "the shadow" and "the lantern" recur as subjects across many consecutive sentences in the climax without varying structure. Minor template cadence in the ending: "Grief had become light, loss had become presence, and a crafty lantern maker had built..." stacks parallel constructions that feel mechanical. One paraphrase loop: "transform unbearable weight" / "transformation was complete" restates theme without adding pressure. No clarity-obscuring artifacts at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The combination of lantern-making craft, dream-recording technology, and grief ritual offers specific synthesis. However, the core premise—parent uses magical technology to preserve dead child's spirit—follows a familiar template without substantial transformation through unique moral calculus or lived complication. The "thousand cranes" and "seventeen gems" provide texture but the emotional arc (unrelenting grief → luminous reunion) resolves conventionally. The floating-island fantasy setting adds atmosphere but doesn't fundamentally alter the stakes or complicate the premise in unexpected ways.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mei's choices drive two key beats: studying basilica methods/smuggling crystal (middle development) and activating the lantern at midnight (closure). Her craftiness is demonstrated through problem-solving (calculating gem specifications, trading lanterns for secrets) rather than merely labeled. The character shapes the ending decisively—the story would fail without her specific skills and determination.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The glass basilica appears in paragraph 3 as visual anchor and tech-source, returns at the climax ("pulsed with accumulated dreams"), and dims at the end in acknowledgment. However, it remains atmospheric rather than causally active—Mei uses smuggled crystal pieces, not the basilica itself. The structure provides setting pressure and thematic parallel but could be replaced with another dream-tech institution without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dream recording shapes the entire plot: Mei studies the technology (setup), adapts it for her lantern (development), and uses it to capture Lin's shadow (closure). The concept determines tactics (gem polishing specifications, crystal smuggling) and enables the transformation. However, the mechanics remain somewhat generic—"refracting consciousness into crystal matrices"—without unique constraints that create friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Descended while ascending" appears once as a lyric moment: "she descended while ascending, her spirit sinking into memory even as her body climbed." It captures Mei's psychological state but doesn't constrain action or recur to reweight meaning. The attribute colors one beat without shaping choices or returning at closure. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Transform" is the story's engine: Mei transforms grief (setup), paper cranes serve as transformation practice (middle reflection), and the final act transforms Lin's shadow into light (closure). The word and concept recur purposefully across beats, and the ending explicitly names transformation as the lesson learned. Removing this exact action-concept would collapse both plot logic and thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Gem polishing is signaled early ("gem polishing kit"), shapes Mei's middle work ("seventeen polished gems...ground to specifications"), and executes the climax ("Light blazed through seventeen gems"). The method is specific to her craft and drives the mechanics of shadow-capture. However, the actual polishing happens off-page in summary, reducing its felt presence compared to its structural importance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The tea garden hosts the workshop (setup), provides jasmine atmosphere throughout, and supplies the terrace for the midnight ritual (closure participation). The setting is more than postcard—oolong bushes "whispered secrets," the pavilion houses her work, the highest terrace enables the ritual. However, it doesn't impose meaningful constraint or alter tactics; another elevated location would serve equally well.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "after the shadow detaches" timeframe creates the inciting urgency (three seasons post-death, anniversary tonight), imposes the midnight deadline that drives the climax, and determines when Lin's spirit becomes capturable. The monks' teaching that "Lin's spirit would complete its journey at midnight" tightens the window and makes Mei's intercept attempt time-sensitive. Strong causal and pressure integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Folding cranes is shown on-page (opening beat), explained as grief processing, and yields the final crane that Lin's shadow catches. The motivation is demonstrated and recurs, but doesn't face meaningful friction—Mei folds easily, without struggle or cost, making it more ritual than conflicted desire. The cranes function as atmospheric motif rather than a want that competes with another need or fear.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Luminous torment" is named once explicitly but permeates the piece: beauty amid grief, light holding sorrow, the lantern as "beautiful and terrible." Tone modulates from heavy grief (opening) through determined craft (middle) to bittersweet reunion (closure), maintaining coherent duality. The final image—daughter's light watching over sleeping mother—charges the tone without resolving the oxymoron fully, sustaining productive tension.</comment>
