<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's interiority is consistent and her motivation is grounded in personal history (grandmother's photographs). However, key character choices feel more thematic than embodied—the decision to leave her note reads as a ritual performed rather than a choice under pressure. The "hushed blaze" metaphor for her passion appears twice but remains abstract; we don't see contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the closure beat. Minor: "stoically sensitive to every ripple that marked absence" leans toward label-speak without full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates artifacts (inkwell letter, photograph) and the closure deposits a note in response, creating a pattern of care across time. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Marina continues her ritual with visible cost (solitude, the "negative space" she inhabits)—but the cost could be more visceral on the page. The linkage between finding the photograph and leaving the note is causally clean within the accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (barnacled benches, copper roof, cold brackish water) and constrains Marina's physical actions (diving, probing the column). The setting charges the final image: Marina standing waist-deep as the moon sets, carrying treasures home. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The pavilion's hollow columns function as both setting and mechanism, directly enabling the plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving/honoring abandoned dreams. The discovery of the photograph matching the inkwell letter provides one meaningful deepening—the fragments cohere, intensifying Marina's sense of purpose. However, the piece lacks a second pressure point or visible tradeoff; Marina's decision to leave a note is consistent with established behavior rather than a choice that narrows options. The "unbearable" absence and her trembling hands gesture toward emotional cost, but no live option is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of interlaced absence and the preservation of unfinished love emerges organically from concrete objects and Marina's actions. The final image of carrying artifacts home while the moon sets offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to honor what is lost. The piece avoids moralizing, though "love, even unfinished, left marks the water could never fully erase" walks close to an explicit statement. Minor: "archeologist of abandoned dreams" appears twice, once as direct thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and the narrative voice carries a distinct, lyric texture ("stoically sensitive," "hushed blaze," "negative space shaped like two people"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Marina notices traces, absences, the interplay of past and present. No dialogue to evaluate. The register occasionally tips into abstraction ("interlaced absence" as a concept Marina explicitly "understands") but the voice remains coherent and purposeful. Diction is controlled, though "hushed blaze" and "interlaced absence" repeat as thematic anchors.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong imagery ("bones of something magnificent and dead," "drowning crown"). Some mild overwriting: "stoically sensitive to every ripple that marked absence" stacks modifiers; "hushed blaze that burned quietly but never extinguished" contains a near-redundancy (hushed/quietly). Template cadence appears in the closure: "For now, it was enough to wrest them... to trace the patterns... and to believe..." (parallel infinitive stems). Minor scaffold: "She understood that she would never know" followed by "That was the nature of her chosen work" paraphrases the same idea. No loops touch the closure image directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—night surveyor who collects lost artifacts from flooded ruins and leaves notes for future finders—offers a fresh synthesis of post-disaster setting and archival longing. The dual identity (day surveyor/night archeologist) and the specific mechanism (foundation repair cavities as dead drops) provide concrete grounding. However, the emotional arc follows a familiar template: solitary caretaker finds meaning in preserving others' stories. The transformation test is middling—swap the flooded pavilion for another ruin and the core remains largely unchanged. Execution is strong but the premise does not fully escape its archetype.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marina's role as surveyor frames her access to the flooded district and provides cover for her night work, but the surveying itself does not constrain a key choice. The occupation appears in setup and context but does not drive a turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The inkwell appears in three beats: initial discovery (flashback), tonight's use (refilled with archival ink), and the closure decision to leave a note. It enables the plot by containing the original letter and serves as the vessel for Marina's response. However, its specific properties (brass hinge, wax-and-copper preservation) matter less than its symbolic function. Strong integration, but not indispensable—a different container could serve.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Interlaced absence" is explicitly named and drives Marina's motivation: she seeks fragments that "wove together into a tapestry of longing." The concept shapes her tactics (searching hollow columns, leaving notes) and charges the closure when she holds the photograph and letter together. However, it functions more as interpretive lens than on-page constraint. The piece demonstrates the concept rather than testing it under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Stoically sensitive" appears once as a descriptor ("stoically sensitive to every ripple that marked absence") but does not constrain an action or create visible tradeoff. The trait is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Marina's composure and emotional attunement are consistent but the specific pairing of stoicism and sensitivity does not generate friction on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears twice: "began her real work... excavating meaning" and "wrest another secret from the pavilion's foundation" and implicitly in the closure mission. The action frames the central turn (diving to retrieve the photograph) and the ending ritual. However, "wrest" could be replaced with "retrieve" or "recover" without structural loss—it is more voice-specific than mechanically essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (flashback to the inkwell's discovery in foundation stones), demonstrated in the middle beat (probing the column cavity), and executed at closure (placing the sealed note in the hollow). The mechanics matter: Marina chooses a specific column, uses oilcloth and wax, and the foundation repairs create the dead-drop possibility. The method is integral to both plot and theme, though a near-substitute (e.g., hiding notes in other ruins) could function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion constrains Marina's physical choices (wading, diving, cold water) and supplies the hollow column that enables the discovery. It charges the closure image: Marina standing in the ruined pavilion, moonlight on water, carrying artifacts home. The setting is causally active across setup, middle, and ending. Removing this exact location would require significant rewriting of tactics and atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The drawbridge rising at dusk and lowering at dawn brackets Marina's night work and establishes her dual identity. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure is felt, and the window is generous. The element provides atmosphere and access but does not alter tactics or create urgency on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Marina's desire to become "the archeologist of abandoned dreams" is established in paragraph two and drives her nightly ritual. The motivation is dramatized through her actions (searching, collecting, leaving notes) and the closure reinforces it. However, the motivation is not tested or conflicted—no choice forces her to weigh this identity against another want or cost. It shapes the premise but does not create friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" appears twice: the letter "ignited something in Marina—a hushed blaze that burned quietly but never extinguished" and the closure phrase "keeper of the flame that burned for things lost but not forgotten." The tone is consistent—quiet intensity, restrained passion—and modulates appropriately (wonder at discovery, solemnity at the ending). The tone charges the final image but is not tested under opposing pressure. Strong coherence, solid payoff.</comment>
