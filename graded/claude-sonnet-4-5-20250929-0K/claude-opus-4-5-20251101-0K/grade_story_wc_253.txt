<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's interior is concrete and specific: the self-narration as survival mechanism, the whittling as prayer, the blank face as armor. Her contradictory impulses—keeping the bouquet versus state compliance, performing blankness while carving grief figures—act simultaneously in scene. The final micro-choice (touching the brittle petals, the "almost" smile) forecloses total suppression with visible cost. Minor deduction: the "morally ambiguous in the eyes of the state" is told rather than purely dramatized through competing choices on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (the piece accumulates pressure through recurring motifs—turbines, narration, whittling, dried flowers—culminating in a cadence shift at closure). Orientation anchors promptly: wind turbines, farmhouse, Mira, the Happiness Mandate context by ~100 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mira's rebellion crystallizes as "quiet persistence of continuing," the almost-smile with the flowers watching, reweighting the opening heaviness with felt cost (she remains hollow but has carved space for transformed grief). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length. Slight deduction: the "remade hush" concept is articulated late and risks thematic echo rather than being fully dramatized as a tactic earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The turbines' shadows sweeping "like hands of a broken clock" constrain Mira's temporal experience and charge the final image of endless turning. The dried bouquet is handled twice (kitchen touch, final cracking petals) and reweights the closure. The whittling figures and porch setting ground the ritual physically. Minor deduction: the neighboring farms' abandonment is told exposition rather than shown through sensory encounter, and the drone's single pass could be more causally integrated into a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: cultivating a private space for grief under state surveillance. Pressure tightens from kitchen narration to whittling (seventeen figures mark escalation) to the drone pass to the brittle-petal touch, each forecloses total erasure. The whittling itself is a repeated, compounding act that narrows her to this one ritual. The final act (touching the flowers, continuing to chop vegetables "with the gravity of defusing a bomb") crystallizes her stance with cost: she remains surveilled, hollow, but refuses full erasure. Deduction: the drone pass could apply immediate jeopardy rather than passive observation; escalation is steady but lacks a sharp tightening choice mid-piece.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme—grief as shaped rather than erased, performance versus essence—emerges through whittling, self-narration, and the turbines' endless harnessing of force. The final image ("our story continues, one narrated moment at a time, until the performer and the performance become indistinguishable") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The dried flowers and wooden figures accumulate meaning across beats. Minor slip: "you couldn't mandate happiness any more than you could mandate the wind to stop" borders on direct statement, though the turbine metaphor earns it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mira's theatrical self-narration ("our heroine retrieves the sacred knife") filters every observation. Psychic distance is stable; the narrative voice modulates between her performed announcements and her quieter interiority without head-hopping. Diction stays within her performer's lexicon. Minor deduction: "morally ambiguous in the eyes of the state" and "cultivate lightness in grief" slip into slightly elevated, thematic register not fully grounded in her immediate sensory frame under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. "The wood surrenders its secrets" and the turbine-as-clock opener create textural specificity. Information density is high. Deduction: "The Happiness Mandate had passed three years ago, after the Great Mourning had nearly collapsed society" is backstory exposition that could be woven more tightly into present choice. "She didn't let herself acknowledge what she was carving" withholds from the reader what Mira already knows, creating brief artificiality. Filter-verb density ("she felt," "she understood") in reflective passages slightly dulls immediacy in a few lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—mandated happiness, performer surviving through self-narration, whittling as grief ritual—synthesizes familiar dystopian and coping elements into a specific, non-obvious angle. The turbines as both metaphor and physical constraint, the wooden figures as secret mourning practice, and the "remade hush" inflection feel fresh. The ending's near-smile and the performer/performance merger offer earned complexity. Minor deduction: the drone surveillance and abandoned farms are competent but recognizable genre furniture; the piece does not fully transform those tropes into irreplaceable particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira (blank-faced performer) is present throughout and her choices—narrating aloud, whittling the figures, touching the bouquet—create key turns. The final almost-smile and decision to continue alter her stance with cost. Setup clear, middle whittling choice constrains her, ending participation strong. Deduction: her performer trait is more frame than active pressure; the blank face is compliance armor rather than a choice that changes tactics under stress.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dried flower bouquet appears in opening (windowsill, "anchors to darkness"), mid-piece reminder, and closing beat where Mira touches it and feels petals crack. Three distinct touches; the final cracking physically embodies cost and charges the closure. Setup strong, middle presence steady, ending participation clear. Deduction: middle beat is description rather than a choice constrained by the flowers; the bouquet's causal pressure is atmospheric more than action-forcing.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Remade hush is articulated mid-piece ("a quietness that wasn't the void of suppression but something she had chosen") and echoed at closure ("In this remade hush, she had found her rebellion"). It frames her stance but does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics in a middle beat. Present in setup (implicitly), named in middle, returns at end; lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake. Deduction: the concept is thematic overlay rather than a tool that shapes decisions; removing it would not break plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Morally ambiguous is told ("this made her morally ambiguous in the eyes of the state") but not dramatized through a choice with visible tradeoff. Her keeping the flowers is defiance, but the state's view is exposition. Setup present, no middle choice directly constrained by this trait, closure does not hinge on it. Ornamental label.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Whittling shapes the middle act (seventeen figures, each week's ritual) and the closure (placing the small girl figure, touching petals, continuing as defusing-bomb metaphor). The act is irreplaceable: it embodies her transformation of grief and provides the physical cost (each stroke a meditation, the secret mourning practice). Setup strong, middle beats driven by it, ending participation clear. High irreplaceability and causal pressure across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dramatically narrating mundane tasks is signaled early ("the protagonist approaches the most dangerous task…washing dishes"), shapes middle beats ("Our heroine retrieves the sacred knife," "The ritual complete"), and charges the ending ("our story continues, one narrated moment at a time"). The method is her survival mechanism and frames every choice. Setup clear, middle mechanics active, ending participation strong. Deduction: the method is frame more than pressure; it does not constrain a choice so much as color it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Farmhouse and wind turbines anchor opening, provide the shadows-as-clock image, the turbine hum that "drowned out the silence," and the closing endless turning. The porch is the whittling stage. Setup strong, middle use steady (drone surveillance above, turbine hum as isolation choice), ending image (turbines turning) charges closure. Deduction: the setting supplies atmosphere more than tactical constraint; Mira's choices do not hinge on farmhouse resources or turbine proximity in a causal way.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>After the happiness mandate (three years post, seventeen weeks of whittling) establishes the rule-set, the surveillance pressure (drones, licensed grief facilities), and the timeline of Mira's ritual. Setup clear, middle choices (keeping flowers, staying on the farm) shaped by mandate consequences, ending stance is her response to it. Deduction: the timeframe is context rather than live clock; no ticking urgency tightens decisions in scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cultivate lightness in grief is dramatized through whittling ("each cut removed something unnecessary"), self-narration, and the final almost-smile. Her desire conflicts with state mandate and her own hollowness ("happiness had become impossible"). Setup present, middle acts (carving figures, touching flowers) embody the friction, ending cost visible (she remains hollow but persists). Deduction: the phrasing "cultivate lightness in grief" is articulated late and slightly abstract; the want could be more embodied in early micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Emotional void tone is established early ("face as empty as the mandate required," "hollowed her completely"), sustained through blank-face performance and drone compliance, and modulates at closure (the "almost" smile, the quiet persistence). The tone charges the final image: void as armor, not absence. Setup strong, middle coherence maintained, ending modulation purposeful. High integration; the tone is structural pressure and final reconfiguration.</comment>
