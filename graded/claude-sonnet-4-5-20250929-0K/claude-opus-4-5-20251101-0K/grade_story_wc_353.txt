<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and her occupation shapes perception (the tree-song sculptor seeing stress cracks as story). The discovery moment feels earned through her months of work. However, the internal arc lacks contradiction—she moves smoothly from problem to solution without genuine struggle or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The hedgehog's return and the closing vision of teaching others feel asserted rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the stress-crack discovery deepens the sonic problem, and the final playing beat reweights the premise (music travels inward, not outward). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—she finds a new channel and the cost is implicit (acceptance of the silence, commitment to a harder path). Orientation is clean. The midpoint turn (stress cracks teach her to reverse her approach) narrows options and the ending image charges prior material, though the cost could be more visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove anchors early and the ancient sculpture constrains her breakthrough. The porcelain insulator functions as both object and conceptual anchor (conducting without sound). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (stress cracks traced by fingertips, vibrations through bone). The grove returns at closure when roots "drink the vibrations," charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore music to the silent world) is signaled early and tightens when months of failure force a conceptual reversal. The stress-crack discovery is a meaningful deepening that changes her approach from outward transmission to inward conduction. The final playing is an act of agency with implicit cost (she commits to teaching a harder method, accepts the silence as permanent). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though a more visceral trade-off would elevate this further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (empathy as adaptation, finding paths that remain open) emerges organically from the stress-crack insight and the instrument's design. The sculpture teaching "how wood carried its wounds without breaking" avoids thesis statement by grounding the lesson in tactile discovery. The final image—"music had found a new way home"—reweights the premise without moralizing. "Cracks could become channels rather than endings" borders on abstraction but is anchored in her physical tracing of the sculpture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and controlled; the tree-song sculptor's perceptual signature (measuring time by creature unfoldings, reading stress cracks as story) is distinct and consistent. Reflection is anchored in present stimuli (the sculpture, the porcelain insulator) and tilts her choices. Diction stays within her idiom ("the slow creaking of growth rings expanding") without register drift. The brief "empathy in motion" meta-phrase in the penultimate section is a minor slip, but the sentence immediately returns to embodied action (the hedgehog feeling vibrations).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or atmosphere. Opening and closing images are strong. Minor issues: "The silence remained, intensely quiet, profound as prayer" stacks near-synonyms, and "refusing to let the music die completely" is a touch abstract for a high-pressure beat. "Sympathy bloomed inside her bones" should be "bloomed in her bones" for tighter idiom. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, and no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The silent-world premise is familiar, but the stress-crack method and bone-conducted music offer a fresh angle. The telegraph/insulator bridge is purposeful. The combination of tree-song sculptor + vibration channels feels organic rather than checklist-driven. However, the "hedgehog uncurls" timeframe and the ending's teaching-others vision lean toward template resolutions (lone artist becomes community teacher). Transformation test: the emotional arc (acceptance through adaptation) would survive with different names and trades.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tree-song sculptor shapes perception (stress cracks as story, listening through touch) and drives the central turn (carving the new instrument). The occupation enables her months of failure and the final breakthrough. Present in setup, middle discovery, and closure playing. Causal role in two beats and closure linkage evident. The trait could not be swapped without breaking the logic of her solution.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Porcelain insulator appears in the middle third as a conceptual anchor (conducting invisible messages) and its mounting wires become instrument strings. Two distinct beats: study and salvage. However, it does not appear in the closure image—the final playing centers on the instrument and the grove. Functional but not indispensable to the ending's charge. A stronger reprise in the final paragraph would lift this.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Empathy in motion is dramatized when the instrument "didn't fight the soundless world; it moved with it, finding the paths that remained open." This insight changes her approach from resistance to adaptation and enables the ending's shared vibration (hedgehog, alders). Present by implication in setup, explicit in the discovery beat, and operative at closure. However, the concept is briefly named rather than fully embodied in a choice with visible cost. Strong closure linkage but slightly declarative.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Symphonically minded is stated early ("her thoughts arranged in movements and crescendos") and shapes her refusal to let music die. It colors her perception but does not constrain a specific choice with cost. The trait is consistent but functions more as characterization than as a lever that alters tactics. Mentioned in setup, implied in the closing "composing a symphony," but lacks a middle beat where the trait forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strum is the climactic action: "she felt the vibrations travel through her fingertips, up her wrists, into her chest." This beat is the first proof of her new method and enables the closure's shared music (hedgehog, alders, future teaching). Signaled by "carving instruments" earlier, executed on-page, and directly shapes the ending. Cannot be swapped; the story's resolution depends on this exact action proving the bone-conduction principle.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Analyzing stress cracks is signaled in the middle ("the stress cracks that covered its surface told a story Maren had never thought to read") and provides the key insight that reverses her approach. The method's mechanics matter: cracks map resistance/yield, teaching her that vibration should travel inward. Present in discovery beat and applied in the instrument's design ("channels for vibration to flow"). The method drives the turn and is essential to her solution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Siskin alder grove anchors the story spatially from the opening and houses the forgotten sculpture. It returns at closure when "the siskin alders swayed without wind, their roots drinking the vibrations." Setup, middle discovery location, and closure participation all present. The grove's roots become part of the solution (vibration network), giving it functional weight. However, the grove could plausibly be another tree species with minor edits; "siskin" is specific but not mechanically essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>After the hedgehog uncurls establishes an initial anchor and the hedgehog returns at closure, creating a reprise. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Maren works "for months" with no urgency marker, and the dawn playing has no competing clock. The hedgehog's presence is more symbolic than temporal; time remains vague. Lyric resonance (hedgehog bookend) is purposeful but the timeframe does not pressure tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To create music in a silent world is dramatized through her months of failed instruments, the stress-crack insight, and the final playing. The desire drives every beat and the closure pays it off when "music had found a new way home." Friction appears when she realizes she's been "approaching her instruments wrong," forcing a reversal. Setup, middle turn, and closure all hinge on this motive. The ending's teaching vision extends the desire with visible commitment (she will "create instruments for every survivor").</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Intensely quiet is sustained through "the silence had come three winters ago," "no sound emerged into the air," and the closing "The silence remained, intensely quiet, profound as prayer." The tone coheres across turns and modulates at the playing beat (internal blooming vs. external stillness). The final image charges the oxymoron (silence + song coexist). The tone is not merely static mood; it creates the story's central constraint and reweights at closure when music finds "a new way home" within the quiet.</comment>
