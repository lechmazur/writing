<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's interiority carries specificity ("loneliness felt as familiar as her own skin"), but her sister exists primarily as a metaphor rather than a character with contradictory impulses. The final choice to "tell our story" feels asserted rather than earned through prior on-page struggle between competing wants. Embodied emotion appears intermittently ("cracked something open inside her") but peaks rely on abstraction ("raw material of longing"). The reconciliation unfolds without visible friction or cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (fog, carnival decay, the emerald swatch building toward a lyric reconfiguration). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the sisters choosing remembrance, but the cost remains asserted ("chosen to be remembered") rather than dramatically legible—no on-page action or forfeiture makes the price undeniable. The sister's solidity shift ("hand grew solid") tells rather than shows the stakes crystallizing. Causality holds, but closure lacks the sharp before/after with felt cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The carnival ship supplies vivid, selective detail (rusted Ferris wheel, rotted canvas, carousel horses with "blissfully aberrant joy") filtered through Maya's search. The emerald swatch card returns with charged meaning in the final image, constraining her approach and framing the Garden concept. Fog and decay modulate throughout, shaping tone and reflecting internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography remains clear across the tilted corridors and carousel.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the sister/reclaim the forgotten name) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sister appears and resists return, but Maya's persuasion lacks on-page friction—she "began speaking" and immediate success follows without trade-off or visible price. The Garden's threat (erasure) is conceptual rather than pressing a choice with escalating cost. Agency at closure reads as wish rather than renunciation or endurance with foreclosed paths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme (memory, erasure, the cost of being known vs. forgotten) emerges through carnival imagery and the Garden concept. "Unkindled solace" and "trapped freedom" deepen the question without overt moralizing. The ending attempts a resonant answer (choosing remembrance over erasure) but the "promise kept" line edges toward summary. Particulars (the swatch, the carousel, fog) accumulate meaning, though the final beat tells the thematic point more than it charges the image with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single POV; perceptual signature is consistent ("watching her reflection split and merge," "fog has been my home so long"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("unkindled solace," "blissfully aberrant joy") that reads slightly imposed rather than organic to Maya's crisis state. The sister's voice converges with Maya's idiom at their encounter, which fits thematic mirroring but lacks distinct rhythm. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully around key images.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening and closing images carry charge. Minor scaffold appears: "She was trying to..." / "I've been trying to..." creates near-loop, and "memories alter" / "as memories alter" recycles phrasing. The phrase "raw material of longing" and "inventing what she couldn't remember, creating truth" tell rather than compress high-stakes beats. Figurative language (Ferris wheel as "forgotten promise," support poles as "pleading hands") occasionally stacks without causal work. Density is moderate; no severe artifacts touch closure directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Carnival-as-metaphor and amnesiac-twin tropes appear; the Garden of Forgotten Names offers a lyric inflection. The emerald swatch as talisman and the poster clue (Chimera Twins) anchor specificity. Risk-taking in the fog-as-erasure conceit and the sister's resistance provides texture, but the resolution (storytelling restores solidity) relies on a familiar emotional-healing template without a non-obvious moral calculus or unexpected cost. Transformation test: the arc could transfer to other liminal settings (abandoned theater, lighthouse) with similar effect.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya (chimera twin discoverer) drives the search and makes the final choice to "tell our story." Setup clear, middle involves navigating the ship, closure features her speaking the sister into solidity. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is observational until the carousel encounter. Her choice at the end alters the sister's state, but the mechanics (speaking = solidity) are asserted rather than tested with cost. Causal pressure moderate; swappable for "seeker finds lost twin" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emerald swatch card appears early (grandmother gives it), returns in the journals and the sister's dress color, and falls in the final image. Three touches across setup, middle, closure. It frames expectation and charges the ending ("promise kept"), but its properties (color-matching) are passive—Maya does not handle or use it in a choice under pressure. Lyric reprise reweights the Garden concept, lifting it above ornamental, but causal work is modest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Unkindled solace" appears once as a label for the sister's state ("unkindled solace was all her sister had left"). Setup absent; introduced late in the sister's dialogue without earlier priming. No middle development; not revisited at closure. The concept enriches theme but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Ornamental use; swappable with "cold comfort" or "hollow peace." Missing setup and development gates cap eligibility.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Blissfully aberrant" describes the carousel horses' eyes once. Introduced mid-story, no setup or closure link. The phrase colors tone but does not enable or constrain an action with cost. Label-only mention; no tradeoff or causal pressure. Missing setup and development gates; ornamental. Could be removed without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Recapture" shapes Maya's goal from the opening ("searching for something," "Find your sister"). Middle beats involve her navigating clues and the carousel ride attempting to recapture memory. Closure features her actively recapturing the sister through storytelling. Three gates met; causal role in multiple beats. The action is essential to the arc, though the final mechanics (speech = solidity) are told rather than tested with friction. Specific enough to resist easy swap.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Through narrative threads" appears in the reflective passage ("piecing together stories from newspaper clippings...whispered dreams") and at closure ("weaving narrative threads"). Setup and payoff present; middle development unclear—Maya's physical search dominates until the ending, where storytelling becomes the method. The mechanics are asserted late rather than dramatized with cost. Functional but the method's execution (how storytelling alters the sister) lacks on-page specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival ship in foggy bay anchors every beat: rusted Ferris wheel, funhouse mirrors, faded posters, tilted corridors, carousel. Setup immediate, middle navigation pressures Maya's search, closure occurs on deck as fog thins. The setting supplies resources (posters as clues, carousel as ritual site) and reflects the erasure theme without postcard stasis. Spatial choreography clear; the environment constrains movement and charges the final image (ship drifting toward sun). Essential across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"As memories alter" frames the timeframe conceptually (memories shifting during Maya's search). Setup present in the opening reflections; no middle tightening via a live clock. Closure does not feature time pressure—fog thins without urgency. The element enriches theme but does not narrow tactics or escalate choices. Vague tracking; no felt deadline. Functional for atmosphere, replaceable for pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Finding the Garden of Forgotten Names drives Maya from the grandmother's deathbed clue through the ship search to the sister encounter. Setup clear, middle involves decoding clues and reaching the carousel, closure pivots on choosing remembrance over the Garden's erasure. Desire is dramatized through action (boarding the ship, climbing the carousel) and conflicted at the end (sister resists, Maya persuades). Three gates met; causal backbone. The friction at closure is modest (sister flickers, then solidifies quickly), limiting cost visibility.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Trapped freedom" is named explicitly ("This was trapped freedom...Movement without destination, joy without release") and embodied in the frozen carousel, the drifting ship, the sister's fog-bound existence. Setup via carnival imagery, middle crystallizes the concept at the carousel, closure attempts release (ship drifts toward sun, sisters leave together). Tone modulates from searching to encounter to tentative hope. The final image charges the paradox, but the resolution (escape from the trap) is told rather than felt, slightly deflating the tonal payoff.</comment>
