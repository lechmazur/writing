<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal state shows some contradictions—drawn by habit yet carrying the lens as "protection"—but her final choice to give away the lens feels somewhat unmotivated beyond thematic necessity. Theo's accused past and ongoing mistrust are told rather than shown in present pressure; his "shoulders loosened" declares rather than embodies the thaw. The exchange of lens and ticket reads as symbolic choreography more than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; the line "their eyes met with the weight of entire conversations" tells rather than dramatizes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the post-language world is established early, pressure accumulates through Mira's observation and the exchange of objects, and the final image reconfigures prior material (the lens as distance-keeping tool, the doodles as translation of chaos). Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the exchange crystallizes a shift from mistrust to shared presence, and the final beat (Mira adding to the ticket, Theo's shoulders loosening) reweights the dominant stake. Cost is felt but oblique—Mira gives away her "protection," Theo's ice "begins to thaw"—and the consequence remains largely conceptual rather than actionable. The orientation is anchored by ~120 words (Mira, forecourt, night registrar role), so no penalty applies. One deduction: the eleven-year backstory and three-month world-change are exposition blocks that compress momentum slightly, though they anchor the present stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt is vivid and purposeful: the crystalline acoustics amplify sound, which Mira uses to eavesdrop, and the forecourt "sang softly" in the closure beat, charging the final image. Sensory detail (wet stones, raindrops on crystal walls, scratch of pen) is filtered through Mira's night-registrar attention. The body is less developed—Mira walks, sits, holds objects—but the projector lens as micro-setting object constrains her gaze and is relinquished at the climax. The post-rain atmosphere supports tone. One cap: the lens must constrain a choice to reach 9+; here it mediates perception and is traded, but the trade feels more symbolic than tactically forced, so the score stays in the 6-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—thawing mistrust with transparency—is signaled early (Theo's accused past, Mira's eavesdropping habit) and tightens in the exchange: Mira offers her distance-tool, Theo reciprocates with a ticket. This is one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. However, no live option is foreclosed with visible cost; the exchange is voluntary and cooperative rather than forced by escalating pressure. The cost is conceptual (Mira gives away "carefully constructed distance") but not dramatized as a trade-off or renunciation with immediate consequence. Agency is present—Mira steps forward, extends her hand—but the stakes remain largely internal and abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the post-language world and the exchange of objects: truth can be "drawn as easily as spoken," honesty requires "courage to show and receive." The final image (two figures stepping through the door together) offers a visual answer to the central question without stating a moral. However, the ending paragraph moralizes ("some beginnings required no registration at all—only presence, offered and accepted") and explicitly articulates the theme rather than trusting the image to carry it. The projector lens and doodles are purposeful motifs that shift meaning, but the resonance is diluted by direct statement. One penalty for thematic echo in the final paragraph: −0.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV (Mira) is clean with no head-hopping; distance is stable and controlled. Diction is elevated and specific ("crystal whispering forecourt," "ambiguously clear," "calcified around him like ice") with a consistent perceptual signature—Mira's attention to acoustics, eavesdropping, and archival detail. The prose has rhythmic variety and purpose. One minor slip: "the weight of entire conversations" and "fractured harmonics" lean toward stock lyricism under emotional pressure, but they remain legible and voice-motivated. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance shifts are intentional and serve the exchange beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are mostly strong, but several loops and scaffold sentences dilute density. "The crystal walls caught their exchange and whispered it back in fractured harmonics, spreading the moment through the forecourt like ripples in still water" stacks metaphors without adding pressure. "Something shifted between them" is abstract summary. The final paragraph contains two paraphrase loops: "freed by honesty that needed no words" echoes "honesty in her contradictions," and "some beginnings required no registration at all—only presence" restates the prior beat. These loops touch the closure paragraph, so the penalty escalates: −1.2 in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact rule. Template cadence is not present, but the stacked figurative language in the closure beat ("crystal catching starlight and rain," "resonant hush," "space where mistrust once lived") feels ornamental rather than propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The post-language world and the exchange of symbolic objects offer a fresh frame, and the specific roles (night registrar, translator) ground the concept. However, the core emotional arc—two isolated people overcoming mistrust through a gesture of vulnerability—is familiar, and the resolution lacks a non-obvious synthesis. The projector lens and doodles are purposeful but not irreplaceable; similar tokens could serve the same function. The piece commits to its premise but does not transform the template with lived particulars that feel inevitable. No derivative penalty, but the originality remains mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira (quiet night registrar) is present throughout, eavesdrops (middle beat), and makes the key decision to offer the lens (closure beat). Setup, development, and payoff gates are all met. However, her choice is voluntary and cooperative rather than forced by narrowing options; the decision alters tactics only in the sense that she relinquishes her "protection." Causal pressure is modest. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but swappability (another isolated professional could serve similarly) −0.5, voluntary exchange (no visible cost that forecloses a path) −0.4. Baseline 3.0 + 2.0 = 5.0, rounded to 5.2 for specificity of the registrar role anchoring her attention to "final recorded words."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The projector lens appears early (first third), is used twice (Mira observes raindrops and Theo through it, then Theo looks at Mira through it after she gives it to him), and is central to the closure beat. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The lens mediates perception and is traded with reweighted meaning ("giving away a piece of her carefully constructed distance"). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (its distortion effect matters) +0.5. Baseline 3.0 + 3.2 = 6.2. However, the lens's distortion ("ambiguously clear") is more thematic label than functional constraint; it does not narrow options or impose cost beyond the conceptual. Causal pressure is modest: +0.7. Final 6.9, rounded to 7.1 for strong closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The concept "freed by honesty" is explicitly stated in the final paragraph and operates as the story's thesis. It shapes the dominant stake (thawing mistrust with transparency) and is dramatized in the exchange of lens and ticket. Setup is present (Theo's mistrust established early), development occurs (the exchange), and payoff appears in the final image. However, the concept is largely thematic rather than tactical; it does not narrow options or impose a cost beyond the conceptual. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but swappability (another trust-building concept could serve) −0.5, summary/label-only use ("freed by honesty" is told in the final paragraph) −0.5. Baseline 3.0 + 1.4 = 4.4, rounded to 4.8 for thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The attribute "ambiguously clear" appears as a descriptor for the lens effect ("sharp in focus but wavering in meaning") and is applied to Mira herself when Theo looks at her through the lens. Setup is early, payoff is in the closure beat, but development (middle constraint) is weak; the attribute does not constrain a choice with cost. It functions as thematic label rather than actionable trait. Early signal +0.4, closure linkage +0.8, but label-only use (no on-page action altered by ambiguity) −0.7, swappability (another descriptor could serve) −0.5. Baseline 3.0 + 0.0 = 3.0, adjusted to 4.3 for purposeful reprise in the closure beat that reweights Mira's self-perception.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mira eavesdrops on Theo by positioning herself where "the crystal acoustics would carry his sounds to her." This action is signaled early, uses the forecourt's properties, and enables her to observe Theo's doodles, which prompts her approach. Setup and development gates are met. However, the eavesdropping does not drive a major turn; Mira would likely have approached Theo regardless, and the information gained (pen scratching, doodles) is observational rather than choice-altering. Early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, causal pressure (enables observation) +0.6, but swappability (she could simply walk closer) −0.6, no closure linkage −0.0. Baseline 3.0 + 0.9 = 3.9, adjusted to 5.9 for coherent use of the forecourt's acoustics as a forecourt-specific tactic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theo's method "through cryptic doodles on concert tickets" is established early (middle of first third), shown in detail (spiraling lines, hollow eyes, door ajar), and reappears in the closure beat when Mira adds to one ticket. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The doodles are Theo's way of "translating inner chaos" in the post-language world, and they prompt Mira's understanding and approach. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (concert tickets + doodles are particular) +0.5, causal pressure (Mira's approach is motivated by seeing the doodles) +0.8. Baseline 3.0 + 3.8 = 6.8, adjusted to 6.4 for modest swappability (another visual medium could serve similarly).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt after rain is established early, supplies the acoustics Mira uses to eavesdrop, and "sang softly" in the closure beat, charging the final image. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The forecourt's crystalline properties enable Mira's tactic and amplify the exchange into "fractured harmonics." Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (crystal acoustics are unique) +0.6, causal pressure (enables eavesdropping) +0.7. Baseline 3.0 + 3.9 = 6.9, adjusted to 6.2 for modest constraint (the acoustics help but do not force Mira's approach).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after words become unnecessary" is established early ("three months ago, humanity had crossed a threshold") and shapes the story's premise: Theo draws doodles because verbal translation is obsolete, and the exchange occurs in "the silence after language." Setup and payoff gates are met, but development is weak; the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics in the middle. It functions as backdrop rather than active constraint. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.8, specificity (post-language world is particular) +0.5, but no middle pressure −0.0, swappability (another isolating world-change could serve) −0.5. Baseline 3.0 + 1.4 = 4.4, adjusted to 5.6 for coherent integration into stakes (thawing mistrust in a world where "everyone could sense intention").</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to thaw mistrust with transparency" is dramatized in her choice to offer the lens and Theo's reciprocation. The dominant stake is signaled early (Theo's mistrust, Mira's eavesdropping) and resolved in the closure beat. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the motivation is largely cooperative and voluntary; friction between want and cost is conceptual ("giving away a piece of her carefully constructed distance") rather than visceral. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +0.8, but told rather than shown in peak beats ("the mistrust that had calcified around him like ice began to thaw") −0.6. Baseline 3.0 + 2.9 = 5.9, adjusted to 6.7 for coherent through-line.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone "resonant hush" is established early ("soft echoes," "resonant hush of the forecourt") and modulates with pressure: the forecourt "sang softly" and "whispered it back in fractured harmonics" in the closure beat. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The tone is coherent, purposeful, and charges the final image. Early signal +0.7, three beats (opening, middle, closure) +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, specificity (crystal acoustics + silence after language) +0.6. Baseline 3.0 + 4.0 = 7.0, adjusted to 7.4 for strong integration across beats and effective modulation under emotional pressure.</comment>
