<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mei Lin's interiority is concrete and specific—the shift from Cold War operative to fortune writer is traced through micro-choices (wearing the specs, preparing the box, writing the journalist's fortune). Internal contradiction appears in her simultaneous desire for revelation and continued orchestration. The backstory, while substantial (~25%), anchors in present stimuli (the specs, tonight's batch, tomorrow's journalist) and tilts present stance through the box-preparation choice. However, the final "orchestrate her own revelation" move reads more告知 than embodied cost; the renunciation lacks visible friction or a moment where competing impulses act simultaneously in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (lighthouse keeper, Mei Lin, present night/tomorrow dawn) land cleanly by ~10% and the pattern of parallels (old spy work/new fortune work, microdots/fortunes, Cold War/present) is taught early. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the box-gift decision crystallizes her shift from hidden to revealed with conceptual cost (end of secrecy, transposition into "harmless eccentric"). The cost is legible in the final fortune and the journalist framing. One meaningful deepening occurs when she decides to give away the specs, reweighting all prior fortune-writing as orchestration. Lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse lamp room, rocky island, mainland ferry, and rotating beam provide spatial grounding and constrain her isolation, which pressures the journalist decision. The microdot specs function as micro-setting (object-as-setting): they're handled in two beats (worn while writing, placed in the box) and their physical presence charges the final choice. The beam's sweep returns as a rhythmic anchor ("swept past again") and the island's "silence and fog" filters through her operative mindset. Setting details are woven through action (spread tools, looked out, removed specs) rather than static catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transpose from hidden operative to revealed eccentric, signaled early ("transpose life into a new key"). One meaningful tightening occurs when the journalist's impending arrival forces the box-gift decision, narrowing options from perpetual hiding to controlled revelation. The escalation is character-driven (her choice to give the specs) and the cost is visible: she forecloses the secrecy that defined forty years. Agency is decision (prepare the box, write the final fortune) that alters her stance. No coincidence resolves; the journalist arrives because Mei Lin's pattern was already on paper. The price—end of operative anonymity—is felt in "final act of spycraft" and "harmless creator."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (truth hiding in plain sight / open secrets perpetually invisible) emerges from the fortune cookie mechanics, the journalist's seventeen-event correlation, and the microdot specs' forty-year uselessness—concrete particulars, not assertion. The final image ("Some lights guide ships; others guide the keeper home") offers a non-literal answer to the transposition question, reweighting her spy career as misdirected guidance and her fortunes as self-guidance. Subtext operates in "accidentally prophetic" (she knows it's pattern recognition, not magic) and "mean everything to someone, and nothing to everyone else." No overt moralizing; the journalist frame invites reflection without stating a thesis. One thematic weakness: "open secrets" is articulated multiple times in expository reflection rather than fully dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, third-limited, stable throughout. Perceptual signature is specific: operative lexicon ("handler," "dead drops," "cipher keys"), pattern-recognition framing ("currents before waves"), and the recurring "orchestrate" verb. Diction remains character-coherent (grad-school recruit turned island recluse). Filter verbs ("thought about," "understood") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull key beats. No dialogue on the page, so dialogue bullets are inapplicable. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. One register slip: "transpose life into a new key" recurs three times and edges toward authorial phrasing rather than strictly Mei Lin's interior idiom, though the musical metaphor is introduced early enough to read as her vocabulary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high: most lines do double duty (fortunes illustrate prophecy and advance the journalist setup). Clarity is strong except for two friction points: "directing flow" and "orchestrate meaning" are repeated near-synonyms that loop without added pressure (−0.3). The final paragraph's "accidentally prophetic, each one a small act of orchestration" restates the thesis already established, creating minor scaffold (−0.2). No mixed metaphors or template cadence runs. Grammar and tense are clean. The prose is serviceable but not lyric; no standout propulsion or figurative control in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of Cold War spy + fortune cookie writer + pattern recognition is specific and non-obvious. The microdot specs embedded in reading glasses is a fresh detail. However, the "open secrets" frame and the "truth hides in plain sight" fortune echo familiar writerly axioms about subtext without fully transforming them. The lighthouse-as-metaphor for guidance is earned but not startling. Emotional truth (decades of waiting, transposing failure into meaning) grounds the premise. The journalist frame provides a fresh angle on the "hermit's revelation" trope. No close echoes of famous lines, but the core insight ("people prefer mystery to meaning") is a common workshop adage given narrative flesh rather than reinvented.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mei Lin is present throughout, makes the box-gift decision that drives closure, writes the journalist's fortune ("truth hides best when spoken plainly"), and chooses to transpose from hidden to revealed. Her choices create the key turn (prepare the box) and shape the ending image. Signaled early, developed in the middle reflection, and active at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The specs are worn while writing (beat 1), their embedded microdots described as "forty-seven microfilm documents" (beat 2), and removed/placed in the box (beat 3). They return in the closure decision ("give them to the journalist") and their "outdated, useless, still classified" status charges the final cost. Early signal, multiple beats, closure-active, irreplaceable (no generic glasses could carry the same Cold War weight).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Open secrets" is introduced early, illustrated with the Wall/towers fortunes, and articulated in the journalist exchange ("truth hides best when spoken plainly"). It shapes the journalist's interest (seventeen fortunes preceded events) and Mei Lin's final tactic (reveal by giving specs). However, it functions more as thematic frame than on-page constraint; it doesn't narrow a tactical choice under pressure so much as color her worldview. Solid thematic integration, modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Accidentally prophetic" is signaled in paragraph two, illustrated with the 1989 Wall and 2001 towers fortunes (beat 1), explained as pattern recognition (beat 2), and drives the journalist's arrival (beat 3). It enables Mei Lin's transposition choice (her fortunes matter because they preceded events) and carries visible cost (the journalist will decode, ending her mystery). Constrains the journalist's interest and Mei Lin's final move.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Orchestrate" appears early ("orchestrate meaning itself"), recurs in the middle ("orchestrate her own revelation"), and governs the closure action (prepare the box, write the journalist's fortune, control the reveal). The journalist decision is an act of orchestration. Swapping "orchestrate" for "control" or "arrange" would slightly weaken the musical-key metaphor thread but not break the plot. Strong causal role, modest irreplaceability penalty.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"By directing flow" is introduced alongside "orchestrate" in paragraph four and restated in the final paragraph ("directing the flow of information one last time"). The method is asserted rather than shown in action; we see her writing fortunes and preparing the box, but the mechanics of "directing flow" versus any other information-control method are not distinguished on the page. It shapes her self-concept and the thematic framing, but does not alter tactics in a beat. Present, thematically coherent, mechanically vague.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse is anchored early (keeper, lamp room, circular desk, automated beam), frames her isolation ("belonged entirely to silence and fog"), and the beam's rotation provides rhythmic punctuation. The rocky island setting enables her decades of isolation (no ferry contact) and pressures the journalist's arrival (dawn ferry). The final fortune ("Some lights guide ships; others guide the keeper home") reweights the setting with thematic resonance. However, the lighthouse does not constrain a tactical choice in the main decision beats; it's atmospheric and symbolic more than causally pressure-creating. Strong setup, closure reprise, modest middle development.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After last orders, when the mainland ferry had departed" anchors the present night and creates isolation (no interruption possible). "Tomorrow, a journalist was coming" and "ferry would bring the journalist at dawn" bracket the night's work and create a soft deadline. However, the timeframe does not tighten a choice or force a trade-off on the page; Mei Lin has "until then" to write two hundred fortunes, and the pacing is leisurely reflection rather than clock-driven pressure. Present, functional, not load-bearing for escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Transpose life into a new key" is introduced in paragraph five, developed through the minor-to-resolved metaphor, and governs the box-gift decision. Mei Lin's desire to resolve her "abandoned spy career" into "something that mattered" drives the journalist choice and the fortunes' thematic reframing. The motivation is dramatized in the box preparation and the final fortune. One friction: "transpose" recurs three times and edges toward tell rather than embodied want, but the musical metaphor is specific enough to her voice. Desire is conflicted (pride in orchestration vs. cost of revelation) and shapes closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Familiar enigma" is named twice (paragraph nine, final paragraph) and evoked through the locals' legend-not-news perception and the journalist's seventeen-event mystery. Tone is consistent: ruminative, ironic, quietly knowing. It modulates slightly (reflective in the backstory passages, purposeful in the box-gift beat) and charges the final image ("always visible, rarely seen"). However, the tone remains largely static contemplation rather than a dramatic arc; there's no sharp tonal shift under peak pressure. Coherent, apt, modest modulation.</comment>
