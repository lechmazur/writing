<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's transformation and decision to dive are motivated by coherent desire, and Jonas's guarded-to-raw arc via the scrimshaw is purposeful. However, the Treaty backstory (violence becomes impossible) feels like convenient world-building that doesn't constrain Mira's central choice—she was already hiding her nature. The final plunge reads as relief rather than a trade-off with visible cost; we don't see what she forfeits on land beyond Jonas's presence, which she leaves easily.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors quickly (sublittoral fringe, Mira's transformation) and tracks a clear causal line: grandmother's deathbed gift → scrimshaw map → whale call → dive. Closure is a Decisive Change (Mira crosses the island threshold), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—"chains detach," "freedom" declared—without showing what specific future or relationship she sacrifices. The Treaty's causal role is unclear: it enables her to emerge, yet the story never tests whether violence-as-fear was the true lock on her identity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is vividly rendered ("dream caught between tides," "distant shimmer") and the scrimshaw's warming/glowing mechanic matters at key beats. The tidal pool and underwater descent are spatially coherent, and the whale + underwater mountain visually charge the ending. Dock-worker detail is gestural (seven years, fluid movements) without showing how that skill or setting constrains her final choice, keeping it from the high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—find the island and embrace her true nature—is signaled early and tightens when the whale calls and the scrimshaw completes its map. The farewell to Jonas and the dive constitute one meaningful turn. However, no live obstacle opposes her: the Treaty removed violence/fear, Jonas supports her, and the island appears on cue. The "already beginning its slow fade" detail suggests cost (urgency), but it doesn't force a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of self-acceptance versus imposed shapes emerges through concrete images (fused legs, unlocked hearts, "detaching" old life). The scrimshaw and whale function as motifs that reweight at closure. Yet the Treaty's "violence becomes impossible" premise feels under-explored thematically—if fear is gone, why did Mira wait? The ending asserts "freedom" and "home" rather than offering a non-literal image that reweights prior material with ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly on Mira; psychic distance modulates well (close during transformation reflection, outward during action). Diction is mostly consistent, though "combative in its tenderness" and "the Treaty of Still Waters" edge toward elevated register. Jonas's dialogue ("You're going to hurt yourself" / "your heart") carries subtext and goal (persuade her to stay), and his rough "Find your freedom" shifts stance credibly. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and key images ("dream caught between tides," "chains...detach and drift away like shed scales") are vivid. Minor loops: "guarded hearts" appears twice in close succession (scrimshaw effect, Jonas's walls); "detach" recurs (Treaty, Mira's nature, final chains) without escalating meaning each time. The phrase "combative tenderness" is declared, then illustrated (Jonas's touch "combative in its tenderness"), which reads as scaffold. Information density is generally high, and no major template cadence runs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mermaid-transformation + underwater sanctuary premise is familiar, but the Treaty twist (violence-impossible world enables hidden identities) offers a fresh synthesis. The scrimshaw's dual function (map + heart-unlocker) and the sublittoral-fringe setting are specific. However, the emotional arc (hiding → acceptance → belonging) follows a well-worn template without unexpected cost or moral friction. The island's fade mechanic is introduced late and not causally tested, reducing inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira drives the dive decision and her prior hiding (seven years as dock worker) frames her need. Her choice at the tidal pool edge is the story's hinge. However, the decision feels low-friction—Jonas supports, the whale calls, the island appears—so her agency doesn't narrow hard options. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure; causal but not sharply constrained.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scrimshaw appears in three beats: deathbed gift (setup), unlocking Jonas's heart (middle), and glowing/completing map at the whale's call (closure catalyst). Its dual properties (map + heart-unlocker) are specific and irreplaceable. It enables the dive and charges Mira's bond with Jonas. Strong integration, though the heart-unlocking trait could be explored with visible cost (e.g., Mira's own walls stripped).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The disappearing island is the story's destination and frames urgency ("vanishes once you've found what you need"). It shapes Mira's tactics (follow the map, dive when the whale calls) and appears in the ending ("already beginning its slow fade"). The vanishing mechanic is asserted but not dramatically tested—Mira crosses the threshold without racing the fade. Causal and closure-present, but the stakes tied to its disappearance aren't felt on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The attribute appears once: the scrimshaw unlocks Jonas's guarded heart, making him "raw and real" with Mira. This enables their tender farewell but doesn't constrain Mira's dive or create visible friction (e.g., does unlocking hearts burden her?). Setup-present but not developed in middle action or tied to closure cost. Functional but replaceable; the story works if Jonas simply trusted her.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Detach" threads the story: the Treaty detached violence-capacity, Mira detached herself from her nature, her legs fused (reverse detachment), and final chains "detach and drift away." The word anchors both the world rule and her internal arc, culminating in the ending's release. It's specific, irreplaceable, and charges the closure image. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The whale call is signaled in grandmother's lore ("sequence of whale songs") and arrives twice on the page: first prompting the scrimshaw to glow, second guiding Mira to the island. It's the method by which the map completes and the island becomes findable, shaping her dive tactics. Present in setup (lore), middle (call triggers map), and closure (whale circles the island). Causal and necessary.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is vividly described in the opening and situates Mira's liminality ("between tides," "surface world distant shimmer"). The tidal pool and deeper water provide spatial staging for the dive. However, the setting doesn't constrain choice—Mira's transformation already suits the environment. It enriches atmosphere and charges the ending descent but doesn't alter tactics or cost. Setup, closure-present, atmospheric but not pressure-applying.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The Treaty occurred three months ago, Mira's legs fused two weeks later; this timeline situates her emergence post-violence world. However, "after violence becomes impossible" shapes context more than decision-pressure. The Treaty removes fear (she has "nothing left to fear"), but the story doesn't test what she might lose in the post-violence world by leaving. Timeframe present in setup and middle but doesn't tighten the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's desire to stop hiding and "embrace what they truly were" is concrete: she spent "her life detaching herself from her own nature." The dive enacts this motivation with embodied cost (leaving Jonas, the surface). Jonas voices the friction ("your heart...something that might not exist"). The motivation is setup-early, tested in the middle dialogue, and fulfilled at closure. Clear want-versus-cost structure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Combative tenderness" is named twice (Jonas's touch, then as learned stance) and illustrated in his rough farewell and Mira's gratitude. The tone modulates from wistful (opening imagery) to intimate (Jonas scene) to exultant (dive). However, the label feels imposed rather than organic—Jonas's tenderness isn't combative in action, just reluctant. Present but not seamlessly woven; the phrase reads as thematic declaration more than felt texture.</comment>
