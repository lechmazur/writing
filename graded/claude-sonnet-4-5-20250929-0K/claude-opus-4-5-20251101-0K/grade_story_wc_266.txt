<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("small fears," "swallowed words") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The guides remain abstract facilitators without individual agency or pressure. The "leash" metaphor and widow-liberation arc feel template-driven, and the final gathering of "flames" reads as symbolic convenience rather than earned character work. The ending choice lacks visible cost because Mira's transformation is asserted through metaphor rather than a concrete forfeiture or micro-choice that closes off a prior path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the flame-gathering moment, but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible—no prior path is visibly foreclosed on the page. The ridgeway tour functions as a guided meditation rather than a pressure sequence with because/therefore linkage. Orientation anchors appear early (widow on ridgeway, three days post-death), but the geography remains allegorical rather than spatially coherent. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending delivers symbolic convergence without a meaningful tightening or cadence shift that reweights Mira's stance with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "veiled ridgeway," "mist," and "twilight" are vivid but remain postcard elements that do not constrain Mira's choices or supply resources affecting outcome. The star-punch and flames function as symbolic props rather than tactile objects with causal pressure. Spatial choreography is vague—guides "gather closer," the path "winds," but no body, tool, or micro-setting detail alters tactics. The shoreline of light at closure is atmospheric but does not charge the final image through concrete interaction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming unused courage—is signaled early but never tested by a live trade-off or visible price on the page. The ridgeway walk presents a series of reflective tableaux (university, job, mother's hand) without escalation or a choice that narrows options. The ending grants Mira all the flames without forfeiture; no credible loss shapes tactics. The guides' "gently persistent" presence offers companionship but no opposition, and coincidence (finding the guides) initiates the journey without agency-driven turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of deferred courage emerges clearly from the ridgeway vignettes and resists overt moralizing until the final guide's line "it is never too late to become who you always could have been," which edges toward platitude. The star-punch motif recurs but remains decorative rather than constraining choice. The ending image—Mira walking on with gathered flames—attempts resonance but lacks the non-literal bite of earned wisdom arising from specific cost. The piece engages complexity (cowardice versus survival) yet resolves it into a tidy redemption arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and the prose carries a lyric, lullaby-inflected texture consistent with the tone requirement. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("geography of her own unlived life," "threshold hour") that feels authorial rather than anchored in Mira's interior lexicon. The guides' dialogue is indistinct—each speaks in the same soothing, aphoristic cadence without individual voice. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs. Perceptual signature is present but filtered through generalized retrospection rather than character-specific bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically controlled and features purposeful similes ("like a mother's hand on a fevered brow"), but several lines loop conceptually: "never done / never spoken / never walked" in paragraph two, and the ridgeway vignettes paraphrase the same regret-pattern without added pressure. Template cadence appears in "They walked... They saw... They crested" sequences. No major filter-verb stacks or clarity breaks, but information density is diluted by atmospheric description that stalls momentum. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the closure turn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The afterlife-ridgeway-redemption premise is familiar from myth and self-help template structures (widow finds symbolic guides who help her reclaim lost self). The "ticket punch with star stamp" offers a fresh object but its mechanics remain decorative. The lullaby tone and twilight-vigil framing are competently sustained but do not transform the core arc. The emotional specificity—unlived university, silent colleague moment, withheld goodbye—could apply to many regret narratives. No bold structural risk or non-obvious synthesis elevates the material beyond its template origins.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The guides appear early, recur across beats, and participate in the ending, satisfying setup and closure gates. However, their agency is purely facilitative—they explain, accompany, and offer the punch, but make no decisions that alter Mira's options or create key turns. The eldest guide's refusal to allow "the direct path" is told rather than dramatized as a constraint. They remain allegorical figures without individual pressure or cost, functioning as chorus rather than active characters.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ticket punch appears in three beats (first guide's demonstration, younger guide's marking passage, Mira's final use) and is handled on the page, satisfying the setup-development-payoff gates. Its star-shaped impression "glimmers and fades like a promise half-remembered" in the first use and blazes to illuminate flames at closure, showing a lyric reprise. However, the punch does not constrain tactics or enable a trade-off—it is offered freely and used without cost. The mechanics (pressing into air, marking passage) remain symbolic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The vigil frames the entire narrative—guides "waited... longer than most souls could remember," the piece closes with "The vigil continued, as it always had," and the ridgeway walk unfolds in sustained twilight. The concept shapes the setting and tone throughout. However, it does not constrain Mira's choices or alter tactics on the page; the vigil is atmospheric context rather than a live stake. The twilight never threatens to end or force a deadline, so the concept charges theme but does not pressure the plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" describes the guides' manner in multiple beats: lanterns "burning with... soft persistence," movements "gentle but persistent, like tides," and their accompaniment "never pushing, never pulling." The trait enables their function (they do not coerce Mira) but imposes no visible cost or trade-off. It is enacted behaviorally but does not constrain a choice—had they been urgent or stern, the plot could proceed unchanged. The attribute is present and consistent but ultimately ornamental to causality.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Traverse" is signaled early ("traverse the veiled ridgeway"), enacted throughout the ridgeway walk, and restated at closure ("The crossing continues"). The action organizes the entire structure—Mira's journey through twilight landscapes is the narrative's spine. Major turns (seeing unlived moments, gathering flames) trace directly to this traversal. However, the action itself is passive observation rather than goal-directed struggle, so while indispensable to structure, it does not redefine options through agency-driven pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Through indirect routes" is announced by the eldest guide ("You must travel through indirect routes, through the twilight places where what-might-have-been touches what-still-could-be"), enacted in the ridgeway walk that presents detours through unlived moments, and echoed at closure ("the shore between regret and redemption"). The method shapes the middle beats—Mira does not reclaim courage directly but through retrospective tableaux. Yet the mechanics do not alter tactics or impose a felt cost; the indirection is thematic rather than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "veiled ridgeway" is introduced in the opening line, is the literal setting for the entire middle, and provides the shore of light at closure, meeting all three gates. The ridgeway's geography (mist, glimpses of unlived roads, the final ridge crest) structures the journey and supplies the visual anchor for each beat. However, it does not constrain Mira's choices—no terrain obstacle, resource scarcity, or spatial limit affects her path. The ridgeway is essential to the story's architecture but functions as stage rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the leash breaks" is anchored early ("three days after the leash broke") and motivates Mira's search, meeting setup. The husband's death is the inciting event, and the passage references his passing. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a deadline—the vigil is timeless ("longer than most souls could remember"), and no clock pressures Mira's choices. The temporal marker provides backstory but does not function as live constraint or escalation mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To find where unused courage waits" is Mira's stated desire, introduced early ("You're looking for the crossing"), pursued through the ridgeway walk, and fulfilled at the shore of flames. The motivation drives the plot structure. Yet it is told rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses—Mira's interiority asserts loss and seeking but does not show friction between competing wants or the cost of this quest over an alternative. The desire is clear and present but lacks on-page conflict or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "shoreline lullaby" tone is sustained from the opening ("voice carried the rhythm of a lullaby") through the entire ridgeway walk (soothing similes, soft cadence) to the closure ("lullaby voice carrying them forward"). The prose modulates under pressure—similes intensify at key beats (mother's hand, patient waves, small waves on sand) without breaking the tonal frame. The tone charges the final image by reinforcing the guides' gentle persistence. It is coherent, purposeful, and integral to the story's atmospheric effect, though it remains static rather than shifting with escalation.</comment>
