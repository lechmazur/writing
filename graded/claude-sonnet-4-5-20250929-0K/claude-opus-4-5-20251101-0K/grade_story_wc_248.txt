<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation is coherent—rescuing her father's promise—and her past actions (library arson, seventeen-year search) establish stakes. However, the central discovery unfolds passively: she observes paintings and reads a letter rather than making choices under pressure. The "analytically intuitive" trait is declared but never constrains a visible action or creates a tradeoff. Interior voice leans toward label-speak ("grief so tender it could have melted stone") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that foreclose paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story employs an accumulative lens: Miriam descends, catalogues visual clues, and arrives at a climactic realization. Orientation anchors adequately (archive, Miriam, post-arson), and the vandalized portrait + letter deliver a Resonant Reconfiguration—she understands her bloodline's legacy. Cost, however, is asserted rather than felt: "The world above had already forgotten her" repeats a prior state rather than showing a fresh forfeiture. The closure reweights her identity but lacks a visible price paid in the final image; the weeping and vow feel like summary rather than a decisive shift that narrows future options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The archive's physicality—volcanic rock, carved chambers, headlamp-lit darkness—grounds the descent and charges the atmosphere. The vandalized portrait is described with scarred-eye detail that mirrors Miriam's own erasure anxiety, and the stone alcove protects the letter, a spatial choice that reflects preservation versus violence. Sensory detail is selective (temperature shifts, shadow patterns) and filtered through Miriam's cataloguing mind, meeting the micro-setting standard by constraining her route and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing the forgotten promise—is signaled early and guides the descent. Pressure, however, remains static: Miriam encounters no reversals, competing goods, or tactical shifts; the archive yields its secret without resistance. The letter resolves cleanly with no visible trade-off between wants. Under the accumulative lens one meaningful deepening suffices, and the portrait's vandalism does deepen the emotional charge, but the lack of any on-page constraint or loss (time, safety, a foreclosed option) keeps escalation in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—legacy, erasure, and the cost of memory—emerges organically from the archive's visual testimony and the vandalized portrait. The final image (weeping beneath her ancient face, vowing to continue the conversation) reweights prior material without overt moralizing. "Archaeologist of the desperate" and "volcanic tenderness" carry metaphoric weight that illuminates character and world. The piece invites reflection on inheritance and erasure without false equivalence, and the ending offers a resonant answer (she is found, now she will add her creation) rooted in concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable, anchored to Miriam's perceptual signature ("cataloging every shadow"). Diction is elevated but mostly consistent with an educated, obsessive archivist. Two register slips weaken peak beats: "volcanic tenderness" in the backstory paragraph reads more like authorial poetry than Miriam's thought, and "grief so tender it could have melted stone" ventures into metaphoric overstatement during the emotional climax. Purposeful compression (the library fire's summary, the seventeen-year search) is economical, and no head-hopping or POV leakage occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences often layer action, setting, and emotion. Rhythm varies appropriately (short beats during the descent, longer reflection at the portrait). Two issues pull the score down: paraphrase loops ("the world above believed she had vanished" / "the world above had already forgotten her") restate erasure without added pressure, and figurative density spikes in the final paragraphs ("volcanic heart," "grief so tender it could have melted stone") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating mild overwriting. Spatial choreography is clear, and no syntactic monotony or typos appear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The genealogical-archive premise and vandalized-ancestor motif feel derivative of common speculative templates (chosen bloodline, hidden legacy, prophecy). The piece transforms this through specific lived detail—Miriam's arson, the library journals plastered into walls, the tapestry fragment pressed into her palm at age seven—grounding tropes in embodied memory. The vandalized portrait's emotional specificity (eyes gouged, mouth obliterated, yet image defiant) and the phrase "archaeologist of the desperate" offer fresh inflections. Risk-taking is moderate; the structure and resolution are conventional, but the synthesis of archive-as-cathedral and genetic-visual message feels purposeful rather than merely executed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Miriam is the protagonist and "arsonist" anchors backstory motivation. The library fire is recounted in one paragraph (controlled burns, extraction of journals, escape through tunnels), shaping her fugitive status and the "off the grid" timeframe. However, the arson itself does not create a key turn in the archive plot; it establishes stakes but remains in summary. She makes no arson-related choice during the descent or at closure. Present in setup and motivation, absent from middle development and closure participation. Introduced early, but replaceable with any fugitive backstory that explains her isolation. Cap at 4.6 (missing middle development), adjust for functional setup and backstory linkage to ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment is handled twice: Miriam carries it for seventeen years (opening), and it bears the archive coordinates her father scrawled (setup). It reappears implicitly when she recalls her father pressing it into her palm at age seven. The fragment enables the entire quest (without coordinates, no archive), meeting causal-pressure and early-signal criteria. However, it is not physically re-encountered or reweighted in the ending; once it delivers coordinates, it disappears. Present in setup and middle (primes backstory choice), absent from closure. Introduced early, causal in one beat (provides coordinates), no closure reprise. Band: ~5.0–6.9 (shapes one key turn). Adjust for early signal +0.5, causal work +0.6, no closure participation −0.8, yields ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait is the central chamber's climax image: a massive rendering of Miriam's face, eyes gouged, mouth obliterated, words carved illegible. It appears in the story's second half, drives Miriam's genealogical realization (the portraits are bloodline), and anchors the final emotional beat (she weeps beneath her ancient face, vows to add her creation). The portrait's vandalism embodies erasure-versus-preservation tension, directly shaping the theme and closure. Present in middle development (genealogical revelation) and closure (she sits beneath it, understands she is found). Introduced late (second half) but transforms prior material. Scores: late arrival −0.4, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost connection +0.4, baseline 3.0 → ~7.9, round to 7.6 given late entry friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is declared in paragraph three ("the ability to feel logic before she could articulate it, to sense connections the way others sensed rain approaching") but never demonstrated. Miriam catalogs shadows and temperature shifts, yet no on-page action shows her intuiting a hidden pattern or making a leap that a purely analytical character could not. The trait is label-only; it does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. Present in setup as character description, absent from middle choices and closure. Ornamental mention −0.8, no beat involvement, no causal work, no closure link, baseline 3.0 → 2.2, but the label primes her cataloguing voice slightly, adjust to 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The action "portray" appears explicitly in two beats: Miriam recognizes the archive's "artistic creations" (paintings, carvings, textile impressions) and vows at closure to "portray this story somehow, add her own creation to these walls, continue the conversation." The verb unifies the genealogical method (each artist portraying the face) and Miriam's future commitment. It shapes the ending's charge (closure participation) but does not drive a middle turn or constrain a present choice; the vow is forward-looking summary. Present in setup (archive's method) and closure (vow), absent from middle pressure. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +1.2, one beat (vow) +0.4, no middle causal work, baseline 3.0 → ~5.1, lyric-resonance allowance (early seed → final reprise reweights stake) +1.0, yields 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "trail of artistic creations leading to a hidden message" is signaled mid-story: Miriam follows portraits deeper, recognizing each figure bears the same face across centuries; she infers "a hidden message encoded across generations of artists." This method drives the genealogical revelation (middle beat) and is paid off in the central chamber (the portraits are bloodline, not just message). The mechanics matter: the visual accumulation compels her to the vandalized portrait. Present in middle development (she follows the trail, decodes the pattern) and closure setup (trail culminates in portrait), though not re-invoked in the final paragraph. Introduced mid-text, drives two beats (following, revelation), causal pressure, no explicit closure reprise. Early signal (mid) −0.2, two beats +0.9, causal +1.0, closure setup (not image) +0.5, baseline 3.0 → ~5.2, method specificity +0.6, irreplaceability +0.5, yields 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is the story's sole location and provides all resources: carved chambers guide her route, the central chamber houses the portrait, the stone alcove protects the letter. The setting is introduced in paragraph two, shapes every middle beat (descent, cataloguing, discovery), and charges the final image (she sits "in the mountain's volcanic heart, surrounded by the artistic testament"). Spatial details (headlamp, darkness, volcanic rock) constrain visibility and mood. Present in setup, middle (all action occurs here), and closure (final line anchors "volcanic heart"). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (chambers guide route) +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, irreplaceability +0.7, baseline 3.0 → ~8.5, minor friction (some description is postcard-like) −0.2, adjust to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After going off the grid" anchors the timeframe in the opening line and recurs in "three months after going off the grid" (paragraph two). The element establishes fugitive stakes (world believes her vanished, mother silent) but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Miriam's descent is unrushed; no deadline pressures tactics. The timeframe is background context, not a driver of escalation. Present in setup, absent from middle pressure and closure. Early signal +0.5, one beat (fugitive status) +0.4, no causal tightening, no closure link, baseline 3.0 → ~3.9, adjust for thematic link (erasure, isolation) +0.9, yields 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to rescue a forgotten promise" is explicit: her father's dying command ("Find the archive… I need you to rescue it"), his letter at closure ("I promised your ancestors I would bring you home"), and Miriam's final vow ("The promise had been rescued. Now she had a new one to make"). It drives the quest and anchors the ending's emotional charge. However, the promise is told rather than dramatized in conflict; Miriam faces no friction between rescuing the promise and competing desires or costs. Present in setup (father's command), middle (she descends to fulfill it), and closure (promise recognized as rescued). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, friction minimal (no competing want) −0.5, summary-dominant −0.4, baseline 3.0 → ~4.6, thematic weight +0.5, cost connection (foregone world) +0.3, adjust to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" is named twice: her father's eyes carry it ("love so fierce it threatened destruction, so quiet it barely disturbed the air") and the archive is described as "the mountain's volcanic heart" at closure. The tone unifies fierce/quiet oppositions and charges the final image (she weeps with "grief so tender it could have melted stone"). It modulates coherently: controlled grief in the arson backstory, analytical calm during descent, volcanic release at the portrait. Present in setup (father's gaze), implicit in middle (descent into volcanic archive), and explicit at closure (heart, melted-stone metaphor). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, coherence +0.8, baseline 3.0 → ~7.0, minor overwriting (metaphoric density at climax) −0.3, yields 6.7.</comment>
