<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira is consistently motivated by community preservation and shows internal texture through her "gentle persistence" approach. Yusuf provides good secondary pressure with his suspicion balanced against need-to-belong. However, the teenage cousins and elders remain functionally interchangeable, and Mira's interiority often slides into conceptual-level reflection ("survival meant more than food—it meant binding the old to the young") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to continue the runs feels ordained rather than tested by a visible cost that forecloses an alternate path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening (who: Mira; where: terra-cotta arbor; when: sanctions period, tonight). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the runs, bell-ringing, and photograph accumulate toward a tonal deepening rather than a causal turn. Closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the photograph of the unchanged homeland plus the decision to "run again" crystallizes the waiting-as-resistance stance. Cost is conceptual (endurance with no end in sight) but legible. Weaknesses: the anonymous donation setup never pays off causally—it remains backdrop rather than a constraint that shapes a choice—and the closure image ("hope would continue its patient work") tilts toward theme-statement rather than concrete image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor is consistently evoked (opening, midpoint gathering, final alone-moment) and its clay pillars frame the photograph discovery, charging the closure. "Salt winds," "rationed candlelight," and "back paths and drainage culverts" build a vivid exile geography. The bell functions as micro-setting, handled twice (ringing, Yusuf examining it) and returned with reweighted meaning at the end. However, the valley houses and Haddad family home remain generic; no spatial detail constrains a choice during the midnight runs, reducing the setting's pressure role.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve community coherence during sanctions) is signaled early and held throughout. The runs create episodic pressure but no on-page tightening: Mira's tactics (which family, what supplies) do not narrow or escalate; the patrols are avoided without friction. The photograph at the end reweights the waiting but introduces no new trade-off or visible price. One meaningful deepening occurs (Yusuf's question about the bell's danger, Mira's answer about identity) but it does not alter subsequent choices. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates via repetition and cadence rather than turn, meeting minimum sufficiency for this mode, but the lack of any visible cost or foreclosed option keeps this mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (intergenerational continuity as survival) emerges from concrete actions: bell-ringing, bread-teaching, the runs. The bell as recurring object shifts meaning (smuggled relic → current call → Yusuf's examination → pocket companion), and the photograph reweights the premise (exile not as loss but as patient holding pattern). However, Mira's closing declaration "We are still here…we remember, and we continue" plus the narrator's final line "hope would continue its patient work" state the theme overtly rather than letting the image resonate. The "gently persistent" descriptor recurs as a thematic echo ("gently persistent as water wearing stone"), which is purposeful but risks becoming a thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited on Mira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear (Mira notices ritual, connection, emotional need) and diction remains controlled ("the product of a childhood spent learning that governments lied" shows her interpretive filter on Yusuf). Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven; Yusuf's question about the bell advances theme and his arc. Free indirect style is clean. Weakness: several lines slip into elevated summary register that feels more like narrator commentary than Mira's live perception: "This was the architecture of survival: not grand gestures but repeated small ones" reads as essay-voice rather than embodied thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied; opening sentence establishes voice and stakes efficiently. Information density is solid (most lines do character, world, or pressure work). However, the piece carries noticeable paraphrase loops: "the purpose of the midnight food runs—not merely distribution, but communion" is immediately restated by "Mira had designed it this way…hunger shared created bonds that lectures could not." The final paragraph stacks three synonym phrases for continuation ("run again," "learn from the old," "continue its patient work") without added pressure. Filter-verb reliance is moderate but present ("she understood," "she had learned"). No major artifact obscures closure, so penalties remain within-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The exile-community-leader-sustaining-tradition premise is a familiar template (diaspora resilience narrative). The story executes it competently with specific details (terra-cotta arbor, smuggled bell, drainage culverts, Haddad family bread lesson) that personalize the frame. The anonymous donor remains unexplored, a convenient supply tap rather than a fresh wrinkle. The intergenerational-support theme and the closing photograph (homeland "unchanged, waiting") hit expected emotional beats without a non-obvious synthesis. Transformation is partial: the details are vivid but the arc and moral calculus remain within well-worn grooves.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira (exile community leader) is present throughout, her choices drive every beat: deciding which family to visit, explaining the bell's purpose to Yusuf, standing to declare the work complete, discovering and pocketing the photograph. All three gates met (setup, development, closure). Her role is causally essential—without her the runs and the intergenerational design do not exist. However, her choices do not meaningfully narrow options or face a visible cost; the story's accumulative mode means her decisions affirm rather than trade off, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Antique silver bell appears in four distinct beats: opening (Mira rings it to call volunteers), backstory anchor (smuggled through refugee camps), Yusuf's examination mid-run ("took the bell from her hands"), and final image (tucked in pocket beside photograph). Setup, development, and closure all met. The bell's meaning evolves from call-to-action to identity-keeper to passed inheritance, and it charges the closure by pairing with the photograph. Solid causal and thematic work, but the bell does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; its role is primarily symbolic resonance rather than pressure instrument.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Anonymous donations are introduced early (Yusuf unloading crates, "no names, no return address") and sustain the community for three months, framing the stakes (sanctions cut supply; donations enable runs). The concept appears again at the end (new coordinates envelope). Setup and closure gates met; middle development is thin—the donations do not complicate or constrain any on-page choice. The story does not dramatize tension around the donor's identity or reliability; they remain a passive enabler. Functional but largely swappable with "aid shipments" or "stockpiled reserves."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is signaled twice as Mira's defining trait (opening "gently persistent in her belief" and closing "gently persistent as water wearing stone") and is demonstrated through her repeated runs, bell-ringing, and explanatory patience with Yusuf. Setup and closure met. The trait enables her sustained work and is visible in her actions. However, it does not constrain a choice or face a visible cost—gentleness is never tested against a competing need for urgency or force. The attribute is more label than dramatic friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Declare" appears once, when Mira "stood to declare the night's work complete," followed by "We are still here…we remember, and we continue." This declaration closes the runs sequence and anchors the final thematic stance. Closure gate met; setup and middle development are absent. The action is not swappable (standing to formally mark completion is specific to Mira's leadership role) but it does not drive a turn or redefine options—it affirms rather than changes. Single-beat causal work limits elevation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Midnight food runs are signaled in the opening third ("purpose of the midnight food runs"), detailed across the middle (moving through back paths, visiting twelve families, avoiding patrols), and reaffirmed at closure ("Tomorrow night, they would run again"). All three gates met. The method constrains choices (must operate in silence, use culverts, move at night) and differentiates this community-support effort from daylight distribution. The mechanics matter: night timing, route selection, risk avoidance. The runs are causally essential and irreplaceable—without them the intergenerational support mechanism collapses.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor on the ridge is anchored in the opening line, hosts the volunteer gathering midpoint, and frames the discovery of the photograph at closure. All three gates met. The arbor's "clay pillars" provide the hiding spot for the envelope, and its three-generation history charges the waiting theme. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Mira could conduct the same work from any gathering point. Solid lyric-resonance integration (early seed, charged return) but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sanctions period is introduced immediately ("since the sanctions began, when the borders closed and the supply ships stopped coming") and sustained as the frame for all action. Setup, development (patrols enforce sanctions, donations circumvent them), and closure (waiting "until the sanctions lifted") all met. The timeframe tightens decisions (rationed supplies, patrol avoidance) and explains the anonymous donor's value. However, the sanctions create static pressure rather than escalating urgency—no countdown or worsening condition forces a new choice on the page. Strong setup and thematic anchor; moderate tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Intergenerational support motivation is dramatized throughout: Mira's opening reflection ("binding the old to the young"), her explanation to Yusuf about the bell ("giving the young reasons to carry what the old cannot bear alone"), the bread-teaching at the Haddad family, the arbor gathering where "elders telling stories while teenagers listened." All three gates met. The motivation drives every choice (which families to visit, why ring the bell, the design of the runs as communion). Friction is present but light—Yusuf's suspicion resists but does not threaten the goal. Strong causal and thematic work; the lack of high-cost trade-off keeps it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" is embodied through the "clear tone cutting through the darkness," the "careful quiet" of the runs, the "silver" moon and "rationed candlelight," and the closing phrase "amplified quiet of the ridge." Setup and closure met; middle sustains the tone through silence, soft footsteps, and restrained dialogue. The tone charges the final image (quiet persistence as resistance) and modulates appropriately (gathering warmth vs. solitary vigil). However, the explicit labeling of "amplified quiet" in the final paragraph makes the effect more stated than purely felt, reducing organic emergence.</comment>
