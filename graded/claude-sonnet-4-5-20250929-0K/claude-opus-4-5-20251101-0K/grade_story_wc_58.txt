<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied through the weft thread, the cold, her fingers on the carpet. The ritual of "projecting presence" to conjure Matthias is specific and charged. Internal contradiction appears in her lifelong practice of helping others while leaving her own grief uncharted, and the final choice to wind the thread into her braid and continue forward forecloses passive mourning with visible cost. Micro-choices (keeping the thread, placing the pages, walking toward the harbor) are legible and character-particular, though the epiphany about healing as practice skirts earned insight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered reflection, the ritual of writing, and recurring imagery (thread, garden, autumn). Orientation anchors quickly (Elara, garden, post-ship departure). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Elara completes the obituary, understands healing as practice, and commits to continue her work with Matthias's memory integrated. Cost is felt in the seven pages written, the cold endured, and the departure toward an uncertain harbor. Escalation reads as deepening rather than causal tightening, consistent with the lens. One reservation: the epiphany ("healing was not a destination but a practice") arrives somewhat cleanly without friction in the final realization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The garden is vivid and particular: crumbling fountain, moss-swallowed benches, salvaged throne-room carpet, maple leaves "the color of dried blood," persimmons "left too long in the sun." Sensory detail is filtered through Elara's perceptual priorities (the weft threads, the cold seeping through her clothes, the cloud-veiled moon). The crimson thread constrains her final action—she winds it into her braid as a keepsake, charging the closure image. Autumn and the shadowed garden mirror internal state without overt declaration. The garden's past (palace, fire) adds resonance without exposition dump.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding her own grief and the "geography of healing" that has eluded her for eleven years. The pressure deepens through the ritual of writing Matthias's obituary, the practice of "projecting presence," and the accumulation of sensory and emotional detail. One meaningful tightening: the act of finishing the seven pages and placing them beneath the stone forecloses passive repetition and commits her to carry the memory forward. The cost is legible in the cold, the grooves worn into her finger, and the choice to board the next ship with the thread woven into her braid. No antagonist required; the lens supports quiet accumulation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—grief as ongoing practice rather than destination—emerges from concrete actions: the obituary ritual, the thread wound like a promise, the pages left beneath a stone. The final image (thread in her braid, walking toward the harbor with no ships waiting) offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the penultimate paragraph states the theme overtly: "healing was not a destination but a practice, a daily choice to carry absence as something precious rather than something missing." This thematic echo in near-thesis language weakens emergence. The closing metaphor "explained absence falling into the patient earth" risks over-articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance. Voice carries a consistent lyric register: "lonesome splendor of autumn itself, beautiful and aching, the kind of glory that exists only in ending." Diction is elevated but remains within the narrator's idiom (traveler, writer, grief-cartographer). Perceptual signature is selective: she notices weft threads, the vibrant crimson, the cold, the particular way Matthias laughed. One slip: "projecting presence" is named but not dramatized until late, reducing immediacy. The final paragraphs' syntactic parallelism ("Someone might find them. Someone might understand") reads slightly mechanical.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and information-dense: "maple leaves the color of dried blood and persimmons left too long in the sun." Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language generally serves the moment. However, several lines approach overwriting: "lonesome splendor of autumn itself, beautiful and aching, the kind of glory that exists only in ending" stacks modifiers in a high-emotion beat. "Explained absences falling into the patient earth" in the final line risks symbolic convenience. Minor template cadence in the closing paragraphs: "Someone might find them. Someone might understand. // She kept the thread... // The garden held..." Each paragraph opens with a similar declarative stem. No severe loops, but density occasionally tips toward purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—writing obituaries for the living—is fresh and specific. The weft thread from a vanished palace, the practice of "projecting presence," and the autumn garden setting combine organically. However, the emotional arc (caregiver finally confronts own grief) follows a familiar template, and the thematic resolution (healing as practice, not destination) is earnest but not surprising. The final image (thread woven into braid, walking toward an uncertain harbor) is resonant but does not fully transform prior material. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits to its lyric mode without bold structural deviation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's role as obituary-writer shapes the entire story: she performs the ritual on herself, writes Matthias's obituary, and decides to continue her work. Her choices (writing through the night, placing the pages, keeping the thread, walking to the harbor) drive all major beats and closure. Setup early, present across all beats, and indispensable to closure. Strong causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The weft thread appears early ("one particular thread, crimson and still impossibly vibrant, came loose in her palm"), is handled physically (wound around her finger "like a ring, like a promise"), and returns at closure (woven into her braid as she departs). It evolves from palace relic to tactile grief-anchor to carried keepsake. The grooves it wears into her finger mark cost. Essential across setup, middle, and ending; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Explained absences" is named explicitly ("among the explained absences, the ones whose disappearances came with official documents") and motivates Elara's vocation: she learned to "explain absences differently, with language that honored the weight of what was lost." The concept shapes her tactics (writing Matthias's obituary as an explained absence) and the final metaphor ("each one an explained absence falling into the patient earth"). Setup and thematic reprise are strong, but middle dramatization is limited; the concept operates more as framing premise than live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Vividly descriptive" is signaled early ("capturing in vividly descriptive prose the essence of who they were") and demonstrated in Elara's writing practice and the narrator's own prose style (maple leaves "the color of dried blood," persimmons "left too long in the sun"). However, it functions more as voice trait than actionable constraint; it does not narrow options or create friction. The attribute is consistent but not causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Intimate" appears explicitly: "It was an intimate act, this conjuring. More intimate than touch, sometimes." The practice of projecting presence is intimate, and the obituary itself is an act of intimacy. However, the action is described more than dramatized; we are told it is intimate rather than shown a choice that tests or costs intimacy. The word "intimate" does not constrain tactics or redefine options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Projecting presence" is named and explained: "the practice she had developed over years of this strange vocation: projecting presence, imagining the person she wrote about sitting across from her, alive and breathing, answering questions they would never hear." She enacts it in the garden with Matthias. Setup is clear, and the method shapes the middle beat (conjuring Matthias, writing the obituary). However, the mechanics are told rather than dramatized; we do not see the projecting presence constrain or enable a specific choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shadowed garden in autumn is established immediately and sustained throughout: crumbling fountain, moss-covered benches, salvaged carpet, maple leaves, persimmons, cold seeping through her clothes, cloud-veiled moon. The garden provides the stage for the writing ritual and the final departure. The cold affects her physically ("joints stiff from the cold"). Autumn's imagery charges the final metaphor ("autumn leaves continued their slow descent, each one an explained absence"). Setup, middle presence, and closure linkage are strong; the garden enables and pressures the ritual.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"The last ship had sailed three hours ago" opens the story and establishes the timeframe. At closure, "no ships waited" but "there would be another vessel eventually." The timeframe creates a window of solitude that enables the ritual, but elapsed time is vague (she writes "until dawn"), and the lack of ships does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The element is present and consistent but does not constrain tactics with cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To understand the geography of healing" is stated explicitly: "Tonight, she was trying to understand the geography of healing, the terrain one must cross to reach the place where memory becomes bearable." The motivation drives her choice to write her own (or Matthias's) obituary and shapes the final realization ("healing was not a destination but a practice"). Setup and closure linkage are clear. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized; we do not see friction between this want and a competing cost until the grooves in her finger and the cold provide mild physical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is named explicitly: "The words came with the lonesome splendor of autumn itself, beautiful and aching, the kind of glory that exists only in ending." The tone is coherent throughout: solitary, elegiac, autumnal, charged with both beauty and loss. Diction and imagery maintain this register from the opening (amber pinpricks, dried-blood leaves) through closure (patient earth, autumn leaves descending). The tone charges the final image and modulates subtly with pressure (quiet opening, ritual intensity, contemplative departure). Strong integration across all beats.</comment>
