<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is fully realized through specific interiority—"learning to read the language of silences," naming storms, archiving phantom experiences—with embodied contradiction between isolation and connection. His micro-choices (writing in the logbook, deciding to find the woman) emerge organically from established traits. The borrowed-memories conceit risks abstraction but stays grounded through concrete sensory flashes ("A woman's voice," "weight of a child's hand"). Minor slip: the final paragraph's emotional pivot ("did not feel entirely solitary") verges on summary rather than showing the shift through action or perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias accepts his role as witness-keeper by writing the stranger's truth and committing to deliver it, foreclosing solitary drift with visible cost (the journey to come, the burden of another's grief). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through counted gaps, memory fragments, and the mist's thickening until the final act of inscription reweights his isolation into purpose. Orientation anchors cleanly (lighthouse keeper, opal dock, three days post-logbook arrival). One small friction: the leap from pressed flower to full backstory memory feels slightly convenient, though the "borrowed memory" rule covers it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The opal dock's iridescence and mist function as micro-setting that charges the closure image ("gleamed behind him, patient"). Specifics ground the world: nautical twilight, Ashmore Rock, the lighthouse beam's sweep. The Edelweiss itself—alpine origin against sea—operates as symbolic constraint that Elias must decode. Spatial choreography remains clear (dock edge, lighthouse, mainland implied). Minor gap: "nautical twilight" timeframe could pressure a choice more directly; here it mostly sets mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the stranger's final gesture—is signaled early and tightens through gap-observation, memory intrusion, and the realization that "the gaps... were not omissions but offerings." The investigation method constrains Elias's path: he must infer rather than know, raising interpretive cost. His agency crystallizes in the inscription choice, which forecloses passive witnessing and commits him to the mountain journey. Escalation reads as accumulative deepening (each clue layer adds weight) rather than reversals, fitting the inferred Accumulative lens. Cost is felt (burden, future journey, emotional inheritance) though not yet paid in full on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing isolation and the weight of others' memories emerges through concrete particulars: the skipped logbook dates, the pressed flower, Elias's forty-seven-year archive. The final inscription—"He remembered... his love stayed stubborn as alpine flowers"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the stranger's silence without moralizing. Subtext operates in the empty page left as offering and in Elias's shift from passive receiver to active keeper. The Edelweiss recurs with reweighted meaning (goodbye token → fidelity proof). No thematic echo or sermon; the story trusts image and action to carry weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: Elias notices silences, names storms, reads borrowed memories as "driftwood." Distance is stable third-limited with clean access to his interior. Diction remains consistent and voice-specific ("achingly familiar," "faithful archivist of phantom experiences," "softly persistent pull"). The borrowed-memory passages shift to sensory fragments ("A young man's hands, not his own") without head-hopping—framed as intrusions Elias receives. Rhythm modulates purposefully, tightening as the mist thickens. No dialogue present to judge. Minor friction: "stubborn as alpine flowers in thin air" in the inscription feels slightly elevated for a lighthouse keeper's spontaneous phrasing, though the moment's gravity may license it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is controlled and dense: "The opal dock stretched into the mist like a pale finger pointing toward nothing" opens with clear image and tone. Information layering is efficient (logbook → three days prior → handwriting familiar yet not his own). Rhythm varies sentence length and structure purposefully. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor overwriting in places: "the softly persistent pull that had guided his stranger instincts" and "the sea took his body, but his love stayed stubborn" both stack modifiers that slightly blur momentum. The opening and closing images bracket cleanly. One figurative stumble: "bruised light of nautical twilight" is vivid but "bruised" competes with "iridescent" in the same sentence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—lighthouse keeper decoding a drowned stranger's logbook via borrowed memories—synthesizes gothic isolation with lyric accumulation in a non-obvious way. The gaps-as-offering reversal and the Edelweiss mountain/sea contrast feel earned rather than imposed. Emotional specificity (forty-seven years naming storms, the woman's voice in memory) elevates beyond template lonely-keeper tropes. Risk-taking in the borrowed-memory conceit and the quiet, inscription-based climax heightens stakes without gimmickry. Small proximity concern: the lonely lighthouse keeper solving a mystery echoes familiar gothic frames, though the execution transforms it through the memory-archive angle and the focus on witnessing rather than haunting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias, the eccentric lighthouse keeper, drives all key beats: he finds the logbook, decodes the gaps, allows the borrowed memory, writes the inscription, and commits to the journey. His eccentricity (naming storms, dream journals, borrowed-memory archive) constrains his method and enables the memory intrusion. Present from the opening line, his choices shape middle investigation and closure participation. Removing him or his specific traits would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dried Edelweiss boutonniere appears early (final logbook entry), returns in the borrowed memory ("pinning the boutonniere to a wool lapel"), and charges the closure as Elias writes beneath it. Its alpine origin against the sea setting creates the mountain/depth contrast that keys the thematic turn. The object's specificity (mountain flower, dried, brown as old paper) matters; a generic token would not carry the same geographic and emotional freight. It shapes two distinct beats (discovery, memory) and the final inscription directly references it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Borrowed memories are established early as Elias's lifelong experience ("They arrived like driftwood, unbidden and waterlogged"), constrain his interpretive method (he trusts them as data), and enable the pivotal memory intrusion that unlocks the stranger's motive. The concept shapes tactics: Elias lets the memory come rather than forcing logic. It participates in closure when he recognizes the final logbook as "deliberately given rather than mysteriously borrowed," reweighting his archive from passive receipt to active witness. Without this exact mechanism, the story's investigative and thematic logic would fail.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" describes the pull guiding Elias to the dock. It appears once as a descriptor ("the softly persistent pull that had guided his stranger instincts his entire life") and implicitly shapes his choice to investigate rather than ignore the logbook. The trait enables the investigation but does not constrain it with visible cost; Elias follows without struggle. It seeds his character but remains more label than dramatized pressure. Mid-band: functional setup without strong causal or closure involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Investigate" frames Elias's entire arc: he comes to the dock "to investigate," decodes by "searching not for what was written but for what was missing," and counts backward to find the pattern. The action drives the middle beats (gap observation, moon-cycle realization) and leads directly to the borrowed-memory intrusion. It structures the narrative and could not be swapped for a passive discovery without breaking the causality. Present in setup, middle, and closure participation (the inscription completes the investigation). Strong integration across beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"By observing gaps" is explicitly signaled early ("by observing gaps, he had learned, you could trace the shape of what someone tried to hide") and immediately applied: Elias notes skipped dates, counts backward, aligns them with full moons. This method is irreplaceable; the gaps themselves become the message ("spaces left empty so they might be filled"). The mechanism shapes the middle investigation and the thematic turn (gaps as offerings, not omissions). It participates in closure when Elias leaves his inscription in "the empty page after" the flower. The method's specificity and causal role across beats elevate it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The opal dock is present from the opening line, its iridescence and mist recur through the investigation, and it "gleamed behind him, patient" in the closing image, reweighted as a liminal space for witness-offerings. Its luminous, finger-pointing-to-nothing quality charges tone and supplies the stage where Elias decodes and inscribes. The dock itself does not constrain a tactical choice (no physical barrier or resource test), which prevents higher scoring, but its recurring presence and final reprise make it essential to atmosphere and closure resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Nautical twilight is mentioned in the opening line and establishes the scene's temporal boundary. The "last bruised light" signals an ending hour that tonally supports the stranger's final gesture and Elias's nocturnal vigil. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Elias could investigate at any hour without altering stakes. It seeds atmosphere and aligns with the seventh-night mist pattern but remains more backdrop than active pressure. Mid-band: functional mood setting without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To decode a stranger's final gesture" is stated as Elias's explicit goal ("That was why he stood here now") and drives every investigative beat: gap observation, memory intrusion, and the inscription choice. The desire is dramatized through his actions (opening the logbook repeatedly, touching the flower, letting the memory in) and encounters friction in the form of incomplete information and the emotional weight of witnessing another's grief. The final act (writing the message, committing to find the woman) converts decoding into active testimony, foreclosing passive curiosity. Strong causal and closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Witnessed isolation is coherent throughout: Elias is "speaking to foghorns and seabirds," the dock stretches "toward nothing," and the beam sweeps "faithful and alone." Tone modulates purposefully as the mist thickens and pressure accumulates, then shifts in the final paragraph ("for the first time in forty-seven years, Elias did not feel entirely solitary") without breaking the established mood—the isolation remains but is now charged with connection. The tone charges the closure image (lighthouse beam, fog, solitary vigil now burdened with another's story). Strong tonal control under pressure.</comment>
