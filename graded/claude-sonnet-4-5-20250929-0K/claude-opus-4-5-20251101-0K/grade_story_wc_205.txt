<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's revolutionary past and current archaeological obsession are established, but her internal contradiction feels stated rather than dramatized in scene. The mirror-uncovering choice is motivated, yet the transition from cataloging to joining the civilization happens too quickly—the embodied struggle between academic distance and revolutionary fire needed more pressure. Her poetic nature is told through verse fragments but doesn't constrain choices until the final act. The crystal shard functions mechanically as a key rather than revealing character through contradictory handling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure: the final image reweights the baroque asteroid from tomb to doorway, charging Maren's revolutionary fire with new purpose. Orientation anchors quickly (baroque asteroid, temporal storms, Maren's quarters). The escalation deepens through the theory formation and mirror-uncovering, then the step-through delivers visible cost (abandoning her research, the academic council's future debates). One weak seam: the transition from hypothesis to action feels compressed—the because/therefore linkage between "writing in verse" and "uncovering the mirror" lacks one intermediate beat of doubt or hesitation that would make the cost feel heavier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid's spirals and gilded arches constrain Maren's theory (architecture as temporal sail), and the temporal storms pressure her ritual of covering mirrors. The crystal shard returns with reweighted meaning at closure, functioning as both setting anchor and tool. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered: "ribbons of amber and violet," "great waves of visible time crashing against the baroque spires." Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The quarters, observatory, and mirror are used tactically, and the final step-through integrates setting into the decisive act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding versus joining the lost civilization—is clear, and Maren's choice to uncover the mirror narrows options with visible cost (her research notes flutter away, the council will debate for years). The escalation operates under the Accumulative lens: theory formation deepens into ritual violation, then physical departure. One friction: the academic dispute is declared but never exerts on-page pressure; the Consortium and Remnant Collective remain abstract. The final choice is protagonist-driven, but the middle lacks a credible complication or loss that tests her commitment before the mirror moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—departure as reimagining, revolution as boundary-breaking—emerges organically from the baroque architecture's purpose and Maren's arc. The verses avoid didacticism and the final poem reweights prior material without moralizing: "All departures start with believing / That somewhere beyond the visible hours / We too might become something ours." The mirror and crystal shard accrue symbolic weight through use rather than declaration. Subtext operates in the covered mirrors and the revolutionary fire rekindling. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: what does it mean to truly understand a lost civilization?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maren; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: "ink-stained fingers," "heart that spoke in verse," temporal currents seen as "thick and golden." Diction remains in register throughout, and the verse fragments are voice-motivated. One slip: "The civilization hadn't died. They had seen time coming—visible, inevitable, beautiful—and they had chosen to step sideways into it" shifts briefly into expository certainty that feels slightly elevated for the focalizer's lived texture. The final poem's syntax and rhythm match Maren's established voice. Psychic distance is controlled, deepening appropriately at the mirror moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well, opening with the baroque asteroid image and closing with the uncovered mirrors. Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Minor scaffold: "She understood now" is a stock epiphany marker, and the phrase "felt hollow, burnished with a sorrow she couldn't shake" contains near-synonym pairing ("hollow"/"sorrow"). The temporal storm descriptions are vivid but repeated phrasing ("temporal storms," "temporal flow," "temporal bliss," "temporal currents") across multiple paragraphs creates a minor loop effect. No major grammatical errors; figurative language is mostly coherent, though "heart that spoke in verse" borders on ornamental. Overall propulsion is strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—archaeologist steps through time via baroque architecture designed as temporal sail—is fresh and the synthesis of revolution, archaeology, and visible time feels specific to this world. The covered-mirror ritual and verse-writing add character-particular texture. However, the "lost civilization became part of time" revelation echoes familiar ascension/transcendence tropes without a deeply non-obvious moral calculus. The "step through the mirror to join them" turn is signaled but not radically transformed. Risk-taking in the lyric interludes and temporal physics elevates above median, but the emotional arc (revolutionary finds new cause) follows a recognizable template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Revolutionary past frames Maren's lens (present ~10%, middle theory formation ~40%, ending fire rekindling ~80%). Her choice to uncover the mirror and step through is driven by revolutionary defiance of boundaries. Two beats: abandoning the cause (backstory anchor) and rekindling fire at closure. Causal pressure: her past loss of purpose makes the mirror-step legible as reclaiming agency. Closure linkage strong: "feeling the old revolutionary fire kindle in her chest. Perhaps this was what she'd always been meant to overthrow." Slight swappability: another past profession (explorer, artist) could support the arc with modest edits, lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Crystal vase shard appears in three beats: unwrapping in quarters (~25%), holding during theory formation (~60%), pressing to mirror at closure (~85%). Early signal strong. Causal role: functions as key left by Verantis-7 people, enabling the step-through. Closure participation direct: "pressed the crystal to the glass. The mirror rippled like water… the crystal shard dissolving into light against her heart." Specificity high: its light-catching property and "faces moving within it" during storms are unique. Visible cost: it dissolves, and Maren's choice to use it forecloses return. Strong integration across setup, development, payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Archaeological dispute mentioned early (~15%: "Consortium… Remnant Collective argued") and dismissed immediately ("Maren cared nothing for their territorial squabbles"). Appears again in passing (~90%: "the academic council would find them and argue for another three years"). Functional presence but no causal pressure: it frames her work context but does not constrain choices or tactics. Swappable with any academic bureaucracy. No closure participation. Fails middle development gate; present in setup and mentioned at ending but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Poetically inclined trait appears in four beats: "heart that spoke in verse" (~20%), cataloging with poetic lens (~30%), writing hypothesis in verse (~65%), final poem on desk (~95%). Early signal clear. Development: verse-writing enables her to process the theory ("because that was how truth moved through her"), constraining method. Closure linkage: final poem left behind carries thematic weight and reweights departure. Cost visible: verse approach isolates her from academic peers ("other archaeologists thought her superstitious"). Modest specificity: another expressive mode (visual art, music) could substitute with edits, but verse structure is used distinctly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Devise" appears centrally (~65%): "she began to devise a new theory, one that would reshape everything they thought they knew about Verantis-7." This theory (civilization sailed into time via baroque architecture) is the story's conceptual hinge, driving her mirror choice. Two beats: theory formation and acting on it (mirror-uncovering). Causal pressure high: the hypothesis makes the mirror-step legible and inevitable. Closure participation indirect but strong: her theory notes "flutter… out into the baroque corridors," framing her departure's legacy. Irreplaceability solid: the act of devising reframes the entire premise from tomb to doorway. Could score higher with one more mid-story complication tied to the theory.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Covering mirrors during storms introduced early (~35%): "developed her own ritual… covering mirrors… so the reflections wouldn't show what had been or what might be." Method matters: she's "seen her own past selves reaching through the glass." Middle development: the covered mirrors create the tactical choice at ~75% ("Maren uncovered the largest mirror"). Closure participation strong: uncovering enables the step-through, and final line reprises "The mirrors stood uncovered now, reflecting only the storm." Causal pressure clear: her ritual reversal is the gate to departure. Cost legible: exposing herself to temporal visions. Setup, development, payoff all present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid Verantis-7 anchors setting throughout: opening image (~5%), observatory and quarters (~20–40%), spirals as temporal sails in theory (~65%), spires during storm at closure (~90%). Early signal excellent. Causal pressure: the architecture's design is the key to understanding the civilization's departure, shaping Maren's theory and her choice. Closure linkage: "The baroque asteroid continued its slow drift through space, but it was no longer a tomb. It was a doorway." Specificity high: baroque spirals as calculated temporal sails are irreplaceable. Visible cost: Maren's physical departure through the mirror depends on the setting's unique properties. Strong integration across all gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Timeframe "after time becomes visible" established in opening (~10%): "watching time flow past the crystalline dome in ribbons of amber and violet—visible now, ever since the Fracture had peeled back reality's skin." Temporal storms recur throughout, anchoring the altered reality. Development: visible time enables Maren's mirror-ritual and theory formation. Closure participation: her step into time is made possible by this condition. Moderate causal pressure: the timeframe permits rather than tightens decisions. Swappability: another post-catastrophe condition could support the arc with edits. The Fracture itself is mentioned once and not developed, weakening irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation "to reimagine an entire civilization" stated early (~25%): "She wanted only to understand—to reimagine an entire civilization from the fragments they'd left behind." Dramatized in middle: cataloging artifacts, forming theory (~60–70%). Conflicted choice at closure: reimagining requires joining them, abandoning academic documentation. Two beats: research-driven understanding and theory-to-action pivot. Causal pressure: the desire drives her mirror choice and step-through. Closure participation strong: "To reimagine their civilization meant to join it." Cost visible: leaving behind her research and the academic world. Friction between want (understanding) and cost (departure) is legible but compressed in the final third.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone "burnished sorrow" coheres throughout: "a heart that spoke in verse" (~20%), "words felt hollow, burnished with a sorrow she couldn't shake" (~70%), "burnished" appears explicitly at the theory moment. Modulates appropriately: melancholy in quarters, intensifies during theory formation, shifts to bittersweet fire at closure ("smiled, feeling the old revolutionary fire kindle"). Final image charges tone: departure as both loss and discovery, sorrow transmuted into purpose. Consistent through turns. Rhythmic control supports emotional progression. Strong closure linkage: tone reweights the ending from tragedy to transformation without false uplift.</comment>
