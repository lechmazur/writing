<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is present but remains largely observational; her internal conflict is told more than shown through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Marcus's transformation from "gruff, suspicious, hoarding supplies" to weeping openly reads as backstory summary rather than earned on-page progression. The ghost's motivation—altruism as penance—is declared but never tested by a dramatized choice that would foreclose a path with visible cost. The final exchange ("You could join us" / "I am not alone") lacks embodied contradiction or a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: recurring chalk messages and the butterfly bell pattern accumulate rather than drive causal turns. However, closure reads as a static restatement—Elara's evening message and the ghost's reply do not reweight prior material with visible cost; the ghost continues "his quiet work" without foreclosure or transformation. The "brambled hope" image in the penultimate paragraph gestures toward Conceptual Repricing but remains abstract assertion rather than a charged final image that makes cost undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating rock arches, silver-barked trees, and fog establish a vivid SF setting with economy. The butterfly garden watering bell is handled on the page (Sola carries it, rings it, moths descend) and constrains agricultural rhythm, meeting the micro-setting standard. Spatial choreography is clean across the orchard grove and Mourner's Bridge. Minor slip: "twin suns crested the horizon" arrives late (final third) without earlier cues, creating a small orientation gap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—maintaining the colony's fragile peace through collective effort—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; Elara finds the message, acts on it, leaves her own message, and receives affirmation without a narrowed option or trade-off. The ghost's guidance is always correct and costless, rendering escalation inert. The "brambled hope" metaphor in reflection asserts difficulty ("thorned") but no on-page choice tests commitment to that claim with a felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of connection across isolation emerges through the ghost's chalk messages and the colony's transformation from strangers to family. However, the final image ("the altruistic ghost smiled, and continued his quiet work") offers reassurance rather than a non-literal answer that reweights prior material. The "brambled hope" passage is explicit thematic statement ("That was what they had built here") rather than image-driven resonance. The butterfly bell recurs but as mechanical symbol rather than a motif that constrains choice or charges closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV through Elara is stable with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: "fog drifted like breath," "moths descended like living stardust." Dialogue is sparse but functional when present (Marcus's grunt, brief exchange). Minor texture issue: elevated diction ("altruism was not performance but penance," "orchestrates their efforts without commanding") occasionally drifts above Elara's established register during reflective beats, though it remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are generally strong. Two pattern artifacts lower the score: (1) Synonym loops—"strangers who had become her family" (para 1) / "strangers had transformed into home" (final para); "peace, Elara had learned, required tending" / "his quiet work of tending"; (2) Template-cadence stems cluster in the middle: "He had seen...He had simply nodded...he had understood...his altruism was not...his distance not." Additionally, the phrase "nebula of respite, a pocket of peace carved from displacement" stacks near-synonyms without added pressure. These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats; apply −0.6 in Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The altruistic ghost leaving chalk guidance is a fresh premise element. However, the emotional arc—isolated guardian finds purpose through silent stewardship, community offers inclusion, guardian declines but feels fulfilled—follows a well-worn template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The orchard-planet setting and floating arches provide vivid color but do not inflect the core dynamic. The final exchange reaffirms the status quo rather than offering a turn that grows inevitably from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The ghost is present across setup (Mourner's Bridge sighting), development (messages guide irrigation, predict blight), and payoff (final message exchange). However, his participation is observational and advisory; he makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or narrows options with cost. The "nod" and written replies are gestures, not decisions under pressure. Swappable with any benevolent oracle figure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bell appears in setup (backstory: gift from ghost with instructions), development (Sola carries it, rings it, moths arrive), and payoff (final paragraph: "The butterfly garden bell rang out"). It enables the pollinating-moth tactic and recurs with slight reweighting (initially a tool, finally "the heartbeat of their agricultural rhythm"). However, it does not constrain a difficult choice or carry visible cost; its presence is functional but the story could substitute another pollination method with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Nebula of respite, a pocket of peace" is declared in paragraph two as thematic label. It does not shape on-page stakes or alter tactics; the term never returns or undergoes conceptual repricing. The actual conflict (tending collective effort) proceeds independently of this metaphor. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" is told in Elara's reflection: "He was strangely trustworthy, this dead man who asked nothing in return." The trait is asserted, not demonstrated through a choice where trust carries cost or enables a risky tactic. It does not constrain an on-page action. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Reexamine what we've built" appears in the ghost's chalk message (setup) and sparks Elara's reflection on "brambled hope" (development/payoff). The action prompts internal reappraisal but does not drive a major turn or redefine options; the reexamination occurs as summary thought rather than a dramatized choice with cost. Functional in one beat (sparks reflection) but swappable with "reflect" or "assess."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Chalk messages on deserted walkways at dawn are present in setup (opening scene), development (guide irrigation, predict blight, adjust school schedule), and payoff (Elara's reply message and ghost's response). The method is specific, enables the ghost's orchestration tactic, and shapes the colony's morning-briefing rhythm. However, the mechanics are static; no choice tests the limits or cost of this medium. Essential to two beats and contributes to ending charge but does not impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Floating rock arches, silver-barked trees, and orchard groves are vividly present throughout. The setting supplies resources (starfruit, pollinating moths) and the arches provide named locations (Mourner's Bridge). However, the environment does not pressure a choice or alter tactics; characters move freely without constraint. The twin suns and fog are atmospheric but do not shape outcome. Functional across beats but does not reach causal pressure threshold.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Three years since the refugee ships" and "For two years now, the messages had appeared" anchor backstory time. "After strangers become family" is the current state, signaled early. However, time does not tighten on-page decisions or tactics; no live clock or deadline alters moves. The timeframe contextualizes the transformation but remains static. Lyric setup → thematic echo without escalation pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ghost's desire "to orchestrate collective effort" is present in setup (messages guide colony actions), development (irrigation routes, school schedule adjustments, pollination strategy), and payoff (continues "his quiet work of tending"). The motivation is dramatized through repeated message-driven actions. However, it is never conflicted or tested by cost; orchestration succeeds without friction or tradeoff. The want is acted upon across multiple beats but lacks the friction-between-wants-and-costs criterion for higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" is declared explicitly in the penultimate paragraph: "Brambled hope, Elara thought—that was what they had built here. Thorned and difficult, yes, but blooming despite everything." Tone is coherent (resilience tinged with difficulty) and modulates subtly from initial loss through fragile cooperation to tentative affirmation. However, the explicit naming and the phrase "blooming despite everything" approach statement rather than image-charged modulation. The final paragraph's gentle optimism lacks the thorn; tone flattens rather than charging the closure image with ambivalent pressure.</comment>
