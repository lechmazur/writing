<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is vivid and specific—translating silence into music through felt vibrations is embodied rather than declared. Elena's exhaustion and the weight of "unspoken counsel" create character-particular tension. The overnight teaching session compresses what should be a gradual shift; Elena's transformation from advisor to silence-mapper feels under-dramatized, relying on summary ("Through the night, they worked together") rather than showing micro-choices that alter her stance. The final choice—Elena walking toward the council with "silence like a torch"—lands with metaphorical weight but minimal visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: silence as a recurring motif deepens through Mira's framing, Elena's arrival, and the overnight instruction, culminating in Elena carrying that silence forward. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Elena departs armed with new knowledge, the harbor "finally finding an audience"—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than concrete; we don't see what Elena risks or loses by adopting Mira's vocabulary. The night-long teaching sequence is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening the causal chain that should earn the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The luminous harbor is vividly established through moonlight pooling in readable patterns and weathered dock planks that carry vibrations. The vintage camera frames the world for Mira, and the dock becomes the teaching ground where silence is mapped. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the harbor's specific features don't constrain choices or alter tactics during the overnight session. The final image of Elena against the waking harbor charges the closure but doesn't demonstrate that the environment shaped the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—saving the harbor from demolition by teaching the council to "hear" silence—is signaled early and pursued through the overnight instruction. The pressure tightens when Elena confesses her words are "losing their power" and asks Mira for help. However, the escalation is compressed into summary ("Through the night, they worked together"), and we never see the council vote or witness the cost of Elena's disruption. The story ends before the stakes are tested on the page, leaving the outcome as poise rather than decisive change with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars: silence as music, invisibility as witness, the spaces between words where truth lives. The filmless camera and vibrations through floorboards concretize Mira's quest without overt thesis statements. The final image—"two ghosts remembered each other, and in that remembering, became real"—offers a resonant answer to the central question of how meaning lives in absence. Minor slip: "joyful sorrow of possibility bloomed between them" edges toward explaining rather than trusting the scene to carry the complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV through Mira is stable and filters the world through her priorities—framing compositions, mapping silences, reading vibrations. Sign language dialogue is naturalistic and goal-driven, advancing both character and plot. Elena's voice reads distinct in her urgency and exhaustion. One register slip: "quietly charismatic in the way of morning fog—present everywhere, touching everything, yet somehow intangible" reads overly polished for Mira's internal texture under the established voice. Psychic distance remains controlled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most lines do double duty. Opening and closing images anchor voice and stakes effectively. However, several passages slip into scaffold: "joy at finally being witnessed, sorrow for all the years of invisibility, hope tangled with grief" paraphrases what the prior scene already showed. "She showed her how fishermen's silences held fear of storms, how children's pauses contained wonder" lists rather than dramatizes. The overnight teaching montage compresses via summary when beats would sharpen momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of deafness, sign language, silence-as-music, and political advocacy offers a non-obvious angle. Mira's filmless camera is a fresh detail that concretizes her seeing rather than capturing impulse. However, the core arc—isolated artist teaches powerful figure to see differently, artist finds validation—follows a familiar template. The transformation feels inevitable in concept but under-dramatized in execution; the overnight teaching sequence compresses what should be the story's most original beats into summary.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elena (whispering advisor) appears early, requests help, and departs with new knowledge that will shape the council vote. She drives the inciting incident and the overnight instruction sequence. However, her key choice—to adopt Mira's vocabulary—happens off-page during the summarized night session, and we don't witness her use it at the council. Present in all three gates but causally passive in the middle and resolution.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The vintage camera with no film appears in the opening beat (framing moonlight), returns when Mira points it at the harbor to explain what will be lost, and closes the story as she frames Elena's departure. It concretizes Mira's seeing-not-capturing philosophy. However, it's description-heavy in the first and last beats; the middle use ("Mira raised her empty camera again") is functional but doesn't narrow options or impose cost. Lyric reprise reweights but doesn't drive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sign language is introduced early when Elena's hands rise in moonlight, shapes the overnight teaching session where Mira guides Elena through "the vocabulary of absence," and implicitly frames the council disruption Elena will attempt. It defines the means of communication and the story's central metaphor (mapping silence). The teaching sequence is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening its middle-beat causal work, but it clearly enables Elena's final action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Quietly charismatic" is asserted in exposition ("quietly charismatic in the way of morning fog") but never dramatized through on-page action. We're told Elena is the voice behind every decision and that she's losing her power, but we don't see her charisma constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. The attribute remains label-only, failing setup and development gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Disrupt" bookends the story: Mira tells Elena "you disrupt the way I understand the world," and at closure Mira says "Go disrupt them." Elena's final action—walking toward the council chambers carrying silence—aims to disrupt the vote. The action shapes the ending and is seeded early, but it occurs off-page and we don't see the disruption's cost or consequence. Present in setup and payoff, absent in middle development, and the ending is poise rather than enacted disruption.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is introduced mid-story when Elena says "you map silence the way you do" and then becomes the method of the overnight teaching session: "Mira guiding Elena's hands through the vocabulary of absence... how fishermen's silences held fear." It shapes the teaching sequence and is explicitly named as the skill Elena will use at the council. However, the mapping itself is summarized rather than shown in detail, and we don't witness its application at closure. Present in middle and payoff but not setup; functional but compressed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight is established vividly in the opening and anchors every beat—the weathered dock where Mira sits nightly, the planks that carry vibrations, the moonlit water holding "silences of a thousand families." It frames the setting and stakes (demolition threat). However, it doesn't constrain choices or alter tactics; the characters could conduct the same conversation elsewhere. The setting charges the final image but doesn't pressure the middle action. Strong setup and payoff, weak development.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"When no one remembers you" is stated in the opening: "When no one remembers you, she had discovered, you become invisible enough to witness everything." It establishes Mira's social position and motivates her thirty years of observation. However, it doesn't tighten decisions or impose a clock. The timeframe is backdrop rather than pressure; Mira's invisibility is static condition, not escalating constraint. Present in setup but inert in development and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—to translate silence into music—is seeded early (her parents were musicians, she feels vibrations through floorboards) and explicitly named in dialogue: "I'm trying to translate silence into music." It drives her nightly harbor vigil and her decision to teach Elena. The motivation is embodied through the camera work and sign language instruction. However, we don't see her wrestle with competing costs or friction between this want and other needs; it's pursued cleanly without visible tradeoff. Present across all three gates but under-contested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Joyful sorrow" is explicitly named mid-story ("The joyful sorrow of possibility bloomed between them—joy at finally being witnessed, sorrow for all the years of invisibility") and echoes in the ending's bittersweet reunion. The tone modulates from Mira's solitary melancholy through the urgent teaching to the hopeful departure. However, the label is over-explained in that mid-story beat rather than shown through contradictory actions, and the ending leans more toward hope than sustained emotional complexity. Functional but didactic at the articulation point.</comment>
