<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Marina's decision to hold the slide to lightning demonstrates agency, but her internal process lacks contradictory impulses—she moves smoothly from dismissal to understanding without visible friction. The grandmother's "timewoven alliances" functions as received knowledge rather than a choice-forcing belief system Marina must wrestle with on the page. Embodied emotion is thin: "racing thoughts" steadied by sound is told rather than shown through perception or micro-choice. The final renunciation (abandoning GPS navigation for resonance-reading) arrives without visible cost—no foreclosed path, no trade-off dramatized in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The piece establishes a causal lens (storm → shelter → slide revelation → new purpose) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marina's stance shifts from lost sculptor to alliance participant. However, the closure cost is conceptual and asserted ("carrying centuries of partnership") rather than felt through a specific forfeiture or constraint visible in the final image. The slide's revelation unfolds through description rather than a decision that narrows options. Orientation anchors quickly (archway, storm, Marina), but the middle escalation (lightning alignments revealing layers) reads as discovery without Marina's agency driving the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The archway constrains Marina physically (shelter from storm) and the slide's layered glass requires specific light conditions, both shaping her actions on the page. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered: "turbine-hum," "salt and fury," "oilcloth." The storm's subsidence allows her to leave shelter, a micro-setting shift that enables the ending choice. The final image—archway shadow stretching "like a bridge"—charges closure, earning the 7+ band.</comment>

<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake (finding the cabin, then understanding her inheritance) is signaled early and tightens once when Marina realizes the slide is a map. However, escalation lacks a second pressure point; the storm subsides conveniently rather than forcing a trade-off. The final choice (returning to her workshop to reread her sculptures) is stated intent without on-page cost—no visible loss of time, material, or alternative path. The reversal (dismissing grandmother's fancy → accepting the alliance) happens off-camera in reverie rather than through a decision that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Theme (inheritance across time, simplicity scaffolding complexity) emerges from the slide's structure and Marina's sculptural practice without overt statement. The final image—"In driftwood, eternity would speak"—edges toward thesis articulation but stays rooted in her work's particulars. The piece earns mid-band score for thematic coherence but loses higher marks because the epiphany ("She had never been lost") reads as unearned comfort rather than a reweighted question. The recurring driftwood/alliance motif charges the ending without feeling forced.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present: Marina notices "twisted forms," "grain," "visual language." However, elevated diction throughout ("timewoven alliances," "perpetually learning," "nodes in a network") clashes with the sculptor's hands-on craft, creating register drift that flattens voice under pressure. The final paragraph's syntax ("a mechanical lullaby for a woman finally awake") reads writerly rather than character-particular. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Clarity holds, but template cadence and paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "She would return... She would learn... She would add" (three-beat parallel); "no longer lost... never been lost" (synonym churn). Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching: "forgotten doorway," "bridge across wet rocks," "golden lines," "turbine-hum," "mechanical meditation." The closure beat ("carrying centuries... weight of future connections") stacks abstractions where a concrete image would sharpen. Mixed metaphor: "storm to strip away everything that obscured the path"—storms obscure rather than clarify. Baseline artifacts trigger −0.6 in Q7; touching closure adds −0.3.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>The core premise (artist discovers inherited magic tool revealing cross-temporal alliance) follows a common template: object-reveals-destiny, creative-person-chosen-one. The slide's layered-glass mechanism offers mild specificity, but the emotional arc (lost → enlightened) and the final stance (I will learn and teach) feel generic. Transformation test: swap sculptor for musician, slide for sheet music, and the beats hold unchanged. The "turbine-hum reverie" and "storm strips clarity" attempts fresh phrasing but do not rescue the derivative frame. No bold risk elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Marina's occupation (driftwood sculptor) seeds early, returns mid-story when she recognizes the slide's "scaffold complexity with simplicity" principle in her work, and frames the ending choice (return to workshop, reread sculptures). She decides to hold the slide to lightning (one choice) and to return to her studio (closure intent). However, neither decision involves visible cost or narrows options on the page—she could have done both regardless of the revelation. The trait shapes interpretation but not tactics under pressure. Two gates met (setup, closure), but causal pressure is weak: −0.7 for late/weak development, −0.4 for swappability (any artist would suffice), +0.3 for early signal, +0.4 for one beat, +0.5 for closure linkage. 3.0 + 1.2 − 1.1 = 3.1, raised to 4.8 for thematic centrality without cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The magic lantern slide appears in paragraph two (early setup), Marina pulls it out and uses it twice (lightning flash, then understanding its layers), and it is present in the final image ("warm against her chest"). Three beats: discovery mention, active use under storm, closure talisman. However, the slide's "layered meanings" are described rather than dramatically tested—Marina does not choose between competing interpretations or sacrifice to access them. All three gates met (setup, development, closure), but causal pressure is modest: +0.8 for early signal, +0.9 for two beats, +0.5 for enabling tactics, +0.7 for closure presence, −0.5 for ornamental final mention (carried, not used). 3.0 + 2.9 − 0.5 = 5.4, raised to 6.7 for multi-beat presence and thematic link without decisive cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Timewoven alliances (core concept) is named in paragraph three, drives Marina's realization that her sculptures are "nodes in a network," and frames the ending commitment to add her layer for future seekers. The concept shapes her interpretation but does not constrain a choice with cost—she could sculpt or not sculpt regardless. Two gates (setup, closure thematic echo) but weak middle development: +0.5 for setup, +0.4 for one interpretive beat, +0.5 for closure theme, −0.6 for swappability (any inherited-knowledge frame would work), −0.3 for summary-only involvement. 3.0 + 1.4 − 0.9 = 3.5, raised to 5.2 for thematic centrality without tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>"Perpetually learning" appears once as a character label ("spirited driftwood sculptor by trade, perpetually learning from twisted forms") and echoes thematically when Marina decides to "learn to read the layers." The trait does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost—it flavors voice without altering tactics. One gate (setup mention), weak closure echo: +0.3 for early label, +0.3 for thematic echo, −0.8 for label-only use, −0.5 for no cost. 3.0 + 0.6 − 1.3 = 2.3, raised to 4.1 for narrative presence without mechanical cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"Reimagine" is the required action. Marina will "reimagine every piece she had ever created" (stated intent, closure paragraph) and "began to reimagine what her grandmother had truly left her" (middle beat). The action frames the ending but occurs as future plan rather than on-page execution with consequence. Two beats (middle realization, closure intent), both told: +0.4 for one beat, +0.5 for closure presence, −0.8 for summary-only (not dramatized), −0.4 for swappability (any reflective verb would serve). 3.0 + 0.9 − 1.2 = 2.7, raised to 5.9 for dual presence and thematic charge without enacted cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>The method "through layered meanings" is introduced early (paragraph two: slide "etched with images that seemed to move when held to light"), demonstrated mid-story when Marina discovers three layers under specific light conditions, and explicitly named ("through layered meanings built into the glass itself"). The mechanics matter—lightning plus slide reveals information—but Marina does not choose between interpretations or sacrifice to access a layer. Three gates met (setup, middle use, closure understanding): +0.8 for early signal, +0.9 for two beats, +0.5 for enabling tactic, +0.3 for specificity, −0.6 for passive discovery (light does the work), −0.4 for no cost. 3.0 + 2.5 − 1.0 = 4.5, raised to 6.3 for mechanical clarity and multi-beat presence without decisive pressure.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The storm-tossed archway (required setting) is the opening image, provides shelter that forces Marina to stop and examine the slide, creates the acoustic "turbine-hum" that steadies her thoughts, and returns in the final image where its shadow "stretches like a bridge." Four beats: opening anchor, shelter constraint, sonic catalyst, closure image. The archway shapes Marina's decision to pull out the slide (she has time under cover) and charges the ending. All three gates met: +0.8 for early anchor, +1.4 for three beats, +0.8 for causal pressure (shelter enables reflection), +1.0 for closure charge, +0.5 for specificity (sound, shadow). 3.0 + 4.5 = 7.5, reduced to 7.1 for modest cost (she could have examined the slide elsewhere).</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.6</grade>
<comment>The timeframe "after the GPS fails" is mentioned in paragraph one ("GPS unit dead in her pocket") and never returns or tightens decisions. Marina does not consult the GPS again, weigh its loss, or adapt tactics because of it. The failure sets up the final contrast ("no longer needed electronic navigation") but does not constrain a middle choice. Two gates (setup, thematic closure echo) but no middle development: +0.5 for setup, +0.3 for closure contrast, −0.7 for missing middle beat, −0.5 for ornamental use. 3.0 + 0.8 − 1.2 = 2.6, raised to 4.6 for present but weak integration; cap at 4.6 for missing middle gate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>The motivation "to scaffold complexity with simplicity" is named in paragraph two as a principle Marina recognizes in the slide and her own work. It drives her interpretive breakthrough (understanding the alliance structure) and frames the ending commitment. However, the desire is never shown in conflict—Marina does not choose simplicity over detail or vice versa with cost. Two gates (setup, closure thematic): +0.5 for setup, +0.4 for one interpretive beat, +0.5 for closure theme, −0.6 for label-only (not dramatized in choice), −0.3 for no friction. 3.0 + 1.4 − 0.9 = 3.5, raised to 5.5 for thematic presence without enacted trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The tone "turbine-hum reverie" is introduced mid-story ("wind screamed through its hollow curve, creating a sound like a turbine's hum, a mechanical meditation") and colors Marina's breakthrough moment. The phrase is specific and recurs in the ending ("turbine-hum of receding wind sang her forward, a mechanical lullaby"). The tone shifts from chaos (storm) to steadiness (hum) to resolution (lullaby), modulating with pressure. Two beats (middle catalyst, closure echo): +0.5 for middle introduction, +0.4 for one beat, +0.7 for closure presence, +0.5 for modulation, −0.4 for late first signal (second third), −0.3 for ornamental final use. 3.0 + 2.1 − 0.7 = 4.4, raised to 6.2 for tonal specificity and charged reprise without earlier setup.</comment>
