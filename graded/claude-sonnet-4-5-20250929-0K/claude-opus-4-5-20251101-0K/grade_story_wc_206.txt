<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's interior is vivid and character-specific through his forty years of listening to "confessions" of automata. The wilting sensation when he recognizes his dishonest hope for resurrection is well-embodied and drives a meaningful pivot. The moment "I understand now. You're not here to resurrect the past" earns the shift through prior interiority. Minor slip: the grandmother's impossible note could use one more grounding beat to anchor motivation earlier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands clearly as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias disperses the light into seven mechanisms, forecloses resurrection, and accepts forward flow with visible cost (the chip dims to nothing). The causal lens holds: grandmother's note → puzzle over "mend what isn't torn" → recognition of invisible wound → wilting dishonesty → corrected intention → dispersal. Orientation is swift (chamber, workbench, chip present by paragraph three). One micro turn (the wilting check) tightens before the final dispersion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The resonance chamber's copper walls and focal point constrain the repair work; seven music boxes arranged spatially guide the ritual. The chip's amber pulse and the rust's transformation into "copper stars" charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and tied to Elias's expertise ("sympathetic harmonics," "covenant of rust"). Minor opportunity: the chamber's small window appears only at the end without prior spatial anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim the light before midnight—is signaled early and tightens through the wilting beat that forces Elias to confront his dishonest motive. The corrected intention ("tether the light so it can flow forward") narrows options and drives the dispersal with visible cost (chip extinguished, grandmother not resurrected). Agency is clear: his recognition and apology enable the transformation. Single meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the covenant of rust (time's agreement with metal), the impossibility of resurrecting the past, and light as forward inheritance rather than backward claim. The wilting beat dramatizes the lie without moralizing. "Mend what isn't torn" reweights from puzzle to action. The final image—seven mechanisms carrying dawn—offers a resonant answer without thesis statement. Rust "transmuting" rather than disappearing honors complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elias hears "songs things wished to sing" and notices "rusted springs" and "corroded mechanisms" through a repairman's lens. Diction stays character-bound ("sympathetic harmonics," "minor key," "tinkersong wonder"). Free indirect control is clean; the recognition "I'm sorry" lands as embodied realization. Rhythm modulates from meditative setup to the climactic winding sequence. No dialogue present; voice remains stable and purpose-driven throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (chip, note, wilting, seven boxes all advance). "Mend what isn't torn" and "covenant of rust" do multiple jobs without padding. Minor loop: "The chip brightened" / "The chip blazed brighter" across two beats feels slightly repetitive. Figurative language ("flower opening to dawn," "streams flowing into a river") is dense but mostly earned by the lyric mode; one mixed vehicle: rust as "song sung in a minor key" then "transmuting" blurs the metaphor slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of music-box repair, philosopher's stone fragment, and forward-flowing inheritance is specific and non-obvious. "Mend what isn't torn" freshens the restoration trope through invisible wounds and memory. The wilting-dishonesty mechanism is a distinct pressure point. Risks: lyric density and the grandmother's impossible note. Weakness: the seven-box ritual and rust transformation lean slightly toward stock alchemical imagery without sharp particularity; the ending's "seven corners of the world" feels generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's expertise (listening to automata, understanding invisible wounds) frames the task early. His key choice—recognizing and renouncing the resurrection hope—drives the wilting reversal and enables the final dispersal. The repairman role is irreplaceable: his skill and ethical correction tether the light. Present across setup (workbench), middle (wilting beat), and closure (dispersal).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The chip appears early (paragraph four), its amber pulse and dimming establish the ticking stake. It triggers the wilting beat when Elias's dishonesty surfaces, then disperses its light at closure—extinguishing is the visible cost. Handled across three beats (arrival, resonance test, dispersal) with reweighted meaning (whole yet incomplete → dispersed inheritance). High specificity: the chip's memory of wholeness is the invisible wound.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The covenant of rust is named and explained (metal's agreement with time) and its transformation—rust becoming "copper stars"—charges the final image. It shapes Elias's method (transposing the minor-key song) and the boxes' arc. Present in setup (corroded mechanisms), middle (rust as dignity), and payoff (transmutation). Weakness: the concept is slightly ornamental in the middle; its constraint on tactics is thin compared to the wilting-dishonesty attribute.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The wilting sensation appears precisely when Elias holds a dishonest hope, forcing immediate self-examination and apology. This constraint is the story's pivot: without the wilting check, the light would not blaze and the dispersal would fail. Visible cost: Elias must renounce his grandmother's return. The trait is irreplaceable, driving the key turn and enabling closure. Present in setup (chip "could sense" honesty), middle beat (wilting + correction), and implicit at closure (boxes now infused honestly).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Tether" is the task from the grandmother's note, repeated as Elias's corrected intention ("tether the light so it can flow forward") and fulfilled in the dispersal (light "tethered" into seven boxes that "midnight could never claim"). The action redefines the goal from resurrection to forward inheritance and is causally central. Present early, reweighted mid-story, and executed at closure. Minor swappability: "anchor" or "bind" could substitute with small edits, but "tether" carries forward-motion connotation that fits the theme.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Mend what isn't torn" is the grandmother's riddle, puzzled over early, and solved when Elias recognizes the chip's invisible wound (memory of wholeness). The method—addressing an intangible break—distinguishes this repair from ordinary fixes and drives the resonance ritual. It shapes his approach (listening for forgotten songs, correcting dishonesty) and charges the ending (connection mended, not stone restored). Present in setup (note), middle (realization), and implicit in closure. High specificity: the paradox is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The resonance chamber's copper walls, focal point, and converging sound waves are the site and mechanism of the repair; the seven boxes must be arranged there. The chamber's "singing" and golden light reflect the ritual's success. It supplies the necessary tool (convergence) and constrains the work (Elias must bring mechanisms to this space). Present in title beat (paragraph one), throughout the winding sequence, and at dawn in the final paragraph. The small window is a late detail but does not weaken prior integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"In the balance between one heartbeat and the next" establishes fragile poise early; the grandmother's note warns "before midnight claims it forever," creating a deadline. The chip's nightly dimming and the final "dawn was breaking" bookend the window. The timeframe tightens the wilting beat (no time for prolonged doubt) and makes the dispersal urgent. Present in setup, implicit in middle pressure, and marked at closure. Weakness: elapsed time during the winding sequence is vague; we don't feel the clock ticking moment-to-moment.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's desire to reclaim the light is stated early and tested when the wilting reveals his buried hope to resurrect his grandmother—a conflicting, dishonest sub-motive. The corrected motivation ("tether the light so it can flow forward") drives the final act. Friction between resurrection (want) and forward inheritance (need) creates the key turn. Present across setup (task accepted), middle (conflict dramatized), and closure (corrected desire fulfilled). Cost: grandmother remains dead, light goes to others.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Tinkersong wonder—"the space between mechanical precision and impossible hope"—is named and modeled through lyric diction ("copper stars," "sparrow's heart," "streams flowing into a river"), the paradox of mending the untorn, and rust's transmutation. Tone modulates from meditative (opening hum) to tense (wilting) to luminous (dispersal and dawn). The final image ("small piece of reclaimed dawn") sustains the wonder without deflating into sentiment. Coherent throughout, charged at closure.</comment>
