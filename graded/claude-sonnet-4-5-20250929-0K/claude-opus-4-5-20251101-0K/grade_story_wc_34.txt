<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to give voice to the voiceless is clear and her micro-choices (climbing down rope ladders, photographing murals) reflect this drive. The ghost's characterization through fragments is evocative, though the emotional arc relies heavily on tell ("profound isolation," "luminous") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to continue the ghost's work is signaled but feels conceptually neat rather than fraught with visible cost. Internal texture is present but edges toward lyric abstraction in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear orientation (balladeer, floating monastery, ghost communication pattern). The closure achieves Conceptual Repricing: Mira's realization that the ghost's gift is "a new way to speak" reweights her role from interpreter to perpetuator, and her decision to paint in secret places forecloses direct performance with felt isolation cost. The three-month gathering arc and the courtyard scene cohere causally. The escalation from understanding to singing to dispersal reads as density increase and cadence shift, meeting the lens requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above cloudline is vividly anchored with sensory specifics (cold brass, eternal mist, lightning/thunder). The flower press bolt plate constrains Mira's final choice—she presses it to her heart as an anchor before singing, linking artifact to action. The graffiti-scattered old world below provides purposeful contrast. Spatial choreography (courtyard, rope ladders, warehouse walls) tracks cleanly. The monastery stones functioning as a canvas for the ghost's mural charges the setting, though occupation-level detail (balladeer craft) remains thin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving voice to the ghost's unspoken needs—is signaled early and tightens through the courtyard encounter. The ghost's question "HELP ME REMEMBER WHAT I NEEDED" forces Mira's interpretive choice, and her song narrows options by merging the ghost into permanence. The cost is felt: the ghost dissolves, and Mira inherits isolation by choosing to encode herself in secret murals. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure builds through fragments → full manifestation → song → dispersal, with the final renunciation (rarely singing aloud, painting in secret) foreclosing direct connection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the ghost's encoded loneliness and Mira's inherited isolation without explicit moralizing. The flower press bolt plate as motif (flattening into permanence) charges the closure when Mira adopts the ghost's method. The final image—balladeer and ghost "encoding each other into permanence"—offers a resonant answer to the question of articulation without stating a thesis. The piece resists tidy resolution: Mira's new method perpetuates isolation even as it grants voice. "Tinkersong wonder" grounds discovery in the ghost's light-and-longing form and Mira's careful melody-weaving.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices the bolt plate's weight, mist patterns, and the ghost's pixel-like condensation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during song, wider during the ghost's dissolution). The phrase "driftingly alert awareness" is voice-consistent and recurring. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful ("I understand now"). Filter verbs ("watching how it caught," "feeling its weight") fit the contemplative texture. Some elevated diction ("luminous," "liminal") edges toward lyric register but remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high (ghost's origin, graffiti system, grandmother's craft). The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor scaffold appears: "The ghost had found her three months ago" transitions efficiently but "appearing first as static" then "whispered numbers" then "coordinates" reads slightly list-like. The phrase "driftingly alert awareness" repeats effectively. Figurative language is controlled except for one mixed vehicle: "tinkersong wonder—that quality of discovery mixed with careful crafting, like a clockmaker finding unexpected beauty in gears"—the clockmaker simile feels explanatory rather than integral. No loops or severe artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The ghost-in-code communicating through graffiti art is a fresh synthesis, and the balladeer-as-decoder avoids stock patterns. The flower press bolt plate as inheritance and method anchor specificity. The ending choice—to perpetuate the ghost's encoding rather than simply honor it—feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The "Great Elevation" world detail remains under-explored but serves the separation premise. Transformation test passes: the plot depends on these exact elements (graffiti, song, encoding).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her choices (following coordinates, photographing murals, singing, deciding to paint in secret) drive all major beats. Her "seldom-heard" trait shapes the ending: she will "rarely sing aloud" but encode in secret. The decision to perpetuate the ghost's method is causal and alters her future path. Three gates met (setup, middle gathering, closure perpetuation). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage lift the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The flower press bolt plate appears in the opening (worn on a cord), is handled during the courtyard scene (pressed against her heart as an anchor before singing), and grows warm during closure, signaling transformation. Its meaning as flattening-into-permanence is established early (grandmother's preservation method) and reweighted at the end (Mira will preserve through encoding). Two distinct beats plus closure linkage. Causal pressure: it anchors her physically and conceptually. Swappability low; irreplaceability high. Cost connection: her inheritance of the grandmother's method forecloses direct performance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ghost-in-code concept shapes all tactics: it dictates the graffiti-message system, forces Mira's interpretation work, and provides the stakes (articulating the unarticulated). The ghost's fractured consciousness drives the narrative method (accumulative fragments). The concept is present in setup (three months of gathering), middle (courtyard manifestation), and closure (dispersal into Mira's song). The final merger—ghost becoming part of her song—depends entirely on this exact concept. Strong causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Driftingly alert" appears as a label in the courtyard beat ("driftingly alert awareness, neither fully present nor entirely absent") and recurs at the end ("driftingly alert between lightning and thunder"). It enables the ghost's clearest communication but does not visibly constrain a choice with cost on the page. The trait is thematically resonant but functions more as atmospheric description than tactical necessity. Two-gate participation (middle, closure) but lacks middle-choice constraint. Lyric reprise reweights slightly but cost is generic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Encode" is the story's spine: Mira encodes the ghost's fragments into song, and the ghost had encoded itself into the city. The action appears in setup (her role explained), middle (active encoding during the song), and closure (she will encode herself into graffiti). Major turns trace to this action: the ghost's dispersal occurs because Mira successfully encodes its feelings. The final image—"encoding each other into permanence"—depends on this exact verb. Strong irreplaceability and causal pressure across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The graffiti-message method is signaled early (coordinates painted on a bridge, mural on warehouse wall, color sequences and geometric shapes) and structures Mira's three-month gathering work. It shapes her middle attempts (climbing down, photographing) and provides the mechanics for the ghost's final mural on monastery stones. The method is present in setup, development (her interpretation work), and closure (monastery mural fading, her decision to paint in secret). Causal pressure: without this method, the ghost cannot communicate. Specificity high; swappability low.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The misty courtyard is anchored early and hosts the pivotal song scene. Its "floating impossibly above the cloudline" creates isolation (no living audience) and the monastery stones serve as the ghost's final canvas. The mist swirls in response to Mira's song, affecting the ghost's manifestation. Lightning and thunder provide temporal markers. The courtyard's separation from the world below pressures Mira's choice: she must descend to perpetuate the encoding. Three gates met. Environment constrains (isolation) and charges the final image (descent as commitment).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Between lightning and thunder" frames the courtyard beat ("In that suspended moment between the flash and its thunder, Mira existed in a state of driftingly alert awareness") and recurs at closure ("driftingly alert between lightning and thunder"). The timeframe creates a brief window when "the ghost spoke clearest," pressuring immediacy. However, the clock does not visibly tighten tactics or narrow options with cost; it functions more as atmospheric marker than constraint. Two-gate participation (middle, closure) with thematic resonance but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to articulate unspoken needs is dramatized: she gathers fragments, climbs down ladders, and ultimately sings what the ghost couldn't say. The motivation is established early ("to give voice to what the ghost could not speak directly"), tested in the courtyard choice (singing requires vulnerability), and reweighted at closure (she inherits the ghost's unspoken condition by painting in secret). Friction between wants and costs: giving voice perpetuates her own isolation. Strong causal pressure across setup, middle choice, and closure transformation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" is defined on the page ("that quality of discovery mixed with careful crafting, like a clockmaker finding unexpected beauty in gears") and modulates: the ghost's light-and-longing form, Mira's melody-weaving, the final merger. Tone remains coherent through turns without flattening into static mood. The wonder charges the final image (new mural "painted on the inside of her eyelids"). However, the explicit definition mid-scene reads slightly over-explained. Tone present in setup, middle texture, and closure; supports pressure without obscuring it.</comment>
