<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal life is delivered through credible physical detail (trembling hands, tear-streaked face) and her career as a floodgate machinist anchors her moral calculus in concrete terms. However, the story relies heavily on backstory to establish motivation rather than present-tense choices under pressure—her grandmother's letter and the decoded confession dominate, leaving Mira's own agency largely reactive until the final decision to wait. The closing resolve ("dappled resolve... willingness to hold contradiction") edges toward abstraction rather than embodied consequence, and the cost of her silence remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: discovery → decoding → realization → renewed purpose. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira decides to defer revelation until she can ensure the villages' safety, a stance that forecloses immediate justice with a visible moral cost. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the second paragraph), and the surveyor's chain functions as both cipher key and thematic bridge. The primary weakness is that the climactic turn—her choice to wait—feels like a continuation of her grandmother's silence rather than a sharp reversal, muting the felt cost at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amphitheater inside the dormant volcano is vividly rendered with selective, purpose-driven detail: breathing stone, obsidian walls, sulfurous light, and volcanic heat all pressure the discovery and charge the final image. The surveyor's chain as micro-setting (cold brass against volcanic warmth, warm against her chest at closure) constrains her decoding and charges the ending. Spatial choreography remains clear across tiers and the central stage. No significant weaknesses touch the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to expose or protect her grandmother's truth—is signaled early and tightens through the decoding sequence. The discovery that Elara chose disgrace over genocide raises moral weight, and Mira's final decision to defer revelation forecloses immediate vindication with a conceptual cost. However, the story lacks a live reversal that narrows options under present pressure; Mira's agency is discovery rather than a trade-off between competing goods. The cost at closure reads as principled patience rather than a visceral sacrifice, keeping the score mid-band despite coherent escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—compassion encrypted in silence, the moral calculus of machines and floodgates—emerges organically from Mira's profession and her grandmother's choice. The surveyor's chain, the breathing amphitheater, and the floodgate metaphor interweave without overt statement, and the final image (chain warm against her chest, "forty-two years of love finally translated") reweights prior material with quiet resonance. The phrase "encrypted compassion" risks being too on-the-nose in the letter, but the story mostly earns its thematic coherence through particulars rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, with Mira's perceptual signature—machines as sleeping giants, balance between fear and need—filtering every detail. The prose modulates appropriately (clinical precision during the adhesive test, emotional intensity at the confession's revelation). Occasional elevated diction ("slyly heartfelt," "dappled resolve") feels slightly imposed rather than emerging from Mira's idiom, and the phrase "murder dressed as negligence" reads more authorial than character-voiced. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The prose is clear and propulsive through most beats, with strong sensory detail (amber-to-violet reagent shift, sulfurous light, brass links cold then warm). However, several lines carry overwriting: "slyly heartfelt," "dappled resolve," and "Cognitive smoothness" feel elevated beyond Mira's established register. The phrase "encrypted compassion, a love letter written in the language of apparent guilt" stacks metaphors without clear imagery. Minor paraphrase loops appear ("machines weren't neutral... every gate and lever carried the weight" echoes the floodgate framing without added pressure). No loops touch the closure, limiting deductions to mid-range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—engineer discovers ancestor's hidden exoneration via surveyor's cipher—offers a fresh synthesis of historical injustice, technical skill, and moral inheritance. The adhesive-dating method and the volcano amphitheater are specific and non-obvious. However, the core emotional arc (vindicating a disgraced ancestor who chose silence to protect the vulnerable) follows a familiar redemption template without sharp transformation. The story commits fully to its premise and avoids hedging, but the ending's "wait for the right moment" stance reduces narrative risk. Within-band placement reflects solid execution of a recognizable frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's profession as floodgate machinist is established early and explicitly linked to her moral calculus (balance, harmonizing conflicting values). However, her ingenuity appears primarily in backstory; on the page, she applies a dating technique and decodes a cipher—actions tied to her skill but not creating a live turn under pressure. The final choice (defer revelation) grows from her values but does not hinge on a floodgate-specific decision. Two gates: setup and thematic payoff; middle development is weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The surveyor's chain appears in four distinct beats: opening (cold despite warmth), decoding (link measurements as cipher key), mid-discovery (clinked in her hands), and closure (warm against her chest). Each use advances meaning: from inheritance to tool to bridge across decades. The chain's final warmth reweights its initial coldness, and its presence shapes the decoding action. Strong setup, development via cipher mechanics, and charged closure participation. Irreplaceability is high; the specific link measurements drive the plot turn.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Encrypted compassion is seeded in the opening phrase ("compassion I could not speak") and governs the entire discovery: Elara's silence protected the villages, and Mira chooses parallel encryption. The concept shapes stakes (whether to decrypt and expose) and tactics (Mira reseals the letter). However, much of the concept's work is told through the decoded letter rather than dramatized in present choices. Setup and payoff are strong; middle pressure is conceptual rather than enacted. The final image (love finally translated) charges the concept but does not test it under live conflict.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Slyly heartfelt" appears once in backstory ("something slyly heartfelt in the way Elara had taught her") as a character note without constraining an on-page action. The trait does not recur, shape a beat, or face a trade-off. It reads as a label rather than an enacted quality. Present but ornamental; missing middle development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Trembling appears twice: "Mira's hands began to tremble as she approached the central stage" and "Mira no longer trembled" at closure. The action marks her emotional arc from fear to resolve and brackets the discovery sequence. However, the trembling does not create a turn; it signals internal state without altering tactics or options. The lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake (uncertainty to willingness) with a visible emotional shift, qualifying for mid-band under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The adhesive-analysis method is signaled early ("a technique she'd developed for dating the river district's oldest floodgate mechanisms"), applied on the page with procedural specificity (reagent, amber-to-violet shift, forty-two-year result), and directly enables the next beat (decoding with heightened urgency). The method shapes one key turn—confirming the letter's age ties it to the dam collapse—but does not recur or constrain the ending. Setup and middle development are strong; closure participation is absent. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The amphitheater is established early with vivid detail (breathing stone, volcanic heat, obsidian walls, sulfurous light filtering through cracks) and provides both atmospheric pressure and a concrete resource (the hidden envelope in cracked marble). The setting's "breath" cycles frame the discovery and the final ascent ("The volcano sighed around her"). However, the amphitheater does not constrain a tactical choice—Mira's work is unaffected by the location's specific properties. Strong setup and closure reprise; middle causal pressure is modest. The setting charges the ending image without altering options.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"As the building breathes" recurs three times (opening, mid-discovery "The amphitheater groaned," closure "The volcano sighed") to mark emotional beats, but the breathing does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than causal; Mira works at her own pace. The element is present and purposeful but does not create urgency or alter tactics. Setup and closure reprise are solid; development as a pressure mechanism is absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira's desire to harmonize conflicting values is established in the opening ("Her entire career had been about balance, about harmonizing conflicting values") and governs the entire arc: she discovers her grandmother's impossible trade-off and chooses a parallel balance (silence now, exposure later). The motivation is dramatized through the decoding and the final decision, with visible friction (justice versus safety). Setup, development via the grandmother's parallel choice, and payoff at closure are all present. The motivation could be more viscerally tested—Mira faces no live antagonist—but it drives the ending with coherent cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears once in the closing paragraph as an authorial summary ("The dappled resolve she felt wasn't certainty but something better") rather than a tone sustained through beats. The story's actual tone—patient discovery, mounting moral weight, quiet determination—coheres across turns and charges the final image, but "dappled" as a descriptor feels imposed and abstract. The tone modulates with pressure (clinical during the adhesive test, emotional at the confession) and supports the ending, but the named element is ornamental. Functional tone without the specific label; late label-only mention trends low.</comment>
