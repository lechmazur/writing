<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Meren's motivation is clear and particularized through her role as weaver, with micro-choices shown in her positioning and stitching. Internal conflict between tradition and compassion is dramatized through her grandmother's voice and the broken precedents. The sleepwalkers remain atmospheric rather than individuated, but this fits the accumulative design. Emotional embodiment is present but sometimes slides toward label-work ("her motivation burned clear").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: the labyrinth transforms from prison to garden through Meren's stitching, with visible cost in her acceptance that "some ruins could not be mended." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The piece follows a mosaic-adjacent structure (past/present interleaved) that teaches its pattern early and holds the lens through closure. One meaningful deepening occurs as Meren's act breaks tradition with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The red canyon labyrinth is established early with sensory particulars (salt-crusted basins, ancient grooves) and directly constrains Meren's work—she waits for moisture to vanish, positions herself at convergence points. The illustration plate functions as micro-setting, charging the final image when held up in starlight. Spatial choreography of sleepwalkers' overlapping paths is clear and purposeful. The empty tide pools serve as both constraint and thematic anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: transforming the labyrinth from ordeal to invitation. Meren's agency is clear in her decision to sew the paths despite tradition, with visible cost in breaking precedent and her grandmother's potential condemnation. The piece operates under Accumulative pressure rather than causal escalation; one meaningful deepening occurs when the stitches hold and the new path forms. Coincidence does not resolve; Meren's deliberate action does.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (sewing paths) and images (whales in corridors, orchid against stone) rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: tradition can transform without erasing history, embodied in the empty tide pools accepted alongside the remade labyrinth. "Orchid solace" as concept arrives through accumulated particulars. The illustration plate reweights meaning without becoming allegory. Minor deduction for one thematic echo ("carve a path from ruin to reverence" stated then shown).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature filtered through Meren's craft knowledge and generational inheritance. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("phantom fishing boats," "creatures with translucent bodies"). No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance modulates appropriately between close observation and wider historical context. One minor register drift: "hauntingly optimistic" reads slightly evaluative rather than character-filtered, though it anchors to the illustration's qualities.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with strong imagery and rhythm variation. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Minor pattern detected: "Her grandmother/mother/[Meren]" parallel structure in paragraph two reads slightly templated but teaches the generational pattern. One filter-verb cluster in the opening paragraph ("had been carved," "still reached") appropriate for establishing deep time. "Orchid solace" as phrase feels slightly ornamental, though it's anchored to the final image. No loops or clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise—weaving paths through sleepwalkers' routes to remake a labyrinth—is fresh and specific, avoiding stock redemption arcs. The synthesis of craft tradition, broken precedent, and mercy feels inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend entirely on this weaver/labyrinth/sleepwalker combination. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and quiet ending heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. The "illustration plate as vision" motif is familiar but executed with specificity that earns freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Meren is present throughout, introduced in paragraph two. She makes the key decision to position herself and sew, breaking tradition (middle development). Her action directly creates the new path and she touches the wall in acceptance at closure (payoff). All three gates met. Her choices drive the central turn and her renunciation of cruel tradition has visible cost. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The illustration plate appears in paragraph four (setup), is physically handled and described as vision (middle), and is held up in starlight near closure where it reweights the labyrinth's transformation (payoff). All three gates met. It charges the final third by embodying the optimistic vision Meren enacts, but its specific properties (moonlit water, whales, children) don't constrain tactics—the vision could be conveyed other ways. Lyric reprise with thematic weight but limited causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Broken precedents is introduced in paragraph seven (setup slightly late but within first third), shapes Meren's core choice to reject tradition (middle), and the resolution explicitly addresses how she transforms precedent (payoff). All three gates met. The concept drives the central conflict: weavers maintained boundaries; Meren breaks them with visible cost (grandmother's condemnation, desecration charge). Strong causal pressure and closure participation; the story's logic depends on this exact tension.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Hauntingly optimistic" appears once as descriptor for the illustration (setup). It informs the vision Meren follows but doesn't constrain an on-page action with visible tradeoff—it's attributed to the artist's belief rather than enabling/limiting Meren's choice. Two gates (setup, thematic payoff at closure) but no middle development as action-constraint. The trait charges mood but remains more label than embodied cost. Lyric presence without tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Sew" is signaled early (paragraph two: "thread could bind more than fabric"), executed as the pivotal action in paragraph six ("Meren began to sew"), and completes at closure when "stitches held" and she gathers her thread. All three gates met. The action is irreplaceable—removing sewing breaks the weaver premise, the tactile method, and the metaphor of binding paths. High specificity (bone needle, hair thread) and strong closure linkage. The act redefines the labyrinth's function with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Overlapping sleepwalking paths introduced in paragraph three (setup: "paths overlapped in the labyrinth's heart"), the method is executed in paragraph six when Meren stitches the convergence point (middle development), and the new path guides sleepwalkers at closure (payoff). All three gates met. The method is specific and shapes the tactic—she must chart intersections, wait for convergence. Removing this exact mechanic would require a different weaving logic. Solid causal role and closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The labyrinth is introduced in the opening line (setup), Meren positions herself at convergence points and the grooves guide sleepwalkers (middle), and the red stone walls are touched at closure (payoff). All three gates met. The setting constrains Meren's work (she waits for dryness, uses established grooves) and the physical paths enable her stitching. The centuries-old history and tide-pool past add thematic weight and pressure the present choice. Strong integration across beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the tide pools empty" is established in the opening (setup) and recurs at closure ("The tide pools would remain empty"). Two gates met; middle development is thematic rather than tactical. The dryness constrains when Meren works ("after the last moisture vanished") with some causal pressure. Dawn's approach adds gentle urgency. The time window shapes conditions but doesn't create a live ticking clock that alters moves beat by beat. Functional constraint with lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation "to carve a path from ruin to reverence" is stated in paragraph eight but dramatized throughout: Meren watches suffering (paragraph four onward), chooses to break tradition (paragraph seven), and enacts transformation with visible cost (paragraphs nine-ten). Setup slightly delayed but all three gates present. The desire drives her key choice against precedent and the final image completes the reverence (touching ancient grooves, accepting empty pools). Strong causal link and closure participation; the exact phrasing matters less than the enacted transformation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Orchid solace" appears explicitly only in the penultimate paragraph but the tone—quiet, delicate resilience amid ruin—is coherent from the opening's elegiac register through the restrained ending. Setup is atmospheric rather than named; development maintains the register; payoff names and charges it ("delicate, rare, and quietly alive"). Two strong gates (tone throughout, explicit naming at closure). The tone modulates with task-focus during the sewing but returns to reflective solace at dawn. Coherent and purposeful but the late explicit mention limits full integration.</comment>
