<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Veloris's motivation is clearly established (sharing light without fire), but her choices feel more observational than agonizing. The gear-turning sequence shows micro-choices under pressure, yet internal contradiction is absent—she moves smoothly from realization to action without competing impulses. Embodied emotion is present ("troubling serenity...pressed against her thoughts like a weight"), though the final renunciation (leaving the gear) reads as fulfillment rather than foreclosure with visible cost. The absence of a second on-page character limits relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through nested metaphors (civilizations, falling petals, stored light) and the gear's discovery pattern, culminating in a cadence shift when resonance replaces fire. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image reweights the dominant stake (light vs. fire) with conceptual cost legible in "most civilizations would still choose fire." One persistent constraint (the gear's frequency mechanism) shapes the final tactic, satisfying the 9+ gate for closure quality. However, the turn itself—gear clicks, resonance spreads—feels more inevitable than earned by prior resistance, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The nebula garden is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: "celestial flowers blooming in colors that existed only in the spaces between stars," "crystalline petals...marking the timeframe of her contemplation." Sensory selection reflects Veloris's cosmic perspective without catalog sprawl. The garden constrains choice (sonar reveals dormant seeds, flowers store light) and charges the final image (the garden "bloomed brighter than before, a beacon"). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The micro-setting (gear in palm, petals falling) functions as setting by constraining the resonance mechanism, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (share light without fire) is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs: the gear clicks into the garden's frequency, revealing stored light and enabling non-destructive transmission. This tightening narrows options (she must match rotation to sonar) and changes knowledge (flowers are collectors, not decorations). However, escalation feels cerebral rather than visceral—no live opposition or reversal tests her commitment. The conceptual cost is legible ("most civilizations would still choose fire"), but the protagonist's agency reads more as discovery than decision under competing pressures. No antagonist or failure sequence pressures the final choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (generational destruction vs. light-sharing alternatives) emerges through the gear's lineage, seventeen fallen civilizations, and the garden's stored light. The closing image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "whether love could outlast destruction—remained unsolved across the generations yet to come." Subtext operates in the gear's worn teeth and the "troubling serenity" that acknowledges limited reach. However, thematic vocabulary occasionally edges toward prompt echo: "patterns of thinking," "generational patterns," "a pattern interrupted" cluster heavily. The final phrase "to remember, to witness, and to offer light" risks thematic statement, though it remains integrated with Veloris's role.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent with Veloris's cosmic perspective: "otherworldly sentimentalist," "sonar pinging echoed through the garden," "streams of gentle radiance." Filter verbs ("She understood," "She realized") appear but feel voice-motivated for a contemplative lens. Perceptual signature is present (she notices equations, frequencies, patterns), though under peak pressure (the gear-turning sequence) the syntax remains lyric rather than compressing. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose carries a distinct texture, though some phrases ("troubled serenity," "infinite corridors of space") lean toward stock SF idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or concept. However, runs of template cadence appear: "She understood...," "She began...," "She watched...," "She resumed..." across key beats, triggering the −0.4 stem-repetition penalty. One paraphrase loop: "The troubling serenity of the garden pressed against her thoughts" in paragraph three echoes "troubling serenity remained" near the end without added pressure. Figurative language is dense but controlled; one muddle: "streams of gentle radiance" after "dissolving" strains the vehicle. Clarity and propulsion remain strong overall, but artifacts at closure beats prevent entry to the 8-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic sentimentalist, generational failure, and resonance-as-alternative feels purposeful and non-obvious. Specific details (brass gear worn by grandmother-to-daughter lineage, sonar painting images, flowers as light collectors) ground the metaphor. However, the core frame—ancient observer witnesses cycles, discovers hope-in-alternative—reads as a familiar SF template. Transformation is partial: the gear's calibration function and the garden's storage architecture add freshness, but the emotional arc (witness despair → fragile hope) and the closing beat ("allowed herself to feel something resembling hope") follow well-worn paths. No close proximity to famous lines detected. Risk-taking is moderate; the lyric structure serves the concept without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Veloris (otherworldly sentimentalist) is established early and her cosmic perspective filters all perception. She makes the key choice to turn the gear and transmit the frequency, altering tactics (sonar + gear rotation). However, observation dominates—she drifts, watches, understands—and the final act (leaving the gear, resuming transit) feels more like ritual fulfillment than a decision that forecloses a contested path. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is thin. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The calculating machine gear appears in paragraph two (setup), is handled and turned in the climactic beat (development: clicks into frequency, enables resonance), and is set down in the closing sequence (payoff: left among roots, kept safe). The gear's worn teeth and encoded frequency are specific and irreplaceable; swapping it for another device would break the generational-lineage metaphor. It constrains the final tactic (must be turned to match sonar) and charges the closure image. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage present. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Generational patterns are signaled early ("grandmother to mother to daughter," "seventeen civilizations rise and collapse") and reappear in the closing reflection ("generations yet to come"). The concept shapes stakes (break the pattern) and the final image reweights it (one thread of light woven, but most will still choose fire). However, it functions more as thematic backdrop than on-page constraint—no moment where a generational mechanic alters Veloris's tactics. Lyric reprise present; causal pressure limited. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Approximates infinity" appears in the opening line (setup) and returns obliquely in "her endless transit" and "carry it forward into infinity" (payoff). It establishes scale and Veloris's timeless nature but does not constrain a single on-page choice—her actions within the garden would read identically if she were merely long-lived. Label-only attribute. Two gates (setup, payoff); no middle development. Ornamental use caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Transit frames the story (Veloris "drifted through," "resumed her transit") and her pause in the garden constitutes the narrative window. The action enables the encounter with the gear and flowers, but the key turn is the gear-rotation, not the transit itself. Transit could be swapped for "wandering" or "searching" with minor edits. Setup and payoff present; development weak. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sonar pinging is introduced midway ("activated her oldest ability. Sonar pinging echoed...") and drives the discovery beat: waves reveal dormant seeds and the flowers' storage architecture. She matches gear rotation to sonar frequency in the climactic sequence, enabling resonance. The method is specific and irreplaceable—visual observation alone would not yield the frequency solution. However, late introduction (past the 40% mark) and summary of the discovery ("Each ping revealed...") rather than dramatized iteration cap the score. Two gates (development, payoff); setup missing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The nebula garden is established in the opening line (setup), supplies the core resource (flowers as light collectors) that enables the resolution (development), and "bloomed brighter than before" in the final image (payoff). The garden's architecture (crystalline structures, geometric hearts, cosmic soil) constrains tactics (Veloris must use the flowers' resonance amplification) and charges closure (beacon for future seekers). Specific, causal, indispensable. Three gates, strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Across the quiet sigh of falling petals" appears twice (paragraph three and closing paragraph), marking contemplation and hope. The timeframe is poetic rather than tactical—no live clock pressures Veloris's moves, and the duration of the garden sequence is unspecified. Petals function more as mood marker than escalation device. Lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake slightly (contemplation → hope), but the time itself does not tighten decisions. Setup and payoff present; no middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation ("share light without using fire") is signaled early ("why she had come...to share light without using fire") and drives the gear-rotation sequence: she seeks non-combustive illumination, discovers the frequency method, and transmits it. The desire is dramatized in action (turning the gear, matching resonance) with conceptual cost (most will still choose fire). However, internal friction is absent—she never doubts the goal or weighs competing wants. Three gates met, causal pressure strong, but lack of conflicted choice prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Troubling serenity" is named in paragraph three and returns near the end ("The troubling serenity remained"), framing the entire sequence. Tone modulates subtly: the garden's quiet oppresses her contemplation early, then the "fragile" hope charges the final image with bittersweet acceptance. The oxymoron coheres (beauty + dread of repeated failure) and supports the Charged Poise closure. However, tone is more consistent than dynamic—the emotional register shifts minimally under pressure. Setup, development (implicit), and payoff present; charges closure but does not transform sharply across turns.</comment>
