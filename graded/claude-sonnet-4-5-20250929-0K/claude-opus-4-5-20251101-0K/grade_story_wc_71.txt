<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's dominant motive—understanding why some houses feel alive—is clear and drives her systematic action. Interiority is abundant and often specific ("inadvertently profound," "creeping normality noticer"), but the piece leans heavily on told reflection rather than embodied contradiction. The realization that "it wasn't the objects themselves that mattered but the attention paid to them" arrives as epiphany without prior dramatized friction between competing methods. No meaningful internal conflict or visible cost forecloses a path; Marina's stance deepens but does not alter under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The piece attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (insight that witnessing sanctifies), but the cost remains conceptual and abstract—no concrete on-page price (social, relational, or opportunity) is legible in the final image. The closing paragraph restates the insight without dramatizing a foreclosed option or visible trade-off, leaving closure asserted rather than landed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bay, streetlights, Whitmore house, and orris root are rendered with vivid, selective detail ("amber daydreaming," "fog-softened edges," "wood softened with rain"). The orris root's scent anchors the climactic interior beat and charges the final walk, constraining her embodied attention. Spatial choreography (porch, kitchen table, rooms) remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding house vitality—is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when Marina realizes attention, not objects, sanctifies space, but this insight emerges through reflection rather than a choice that narrows options. No visible price is paid; she simply moves to the Jensen cottage tomorrow with the same method intact. The lack of an on-page trade-off or foreclosed path keeps escalation told rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—witnessing as sanctification—emerges organically from the displaced-object method and Marina's realization. The final image (carrying the orris root "like a compass pointing toward all the abandoned places") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates cleanly in "the trying itself was the sanctification." Minor deduction: the grandmother's theory is introduced, corrected, and restated within a single reflective arc, reducing surprise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single POV with stable focalization and a distinct perceptual signature ("creeping normality noticer," "shard of hush"). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("inadvertently profound," "amber daydreaming"). Distance is consistent; psychic access remains Marina's throughout. No dialogue to evaluate. Mild register elevation in phrases like "sanctify a space" and "hushed blaze" stays within a literary narrator's plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is vivid ("gap-toothed with foreclosures," "streetlight pooled like honey"). However, paraphrase loops appear: the paragraph beginning "This was why some houses died..." restates the prior realization without adding pressure. Template cadence: "She'd spent three months documenting... trying to understand..." and "She sat... She rose and walked... She carried..." create a scaffolded feel in key transitions. Closure image is clear but the reflection-heavy final third dulls propulsion slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "attention as sanctification" premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on abandoned-house narratives. The displaced-object method and "creeping normality noticer" role are specific. Transformation test passes: swapping names would weaken the bay setting's particular texture. Deduction: the grandmother-as-corrected-oracle structure is familiar, and the insight arrives through solitary reflection rather than earned friction, reducing ingenuity at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marina's noticing habit frames the story early and drives her house visits. Her observation fuels the realization, but the decisive insight occurs via reflection, not a choice under pressure. Present across beats but observational work does not force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The orris root appears in the opening, is held during the Whitmore visit, releases scent at the climax, and is carried as a "compass" in the ending. Three distinct beats. It anchors sensory memory but does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; its role is more symbolic reprise than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Shard of hush" is introduced mid-story as a descriptor for profound silence. It recurs in the walk-through and closing, but functions thematically rather than shaping on-page stakes or altering tactics. Label-only depth; swappable with "deep silence" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" is applied to Marina's method early. The label colors her stance but does not constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost. It describes rather than pressures; ornamental trait mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Sanctify" is named explicitly in the realization beat and echoed in the closing reflection. It defines the thematic turn but arrives as epiphany, not dramatized action. Swappable with "honor" or "remember" at the phrase level; the concept matters more than the verb's irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Displacing objects (teacup, shoe, photograph) is demonstrated on-page at the Whitmore house and explained as the grandmother's method. It drives Marina's ritual and is promised again at the Jensen cottage. Present in setup, middle action, and closure plan. The method does not face a test or cost, limiting causal pressure, but it anchors two beats and the ending commitment.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The bay setting is introduced early and provides sensory texture (fog, warming mud, night heron). Spatial anchors (shore road, Whitmore porch, kitchen) guide movement. The setting supplies atmosphere but does not constrain a choice or alter Marina's tactics; she moves freely without environmental resistance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydream" opens the story and recurs at the end. Time of day (violet hour, full dark) is noted but does not tighten decisions. No clock pressure; Marina's process unfolds without temporal constraint or urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marina's desire to understand house vitality is stated early and drives her documentation and object-displacement practice. The realization answers the question. The motive is clear and consistent but told rather than tested through conflicting wants or external resistance; no friction between this desire and a competing cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" appears in the closing reflection, naming the effect Marina seeks to kindle. Tone throughout is meditative and lyric, modulating from evening calm to interior intensity during the realization, then returning to quiet resolve. The phrase charges the final image by naming the paradox (quiet yet vital) without forcing it.</comment>
