<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's interior contradiction—the tension between her broken heart and her archival devotion—is embodied through her micro-choices (photographing the button, replacing it exactly where Thomas left it). The parallel structure between Thomas's search and Eleanor's daily work earns the final stance: "she would never stop being broken-hearted... But she would also never stop looking." Marcus functions as efficient backstory that primes her lens without requiring on-page presence. Interiority remains concrete and character-particular throughout, with no therapy-speak even under emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (file room, Eleanor, present action of pulling folders). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases as the 1867 file deepens the pattern Eleanor has been tracing, then the button discovery crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant). The final image—"she would never stop looking"—reweights the opening dust-reading with undeniable cost: her heartbreak is permanent, yet her devotion persists. The closure lands on the page with felt cost; one meaningful deepening suffices at this length. Causality is clean within the accumulative frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The file room's dust patterns function as micro-setting that constrains Eleanor's method and charges the final image: "dust would continue to settle... marking the distance between what happened and what gets remembered." The 1867 file's brittle pages and the button's tarnish ground the historical layer in tactile specificity. Spatial choreography is coherent (shelf, floor, door) and the setting subtly mirrors Eleanor's isolation. The environment does not constrain a peak choice but does frame her work and recurs in the closing beat, reaching the 7-band threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Eleanor's purpose "in the margins of other people's tragedies." The button discovery tightens her commitment—she photographs it, catalogs it, then deliberately replaces it, a micro-choice that forecloses the safer path of treating it as mere artifact. The final paragraph reweights her daily return as both wound and gift, an Earned Stasis with visible cost: "she would never stop being broken-hearted." Agency is renunciation and endurance; the price is her perpetual heartbreak, legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—acts of quiet love as evidence worth preserving—emerges from Eleanor's cataloging work and the Thomas Reed file without meta-commentary. The button as left-behind token ("perhaps he needed to leave something behind so his search would not vanish entirely") resonates with Eleanor's database project. The final lines offer a non-literal answer: love's capacity and fragility are dual, and the work of remembering is both cost and gift. "Tactfully hopeful" is dramatized through her actions, not declared. The ending reweights the opening dust patterns with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Eleanor reads dust "like scripture" and traces ink with "reverent fingers." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—intimate at the button discovery, pulling back for the final reflection. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Diction remains within Eleanor's scholarly yet tender register throughout. The prose rhythm tightens during the file discovery and expands for the closing meditation, matching emotional pressure without breaking voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Sentence rhythm varies naturally with no algorithmic patterns. Minor scaffold appears: "which children had been sought, which had been abandoned twice over" and later "she would never stop being broken-hearted... she would also never stop looking" both rely on mirrored phrasing, but the repetition is purposeful and charges the closure rather than padding. No paraphrase loops, register drift, or clarity issues. Figurative language (dust as scripture, something "unfurl in her chest") is selective and integrated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The framing—dust patterns as archival scripture, a Civil War–era foster care search—offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The parallel between Thomas's button and Eleanor's cataloging transforms the familiar "broken archivist" premise through historical particularity and moral stakes (Freedmen's Bureau, post-emancipation reunion efforts). The ending's dual insight (heartbreak persists, devotion persists) feels earned rather than clever. Risk is moderate: the piece commits fully to its quiet register and lyric accumulation without retreat, but the emotional terrain remains adjacent to well-traveled templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor (broken-hearted archivist) is present throughout and makes two key choices: photographing the button/file and replacing the button exactly where Thomas left it. The second choice—replacement over retention—articulates her stance and forecloses the path of treating the button as mere object. Her heartbreak shapes her lens and endures at closure with visible cost. Early signal, two beats, closure linkage, but the choices are micro rather than plot-altering.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The infantryman's button appears in three beats: discovery (tumbles from file), examination (eagle design, tarnish), and replacement. It drives the middle beat (Eleanor imagines Thomas's visit, reads the clerk's notes) and charges the closure meditation ("acts of quiet love did not disappear"). Specific properties (Union Army, 54th Massachusetts) matter. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, but the button does not constrain Eleanor's key choice—she decides to replace it; the button itself is passive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Unknown histories" frames Eleanor's work from the opening (dust tells "which children had been sought, which had been abandoned") and reappears in her "catalog of unknown histories" and the final image ("thousands of folders... each one containing someone's attempt to find someone else"). The concept shapes her daily stake and the closure's thematic weight. It does not constrain a tactical choice but does reweight the ending image with conceptual cost, qualifying as Conceptual Repricing participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Tactfully hopeful" is declared once ("The work was tactfully hopeful, she had decided") but dramatized through Eleanor's measured actions: photographing rather than taking, replacing the button, continuing her unpaid cataloging. The trait constrains her stance—she does not believe the stories "would change the world" yet persists—but the cost is distributed rather than tied to one on-page choice. Label-only mention lowers the score; the trait's friction with her heartbreak is present but not acute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unfurl" appears once ("Eleanor felt something unfurl in her chest, a tenderness she had thought Marcus had killed") at the button discovery. The action marks her emotional turn and enables the subsequent imagining of Thomas, but it is internal and could be replaced with a near-synonym (awaken, revive) without breaking story logic. It signals emotional shift but does not constrain a choice or drive the ending image. One beat, mid-scene, swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Through accumulated dust patterns" is signaled early ("Eleanor had learned to read them like scripture") and mentioned again ("the dust patterns that indicated no one had opened this folder in decades"), but the method does not shape Eleanor's key choice or constrain her tactics. The dust functions as atmospheric detail and thematic metaphor rather than a mechanical necessity. It does not alter the ending or complicate her work; she could catalog without reading dust with minor edits. Two mentions, no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The foster care file room is present throughout, anchoring Eleanor's work and isolation. The shelves, brittle 1867 file, wooden floor, and door frame the action. The setting supplies the button (via the file) and provides Eleanor's resource (the archive itself). It charges the final image ("shelves stretching toward the ceiling... marking time, marking neglect") with thematic weight. The room does not constrain a peak choice but does enable her work and reweight the closure. Three gates, closure linkage, modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the emancipation" anchors the 1867 file's historical stakes (Freedmen's Bureau, Thomas Reed seeking Samuel) and charges the thematic weight of reunion attempts. The timeframe is signaled and its social context matters, but it does not tighten Eleanor's present-day decisions or create urgency. The historical layer enriches setting and theme without constraining tactics. Setup present, thematic payoff present, but no middle development or on-page time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To magnify small kindnesses" is Eleanor's stated motivation ("She did it to magnify small kindnesses, to ensure that acts of quiet love did not disappear") and dramatized through her cataloging, photographing, and replacement of the button. The desire is conflicted with cost: her heartbreak persists, yet she continues. Two beats (mid-story declaration, closure action), closure linkage, and visible friction between want (preserve kindness) and cost (perpetual brokenness). The motivation shapes her stance and forecloses the path of stopping.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Examined unknown" is maintained through Eleanor's meditative, scholarly tone and her careful attention to the file's marginalia, the button's details, and the dust's testimony. The tone modulates slightly—tightening at the button discovery, expanding for the closing reflection—without breaking coherence. It charges the final image ("she would never stop looking") with quiet gravity. The tone does not shift under pressure but does support the Accumulative/Textural lens and the closure's Resonant Reconfiguration. Coherent, purposeful, closure-linked.</comment>
