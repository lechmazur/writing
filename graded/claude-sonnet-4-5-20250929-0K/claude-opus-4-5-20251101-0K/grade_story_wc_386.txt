<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is concrete and textured—her vocation shapes perception ("psychic residue," "windows of consciousness"), and her relationship to the dead feels lived-in. The choice to expose truth is motivated by her role and Elise's demonstrated need, but the decision itself lands without visible internal conflict or competing impulse; she moves from understanding to resolve without dramatized hesitation. Elise's portrayal is evocative but thin—her desperation is told more than shown through dream-image choreography. The harbormaster's son appears only as a named consequence, not an on-page pressure that complicates Mira's stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes Mira's setting, vocation, and the ghost-haunting problem cleanly within the first third. Causality flows: villagers bring journals → Mira reads dreams → she discovers the lighthouse sabotage → she resolves to expose it. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elise steps through the opened window, her recognition secured, and Mira carries the snow globe into dawn with the truth pending before the council. Cost is conceptual and felt—Mira will name a dead man's crime and implicate his living son—but the final image charges that poise without showing the confrontation or its social fallout on the page. The lens reads Causal with Accumulative undertones (dream-pattern analysis, ice-memory motif), and the ending holds under that hybrid without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is vivid and purposeful: candle-lit ice serves as the literal "window of connection," and the cold is both atmospheric and functional (thins the veil, embodies sacred patience). Spatial choreography is clear—Mira kneels, places the snow globe, closes her eyes, opens them as candles burn low, then leaves. The melted snow globe itself becomes micro-setting, warm "as if Elise's hands still cradled it," and that warmth charges the final departure. The setting constrains choice (ice shrine enables ghost contact) and recurs in the closure image (candles gutter, shrine returns to silence), meeting the 9+ test for environment shaping tactics and the final moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—give Elise recognition and expose the truth—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure tightens when Mira discovers the harbormaster's father in Marcus's dream margin, narrowing her choice to silence or exposure. The cost is conceptual and social (implicate a living man for his father's crime), legible in "The truth was a knife, and Mira had to decide where to cut." No on-page confrontation or reversal tests Mira's commitment under immediate resistance; she resolves to speak at dawn without visible opposition or internal friction in the deciding moment. The escalation is present but operates more through knowledge accumulation than through contested agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: windows of connection (ice as veil-thinner, dreams as margin-space, snow globe as cradled link), memory held in ice and objects, salvaging recognition from wreckage. The final image—Elise stepping through, light reaching secondhand through frozen water—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of witness and passage without stating a moral. "That was enough. / That had always been enough" risks thematic underlining but remains rooted in Mira's vocation and the story's recurring motif of borrowed light. No diagnostic label-speak or overt allegory; subtext operates cleanly in gesture (warm snow globe, guttering candles) and the shift from "window remained open" to "stepped through."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-close on Mira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—"psychic residue," "dreams came to her like photographs," "calcified into silence"—mixing the occupational (wreck-diver ghost whisperer idiom) with lyric compression. Distance control is clean, though some elevated diction ("threshold of consciousness," "windows she could peer through") trends slightly formal for crisis interiority. No dialogue on the page. The phrase "Mira weaves truth carefully" momentarily breaks into present tense and meta-commentary ("knowing that exposure demanded precision") in a way that feels like prompt-echo rather than scene pressure, but the lapse is brief and does not recur. Rhythm modulates well from meditative setup to charged closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and image-rich. Information density is high: most sentences advance setting, character knowledge, or thematic resonance. Minor scaffold appears: "someone who descended into sunken vessels not for gold but for voices" is functional exposition but slightly over-explanatory for the established tone. The phrase "weaves truth carefully, knowing that exposure demanded precision" reads as meta-commentary inserted mid-flow, creating a small momentum dip. No loops, synonym churn, or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled and consistent (ice/memory, light/borrowed, windows/connection) without mixed metaphors. One participial ambiguity: "their light borrowed starlight reflected through frozen depths" compresses syntax nearly to opacity, though context rescues meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The wreck-diver ghost whisperer vocation is fresh and the mechanism—ghosts haunting dream-margins via witnesses' grief-cracks—offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The glacier shrine as connection-window and the melted snow globe as warm relic are particular and textured. The core turn (lighthouse lamp extinguished for insurance fraud) is a solid mystery payoff but not especially novel; the emotional center—salvaging recognition over revenge—transforms the familiar haunting premise with moral specificity. The borrowed-starlight motif and ice-as-memory metaphor are elegantly handled but trend toward well-trodden lyric territory. Risk is present in the quiet, image-driven closure and the choice to leave confrontation off-page, which succeeds without obscuring stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's role is established early and drives all major beats: she receives journals, analyzes dream-images, identifies Elise and the sabotage, and resolves to expose the truth. Her decision to speak at dawn is the story's hinge, and her vocation (ghost whisperer, truth-weaver) shapes tactics and closure. She appears in the opening, middle analysis, and final departure, meeting setup/development/payoff. The choice to expose is causally motivated but not tested by on-page opposition or internal friction; she moves from discovery to resolve without visible struggle. Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is strong (she carries the snow globe out, opens the window for Elise).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The snow globe is introduced in paragraph two, handled and described ("warped into something that resembled a teardrop," "miniature ship encased in clouded resin"), and returns with reweighted meaning in the resolution ("warm despite the cold, as if Elise's hands still cradled it"). It anchors Elise's identity and serves as the relic Mira will present to the council. Three beats: placement at shrine, psychic reading, final carry-out. The object is specific (melted, from the Celestine wreck) and irreplaceable within the story's ghost-contact logic. It does not constrain a middle choice or force a trade-off, keeping it below the highest bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Windows of connection" is signaled early (ice shrine thins the veil, ghosts slip through "margins of consciousness") and recurs in Mira's method (dream-analysis as window-access) and the closure ("The window remained open. / Elise Varnum, at last, stepped through"). The concept shapes Mira's vocation and the mechanism by which she identifies Elise, meeting setup and payoff. It does not constrain a middle choice or create visible friction; it functions more as thematic frame than tactical pressure. The final image reweights it from metaphor to literal passage, elevating integration. Present across all three gates but more resonant than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" appears once in mid-story meta-commentary: "Mira weaves truth carefully, knowing that exposure demanded precision." The phrase reads as prompt-echo rather than dramatized trait. No prior or subsequent action shows Mira weighing how much truth to reveal, to whom, or in what order; she moves directly from discovery to full-exposure resolve without on-page calibration. The trait is told, not embodied through choice. It appears in development but does not constrain action or enable a cost-bearing decision. Swappable with "chooses her words" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Expose" is signaled as Mira's resolution in the penultimate section ("She would expose the truth to the village council at dawn") and drives the closure's Charged Poise—Elise steps through because recognition is secured, and Mira carries the evidence toward the council. The action is the story's hinge and shapes the ending's cost (implicating the harbormaster's son). It is not dramatized on the page; the confrontation and its fallout occur after the text ends. Setup is present (villagers bring journals, truth emerges), payoff is clear (Mira commits and Elise is freed), but middle development is thin—no on-page obstacle tests the choice. Strong closure linkage, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method is established early: Mira is "someone who descended into sunken vessels not for gold but for voices," and villagers bring "sleep journals" reporting "phantom passengers standing on dream-docks." Mira's work is shown on the page—she traces patterns across three dreamers' accounts, identifies Elise by recurring image, and finds the harbormaster's father "hidden behind the phantom woman" in Marcus's dream margin. The mechanics matter: dream-analysis is how Mira solves the mystery and earns the right to name the crime. Present in setup (journals, dream-margin explanation), development (tracing patterns, finding the saboteur), and payoff (recognition secured, window opened). Specific, irreplaceable, and causally active.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The shrine is introduced in the opening line and described vividly across the first third: carved by monks, candle-lit, glacier walls painted amber, ice serving as "window of connection." Mira kneels within it, performs her analysis there, and the shrine's cold "seep[s] into her," enabling ghost contact. The setting returns at closure: candles gutter, shrine returns to silence. It constrains the ghost-whispering ritual (ice thins the veil) and charges the final image (patience "as only ice can be"). Setup, development (site of the dream-reading), and payoff are all present. The shrine is essential to the method and irreplaceable within the story's logic, though it does not alter tactics mid-scene or create a complication.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To salvage something pure from the wreckage" is named explicitly in the penultimate section as the motivation binding Mira and Elise: "For Elise, it was acknowledgment... For Mira, it was the knowledge that some windows of connection... could offer passage both ways." The desire is told rather than dramatized through competing wants or friction. Mira's vocation (ghost whisperer) implies the motivation from the start, and the resolution enacts it (she will give Elise forty-three witnesses), but no on-page moment shows Mira weighing the cost of exposure against silence or safety. The motivation shapes closure and is present in setup (her role) and payoff (the decision to speak), but lacks visible struggle or trade-off in development.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Borrowed starlight" appears in the opening ("their light borrowed starlight reflected through frozen depths") and returns in the penultimate section: "stars she couldn't see still burned. Their light reached her only secondhand, filtered through frozen water and the dreams of strangers, but it reached her nonetheless." The tone is lyric, meditative, and elegiac throughout—no tonal breaks or register clashes. The motif charges the closure by linking ice, light, witness, and passage: Mira's work (secondhand contact with the dead) mirrors the way starlight reaches her. Coherent across all beats, modulates subtly with the candles' dimming, and reweights the dominant stake (recognition through intermediaries) in the final image. Strong thematic and tonal integration.</comment>
