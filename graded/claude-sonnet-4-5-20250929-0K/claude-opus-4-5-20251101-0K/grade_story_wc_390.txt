<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and her "logically emotional" trait shows up in her analytical processing of grief, but the execution leans heavily on told interiority rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic choice—to become a living tuning fork—arrives without prior micro-choices that show her wrestling with the cost of self-dissolution; we're told she "felt peace" during molecular disintegration rather than shown contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final sacrifice reads as determined rather than earned through on-page struggle, and the phrase "logically emotional" functions more as a label than a trait that constrains her actions with visible friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear causal chain: Consortium threat → Vera's decision to release the Tone → vibrational matching → dissolution. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first two paragraphs. The closure unit is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (Vera disperses into sound, the bell cracks, absolution spreads), and the drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture in the final beats. One weakness: the "vibrational matching" mechanism and Vera's unique qualification for it arrive late without prior setup, creating a mild convenience feel. The inferred lens (Hybrid: Causal escalation → Accumulative closure) holds, and the cost is legible on the page, though the final image could be more specific.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina and ice-chapel are vividly rendered with purpose-driven detail: "frozen pontoons," "mournful whales," "translucent walls." The setting constrains Vera's choices (limited time before dark, physical journey through ice) and charges the final image (the azure coat left behind). The "fleshly ethereal" tone is integrated into sensory description ("air itself seemed to thicken," "frozen air"). Minor issue: occupational detail (lighthouse engineer) is declared but never shapes a tactical choice; her professional skill set doesn't visibly inform her approach to the bell or the vibrational task.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protecting the Source Tone from commodification—is signaled early and pressure tightens through the approaching vessel's lights and the twenty-minute sunset countdown. One meaningful escalation occurs: Vera shifts from hiding to releasing the Tone, a decision that narrows her options and leads to self-sacrifice. However, the escalation is more declared than dramatized; we're told she "understood what she must do" rather than shown her weighing alternatives or facing a genuine dilemma. The vibrational matching process, while visceral, unfolds without tactical friction or failed attempts that would raise the cost. The ending pays a price (her dissolution), but the path there feels more inevitable than hard-won.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars: the tension between preservation and release, the impossibility of commodifying the sacred, and the cost of being a vessel for something larger. The final image—Vera becoming sound, the bell cracking, absolution spreading—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The "Source Tone" and "vibrational matching" concepts integrate with the theme of sonic absolution. One slip: the phrase "the logical conclusion of a life spent protecting light" in the penultimate beat edges toward thematic echo, though it's framed as Vera's thought rather than authorial summary. The closing line ("a frequency of absolution, eternal and free") reweights the material without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Vera's perceptual signature is consistent: analytical yet feeling ("logically emotional" filters her processing of grief and duty). Psychic distance modulates appropriately, tightening during the vibrational matching sequence. Voice texture is present in specific word choices ("fleshly ethereal," "synchronized with the artifact's dormant energy"). However, some diction feels slightly elevated beyond the moment's urgency—"requisite," "vibrational matching," "molecular level"—creating minor register drift during peak stress. No head-hopping, and the prose rhythm supports the escalating pressure, though a few filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") could be tightened in high-intensity beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. The opening anchors voice and stakes effectively. Clarity issues: "fleshly ethereal" appears twice without clear integration into the action (Q3 credited its atmospheric use; here it reads as ornamental repetition). Minor paraphrase loop: "She had perhaps twenty minutes before full dark" is closely echoed by "The golden sunset was already fleeting, its warmth fading into violet." A few stock metaphors ("each heartbeat a drum," "ripples") and a template-cadence run in the middle section (three consecutive sentences beginning with "She" + verb). No major artifacts touch the closure beat, but cumulative minor slips prevent higher scoring. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—an engineer must become a living tuning fork to release a sacred sound before mercenaries commodify it—offers a fresh synthesis of fantasy, environmental stakes, and acoustic mysticism. The drift-ice setting and "Source Tone" concept feel specific rather than generic. However, the emotional arc (duty → self-sacrifice) follows a familiar template, and the "vibrational matching" mechanism arrives as a late convenience without prior grounding in Vera's skill set or the world's rules. The transformation of the "guardian of a sacred object" trope is competent but not startling. One strong fresh inflection: the idea that dispersal prevents commodification by denying a single recording. The ending's resonance is earned, but the path there doesn't surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera is present throughout and makes the central decision to release the Tone rather than hide it, altering tactics mid-story. Her role as lighthouse engineer is declared but never shapes a choice; the occupation could swap for "scholar" or "guardian" without structural impact. She demonstrates agency in the climax (vibrational matching, self-sacrifice), meeting the middle development and closure gates. However, her decision is more determined than conflicted—"she understood what she must do" arrives without prior micro-choices that narrow options. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (skiff journey, bell sequence) (+0.9), closure linkage (dissolution) (+1.0), but swappability of the occupation (−0.5) and summary-only deliberation (−0.5) lower the score. Total: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The crypt keeper's key is seeded early (setup gate met), used twice (unlocking the chapel door, mentioned as "resting atop" the coat at the end), and its hereditary significance is established. However, its function is purely mechanical—any key would serve the plot equally well. The "seven generations" detail adds texture but doesn't constrain Vera's choice or reweight meaning at closure; the key simply enables entry. It participates in the ending image as a relic "without purpose," a minor lyric reprise (+0.4), but it doesn't shape the vibrational matching or cost of dissolution. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), closure cameo (+0.3), but high swappability (−0.7) caps the score. Total: 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sonic absolution is the story's conceptual spine: it shapes the stake (protecting the Tone from commodification), drives Vera's tactic (release via vibrational matching), and pays off in the climax (absolution spreading, "mercenaries wept openly"). The concept is seeded early ("their accumulated griefs and guilts dissolved into pure resonance"), developed in the middle (Vera's realization that release prevents fragmentation), and anchors the closure (the frequency of absolution spreading). It could not be swapped without collapsing the plot. Early signal (+0.7), three beats (threat, decision, dispersal) (+1.4), causal pressure (narrows options to release) (+1.2), closure linkage (absolution realized) (+1.5), irreplaceability (+0.7), cost connection (self-dissolution) (+0.5). Total: 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Logically emotional" is declared early and illustrated once in Vera's analysis of the Consortium threat ("filtered each feeling through rigorous analysis"). However, the trait doesn't visibly constrain an on-page action with cost. During the climax, Vera's approach is purely intuitive (humming, seeking resonance), not analytical; the trait could be removed without altering her choices. It functions more as characterization flavor than a causal force. Early signal (+0.4), one beat (threat processing) (+0.4), but no causal pressure (−0.8), no closure linkage (−0.7), label-only in peak moments (−0.3). Total: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Adapt" is seeded through Vera's career background ("learning to adapt—to shifting ice conditions, to failing equipment") and shapes her approach to the bell (adapting her frequency to match the artifact's). It drives the climactic turn (vibrational matching) and is essential to closure (her cells "synchronize," enabling the Tone's release). However, the term itself is generic; swapping "adapt" for "attune" or "harmonize" would preserve the structure. The concept's work is strong, but its label is not irreplaceable. Early signal (+0.6), two beats (reflection, matching sequence) (+0.9), causal pressure (+1.0), closure linkage (+1.2), but swappability of the term (−0.6), summary-only in the reflective beat (−0.4). Total: 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Vibrational matching" is introduced late (final third, in Vera's reflection on adaptation) and immediately deployed in the climax. It is causally essential—without it, Vera cannot unlock the bell—but the mechanism lacks prior setup or failed attempts that would show its difficulty. The method is specific and irreplaceable (swapping it for "ritual" or "prayer" would require rewriting the closure), but late arrival and summary treatment weaken integration. Mentioned at ~60% (+0.0 for late intro, −0.4 penalty), one beat (matching sequence) (+0.4), causal pressure (enables Tone release) (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.0), irreplaceability (+0.6), but late introduction (−0.7), resolves a problem it did not help create (−0.5). Total: 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is established early and provides spatial grounding, but its main function is atmospheric rather than tactical. The ice chunks scraping the skiff hull and the "maze of drift-ice" create texture, yet Vera's journey through them is not shown to constrain her approach or delay her arrival in ways that alter the outcome. The ice-chapel (a micro-setting shift within the same seascape) is where the key action occurs, and the frozen environment contributes to tone. Early signal (+0.6), two locations (marina, chapel) (+0.6), tone support (+0.4), but limited causal pressure (setting does not force a tactical choice) (−0.5), no closure linkage beyond backdrop (−0.3). Total: 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "fleeting golden sunset" and twenty-minute countdown are seeded early and create urgency: "She had perhaps twenty minutes before full dark, and the recovery vessel's lights were visible now." Time pressure shapes Vera's decision to act immediately (commandeering the skiff, racing to the chapel). The sunset extinguishes at the end, marking the closure moment. However, the clock is not tracked beat-by-beat during the vibrational matching sequence, softening its tactical impact in the climax. Early signal (+0.7), two beats (departure, closure timestamp) (+0.9), causal pressure (forces immediate action) (+1.0), closure linkage (sunset extinguishes as Vera disperses) (+1.0), but mid-action clock tracking is absent (−0.4). Total: 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"To protect a sacred artifact" is seeded early (the crypt keeper's duty, the key's hereditary significance) and drives every major choice: Vera's journey to the chapel, her decision to release rather than hide the Tone, and her self-sacrifice. The motivation is tested when she realizes hiding won't work, forcing a shift to release—a meaningful friction. It anchors the closure (the Tone protected by dispersal, the key rendered purposeless). Early signal (+0.7), three beats (setup, decision shift, sacrifice) (+1.4), causal pressure (narrows to release as only viable tactic) (+1.2), closure linkage (protection fulfilled at cost of self) (+1.4), cost connection (dissolution) (+0.5), but the shift from hide to release is told more than dramatized (−0.5). Total: 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Fleshly ethereal" is declared as a descriptor ("air itself seemed to thicken around her, fleshly ethereal") and recurs in Vera's transformation ("being unmade and reassembled... fleshly and ethereal simultaneously"). The tone modulates with pressure, grounding visceral detail (body, cold, ice) against mystical imagery (Source Tone, dispersal into sound). However, the phrase itself is somewhat ornamental; its exact wording could swap for "corporeal and spectral" without structural loss. The tone charges the final image (Vera becoming "less solid, more sound"), meeting the payoff gate. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (journey, transformation) (+0.9), closure linkage (tone embodied in dispersal) (+1.0), coherence across turns (+0.6), but phrase swappability (−0.5), mild overwriting in application (−0.3). Total: 6.6.</comment>
