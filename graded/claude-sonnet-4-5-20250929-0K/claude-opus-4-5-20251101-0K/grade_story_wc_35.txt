<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her curse creates embodied constraint through touch-avoidance and taste-floods. The final choice to surgically deposit only harmful remorse while keeping lessons learned is earned by the pavilion revelation, though the "careful with ingredients, gentle with customers" formulation edges toward stock service-worker virtue. Internal contradiction appears when she tastes the coral's emptiness and pulls back, demonstrating genuine deliberation under pressure. The touch of Cassius at the end forecloses her three-year isolation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page: Elara's selective deposit creates a Decisive Change with visible cost (she keeps painful memories that teach). Causal lens holds: rain creates map → she follows tidal pools → discovers pavilion → tastes others' emptiness → chooses surgical transfer → emerges changed, touches Cassius willingly. The "close of an unspoken dream" timeframe functions more as atmosphere than constraint, creating mild lens wobble, but the core because/therefore chain remains intact and the cost is legible in the final cooking scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fortress courtyard's drainage channels and mud-softened dunes guide her path; tidal pools function as a puzzle that constrains access. The coral pavilion's impossible ice and preserved formations charge the climax through tactile interaction. "Sturdy brittle" light appears once as vivid but doesn't recur or constrain choice. Spatial choreography remains clear (courtyard → eastern gate → dunes → descent → cavern), and the chef's knife strapped to her thigh is noted early but never returns, creating minor setup debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—releasing toxic remorse—is signaled early and tightens when the pavilion offers total subsumption. The reversal (tasting emptiness in the coral, pulling back) is earned by her gift and narrows options to surgical deposit. Agency is clear: she chooses what to keep versus release, and the cost appears immediately in touching Cassius and later cooking without trembling. The garrison cooking scene demonstrates the trade-off's permanence. No coincidence resolves; her curse led her here and her decision reshapes her future.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the particulars of what remorse teaches versus what it destroys, culminating in the final line's "gentle reminder of what it cost to love imperfect people imperfectly." The pavilion's cold-as-emotion and the taste-memory curse interweave without thesis statements. The lamb's "final contentment" in the closing beat offers a non-literal answer: honoring what you consume, whether food or memory. Minor slip: "sandpaper rough memories" borders on prompt-echo phrasing, though it's attributed to Elara and contextualized by her trade.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady with Elara's perceptual signature (taste-driven, chef's lexicon, texture-focused). "Sturdy brittle" light and "weeping moisture" reflect her sensory priorities. Cassius's dialogue is sparse but goal-driven ("You'll need to analyze..."). Minor register drift: "subsume her remorse" and "compassion their suffering had built" elevate diction slightly above the embodied voice dominant elsewhere, though not enough to break focalization. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance. "The desert fortress after rain became something almost alive, its stone walls weeping moisture that wouldn't last the afternoon" compresses setting and time pressure efficiently. Stock metaphor: "like ink into water" for emotional bleed is generic. Minor paraphrase loop: "the pavilion wanted to subsume her remorse, to absorb her mother's guilt" restates in adjacent clauses without new pressure. "At the close of an unspoken dream" is striking but the follow-up explanation ("that liminal hour when...") dilutes the image with scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The chef-curse premise (tasting memories in ingredients) is specific and shapes the pavilion's function freshly. The turn—keeping useful pain, releasing only destructive remorse—avoids the all-or-nothing binary common to burden-release templates. "Coral icebound pavilion beneath the dunes" is vivid but the accumulated-remorse-as-place mechanic echoes fantasy-quest structures without deep transformation. The final image (cooking lamb with steady hands) synthesizes the arc concretely. Proximity check passes; no close echoes detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Chef who can taste memories: Setup (paragraph 3), Development (drives her to the pavilion, informs her choice when she tastes the coral's emptiness), Payoff (cooking scene shows the gift now bearable). Causal pressure: her curse creates the quest and the diagnostic tool at climax. Two beats (tasting coral, cooking lamb) plus closure linkage. Irreplaceable: the specific sensory gift enables the surgical decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Coral icebound pavilion beneath the dunes: Setup (whispered goal, paragraph 4), Development (she descends, touches pillar, tastes thousands of memories, experiences the subsumption offer), Payoff (her selective deposit and the coral's blue glow). Three beats with evolving use (goal → tactile interaction → transformation). High irreplaceability: the coral's dual nature (storage + revelation of emptiness) drives the turn. Causal and closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stored remorse: Setup (paragraph 4 "stores remorse, accumulated it like sediment"), Development (the coral's cold-as-emotion and her tasting others' deposited pain), Payoff (she deposits selectively, coral grows and glows). Shapes stakes directly: the pavilion offers total relief, she chooses partial. Two beats plus closure. Irreplaceable: the concept's specificity (remorse that can be physically stored and sorted) enables the surgical choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Emotionally contagious through touch: Setup (paragraph 3 "when she touched another person's skin, her emotions bled into them"), Development (implicit in her three-year avoidance), Payoff (touching Cassius deliberately as proof of change). One strong beat (Cassius touch with visible cost) plus closure linkage. Constraint visible: three years of isolation. Mid-band because the middle section doesn't dramatize a touch-attempt or near-miss that would add a second beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Subsume: Setup (paragraph 4 "deposit what she carried"), Development ("the pavilion wanted to subsume her remorse" triggers the turn when she tastes emptiness), Payoff (she allows partial subsumption, surgical transfer). The verb "subsume" appears explicitly at the climax and the choice pivots on resisting total subsumption. Two beats (temptation, selective acceptance). Swappability test: "absorb" or "consume" would function but "subsume" carries connotations of erasure that fit the thematic stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Analyzing tidal pool formations: Setup (Cassius instructs, paragraph 6 "You'll need to analyze"), Development (she kneels, sees spiral patterns that mimic coral, follows the map), Payoff (pools lead her to the pavilion entrance). One functional beat (reading the map). Present in two scenes but mechanics remain vague—no cost or constraint tied to misreading. Swappable: any rain-sign could serve; the specificity of "tidal pool formations" doesn't alter her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Desert fortress after rain: Setup (paragraph 2, first sentence), Development (drainage channels and mud guide her path, dunes soften to allow descent), Payoff (sun dries the walls white when she emerges, marking time passage). Two beats where rain's aftermath enables movement. The micro-setting (body, knife) is noted but the knife never returns. Mid-band: the rain's effect supplies access but doesn't constrain a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>At the close of an unspoken dream: Setup (paragraph 9 "that liminal hour when the subconscious releases its grip"), Development (used as atmospheric frame), Payoff (absent—time pressure doesn't tighten the decision). One mention, ornamental. The phrase is vivid but doesn't create a deadline or shape tactics. The "hours until evaporation" mentioned for the tidal pools is concrete time pressure; the "unspoken dream" frame is metaphorical and doesn't constrain.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>To sandpaper rough memories: Setup (paragraph 7, Elara's stated goal to Cassius), Development (the pavilion offers total smoothing, she tastes the cost of erasure, chooses selective smoothing), Payoff (final line "smoothed now, no longer cutting"). Three beats: declaration, pivot, fulfillment. High irreplaceability: the tactile "sandpaper" metaphor threads through to "smoothed" and shapes the surgical vs. total choice. Cost visible: she keeps pain that teaches.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sturdy brittle: Setup (paragraph 9 "light was sturdy brittle, golden but ready to shatter"), Development (implicit in the fortress walls weeping then drying), Payoff (tone modulates from tense discovery to quiet competence in the cooking scene). One strong image, tone coherent but "sturdy brittle" as a phrase doesn't recur or charge the final moment. Mid-band: the tone is consistent and apt but doesn't constrain or reweight the closure image directly.</comment>
