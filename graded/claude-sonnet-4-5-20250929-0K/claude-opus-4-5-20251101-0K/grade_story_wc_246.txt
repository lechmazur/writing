<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and her interior life is sufficiently concrete, particularly in her relationship with her mentor's teachings. The emotional stakes of having destroyed a civilization anchor her choices. However, the final decision to send the corrected message feels somewhat easy—the anomaly conveniently provides a revision opportunity without forcing her to face a meaningful tradeoff or foreclosure. The piece needed Vera to sacrifice something tangible or accept an irreversible cost to earn the resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early). The drive lens reads as Causal with situational coloring: Vera's original mistake → Kepler response arrives early due to anomaly → she can revise. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (she transmits the correction and observes the star brighten), and cost is present but soft—she gains relief rather than paying a price that forecloses a path. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Kepler question arrives, narrowing her options. The causal chain holds, though the anomaly's convenience slightly undercuts earned tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is vividly rendered with concrete sensory details (spacetime unbending, starlight shifting) and it constrains the plot—only here can time be edited. The dried-up fountain pen functions as micro-setting, charging two beats (initial mention tied to mentor, final use during transmission). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The anomaly's recursive time effects feel specific to this world and enable the climactic choice, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for setting-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (can she undo the Kepler destruction?) is signaled early and pressure accumulates when their clarifying question arrives, creating one meaningful tightening. However, the resolution feels gifted rather than earned through agency—the anomaly's temporal distortion solves the problem Vera didn't help create in this story window. She composes a better message, but faces no forced tradeoff or irreversible loss in doing so. The cost is conceptual (years of self-punishment) rather than dramatized in the present.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (mistakes can be revised through humility and patience) emerges organically from the anomaly's properties and Vera's arc. The fountain pen and "confidently uncertain" motif recur with purpose, and "editing history" operates as both literal plot and thematic spine. The final image (anomaly humming, "familiar as breath") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The piece resists tidy binaries and embraces productive uncertainty. Minor deduction: "strange comfort" and the closing wisdom-statement ("felt less like a burden and more like wisdom") edge toward theme summary rather than letting the image do all the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: Vera's scientific training colors her observations (probability cascades, translation matrices), and the prose modulates appropriately under pressure. Diction remains controlled and voice-consistent. No dialogue present, so those bullets are waived. The piece maintains narrative distance without head-hopping. Minor slip: "the knowledge that history could be edited, that wrong seeds could sometimes be replanted" in the penultimate paragraph slightly over-articulates the thematic takeaway in a way that reduces trust in the reader.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Opening and closing images are strong. However, the piece carries template-cadence runs ("She had come here... she had found"; "Tomorrow she would... Tonight, she allowed") and mild paraphrase loops around the core concept (editing history, revising work, unmade mistakes). The phrase "confidently uncertain" appears three times with diminishing returns. Figurative language is controlled, though "time folded like wet paper" and "starlight arrived centuries late" in the opening paragraph stack without clear progression. No opacity at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly as time-editor offers a fresh angle on "fixing past mistakes," and the celestial signal interpreter role feels specific. The combination of temporal distortion + interstellar miscommunication is well-integrated. However, the core emotional arc (guilt → redemption via second chance) follows a familiar template, and the anomaly's convenience—allowing revision without meaningful sacrifice—undercuts the boldness. The Kepler civilization's preemptive question is the story's most inventive turn, but it arrives to solve rather than complicate. Solid execution of a recognizable structure rather than transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera (celestial signal interpreter) drives the key decision: she composes and transmits the corrected message, which alters the Kepler star's brightness. Her role is causally active in setup (original error), middle (receives clarifying question), and closure (sends correction). Her professional skills (translation matrices, signal interpretation) shape her tactics. The interpretation is indispensable to the closure unit.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The fountain pen appears in two beats: initial description linking to Okonkwo's teaching, and Vera grabbing it during the climax to trace equations on her palm. The nib's dryness charges both mentions (mentor's absence, legacy persists). However, its role in the transmission decision is atmospheric rather than causal—she doesn't use it to write the correction; the console does the work. The reprise reweights meaning but doesn't constrain the choice. Just misses the ~6.1 threshold for three-gate necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Editing history" is the story's spine: introduced early as Okonkwo's teaching, literalized when the anomaly allows Vera to revise her transmission, and charged at closure when "past and future existed simultaneously" and her messages "edit each other." The concept shapes her tactics (she composes a clarification rather than a retraction) and the final image (history unmade). Removing this exact framing would collapse the thematic and plot logic. The execution is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" is introduced early, labeled twice more, and governs Vera's final stance. It enables her to make the transmission decision ("sure enough to make decisions, humble enough to question") and charges the closing beat ("felt less like a burden and more like wisdom"). However, the trait is more asserted than dramatized—we see her certainty and humility in action, but the phrase itself functions as a thematic label rather than constraining a specific choice with visible cost. Lyric reprise present, causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Unbend" (the anomaly's spacetime fluctuations) is established early, recurs in the middle when the Kepler signal arrives through an unbending event, and returns at closure when Vera initiates the broadcast "as she initiated the broadcast, and... past and future existed simultaneously." The action enables the time-edit that drives the resolution. However, the unbending is a backdrop condition rather than something Vera does—she benefits from it rather than causing it. Essential to the closure effect but not irreplaceable as a verb tied to protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Through contingent relationships" appears late (final third) as a method: "Through contingent relationships—the gravitational anomaly's effect on time, her position at this exact moment, the pen connecting her to Okonkwo's teachings—she could change what she had done." It frames the solution but doesn't shape prior attempts or constrain her tactics. The concept is explained rather than dramatized across beats. Late arrival and summary-only use limit integration. Functional but replaceable with "using the anomaly's properties" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is introduced immediately, provides the story's central constraint (time distortion allows message revision), and shapes the final image (starlight shifts, anomaly hums). It enables Vera's presence, supplies the Kepler signal's early arrival, and makes the climactic transmission possible. The setting is causally indispensable—remove the anomaly and the plot collapses. Specificity (seventeen degrees off the galactic plane, spacetime unbending) and active participation across all three gates earn high integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"After planting the wrong seeds" frames the inciting incident (Vera's original transmission error twenty years prior) and her current penance (eleven years at the anomaly). The timeframe establishes her motive and guilt, and the closure reveals that the "after" can be rewritten. However, the timeframe is backstory context rather than a live countdown—no ticking clock constrains her present decision. The concept is present in setup and closure, but doesn't tighten middle tactics. Two-gate integration with strong thematic reprise, but lacks escalation pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To thresh meaning from experience" is introduced early as Vera's daily work, literalized in her interpretation of the Kepler signal, and charged at closure when she finds "new meanings to thresh from the universe's endless noise." The desire drives her action (she translates the signal, composes the correction) and the stakes (has she interpreted correctly?). The friction between wanting certainty and accepting uncertainty is embodied in "confidently uncertain." Strong causal presence across setup, middle, and ending. Just shy of indispensability because the motive could be reframed as "correct her mistake" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Strange comfort" is introduced mid-story ("the strange comfort of the anomaly"), recurs in the final third ("this strange comfort: the knowledge that history could be edited"), and charges the closing beat ("The anomaly hummed around her, familiar as breath"). The tone coheres—what began as punishment becomes refuge—and modulates from guilt to cautious hope. The tone reweights the dominant stake (penance → possibility). However, the label "strange comfort" is told rather than consistently embodied in sensory texture across beats. Strong thematic reprise, moderate tonal control under pressure.</comment>
