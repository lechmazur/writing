<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's cool-headed fisher trait is established early and shapes her approach to the goddess encounter, though her internal contradiction between ice and cracking provides texture. The backstory of her daughter's drowning is efficiently integrated and drives the present quest with visceral specificity. The final choice—releasing "pure, absolute silence given form"—is earned by her temperament and decades of patience, though the embodiment of this act remains somewhat abstract. Her micro-choices under pressure are coherent, and the ending forecloses her prior grief-path with visible relief and release.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the garden responds to cosmic signals, the rail spike transliterates emotions, and the climax accumulates through layered frequencies rather than a causal chain of decisions. Orientation anchors are clear early (sound wave garden, Maren, rail spike, quest for daughter's echo). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the whisper "Don't blame the water. I was trying to reach a star" reweights Maren's grief with conceptual cost (the not-knowing splinter is removed, but she must accept her daughter's agency). The lens holds through the ending without contradiction, and the timeframe "when patterns break themselves" enables passage without solving the problem for her.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sound wave garden functions as more than backdrop: its hedges of crystallized vibrations, gravel that hums, and the fountain of "visible shape of sound" constrain Maren's approach and charge the closure scene. The rail spike as micro-setting object is handled twice (planting it, watching emotions bloom, retrieving it) and its spiral patterns reappear in the drifting constellations above, binding the ending image. Sensory detail is filtered through Maren's fisher perspective (boots crunching, frequencies bypassing ears to settle in bones). The zigzag path's impossible transformations reflect the garden's response to cosmic pressure, making setting an active participant rather than static decor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Maren seeks her daughter's final words to resolve the "splinter working its way toward her heart." The tightening occurs when Vela demands she voice silence—a paradox that tests Maren's cool temperament and forces her to release unspoken apologies and love. The price is visible: she must open the place where words she never spoke live, and the echo she receives carries both relief and "terrible and beautiful release." Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through the garden's shifting responses and the goddess's emergence, culminating in a charged exchange that reweights her grief with her daughter's agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: stillness as gift, the gap between silence and speech, and the search for what's been lost. The rail spike's transliteration of emotions into visible patterns, the sleepwalking constellations "only searching, as she had searched," and the final line "She would fish for stars" all avoid stating a moral while offering a resonant reconfiguration of Maren's life's work. The daughter's whisper "I was trying to reach a star" reweights the drowning from tragedy to aspiration without sentimentality. Subtext operates in Maren's unspoken love and Vela's "feral lullaby" smile, and the ending invites reflection on grief, blame, and transformation without resolving into tidy binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited through Maren; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct with a measured, patient texture that matches her fisher occupation: "Cool-headed, her mother used to say. Ice where your blood should be." Figurative language is dense but mostly controlled ("feral beauty of a lullaby sung through clenched teeth"), though some phrases edge toward over-writing ("amber grief, crimson determination, the pale blue of hope"). Dialogue from Vela and Maren is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext. Perception remains character-bound (frequencies "bypassing her ears entirely and settled directly into her bones"). Minor register drift in "voicing silence" feels slightly elevated for the moment's urgency, but the overall perceptual signature is coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, though some lines carry ornamental weight without advancing pressure: "tender and dangerous in equal measure" restates what "feral beauty" already conveyed. The phrase "something ancient turn its attention toward her" is abstract where specificity would sharpen the beat. A minor paraphrase loop appears in the rail spike description: "transliterates emotions" is explained twice in close proximity (market woman's line, then "translating her relief, her sorrow" later). The opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively, and the final image "She would fish for stars" recharges prior material. Figurative density in the goddess's appearance ("not quite human, not quite anything") and the fountain's "visible shape of sound" work under the Accumulative lens but cluster heavily in one passage.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound-as-setting, emotional transliteration via rail spike, and sleepwalking constellations as cosmic pressure creates a cohesive, non-obvious frame. The transformation of grief through "voicing silence" avoids stock epiphany language and earns its resonance through Maren's specific occupation and temperament. The premise risks fantasy trope familiarity (goddess who holds echoes, quest for lost words), but the execution through sensory particulars (gravel that hums, frequencies in bones) and the daughter's surprising final words ("trying to reach a star") provide fresh inflection. The final image—fishing for stars—synthesizes her life's work with her daughter's aspiration in a way that feels inevitable in hindsight rather than grafted on.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's cool-headed fisher trait is established in the opening third, pressures her middle choice (finding stillness to voice silence), and charges the ending when she returns to fishing "differently now." Her decades of patience enable the paradoxical act at closure. Two distinct beats: waiting at the fountain, releasing silence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The rail spike appears early (market purchase referenced, then carried), is planted at the garden's center where emotions bloom across its surface, and is retrieved at the end. Its transliteration function enables the climax (patterns "matched the drifting constellations") but the spike itself does not constrain a middle choice—it visualizes rather than alters tactics. Three beats, moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sleepwalking constellations are introduced early, pause during the climax ("turn their attention toward her"), and resume at the end with reweighted meaning ("never been lost at all—only searching"). They frame the theme and provide atmospheric pressure but do not directly narrow Maren's tactical options. The ending reprise shifts their meaning from "Unraveling" to purposeful search, creating lyric resonance without hard causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rail spike's emotion-transliteration trait is signaled early (market woman explains it), demonstrated at the fountain (grief/determination colors bloom), and echoed at closure (patterns match constellations). It enables Vela to "know your truth before you speak it," setting up the paradox of voicing silence. The trait shapes one key beat but does not impose a visible cost or constrain a choice—it reveals rather than limits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The zigzag path is mentioned three times: Maren walks it at the opening, it "straightened, then curved impossibly" at the timeframe trigger, and she walks it back at the end. The path's transformation signals the cosmic shift but does not drive a major turn—the real pressure comes from Vela's demand. Easily swappable with "spiral" or "labyrinth" without altering core beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Voicing silence" is signaled early (Vela's demand), its mechanics matter (Maren must release unspoken words as "pure, absolute silence given form"), and it directly enables the climax: the echo emerges only after this paradoxical act. The method is irreplaceable—no other means would test her cool temperament or unspoken love. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, though the exact mechanics remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is established early (hedges of crystallized vibrations, gravel that hums), shifts in response to cosmic signals (path transforms, garden "shuddered"), and provides the fountain where the climax occurs. It pressures Maren's approach (she must wait for "when patterns break themselves") and supplies the resonance that carries her daughter's whisper. The garden's fade at the end charges the final image. Essential across setup, middle, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "when patterns break themselves" is introduced early as the window for passage, triggers the garden's transformation mid-scene, and tightens the decision (constellations pause, "something ancient" turns its attention). It constrains when Maren can act but does not impose a countdown or live clock that alters her tactics beat-by-beat. Two gates (setup, middle), moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to catch the echo of her daughter's final words is dramatized immediately (backstory of drowning, "not-knowing had become a splinter"), drives her journey to the garden, and fuels her willingness to give "anything." The friction between her need and the cost (voicing unspoken love) creates tension at the climax. The echo's content ("Don't blame the water. I was trying to reach a star") reweights the quest with both relief and sorrow, visible in "knees buckled, but she did not fall." Essential to all three beats and the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "feral lullaby" tone is introduced late (near the end: "feral beauty of a lullaby sung through clenched teeth," "fierce and gentle as a mother wolf singing her cubs to sleep," "feral lullaby humming in her wake"). It charges the final image and coheres with the tender-dangerous duality of Vela, but it does not modulate with pressure across earlier beats—the opening and middle read more as patient/cool than feral. Lyric reprise without middle development; purposeful but not indispensable.</comment>
