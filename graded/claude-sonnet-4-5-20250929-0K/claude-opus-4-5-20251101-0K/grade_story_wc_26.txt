<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is consistently rendered through concrete actions—her thirty-year climb, her cataloging, her choice to place the stone—and her embodied regret avoids therapy-speak. The shadow's transformation is earned by her recognition and offering, though the final choice feels slightly passive (the stone does the work rather than Vera making a harder sacrifice). Internal contradiction is present in her "luminous regret," accepting loss while acting to preserve, but the piece stays just shy of forcing Vera into a genuine trade-off that costs her something irreplaceable on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of noticing, memory, and metamorphosis that tightens through Vera's three-month tracking and culminates in the shadow's transformation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shadow becomes a keeper rather than consumer) with visible cost—the grandmother's stone is given up permanently, and Vera's role shifts from hunter to witness. Orientation anchors (floating library, dusk, Vera's role) arrive early. The comparison-screen beat provides the causal hinge, though the shadow's response to acknowledgment and the stone feels slightly convenient—"I see you" immediately unlocks the metamorphosis without additional struggle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blooming library is vividly particularized (glass petals, floating shelves, hope-lattices like luminous fruit) and the shadow's behavior—curling around lattices, pooling beneath a child's wish—constrains Vera's choice to intervene. The river stone anchors tactile memory (smooth, heavy, worn by water) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The clouds and dusk filtering create consistent atmosphere, though the transformation of the library itself (old books to impossible garden) is told more than shown in the comparison footage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve crystallized hopes from the unbound shadow. Pressure tightens through Vera's three-month tracking and the comparison proof, then the shadow "tasting the edges" of dreams raises urgency. The resolution—placing the stone—feels slightly too neat; the shadow's immediate, benign transformation after acknowledgment undercuts the prior sense of threat. Vera's agency is real but soft: she offers rather than wrestles, and the cost (losing the stone) is visible but doesn't foreclose a painful alternative path for her personally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief witnessed and named can transform into guardianship, preservation requires accepting irretrievable loss. The shadow-as-mourning is earned through specifics (separation from transformation, hunger for dreams, response to the river stone's physical memory). The final image—shadow flowing like a current among lattices—reweights the premise without stating a moral. "Luminous regret" operates throughout as embodied paradox rather than label. The piece resists tidy resolution; the shadow remains, now purposeful, and Vera's work continues with quiet cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Vera; psychic distance is controlled and her perceptual signature (noticing shadows, dusk precision) is consistent. Diction is elevated but character-appropriate for an archivist in a speculative setting. The phrase "softly deliberate" recurs as description rather than enacted trait in every instance, and "luminous regret" appears twice as a set phrase, suggesting slight template reliance. Dialogue is minimal (one line to the shadow) and purposeful. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled; figurative language (petals of walls, book-branches, hope like fruit) is coherent and world-integrated. Two minor artifacts: "softly deliberate" appears three times in identical phrasing across paragraphs, and "luminous regret" is repeated verbatim. The phrase "Each evening since, she had tracked its growth" compresses transit efficiently. Information density is high; no paraphrase loops. Sentence openings vary, and the final image (shadow flowing, Vera noticing the exact moment of dusk's release) carries propulsion and closure charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—shareable dreams crystallized as light-lattices, a library that blooms above clouds, a shadow born from transformation—synthesizes speculative elements into a cohesive world. The river stone as anchor for physical memory and the shadow-as-grief transformation feel earned rather than convenient. The "dusk noticer" profession and the Ascension backstory are specific enough to avoid placeholder settings. Risk is present in the lyric pacing and the choice to make the shadow non-malevolent. The emotional calculus (witnessing grief rather than destroying it) offers a non-obvious angle on preservation narratives, though the central hope-preservation plot is familiar in structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera is present throughout and her noticing drives the comparison and recognition beats. Her sharp-eyed tracking across three months is established, and her final choice to place the stone alters the shadow's nature. However, "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" functions more as a professional frame than a trait that constrains her peak choice—any empathetic archivist could make the same move. The noticing matters most in the setup and comparison, less in the decisive moment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The river stone appears in four beats: Vera clutching it while hunting, pressing it as talisman during approach, offering it to the shadow, and its transformation into the shadow's new anchor. It is both handled and conceptually reweighted—from personal memory to shared memorial. Removing it would break the shadow's metamorphosis and the closure's emotional hinge. Cost is visible: Vera loses her grandmother's last tangible gift.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The unbound shadow is introduced early, drives Vera's investigation and comparison, and its metamorphosis is the story's climactic turn. It shapes every major beat: Vera's tracking, the comparison proof, the final offering, and the transformed ending state. The concept is irreplaceable; without the shadow separating from its source, the conflict and closure collapse. Visible cost: the library's mourning must be acknowledged and redirected.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" is labeled three times ("her motivation burned quietly…softly deliberate," "her steps softly deliberate," "her work continued, softly deliberate") but never constrains a choice with visible friction. It describes Vera's tempo but doesn't create on-page trade-offs—she is never forced to choose between speed and care, or between deliberation and urgency. Present across beats but ornamental; swappable with "careful" or "steady."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" is the story's structural spine: the library's transformation births the shadow, the shadow begins to metamorphose hope-lattices by tasting them, and the climax is the shadow's own metamorphosis into a keeper. The action is irreplaceable and drives all major turns. Removing it collapses both the problem and resolution. Cost is tied to each metamorphosis: the library left something behind, the shadow threatened dreams, Vera's offering redirects grief into guardianship.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The comparison footage appears in one extended beat, provides the proof Vera needs, and directly precipitates her approach to the shadow. The method is specific (silent video, forty years apart, showing shadow behavior) and shapes Vera's understanding. However, it arrives late (past midpoint) and is not revisited; the mechanics matter in the moment but don't constrain her final choice—she could have reached the same realization through direct observation. Functional but replaceable with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The blooming library is established in the opening line, anchors every scene, and its transformation from earthbound to cloud-dwelling directly births the shadow (the story's central problem). The hope-lattices provide the stakes (what Vera protects), and the floating shelves and glass petals create spatial coherence. The setting's metamorphosis is the shadow's origin, and the final image of shadow flowing among lattices charges the closure. Removing the specific setting collapses the logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After dreams become shareable" frames the world's rules and enables the hope-lattices, but the timeframe itself doesn't tighten decisions. Vera's three-month tracking and "tonight" create mild urgency, yet no clock pressures her moves—she could act tomorrow with the same options. The shareable-dreams premise is functional backdrop but swappable (e.g., "after emotions became visible") without altering her tactics. Present in setup, absent from escalation and closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Preserving hope's shape is Vera's stated and enacted goal: her thirty-year role, her tracking of the shadow's threat to lattices, and her final choice to redirect the shadow into guardianship all dramatize this motivation. Internal friction is present—she must surrender her grandmother's memory to preserve others' hopes—and the cost is visible. The motivation drives at least three beats and shapes the closure. Minor deduction: the motivation is told more than tested by competing desires on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" is named twice and enacted throughout: Vera's acceptance of irretrievable loss, her understanding that preservation requires acknowledging what cannot return, and the bittersweet final image of the shadow as keeper. Tone modulates appropriately—quiet determination during tracking, intensified sorrow during the comparison, gentle resolution at closure. The adjective "luminous" elevates regret into something purposeful rather than despairing, and this paradox charges the ending without flattening into single-note melancholy.</comment>
