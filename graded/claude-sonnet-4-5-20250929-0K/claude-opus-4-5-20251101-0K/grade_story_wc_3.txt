<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is concrete and filtered through her scholarly lens ("catalogued it like she catalogued Sumerian verb forms"). The final choice to stay is earned through on-page progression from grief-processing to understanding-absorption, with visible cost in leaving the world below. Minor slip: the "kindly methodical" grief feels slightly performed rather than contradictory under peak pressure. Embodiment is strong ("fingers still stained with clay dust"), and the tree-planting micro-choice credibly shifts her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elena commits to staying with visible cost ("the world continued its turning" below while she remains above). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through layered images (clay/seed/soil/fruit) and the cadence shifts at "She would stay" crystallize her renunciation of earthly academic life. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly by the platform arrival. One meaningful deepening (seed → fruit → absorption) reconfigures the opening grief into purpose with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor constrains Elena's final choice: she plants the seed in "magnetic soil," and the environment's properties (sideways trees, lodestones, fruit that "glowed faintly blue") charge the closure image when she tastes the knowledge fruit. Micro-setting detail (clay tablets, soil that "sparkled with magnetic dust") is filtered through her scholarly attention. Spatial choreography remains clear across the platform, tree, and soil. The arbor functions as both setting and conceptual constraint, making it indispensable to the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding transition's physics) is signaled early and tightens when Elena receives Vasil's tablet describing "spirit as charge, the body as vessel." The seed-planting decision narrows her options with visible cost: she forgoes return to the university for arbor work. One meaningful deepening occurs when she tastes the fruit and experiences Vasil's voice as "current through copper," reweighting her opening grief into practiced methodology. Agency is decision with renunciation; no explicit antagonist needed under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (transition as translation, not ending) emerges through concrete particulars: seed/cuneiform sign analogy, spirit leaving as "word leaving the mouth," the fruit containing compressed knowing. The final image—Elena beginning "new translation work, reading the grammar of passage"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. "The meaning remained, waiting in clay and seed and magnetic soil" reweights the opening grief into purposeful witness. No thematic echo; the analogical thinking stays embodied in her scholarly lens throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elena filters everything through translation metaphor ("A seed was like a cuneiform sign"). POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction stays consistent ("kindly methodical," "process later") and modulates under pressure without register drift. The caretaker's brief dialogue feels functional and distinct. Minor slip: "the spirit had left" in the opening feels slightly detached from Elena's immediate grief, but recovers quickly. Purposeful compression in the fruit-tasting beat ("every transition she had ever witnessed flowing through her") fits the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong figurative density ("magnetic arbor floated above the clouds like a promise that had forgotten how to break") charges the opening but risks overwriting in a few beats. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. No loops or template cadence. Minor deduction: "kindly methodical" appears three times without functional variation, edging toward ornamental repetition. The final paragraph's syntax ("ancient as breath and new as her next heartbeat") tilts toward elevated diction but remains voice-motivated. Propulsion is steady; no scaffolding or paraphrase loops detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of cuneiform translation, magnetic arbor physics, and knowledge-fruit consumption feels specific and non-obvious. Transformation test: the plot would collapse without Elena's scholarly lens shaping her analogical approach to transition. The tablet describing "spirit as charge, the body as vessel" avoids metaphysics-as-metaphor and treats it as mechanism, a fresh angle. Risk-taking in the arbor's sideways trees and lodestone roots heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor template echo in "the spirit had left, yes. But the meaning remained" feels mildly generic, but prior particulars redeem it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's choices—planting the seed, tasting the fruit, deciding to stay—create all major turns. Present early, shapes middle action, and drives the closure decision with visible cost (leaving her university life). Swappability is low: her translator identity inflects every beat through analogical thinking.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The seed is handled in three beats: received, planted, and grown into fruit she tastes. Its properties (warmth, growth speed, compressed knowing) matter causally. Removing it breaks the closure mechanism. Reweighted at the end when the fruit delivers Vasil's voice and transitions, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Haunted ambitions" is signaled early ("the question that had haunted her ambitions") and shapes her motive to climb. The concept reappears at the seed-planting ("She thought of her own hands, steady and patient, kindly in their methodical attention") but doesn't constrain a middle choice. It modulates at closure ("not haunted now but honored"), reweighting the opening stake. Present in closure but not essential to mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" appears three times: in grief-processing, seed-planting reflection, and final weeping. It colors her approach but doesn't constrain or enable a distinct on-page action with cost. The trait reads more as descriptive texture than causal lever. Lyric reprise (early → final paragraph) reweights her grief into practiced patience, reaching mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Reestablish" appears in the caretaker's explanation and Elena's understanding: "The old translators didn't just read the tablets. They grew their understanding." Her decision to stay and begin "new translation work" fulfills it. The action redefines her options and drives closure. Swapping it would require restructuring the arbor's purpose and Elena's final choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Analogical thinking is signaled early ("thinking through analogy as she always did") and demonstrated in two beats: seed/cuneiform comparison and spirit/word leaving. It shapes her interpretation of the tablet and her willingness to plant the seed. Mechanics matter: her scholarly habit enables the leap to understanding transition. Present in closure reflection ("reading the grammar of passage").</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor's properties—lodestones threading roots, sideways growth, magnetic soil—enable the seed's impossible growth speed and the fruit's knowledge-compression. Setting constrains her choice (she must stay above the clouds to continue the work) and charges the closure image. Removing the arbor's specifics breaks the story's physics and Elena's final commitment.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"After the spirit leaves" frames the entire piece: Vasil's death three days prior initiates Elena's climb. The timeframe tightens her grief-processing and drives the urgency to understand transition. It appears in the closure reflection ("The spirit had left, yes. But the meaning remained"). The temporal anchor shapes her motive and the arbor's function as witness-laboratory.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The desire to understand transition's physics is dramatized early ("what happens in the moment of transition?") and tested when she reads Vasil's tablet describing "polarity reverses." Her decision to plant the seed and taste the fruit enacts the motive with cost (leaving her university position). The final image—beginning translation work on "the grammar of passage"—fulfills and reweights the opening question.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Touching distance" modulates coherently: Elena stands "at touching distance from the threshold" in her witness role, and the tone shifts from detached grief-cataloging to embodied absorption when she tastes the fruit. The phrase appears explicitly in the climax reflection, charging the final image. Tone is consistent through turns, balancing scholarly restraint with emotional weight without flatlining.</comment>
