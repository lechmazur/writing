<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior contradiction—scientist seeking "practical" closure while finding emotional resonance—operates convincingly throughout. The embodied grief ("weight of something far more immediate pressing against her chest") and micro-choices (pocketing the slide, walking away) earn the final stance. Minor slip: the therapist's directive "strip needless drama from grief" reads slightly therapeutic-label-speak, though it's framed as reported speech and the story contradicts it through dramatized discovery. Character-particular perception (dust motes watched "with the same attention she usually reserved for spectral analyses") consistently filters the setting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira's acceptance that "understanding came not in revelations but in the gradual settling of sediment" forecloses the search for tidy answers with visible cost—she demolishes the greenhouse, disperses the collection, keeps only fragments. The accumulative lens holds: repeated dust/decay imagery deepens until the final orchid reweights survival versus entropy. Causality is clean; the orientation anchor (greenhouse, post-flood, sorting task) arrives immediately. One meaningful deepening (from logistics to humility) suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse constrains on-page choices: shattered door, collapsed shelving, and broken roof panels guide Mira's movements and discoveries. The surviving orchid in the final beat charges the closure image with defiant persistence. Sensory detail (sediment crunch, "smell of drowned things," iridescent wing scales in broken light) is vivid, selective, and filtered through Mira's scientific attention. Spatial choreography remains clear across kneeling, lifting slides, standing. The micro-setting (glass slides as portable archive) functions as purposeful constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—processing grief and deciding what to keep—is signaled early and tightens through the discovery sequence. The escalation reads as accumulative deepening: physical sorting → butterfly scales → memory of mother's phrase → neutron star parallel → final decision to keep one slide and let the rest go. Agency operates through attention and renunciation with on-page cost (demolition, dispersal). The orchid's survival provides a micro-turn that reweights persistence without resolving the loss. No antagonist required; pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (gradual transformation across scales, from stellar to cellular to emotional) emerges from concrete particulars: neutron star compression, butterfly wing decay, dementia's "quieter flood," sediment settling. The final image—walking "into a world still drying, still recovering, still patiently teaching her humility"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. The mother's phrase "preprocesses reality" seeds early and returns reweighted at closure. No thematic echo in the ending; the orchid provides embodied persistence rather than thesis. Subtext operates in silences (the decision to pocket one slide) and shifting dust patterns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature (scientific analogies, attention to micro-structures). Diction remains stable in Mira's professional lexicon ("spectral analyses," "chitin," "stellar cores") without unmotivated register shifts. The mother's voice in quoted memory carries distinct idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during physical discoveries, wider for cosmic parallels). Minor friction: "To strip needless drama from grief, her therapist had said" reads slightly expository, though it sets up the story's thematic contradiction. No head-hopping; focalization stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (most lines do double work linking setting, memory, and theme). Figurative language (dust as time's archive, neutron stars as grief analogue) remains coherent and voice-motivated. Minor loop: "Dust accumulated everywhere—in greenhouse corners, in the spaces between galaxies, in the crevices of human hearts where grief settled and slowly transformed" borders on thematic restatement after prior dust motifs, though the tricolon structure charges the closure approach. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Syntax varies; sentence openings shift across paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of astrophysics grief narrative through lepidopterist mother and post-flood greenhouse feels specific and earned, avoiding template bereavement arcs. The neutron star / butterfly scale parallel (both archives of transformation) is non-obvious and structurally motivated. Risk: sustained scientific register in an emotional scene could alienate, but here it defines Mira's coping mechanism. The "preprocesses reality" phrase transforms from unscientific dismissal to operational insight. Transformation test passes: swapping neutron stars for another profession would require full reimagining of the perceptual filter and thematic architecture.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's profession (neutron star researcher) shapes her perceptual signature throughout: watching dust motes "with the same attention she usually reserved for spectral analyses," understanding her mother's phrase through radiation's "thousand transformations," recognizing gradual stellar collapse in human grief. The decision to place slides near her neutron star monitors at closure links professional and personal archives. Present in setup (paragraph two), middle reflection (interpreting mother's phrase), and closure (workstation placement). Causal pressure: her scientific lens enables the acceptance that structures the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Butterfly wing scales appear in three functionally distinct beats: discovery in the specimen drawer, lifted to broken light for iridescent examination, and the decision to pocket "one glass slide" and place it near her workstation. The scales' meaning reweights from archive of flight to embodied lesson in entropy and preservation. Specificity: "scales—dust from butterfly wings, preserved for decades" and "tiny architecture of chitin" make the object irreplaceable. The final reprise charges closure by linking maternal legacy to ongoing work. Cost: choosing fragments over wholeness.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gradual change operates as the story's structural and thematic engine. Setup: flood aftermath and dementia's progression ("swept away...piece by piece over five years"). Middle: stellar transformation sequence ("Nothing collapsed all at once...billions of years of slow transformation"). Closure: "understanding came not in revelations but in the gradual settling of sediment." The concept constrains Mira's choices—she cannot rush grief, only allow accumulation—and shapes the final image of a "world still drying, still recovering." Escalation reads as deepening recognition across scales (stellar, insect, human). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Preprocesses reality" appears twice with reweighted meaning. Setup: mother's phrase dismissed as "unscientific." Development: Mira reinterprets it through neutron star radiation ("Nothing arrived unprocessed. Everything was translated through accumulated dust patterns"). Closure: "the universe...had already preprocessed this moment for her through accumulated dust patterns of experience and loss." The attribute enables her acceptance—grief arrives filtered, not raw—and constrains her earlier resistance. Visible tradeoff: scientific skepticism yields to maternal wisdom. Could score higher with more middle-beat tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Decay drives every major beat: flood destruction of specimens, dementia's erosion, butterfly scale preservation against entropy, neutron star core densification, "questions dissolving into smaller questions," and "slow decay of resistance." Setup and middle beats are saturated with decay imagery. Closure: Mira's acceptance is framed as "the gradual settling of sediment, the slow decay of resistance." The action redefines her options—she stops seeking intact answers and accepts fragments. Removing decay would collapse the thematic architecture and leave only inventory logistics. Near-indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through accumulated dust patterns" is seeded early (dust motes in light columns, mother's phrase about transformation), developed in middle reflection (radiation painting pictures "through accumulated dust patterns"), and returns at closure ("preprocessed this moment...through accumulated dust patterns of experience and loss"). The method shapes Mira's interpretive strategy—she learns to read layers rather than demand clarity—and charges the final image. Present across all three gates with causal work. Minor friction: the phrase itself risks abstraction, though grounded through repeated concrete dust observations (sediment, wing scales, motes).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse pressures every choice: shattered door forces entry method, broken glass underfoot creates embodied difficulty, collapsed shelving limits access, damaged roof panels create the light shafts that illuminate scales and the surviving orchid. Setup immediate, middle discoveries depend on spatial layout (overturned case, surviving drawer), closure hinges on the orchid's defiant bloom in "its shattered pot" and the decision to demolish. The setting supplies resources (slides) and constraints (destruction) that alter Mira's tactics from preservation to selection. Removing this exact setting would break the flood/dementia parallel and the fragility/persistence tension. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the flood" anchors setup ("Three weeks since the waters receded") and frames the task (sorting what survived). The timeframe enables the decay imagery (smell, sediment, dried specimens) and the mother's absence (dementia preceded flood). Development: implicit urgency in "came to sort through what remained" though no ticking clock tightens decisions. Closure: "a world still drying, still recovering" extends the temporal frame into ongoing process. Present in two gates (setup, closure); middle development is atmospheric rather than tactical. Functional but not indispensable—story could occur at other post-loss intervals with minor adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To strip needless drama from grief" is stated early as therapist's directive, then contradicted through dramatized discovery: Mira arrives seeking "practical...logistics" but finds "peace...the quiet accumulation of meaning from meaninglessness." Setup and closure clearly frame the motivation's transformation. Middle friction: the desire operates more as framing irony than active pressure—Mira doesn't struggle against emotional pulls, she simply discovers them. The cost (demolition, dispersal) isn't shown as renouncing drama but as accepting complexity. Desire is dramatized in conflict with outcome; could score higher if middle beats showed her resisting emotional responses before yielding.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tone moves from clinical survey ("shattered door frame," "sediment") through gradual softening (mother's teaching, butterfly wonder) to final humility ("ready now to let the drama go...quiet accumulation of meaning"). Modulation is coherent and pressure-responsive: initial distance protects against grief, deepening engagement mirrors acceptance. The orchid "purple and defiant" provides a tonal shift—wonder breaking through—that charges the final image of "patient, unhurried change." No static mood; the kindled humility emerges through accumulation rather than declaration. Tone constrains diction (scientific analogies soften without dissolving) and charges closure by making acceptance feel earned rather than resigned.</comment>
