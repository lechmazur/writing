<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mora's return after seventeen years carries genuine interior weight, with the "tremor of certainty" embodied through physical contact with the quartz. However, her transformation from doubt to certainty happens via atmospheric accumulation rather than on-page friction between contradictory impulses. The final choice to read aloud is framed as validation rather than a difficult renunciation or trade-off that forecloses another path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens cleanly: quartz contact → tremor of certainty → reading verses → lake cracking → moths arriving builds density and charges the final image. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mora crystallizes her stance against the Council's boundaries, and the environmental response (moths, glowing quartz, cracking ice) makes the conceptual cost—she has irrevocably crossed back—felt on the page. One meaningful deepening (from touching to speaking aloud) suffices at this length, and the escalation is clear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium and frozen lake anchor who/where/when by the second paragraph; the quartz colonnade constrains Mora's action (she must touch it, let its hum shape her syntax) and charges the closure when it glows and draws moths. Sensory detail—twilight-blue walls, humming crystals, lantern-moth hush—is filtered through Mora's aesthetic priorities and tied to her choices. Spatial choreography (atrium interior, windows, lake beyond) remains stable and vivid.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving her words held power and boundaries can be crossed—is signaled early and tightened when Mora moves from doubt to speaking aloud, triggering environmental response (quartz glow, ice crack, moths). The escalation is driven by her agency (touching, paraphrasing, reading) under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: by reading she awakens the atrium and reopens boundaries the Council sealed, a stance that "the boundary keepers felt their certainties tremble" confirms as irrevocable even if consequence isn't fully paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—boundaries exist to be crossed carefully, sacred means worthy of approach—emerges through concrete particulars: paraphrasing not copying, quartz absorbing her voice, the ice opening rather than breaking. The final image (moths circling, lake remembering, boundary keepers trembling) offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. "Through dissolving boundaries, she rewrote sorrow as understanding" edges toward thematic echo but is immediately anchored in the contrast between old/new verses and remains tied to scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Mora notices quartz frequencies, reads ice as text, frames beauty as compass. Diction—"cloud-shadow poet," "lantern-moth hush," "crystalline air"—is lyric and voice-consistent. One slip: "The Council had feared what her words dissolved" tells the antagonist's interiority with unwarranted certainty rather than staying in Mora's inference. Otherwise, psychic distance is controlled and the prose texture reflects her aesthetic drive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and sentences carry high information density. However, decorative figurative density in non-peak beats slightly drags momentum: "cobalt geometry into a perfect mirror world," "lantern-moth hush settled around her, that particular silence that seems to breathe and flutter" are vivid but border on overwriting when combined with similar constructions in adjacent paragraphs. No loops or scaffold; clarity remains high. The final image ("cloud-shadow poet casting verses into crystalline air") maintains propulsion without muddling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of poet-as-boundary-crosser, resonant quartz, and frozen-lake memory is specific and coherent, avoiding template premises. Emotional particulars (seventeen-year wait, paraphrasing not copying) ground the arc. Yet the core conflict—artist returns after ban lifts, proves her art's power through environmental response—follows a familiar "vindicated creator" template without a non-obvious moral calculus or trade-off that would deepen risk. The ending fulfills expectation rather than reweighting it in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mora (cloud-shadow poet) makes the key decision to read aloud, triggering the environmental response and closure. She appears early, her choices (touching quartz, paraphrasing, reading) drive all major beats, and her stance crystallizes at the end. The title "cloud-shadow poet" is more label than trait that constrains tactics; her actual agency—choosing to speak—shapes the arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The humming quartz colonnade is handled in at least three beats: Mora presses her palm (vibration travels through her body), it hums while she reads (absorbing, glowing cobalt), and it draws moths at closure. Its resonance shapes her syntax and charges the final image. Setup, middle development, and closure participation all present; causal pressure is strong. Swappability is low—another object could not replicate the specific hum-as-thought effect.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"A tremor of certainty" is introduced when Mora touches the quartz, grows into "a steady pulse" synchronizing with her heartbeat, and underwrites her final stance. It shapes her internal arc from doubt to conviction and enables the choice to read aloud. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development is lighter (the tremor is felt but does not constrain a discrete mid-story choice). Causal role in the ending is solid.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Aesthetically driven" is declared ("Beauty remained her compass, her method, her justification") and filters her perception (she notices frost-as-scripture, moth-wing color), but it does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost on the page. It functions as characterization texture rather than a tactical lever. No setup in the first third; introduced mid-story as exposition.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Paraphrasing (not copying) the old verses is the pivotal action that differentiates Mora's method from the Council's rigidity and triggers the quartz/ice/moth response. Introduced early in concept, executed on the page in the middle third, and its outcome (awakening, opening) defines the closure. Swapping it for "recite" or "translate" would diminish the thematic contrast between rigid copying and fluid transformation. Strong causal role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through dissolving boundaries" is the method signaled in the opening (Council sealed, poetry violated boundaries) and dramatized when Mora reads and the ice opens, quartz glows, boundaries between solid/liquid and living/dead blur. Setup, middle (she begins dissolving via paraphrase), and payoff (environmental dissolution) are all present. Mechanics are more atmospheric than tactical—boundaries dissolve around her rather than through a legible procedure she enacts—but causal linkage to closure is clear.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium anchors all action, supplies the quartz colonnade (a resource Mora uses to shape syntax and trigger response), and its windows frame the frozen lake's transformation. Setup is immediate, middle beats occur within it, and the closure (atrium glows, sings, draws moths) depends on the location. The frozen lake adds pressure by holding memory and cracking in response. Micro-setting (quartz pillars, windows) alters Mora's tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the ban lifts" frames the return as newly possible but does not tighten on-page decisions. Seventeen years of waiting is backstory that motivates arrival but does not create a live clock. Time within the scene (afternoon → night) tracks loosely and does not pressure Mora's choices—she could read sooner or later without altering outcome. The timeframe is present and logically consistent but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To stride through boundaries once thought sacred" is Mora's stated motivation, dramatized when she crosses the threshold, touches the quartz, and reads aloud despite prior exile. Setup is early (she returns to prove boundaries were never solid), development occurs when doubt gives way to certainty, and payoff lands when she speaks and boundaries dissolve. Friction between wanting validation and fearing she was wrong is felt but resolved quickly via the tremor rather than through a sustained on-page choice with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Lantern-moth hush" is established as a coherent tone (quiet, fluttering, breathing silence) that modulates from the opening stillness through quartz-hum escalation to the arrival of actual moths at closure. The tone charges the final image when moths circle Mora and the piece ends on soft laughter and kept reading. Tone is consistent through turns, atmospheric pressure builds, and the ending reconfigures the hush into embodied life without breaking the register.</comment>
