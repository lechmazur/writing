<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and voice-specific throughout, with embodied grief ("her heart," the piano as refuge). Her strategic creativity drives the decoding sequence and beacon-playing with clear on-page micro-choices. The husband remains sketch-level, present only through film and final approach, but Elara's earned endurance and active problem-solving carry the weight. The final reunion choice feels motivated by prior causality with visible cost (seventeen years of waiting, the broken clock's purpose fulfilled).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal backbone. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The story accumulates pressure through film discovery → coordinate decoding → piano-as-beacon → craft arrival, tightening once meaningfully when Elara realizes the compasses need her signal. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis converted to reunion) with visible cost: the clock stops permanently, its receiver's purpose complete, and seventeen years of solitary waiting reweighted by "we surprised it together." Cost is legible in the clock's final stillness and the "steely longing finally permitted to soften."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tidal arbor is vivid and purposeful: latticed walkways rising/falling with currents, cloud-break alignment at dusk creating the beacon window. Micro-setting (piano keys, mist, cloud curtain) charges multiple beats. The dusk alignment directly constrains the climactic choice—Elara must play before the window closes—and the arbor's sway modulates atmosphere without becoming postcard. The white curtain of cloud serves as projection surface, integrating setting into plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: find/reunite with lost husband. Pressure tightens when Elara decodes coordinates and realizes she must produce specific frequencies before the dusk window closes. Agency is clear: she weaves tonal patterns into the song, transforming nostalgia into navigation. The clock's hands moving outward and revealing the receiver is a meaningful reversal that narrows options (one chance, minutes remaining). Cost is visible: seventeen years of grief, the clock's purpose consumed, and the final gamble that he will arrive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: patience vs. active creation, music as beacon, refusing funeral hymns. The "surprise fate" line in the final exchange risks thematic echo but is brief and embedded in character voice rather than authorial summary. The broken clock → revelation → final stillness progression reweights waiting as preparation rather than passivity. The ending avoids moralizing; the piano's silence and her head on his shoulder offer a resonant image that doesn't state its thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; perceptual signature is consistent (musician's ear, strategic creativity, mechanical detail). Diction stays character-apt: "strategically creative," "frequencies that could serve as lighthouse and compass rose alike." The husband's single whispered line and her reply carry subtext without over-explanation. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The prose modulates from contemplative (opening) to urgent (climax) to quiet (close) without register breaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high: "The broken anniversary clock beside her bench had stopped at 4:47, the exact moment her husband's airship had vanished into a storm three years ago" packs backstory, object, and motive into one economical line. Figurative language is purposeful ("dissolving into the mist," "horizon invited night") without overwriting. Propulsion is strong; every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Zero scaffolding or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes steampunk aesthetics with a beacon-navigation love story through specific details (compass needles, frequency-coded piano music, tidal arbor mechanics). The "flickering compasses" and receiver-in-clock conceit is fresh and earns its resolution through Elara's musician skillset. Risk-taking is moderate: the atmospheric setting and quiet-to-urgent arc avoid template beats, though the reunion payoff is emotionally conventional. The piece commits fully to its lyrical voice and fantastical logic without hedging.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout and her choices (threading film, decoding coordinates, playing beacon frequencies) drive all key turns. Her decision to weave tonal patterns into the song at the climax directly enables the reunion. Setup present (paragraph one), multiple beats, closure participation clear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clock introduced early (paragraph two), handled in at least three beats: initial description, shuddering/hands moving outward when music starts, revealing the receiver, then final stillness after reunion. Its dual function (grief marker and hidden receiver) charges the ending and its stopping permanently signifies visible cost. Removal would collapse the beacon mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Flickering compasses appear in hidden film footage and are mounted on the arriving craft's hull, shaping Elara's understanding that a beacon is needed. They frame the navigation problem but are not handled by Elara or used to constrain a middle choice directly. Present in setup and payoff; middle development is summary/observation rather than active use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Strategically creative" is named (paragraph four) and demonstrated: Elara finds melodies in mechanical noise, decodes coordinates from footage, weaves tonal patterns into music. The trait enables the beacon solution with clear on-page action. Cost is implicit (years of solitary creative endurance). Early signal, multiple beats, closure linkage solid.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Refuge" anchors the climax: "Elara's music became refuge for a man who had wandered three years through unmapped skies." The action redefines the reunion—she provides sanctuary through sound, not passive waiting. The concept threads through earlier beats (station as home of sound, refusing funeral hymns) and the piano's final silence. Removal would hollow the thematic and mechanical core.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method (hidden sections in film) is introduced early (paragraph three), drives the decoding sequence in paragraphs four–six, and provides the coordinate/frequency data Elara needs. The spliced footage mechanics matter: she threads the projector, watches repeatedly, extracts patterns. Shapes multiple attempts and directly enables the beacon solution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tidal arbor is present throughout, its position shifts with the day, and the dusk cloud-break alignment creates the time-pressure constraint at the climax. The arbor's sway and open arches allow sound to carry and provide the landing deck. Micro-setting (piano, mist, cloud curtain) alters tactics. Early anchor, middle development (afternoon currents), closure participation (craft lands on deck).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Until the horizon invites night" is signaled in paragraph seven and repeated at closure. The dusk window tightens Elara's decision: she has "mere minutes" when the cloud layer aligns. The timeframe is tracked (afternoon currents strengthen, horizon blushed with darkness) and the deadline directly pressures the climactic piano-playing. Felt cost: one chance only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Surprise fate with an unplanned encore" is dramatized in Elara's refusal to play funeral hymns, her active decoding, and the climactic beacon gamble. The desire is conflicted (grief vs. stubborn hope) and tested by the dusk deadline. Final dialogue ("We surprised it together, with an unplanned encore") names the motive but only after it has been enacted. Setup implicit, middle choices clear, closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Steely longing" is embodied throughout: Elara's seventeen-year vigil, the phrase "steely longing finally permitted to soften" at closure, and the contrast between her disciplined endurance and the emotional release when he arrives. Tone modulates from contemplative melancholy (opening) to focused urgency (beacon sequence) to quiet resolution (final image) without losing coherence. The final line ("her head against his shoulder, the piano silent at last") charges the tone shift with visible cost.</comment>
