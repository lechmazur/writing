<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's interior life is textured and specific—the mercury metaphor embodied through "memories bleeding out each dawn like water through cupped hands" and the night-by-night reconstruction. Her agency escalates from passive discovery to deliberate action ("traced the stone's symbols onto her reflective skin"), and the final climb embodies contradictory impulses: wholeness and pain together. Minor slip: the shift from pain-avoidance to pain-acceptance feels slightly rushed in the final third, though the line "finally whole enough to hurt" earns the turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure arrives on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Vera climbs toward the peak carrying stone and feather, the act of returning to buried parts now legible as continuous work rather than destination. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—each night's tracing deepens pattern and stakes—with clean escalation through the feather discovery (night 47) and the hundred-night speech. Cost is felt ("finally whole enough to hurt") and the image of upward motion reconfigures the premise. Orientation anchors cleanly within the first 100 words (who, where, when). One minor gap: the bookstore's sentience ("The bookstore noticed") introduces agency late without prior cue, creating a small causal wobble that does not break closure but blurs the middle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore as living archive—"corridors spiraling through granite like the whorls of a shell," shelves with roots, passages that shift—constrains Vera's nightly reconstruction and charges the final climb. The stone and feather function as micro-setting, tactile and recurring, with the feather's "barbs and rachis" enabling the bodily breakthrough. The mountain-as-text realization ("the mountain itself was a book") transforms setting into stakes without ornament. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (dust, iridescence, mercury reflection). The environment pressures every turn and the upward spiral structure mirrors the bookstore's form, elevating closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming buried fluency to speak home into being—signals early and tightens through three escalations: finding the stone (deepest level), the feather pivot (night 47), and speaking aloud (night 100). Each tightening narrows options under the Accumulative lens: understanding dissolves nightly until she seeds knowledge into flesh directly, a visible tactical shift with cost (the patterns "became part of her new reality"). The final climb forecloses stasis with felt price ("whole enough to hurt"). Agency drives all turns. Minor: the bookstore's responsive shifts feel slightly convenient, though they reward rather than resolve Vera's work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—home as fluency, the act of returning to buried self—emerges through stone, feather, and flesh without statement. The image of tracing symbols onto mercury skin literalizes the concept: knowledge as embodied terrain. The realization "speaking to the world meant hearing its grief" earns the buried-gift backstory without moralizing, and the final line ("mercury and memory, finally whole enough to hurt") offers resonant answer to the thematic question with cost. Subtext operates in "substitutes reality nightly" and "the shape of home was not a destination." The tongue/mountain/bookstore convergence charges closure without allegory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with lyric compression that serves voice: "mercury and memory" as perceptual signature, "the outline of something she had forgotten—not a memory, but a shape." Distance modulates purposefully (close during tracing, wider during hundred-night backstory anchor). No head-hopping. Diction stays within Vera's plausible register—archival, embodied, precise. The prose reflects her state: fragmented early ("bleeding out each dawn"), cohering through repetition ("night by night"). Sentence rhythm accelerates in the final third without blur. One minor slip: "hidden thunder" appears only in narration, not enacted through syntax or image in peak beats, leaving the tonal cue slightly ornamental.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Information density is high—most lines do two jobs (e.g., "the bookstore that occupied the entire mountain" anchors setting and scale; "mercury-glass seer" signals transformation and reflection). Rhythm varies with purpose: short declaratives at discovery beats, longer syntactic coils during reflection. Zero paraphrase loops. One cluster of filter verbs in the middle third ("she felt," "she understood") slightly dulls immediacy but does not touch closure. Figurative language (whorls of shell, insects beneath glass, hidden thunder) is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor: "impossible softness" and "colors she had no names for" trend slightly generic in an otherwise specific register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—embodied language learned through texture rather than symbol, bookstore-as-living-archive, nightly reconstruction as survival tactic—feels fresh and specific. The feather pivot (barbs/rachis as terrain) transforms the lost-language trope through bodily epistemology. Mercury-glass body avoids pure metaphor by constraining memory and enabling tracing. Risk: the multi-scale world (plague, mountain, symbols) could sprawl but coheres through Vera's micro-actions. Minor: "forgetting plague" and "lost language stone" echo familiar SFF templates; transformation is strong but not yet indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's choices drive all major turns: trading skin for silver (setup), tracing symbols with the feather (night 47 pivot), seeding knowledge into flesh (tactical shift), speaking aloud (night 100 climax), and climbing toward the peak (closure action). Setup early, development across multiple beats, payoff in final image. Causal pressure is strong and cost is visible throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stone appears at discovery (deepest level), is handled nightly (tracing symbols, attempting to seed knowledge), reappears with the feather (night 47 shift), and is carried in the final climb. It enables the language breakthrough and constrains Vera's nightly attempts. Three gates met; causal pressure high; irreplaceable (the moving symbols are unique). Closure linkage clear but the stone shares final-image weight with the feather, slightly reducing dominance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Buried talent (translator of lost tongues) frames the entire quest and shapes stakes: Vera sealed it away when dangerous, the plague took it, and reclaiming it costs pain. Setup via backstory, development through nightly attempts, payoff when she speaks aloud and climbs. The concept alters options (she cannot simply remember; she must rebuild through embodied method). Cost is felt ("finally whole enough to hurt"). Strong across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Substitutes reality nightly" is setup early and constrains every attempt—understanding dissolves by dawn, forcing the tactical shift to tracing on skin. Development: the nightly cycle limits and enables her method. Payoff: implied in the final climb (she has stabilized enough to act). Two gates clearly met; causal role is strong. Minor: the exact mechanics of substitution remain abstract; we see effects more than visible cost in individual beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Seed" appears as verb and concept throughout: she tries to seed knowledge back into mercury mind (fails), then seeds it into flesh directly (succeeds), enabling the patterns to stay. The action defines the tactical breakthrough at night 47 and drives escalation to night 100. Setup implicit, development central, payoff in closure (the seeded knowledge allows her to speak and climb). Irreplaceable and causally active across beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The feather (night 47 discovery) enables the pivotal breakthrough: "via the texture of the feather—its barbs and rachis, its impossible softness—she felt the stone's language differently." It transforms method from mental to bodily and is used to trace symbols onto skin. Setup, development (the tracing becomes nightly practice), and payoff (carried in final climb alongside stone). The method's mechanics—texture as terrain—are specific and irreplaceable. Strongly integrated across all gates with high causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Labyrinthine bookstore occupying the mountain structures the entire piece: Vera shelved books there, knows every passage, descends to the deepest level (stone discovery), and the corridors shift to reveal new texts as she relearns the language. It supplies the stone, pressures her nightly existence, and the upward spiral to the peak is the closure geography. Setup immediate, development (the bookstore notices and responds), payoff (the climb). The setting is both resource and active participant, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After remembering became painful" frames the premise and explains Vera's transformation. The forgetting plague creates the nightly substitution constraint. Setup is early and clear. Development: implied across the forty-seven and hundred nights (time pressure is durational rather than a ticking clock). Payoff: the ending suggests she has endured long enough to carry pain. Two gates met but the timeframe is more backdrop than live tactical constraint in individual beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"To understand the shape of home" is Vera's explicit motivation, setup when she holds the stone and feels "the shape of home." It drives her nightly attempts, her choice to trace with the feather, and the realization that "home was not a place but a fluency." Payoff: "The shape of home was not a destination. It was the act of returning." The motivation is dramatized through repeated tactile choices and the cost of reclaiming grief. All three gates met with strong causal and thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Hidden thunder" appears explicitly ("words rolled through her like hidden thunder") at night 100 when she speaks aloud, and the tone throughout balances lyric compression with embodied specificity. The atmosphere is quiet yet charged, modulating from fragmented early sections to cohering rhythms at closure. Setup is tonal rather than named; development through accumulating pattern; payoff when the metaphor is enacted. The tone charges the ending but is less causally active than other elements; score reflects strong coherence with moderate irreplaceability.</comment>
