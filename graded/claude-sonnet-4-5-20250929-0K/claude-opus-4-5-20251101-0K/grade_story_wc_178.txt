<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is distinct and her frugality shapes her methodology, but her choices feel predetermined rather than pressured. The "empirically ironic" trait is labeled but never constrains a tactical decision. Internal contradiction is absent—she moves through the night's work without competing impulses or genuine friction between rationalist skepticism and mystical seeking. The final packing of the tile reads as inevitable victory rather than a choice forged under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-building through translation and observation accumulates toward the decoded sequence. Orientation anchors (Mira, Babylon palace, interregnum twilight) arrive cleanly by the opening paragraphs. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): Mira completes her covenant, accepts marginalization, and commits to seventeen years of waiting—a renunciation that forecloses immediate validation with felt cost. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows her options; the sequence simply emerges as predicted, making the escalation more confirmatory than transformative.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The reimagined Babylonian palace with brass telescopes and magic square tiles is vivid and purposeful. The lapis lazuli tile with silver numerals constrains her method and charges the closure when she packs it. Spatial choreography (throne room, clerestory windows, ziggurat stairs) is coherent. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira's professional filter: she notices celestial angles and mathematical objects. The interregnum timeframe adds social texture—empty observatories enable solitary work—but does not materially constrain a choice during the night's observation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (seal a covenant via mathematical communication) is signaled early and remains coherent. However, pressure never genuinely tightens or deepens—Mira expects patterns to hold and they do; no live option is foreclosed. The sequence's emergence is described as invitation rather than test. Cost is legible in the ending (seventeen-year wait, anticipated dismissal) but arrives as acceptance of known terms rather than a hard-won tradeoff forced by the night's events. Under the Accumulative lens, a single decisive intensification or cadence shift that reweights the stake with visible cost is needed; here the mood deepens but the stake does not transform.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (rationalist mysticism, devotion encoded in mathematics) emerges organically from Mira's actions and the polymath's notebooks. The magic square and stellar sequence function as concrete particulars rather than abstract symbols. "Encrypted devotion" and "love letters in cipher" offer fresh inflections without thesis statements. The final image—carrying the tile homeward through silent Babylon—resonates without moralizing. However, the piece resists ambiguity: the communication succeeds cleanly, and Mira's stance never wavers or complicates, limiting the thematic friction available at this length.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt. Diction (ziggurat, clerestory, schematic representations, empirically ironic) is elevated but consistent with Mira's academic voice. Psychic distance narrows smoothly during the observation sequence. However, perceptual signature is thin—Mira's way of noticing feels generic astronomer rather than distinctly hers. Filter verbs ("seemed to glow," "attributed this to") are voice-motivated and acceptable. No dialogue appears; the piece is introspective monologue in narration. Register occasionally drifts into Wikipedia-voice exposition ("a Persian polymath who believed...") that flattens intimacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening and closing paragraphs. However, mid-story paragraphs loop conceptually: "empirically ironic results" is paraphrased across lines without added pressure, and the observation sequence relies on summary ("hour by hour, the pattern emerged") rather than dramatized beats. Minor template cadence appears in the polymath backstory section. Figurative language ("breadcrumbs of truth," "bridge built from numbers") is stock in places. The prose is clean and grammatical but does not propel with urgency; peak beats (the sequence reveal) are told rather than shown in sensory or tactical detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—frugal astronomer, Babylonian magic squares, communication with cosmic intelligence—is specific and non-obvious. The interregnum setting and polymath's unfinished work add texture. However, the emotional arc (skeptic seeking transcendence, patient devotion rewarded) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived friction. The turn (sequence decoded, seventeen-year wait accepted) feels preordained rather than earned through risk or surprise. Mira's frugality and the "empirically ironic" trait remain ornamental rather than pressuring choices. The piece commits fully to its premise but stays safely within its initial frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's frugality is mentioned (secondhand equipment, three-coin case purchase) and frames her methodology, but it does not constrain a key turn or create a tradeoff. She observes and translates without deprivation forcing a tactical choice. Present in setup and ending (packing the tile), shaping method, but not escalating pressure or altering closure options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The magic square tile is introduced early (lapis lazuli, silver numerals, sixteen cells summing to thirty-four), handled during the central observation beat (mapping sequences onto it), and packed at closure with reweighted meaning (carrying the covenant home). It enables her method and charges the final image. The tile's specific properties (magic square mathematics) matter to the communication system. Three beats plus closure participation; causal pressure moderate; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Encrypted devotion" is explicitly named and shapes Mira's motivation ("love letters in cipher; why not prayers?"). It frames the work as rationalist mysticism and recurs in the final paragraph. However, it functions more as thematic label than tactical constraint—it does not narrow her options or create visible cost during the observation. Present in setup and ending; thematic resonance without altering stakes mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Empirically ironic" is labeled in one paragraph ("every time she expected failure, the patterns held...universe delighted in subverting expectations"). It describes her prior three years but does not constrain or enable an on-page action during this night's work. The trait could be removed without altering the sequence of events. Ornamental; no visible tradeoff or tactical use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Uncloak" appears twice: once describing the polymath's claim (magic squares "uncloak messages") and once at the sequence reveal ("the message...uncloaked itself"). The action is integral to the method—translation from stellar coordinates via the magic square—and the decoded sequence is the story's pivot. However, the mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized in tactical detail, and the verb itself is somewhat generic (could swap "reveal" or "decode"). Present in setup and payoff; moderate causal weight; mid-high replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Schematic representations" are introduced in the polymath's notebooks (setup) and used during observation ("through the schematic representations in her notebook, she translated stellar coordinates"). The method matters—without it, the translation fails—but the mechanics remain abstract and summarized. Present in setup and middle beat; enables the work; not charged at closure. Functional but not irreplaceable; the phrase itself is generic technical diction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The reimagined ancient Babylonian palace with ziggurat spires, brass telescopes, magic square tiles, and carved clerestory windows is vivid and specific. The setting enables Mira's work (empty observatories during interregnum) and supplies the tile. The dusky light through clerestory windows affects perception. The final descent down ziggurat stairs charges the ending image. Present in all three gates; causal and atmospheric pressure; high specificity. However, the palace does not constrain a choice—Mira could perform the same work elsewhere with the tile and notebooks.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The interregnum (between regimes, old astronomers fled, new not yet arrived) is signaled early and motivates Mira's solitary access. It adds texture to her marginalization and foreshadows future dismissal ("new astronomers would claim these halls and dismiss her findings"). However, the timeframe does not tighten the night's observation or create urgency—no regime change threatens mid-scene. Present in setup and thematic closure; shapes context but not tactical pressure. Lyric resonance without escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to seal a covenant with the unknown" is stated explicitly and shapes her choices (ignoring fame, seeking transcendence through mathematics). It drives the observation work and is fulfilled at closure (covenant sealed, waiting accepted). However, the desire is never conflicted on the page—no friction between wants and costs during the night's work; she simply proceeds and succeeds. Dramatized in framing and ending; told rather than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" appears three times: opening (telescopes catching "dying amber light"), mid-scene ("dusky harmony of twilight settled"), and closing ("dusky harmony of ancient Babylon"). The tone is consistent—contemplative, patient, wistful—and modulates slightly as twilight fades to midnight and Mira accepts the long wait. It charges the final image but does not shift dramatically under pressure. Coherent; purposeful reprise; moderate resonance without stark transformation.</comment>
