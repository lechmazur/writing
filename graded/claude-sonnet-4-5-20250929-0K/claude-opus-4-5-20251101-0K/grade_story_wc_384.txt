<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Veren's internal life is richly embodied through decades of guilt "calcified around his heart" and the micro-choice to prick his thumb, mingling blood with ink. The motivation to complete Aldric's signature is well-earned through forty years of study and friendship, though the final act of forgiveness ("allowed himself, finally, to forgive the unfinished") edges toward summary rather than a dramatized shift under immediate pressure. Interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout, and the embodied emotion (the key warming, then crumbling) grounds the arc in physical sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens: Veren's decision to forge the treaty is motivated by decades of guilt, the rose thorn and blood anchor the act in ritual specificity, and the key's crumbling signals an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—he completes what could not be finished, foreclosing his path of guilt with visible cost). Orientation is clear early (marble sanctuary, aurora, calligraphy forger at work), and the single-scene structure tightens toward the signature's completion. The cost is legible: the key dissolves, his silence ends, and he accepts the "beautiful crime that honor demanded," though the final walk toward peace lacks a sharper image of what he has truly forfeited beyond internal release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary, aurora, and stalactites are vividly rendered and serve atmospheric purpose, but they do not constrain Veren's choice in a material way—he could complete the forgery in any setting. The heritage rose thorn and the key function more as symbolic anchors than as environmental pressures. Sensory detail is selective and mood-appropriate ("pearl twilight," "faint scent of heritage roses"), and the spatial anchors remain stable throughout, meeting baseline needs without elevating to the threshold where setting itself alters tactics or charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Veren will commit "calibrated treason" to correct history's record—is signaled early and tightens as he prepares ink, blood, and thorn, then completes the signature. The act is driven by protagonist agency, and the key's dissolution marks a visible cost (the relic is destroyed, the secret act is irreversible). However, the escalation is more a steady accumulation than a reversal that narrows options; Veren never seriously hesitates or encounters an obstacle that tests his resolve, so the pressure remains coherent but does not sharpen into a trade-off that risks his safety or legacy on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of unfinished legacy, forgiveness, and the ethics of "completing" rather than deceiving. The final image—Veren walking away as stalactites drip into forever—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether history can be corrected by belated intention. The piece resists easy morals and invites reflection on authenticity versus completion. Minor deduction for the phrase "to forgive the unfinished," which edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image do all the work, and for "the beautiful crime that honor demanded," which comes close to stating the theme outright.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice carries a distinct, elevated register ("pale luminescence," "calibrated treason," "calcified around his heart") that fits the contemplative, historical tone. However, the diction occasionally drifts into generic lyricism ("the faint scent of heritage roses that no one would ever explain") and the final paragraph's summary mode ("allowed himself, finally, to forgive") softens the immediacy. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply. Perceptual signature is consistent—Veren notices script, ink, and ritual—but the voice does not modulate under peak pressure; it maintains the same measured cadence throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is largely clear and purposeful, with strong concrete nouns ("stalactites," "heritage rose thorn," "wax") and vivid images. However, several lines loop or restate without adding pressure: "The signature emerged perfect, indistinguishable from genuine, because in every way that mattered, it was genuine" is close to a paraphrase of the prior paragraph's claim that the act is "completion" not "deception." Template cadence appears in the final third: "The aurora dimmed... Veren extinguished... walked toward... leaving behind..." reads as a list rather than propulsion. Minor figurative density ("pearl twilight," "calcified," "chains of another kind") is consistent but borders on ornamental in non-peak beats. Apply −0.6 for the loop and template run, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise—forging a dead prince's signature to complete an unfulfilled peace treaty—offers a fresh angle on guilt, historical revision, and the ethics of intention versus act. The key with no lock and the heritage rose thorn are memorable specifics. However, the core emotional arc (decades of guilt → one decisive act → forgiveness) follows a familiar redemption template, and the resolution arrives without significant risk or opposition on the page; Veren's internal debate is already resolved when the story opens. The setting and ritual elevate the execution, but the transformation test is middling: swap names and the shape remains recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Veren's identity as a calligraphy forger is signaled early, drives his technical ability to complete the signature, and shapes the central choice (whether to commit "calibrated treason"). His decision to prick his thumb and complete the script are on-page actions that alter the situation irreversibly. The character is essential to the story's logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The heritage rose thorn is introduced mid-story, wrapped in silk, and used once (to prick Veren's thumb and mingle blood with ink). It returns in the final image as "the faint scent of heritage roses that no one would ever explain," reweighting the closure with a charged sensory detail. However, it does not appear in multiple distinct beats or constrain earlier choices; its primary function is symbolic anchor and ritual instrument. Late introduction (past the first third) and single functional use cap it below 7.0, but the lyric reprise at closure and the blood-mingling choice lift it into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Calibrated treason" is named explicitly, frames the ethical stakes (forging a royal signature to alter history's record), and drives Veren's central choice. The concept shapes the narrative question—whether completion is deception or correction—and recurs in the council's term and Veren's internal justification. It is present in setup, drives the middle choice, and charges the ending's moral ambiguity, meeting all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Wisely enduring" appears as a descriptor for the stalactites ("wisely enduring as they always had") and recurs in the final line ("wisely enduring as the forger finally found his peace"). The trait is presented as a teaching or quality that Veren internalizes, but it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost; it functions more as thematic echo than functional attribute. The recurrence at closure adds resonance but remains label-adjacent rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Unlink" is seeded early in Aldric's dying words ("Unlink me from this failure") and becomes the story's structural engine: the key's purpose is "to unlink a dead prince from an unfinished legacy," and Veren's act of completing the signature is the literal unlinking. The action drives the middle choice (preparing the ritual) and the closure (the key crumbles, the treaty is sealed). It is indispensable to the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The key with no apparent lock is introduced early, hangs around Veren's neck since Aldric's death, and its mystery frames the narrative's suspense. Its mechanics are revealed mid-story ("The key was never meant for metal or wood. It was meant for chains of another kind entirely") and it transforms at closure, warming and crumbling to dust across the completed document. It shapes Veren's understanding of his mission and provides the story's central metaphor. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure transformation; essential to the conceptual logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary under aurora is vividly described (pale luminescence, stalactites, pearl twilight) and provides atmosphere, but it does not constrain Veren's choices or supply resources that affect the outcome. He could complete the forgery in any quiet, solitary space. The aurora's intensification at the moment of completion ("shifted from green to violet") charges the final image slightly, and the stalactites' dripping recurs to mark time, but the setting remains more postcard than tactical pressure. Present early and at closure, but functional role is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"As stalactites drip" recurs three times as a time marker: opening ("each drop marking seconds that accumulated into centuries"), mid-story ("stalactites continued their ancient drip"), and closing ("stalactites continued dripping, counting seconds into forever"). However, the timeframe does not tighten Veren's choices or impose a deadline; the dripping functions as mood and metaphor (patience, endurance) rather than a live clock that alters tactics. Lyric recurrence adds thematic resonance but does not constrain action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To forgive the unfinished" is dramatized through Veren's forty-year guilt, his decision to complete the treaty, and the final moment when he "allowed himself, finally, to forgive the unfinished." The motivation drives the central choice (forging the signature) and is tested through the ritual preparation and the key's dissolution. It is present in setup (guilt "calcified around his heart"), middle action (the signing), and closure (walking away with peace). The final articulation edges toward summary rather than embodied shift, preventing a higher score, but the desire is legible and conflicted throughout.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Pearl twilight" recurs throughout: the aurora casts "pearl twilight across white stone pillars" early, intensifies to "that peculiar pearl twilight that existed only in this sacred place" at the signing, and dims as "dawn approached" at closure. The tone is coherent—solemn, luminous, elegiac—and modulates subtly as Veren moves from guilt through ritual to release. It charges the final image by linking the aurora's fading to Veren's departure. Present early, sustained through turns, and integrated into the closure beat.</comment>
