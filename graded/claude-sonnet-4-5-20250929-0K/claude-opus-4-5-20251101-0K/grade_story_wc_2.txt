<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior world is textured with embodied contradiction—she understands clocks lie yet spends thirty years fixing them—but her pivotal shifts occur largely in reflective summary rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation (befriending uncertainty) is narrated more than enacted; we're told her motivation crystallized during descent but don't witness the struggle that earns it. Interiority occasionally slips into label-speak ("befriend uncertainty in planning") and the admiral functions as philosophical echo rather than immediate pressure. The ending forecloses her old convictions with conceptual cost, but the embodied price remains oblique.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational elements. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the waterfall reveal. The closure—Mira carrying the compass and logbook, committing to build a probability timepiece—lands as Conceptual Repricing: her old belief in precision is reweighted by the admiral's honesty and the spinning needle. Cost is felt (thirty years of conviction abandoned) but not dramatized in a single decisive beat; the piece accumulates pressure through descent, discovery, and the admiral's wisdom, then crystallizes in her climb back. One meaningful deepening occurs when she digs up the logbook and decides to improvise. Causality is intact; coincidence (the dead client's map) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall, bioluminescent fungi, and neglected greenhouse constrain movement and charge atmosphere throughout. Sensory hierarchy is vivid and selective: "thunder, then mist, finally the impossible blue glow" filters discovery through Mira's practitioner's eye. The greenhouse's perpetual leaf-spirals and the compass pedestal anchor the closure image with tactile specificity. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the descent, waterfall passage, greenhouse interior, and digging action. The underground setting recurs in the final paragraph ("waterfall continued its eternal fall"), reweighting Mira's new relationship to time.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Mira's confrontation with her life's work (order vs. entropy). Pressure accumulates through three messages (client's death, journal pages, etched clock), the descent, and the admiral's compass revelation. One meaningful tightening occurs when she digs for the logbook and commits to "improvise now—create something new," forecloses the old precision path with conceptual cost. The choice is more renunciation than agonized decision; we see her understand rather than struggle. No antagonist; coincidence seeds the quest but does not solve it. Agency is present but the escalation reads as deepening comprehension rather than narrowing tactical options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (honesty in measurement, befriending uncertainty) emerges organically from the spinning compass, swirling leaves, and Mira's reflections without overt moralizing. The final image—"magnificently imprecise and utterly true"—offers a resonant answer to the premise without stating a thesis. The "beneath the ashes" seed returns with layered meaning (literal fireplace, metaphor for old convictions). Subtext operates in the admiral's final letter and Mira's decision to build a probability clock. Minor slip: "befriend uncertainty in planning" in mid-story edges toward prompt-echo phrasing, but the ending earns the concept through accumulated particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during reflection, wider during descent). Voice carries a distinct rhythmic texture: "uncertainly certain," "magnificently imprecise and utterly true." Perceptual signature is consistent (gears, brass, precision instruments filter her observations). No dialogue appears. Reflection is substantial (~25–30%) but anchored to present stimuli (waterfall, compass, logbook) and interleaved with micro-choices (lifting the compass, digging, reading). Brief register drift: "imposing order on entropy itself" and "befriend uncertainty in planning" feel slightly elevated for the character's practitioner idiom under peak discovery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is controlled and rhythmically varied; opening and closing images bookend effectively. Information density is high in the descent and discovery beats. Minor loop: "beneath the ashes" recurs three times with similar phrasing; "uncertainty" and "precision" are paired repeatedly without added nuance. Template cadence appears in the three-message sequence ("first time could have been...second time...third time"). Figurative language is purposeful but occasionally dense ("subterranean cathedral," "impossibly blue glow," "eternal fall") in adjacent lines without pattern-teaching. No major clarity breaks; propulsion remains steady.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The broken-clock tinkerer and spinning compass offer a fresh synthesis of measurement/honesty that feels earned in hindsight. The underground greenhouse and bioluminescent fungi are vivid, specific choices. Risk: the accumulative structure and reflective density serve the theme but flatten immediate dramatic tension. Minor proximity concern: "beneath the ashes" as both literal and metaphorical device is a familiar trope; the piece transforms it through Mira's arc but does not fully escape the template. The ending's "befriend uncertainty" thesis is specific to this character yet feels slightly thesis-driven. Solid transformation of familiar materials without breakthrough originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira (broken-clock tinkerer) is present throughout; her occupation filters perception (gears, brass, precision) and primes the theme. She makes two key choices: lifting the compass ("uncertainly certain") and digging for the logbook, then committing to build a new instrument. Her trait (tinkerer) constrains interpretation (she reads the spinning needle as "finally honest") and shapes the closure image. Present early, involved in two beats, and essential to thematic payoff. Swappability is low; removing "tinkerer" would break the premise.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The compass rose appears in three beats: spotted through leaves, lifted and examined ("needle spun slowly, continuously"), and implicit in her climb back with it. Its spinning needle is the story's central honesty symbol and directly shapes Mira's renunciation of precision. It charges the closure: she'll use it as the heart of her new timepiece. Specificity is high (Admiral Chen's instrument, two centuries lost, brass tarnished). Removing it would collapse the story's logic. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Beneath the ashes" appears as the client's phrase, the literal fireplace discovery (map hidden under ashes), and the final metaphor ("beneath the ashes of her old convictions"). It frames expectation early, enables the quest (map discovery), and is reprised thematically at closure. The phrase reweights prior material but does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics on the page. Lyric resonance is purposeful; causal pressure is moderate. Two of three gates (setup, payoff) are met; middle development is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Uncertainly certain" appears once as descriptor when Mira approaches the compass ("approached uncertainly certain of what she'd find"). The phrase captures her stance but does not constrain a visible choice or create a tradeoff. It's a perceptual label rather than an embodied action driver. Present in one beat; no clear setup or closure reprise. Replaceable with "hesitant yet expecting" without structural loss. Label-only use and late first appearance lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Improvise" is named once mid-story ("She would need to improvise now—create something new") and drives the commitment to build a probability timepiece rather than repair old clocks. It articulates the story's turn from precision to uncertainty and shapes the ending action (designing the new instrument). Present in the middle and implicit at closure. Causal role in one major beat; removing it would weaken but not break the arc. Swappable with "invent" or "adapt" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse" describes the compass discovery setting. The leaves are atmospheric (perpetual spirals, autumn, never settling) and thematically resonant (like the spinning needle), but Mira does not navigate through them as a method requiring tactics. The phrase is ornamental geography rather than a mechanical constraint. Present in one beat; no setup or middle use. Removing "swirling leaves" would lose texture but not alter Mira's approach or outcome.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall anchors the entire quest: it's the destination, provides the client's coordinates, supplies the fungal light for reading, and recurs in the final paragraph ("continued its eternal fall") to charge the closure image with timekeeping irony. It pressures movement (moss-slicked stairs, mist, narrow path behind the falls) and supplies atmosphere throughout. Present in four beats (descent, arrival, reading, closing image). Specificity is high; removing it would require a different underground structure and break thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"When coincidence becomes pattern" is articulated mid-story after the third message and frames Mira's recognition that someone orchestrated her journey. It reweights the quest's nature (deliberate vs. accidental) and sharpens her commitment. The phrase recurs implicitly in her climb back when she stops counting hours. Two gates met (middle recognition, closure echo); no early signal. Causal role in one beat; removing it would flatten the mystery layer but not break the core arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To befriend uncertainty in planning" is stated explicitly mid-story as Mira's crystallized motivation during descent. It drives her interpretation of the compass (honesty in spinning) and her commitment to build a probability clock. The motivation shapes two beats (compass lift, logbook reading/design choice) and charges the ending. Cost is conceptual (abandoning thirty years of precision work). Dramatization is mixed: the goal is declared rather than emergent from earlier contradictory impulses. Strong thematic linkage; moderate causal pressure.</comment>
