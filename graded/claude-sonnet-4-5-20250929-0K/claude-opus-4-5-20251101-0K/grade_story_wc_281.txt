<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is concrete and embodied through somatic markers (shoulder tingling = grief, left hand trembling = joy), avoiding therapeutic label-speak. Her motivation to find Daniel is rooted in specific traits—affectionate skepticism paired with methodical curiosity—and the final choice to follow his pathways feels earned by the accumulation of clues and her growing trust in bodily knowledge. Minor weakness: the pharmaceutical company recall functions more as background pressure than a live constraint that forces trade-offs on the page. The body-as-telegraph system is character-particular and avoids stock interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates discovery beats—static shock rewiring, somatic mapping, hidden chamber, journal revelation—through a coherent pattern of Maya learning to read her body's signals, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when she commits to follow Daniel's pathways. Closure lands on the page with felt cost: she accepts the risk of pursuing a disappeared person based on trust in an unproven method. Orientation anchors (Maya, studio, post-shock) arrive early and hold. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hidden chamber reweights all prior somatic markers as breadcrumbs rather than random noise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The light-painting studio functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: the faulty ground wire triggers the shock, the workbench holds the muscovite sliver, the hidden panel behind the light panel becomes the spatial hinge for discovery. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (amber light on mica, fiber-optic glow, cold seam). The studio's layered architecture mirrors the story's theme of hidden pathways and charges the final light-painting gesture. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: find Daniel and understand the recall's true purpose. Pressure accumulates through discovery rather than confrontation; each somatic marker and textual clue tightens Maya's understanding and forecloses the option of ignoring the evidence. The hidden chamber reversal reweights the pharmaceutical company's motives (control, not telepathy) and crystallizes her commitment. Cost is felt but not yet paid on the page—she chooses pursuit knowing the danger—qualifying as Charged Poise under Accumulative lens. One turn (chamber discovery) is sufficient at this length, though the antagonist (company) remains off-stage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of hidden pathways and trust in embodied knowledge emerges through the somatic markers, the geode's layered structure, and the light-painting metaphor without overt statement. The ending offers a resonant answer: belief becomes logical when the body's evidence accumulates past skepticism's threshold. The muscovite-as-frozen-thought image and the final light-painted name avoid sentimentality while charging the closure. Minor slip: "the only logical choice" in the penultimate section edges toward thematic echo, though it's integrated into Maya's voice as affectionate skeptic reconciling paradox.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: Maya filters all detail through her artist's eye (fractally precise spirals, mica sheets as frozen thought) and skeptical-but-open stance. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("affectionate skeptic," "willowglass," "somatic markers") without register drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the chamber discovery. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose reflects her methodical mind under pressure: short declarative beats during discovery, longer lyric cadence in the final painting gesture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most lines doing double duty (e.g., "The sliver sat on her workbench now, catching the amber light from her wand, its layered mica sheets glittering like frozen thought" anchors object, light source, and metaphor in one move). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor tic: "the kind of woman who" construction and "correlation does not imply causation" reads slightly expository for peak interiority, though it establishes character voice. Figurative language (fractal spirals, willowglass) is consistent and purposeful. Opening and closing lines bracket the arc cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The telepathy-pill-as-somatic-telegraph premise offers a fresh synthesis of SF trope and embodied cognition. The muscovite geode as both metaphor and literal clue, the light-painting studio as both setting and method, and the affectionate-skeptic reconciling bodily evidence all feel specific rather than stock. Risk: the pharmaceutical-conspiracy backbone is familiar, though the somatic-marker twist and the sibling breadcrumb trail add particularity. The piece commits fully to its logic without hedging, and the final light-painting gesture transforms recurrence into promise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya as affectionate skeptic is present early ("kiss her grandmother's lucky coin before politely explaining correlation does not imply causation") and her skepticism-to-belief arc drives the chamber discovery and final commitment. The trait constrains her initial doubt and enables her methodical mapping of somatic markers. It shapes two key beats: her resistance to trusting the body and her surrender to "belief finally became the only logical choice." Not fully indispensable—another temperament could follow clues—but the specific skeptic-to-believer transformation charges the thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The muscovite geode sliver appears in three beats: Daniel's gift (setup), workbench recognition trigger (middle), and journal-page storage (ending). Its layered structure mirrors Daniel's mind and the story's hidden-pathways theme. The "recognition" somatic marker when Maya holds it bridges her body-telegraph method with the closure discovery. Removing it would require rewriting the recognition beat and the Daniel-connection anchor. High integration: it's both clue and symbol, handled on the page, and its properties (mica layers) matter causally and thematically.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The telepathy pill recall frames the stakes (company wants control, not connection; Daniel disappeared after discovering this) and motivates the hidden-pathways search. It appears early (recall notice two days after shock), reappears in the journal revelation (Daniel's discovery of "control"), and shapes the ending commitment (Maya chooses to follow his escape route). The recall itself is more setup than live pressure—no agents pursue her on the page—but the concept alters Maya's understanding of what the pills do, which reweights her final choice. Functional across three beats but could be more urgent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" is signaled early in the light-painting description ("each spiral containing smaller spirals, each curve holding infinite curves") and recurs as a perceptual mode. It enables her recognition of the hidden panel's seam and the geode pattern as intentional structure rather than randomness. The trait is more perceptual filter than constraint with cost—she doesn't lose anything by seeing fractally—so it trends mid-band. It charges the thematic closure (hidden patterns made visible) but doesn't force a trade-off. Present in two beats, purposeful, but replaceable with another artist's-eye trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Devise" anchors the central action: Maya devises a method to read somatic markers, then discovers Daniel devised the same method months earlier. The parallel methods drive the recognition beat and the journal revelation. The verb appears explicitly ("beginning to devise a method," "devised the same method she had") and the action—mapping body signals to hidden knowledge—shapes every discovery beat and the final commitment. Swapping it for "discover" or "learn" would weaken the active, inventive stance. Strong integration: the devising is both her agency and the thematic through-line.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Somatic markers are introduced early (shoulder tingling = grief, hand trembling = joy, stomach drop = secret), used in the middle (knee buckle = concealed knowledge, palm tingling = recognition), and shape the climax (body guides her to the hidden panel). The mechanics matter: she moves "like a sleepwalker, her body responding to stimuli her conscious mind couldn't process." Removing this method would collapse the plot—no other telegraph system bridges the static shock to the discovery. The method is specific, taught, and indispensable. It appears in four distinct beats and enables the closure turn.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The light-painting studio provides the faulty ground wire (inciting shock), the workbench (sliver location), the hidden panel (discovery hinge), and the light wand (final gesture). It's both the accident site and the shared workspace with Daniel, which makes the hidden chamber discovery spatially and emotionally charged. The studio's architecture—panels, walls, seams—constrains the search and supplies the resources. Final image (light-painting Daniel's name) is site-specific. Strong micro-setting: it alters tactics and charges closure. Three beats plus ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After the static shock" establishes the temporal frame early and recurs (recall notice "two days after the shock," "three weeks of learning"). The timeframe creates before/after structure: pills worked one way, then the shock rewired them. It doesn't tighten decisions on the page—no live clock pressures Maya—but it anchors causality and separates the old telepathy from the new somatic mode. Functional setup and one development beat (three weeks of practice mentioned), but no urgency or countdown. Mid-band: present and causal but not a pressure lever.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maya's motivation "to illuminate hidden pathways" is signaled through Daniel's text ("Follow the pathways they don't want you to see"), her light-painting practice (tracing patterns), and crystallizes explicitly ("Her motivation had crystallized around those words"). It drives the chamber search and the final commitment to follow Daniel's map. The desire is dramatized in choices: she keeps the last pill, maps her somatic responses, searches the studio. Friction exists between her skepticism and the cost of trusting unproven bodily signals. Three beats, purposeful, but the phrasing is slightly abstract. Strong thematic fit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope" as tone appears once explicitly ("as fragile and luminous as light through willowglass") at the journal discovery and is embodied in the final smile and light-painting promise. The tone modulates: early skepticism and dread (faulty recall, Daniel's disappearance), middle tension (knee buckles, dark studio), then the shift to fragile hope when the journal proves he's alive. The willowglass image charges the closure by linking transparency, fragility, and light. Not pervasive across all beats—tone is darker earlier—but the final modulation to hope is purposeful and reweights prior dread. Two beats (journal moment, ending), coherent final charge.</comment>
