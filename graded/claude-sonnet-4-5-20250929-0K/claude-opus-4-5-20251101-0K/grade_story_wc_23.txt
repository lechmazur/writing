<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and her motivation (navigating loss through literal and metaphorical means) drives consistent choices under pressure. The emotional progression through grief to purposeful action feels earned, with embodied moments like gripping the bronze censer foot. However, the revelation that the caller is her future self arrives without sufficient groundwork, creating a slight motivation gap at the closure beat that weakens what is otherwise strong character work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes clear spatial and temporal anchors early (station, Tuesday, post-hydraulic failure) and builds coherent pressure through the midnight calls and Mira's accumulating understanding. The closure—Mira completing the beacon and recognizing her own voice—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where her grief work crystallizes into ongoing purpose. The causal lens holds: phone clues → chart plotting → beacon construction → recognition of self-as-caller. Cost is visible in her raw hands and transformed relationship to loss, though the future-self twist introduces a minor causality wrinkle that prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The starlit signal station is vividly rendered through specific details (cracked windows, corroded metal, bronze patina, salvaged mirrors) that constrain Mira's choices throughout. The setting's decay forces manual construction, the rocks provide the recovered censer, and the beacon array's spatial arrangement shapes the climactic action. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's navigational priorities, grounding both the physical work and the metaphysical stakes in concrete space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—guiding the lost home through beacon construction—is signaled early and escalates through Mira's discovery process, the cryptic calls, and her physical labor. The tightening occurs when she understands she's building "a beacon not for ships, but for souls," narrowing her options and raising the metaphysical cost. The resolution is earned by her choices and work, with visible prices (raw hands, grief transformed). However, the future-self device delivers the key insight rather than forcing Mira to a more difficult on-page choice, slightly softening the agency at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the bronze censer foot's return, the reverse migration concept, and the beacon built from salvage. The piece resists easy moralizing, instead offering "creating a path for loss itself to find meaning, to transform from absence into presence of a different kind" as an earned, non-literal answer to grief's geography. The final image of returning lights charged by "a beacon built from salvage and sorrow, flickering in raw solace" reweights all prior material without stating a thesis. Minor deduction for "reverse migration" being slightly over-explained in places.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV control is clean throughout, with Mira's perceptual signature consistent (navigator's eye for coordinates, charts, mechanical details) and diction appropriate to her makeshift expertise. The prose modulates effectively under pressure, tightening during the construction sequence. The phone voice's fragments carry authentic mystery and purpose. The future-self reveal maintains focalization but introduces a slight temporal paradox that strains the established narrative distance without full preparation, preventing entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and most lines advance character or atmosphere. Strong moments: "the geography of loss had already claimed every other place," "some kinds of navigation required an anchor to memory." However, several phrases approach overwriting: "wheeling overhead, indifferent and eternal" stacks modifiers, and "flickering in raw solace against the endless dark" loads the final image with slightly forced lyricism. Minor template cadence in the construction sequence ("She positioned each mirror... creating a constellation... When dawn approached, she placed...") and one paraphrase loop around the beacon's purpose reduce precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of literal navigation failure with metaphysical beacon-building for the lost offers a fresh angle on grief narratives, and the reverse migration concept transforms familiar "coastal exodus" material through specific detail (patchwork charts, moon-phase interpretation, manual signal array). The time-loop phone call is a bold structural risk that mostly pays off. However, the future-self device, while striking, echoes established genre templates (Interstellar, various bootstrap paradox stories), and the piece's retreat into slightly mystical language at closure ("returning lights were already beginning to gather") softens the otherwise grounded specificity. Deduction for derivative time-loop mechanics partially offsets the strong world-building and emotional particularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira as patchwork navigator is introduced early, her skills (chart-stitching, coordinate interpretation) shape multiple beats (plotting locations, constructing the array), and her final act of building and recognizing the caller drives the closure. Her navigation work is causal: interpreting calls → plotting → building → completing the beacon for "the lost." Strong specificity and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bronze censer foot appears in three beats: on the workstation, grounding Mira during the midnight call, and placed at the array's center. Its patina and shrine origin are specific, and the text explicitly states it serves as "an anchor to memory" at closure. However, its mechanical function is declared non-existent ("not because it served any mechanical purpose"), limiting causal pressure. It reweights symbolically but does not constrain choices or alter tactics. Lyric reprise partially compensates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Reverse migration is introduced early ("some things needed to return"), drives Mira's interpretation of the calls and washed-up objects, and explicitly redefines the beacon's purpose from ships to souls. The concept shapes stakes (guiding the lost home), alters tactics (manual array positioned by call coordinates), and charges the final image ("The reverse migration... was about creating a path for loss itself"). Essential across beats and ending; indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Moon-phase fluctuation is signaled early ("her ability to interpret... fluctuated with the moon phases"), affects Mira's plotting work (full moons = clarity, new moons = static), and the piece notes "the moon hung three-quarters full, and Mira was ready to build." It constrains her interpretive capacity and enables the climactic construction night. However, cost is implied rather than dramatized (we don't see her struggle during a new moon), and the mechanic is referenced more than shown altering on-page choices. Two-gate participation with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Build" is the story's central action: Mira "was constructing something new" early, the midnight call instructs "Guide them home" (requiring construction), and the climactic beat is her working through the night positioning mirrors and creating the array. The final test of her creation and the arriving lights validate the build. Removing "build" and substituting "repair" or "signal manually" would collapse the thematic arc and closure image. Major turns trace directly to this action; indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cryptic phone calls at midnight are introduced early ("That's when the midnight calls began"), drive Mira's knowledge acquisition across multiple nights, and the final call at exactly midnight delivers the key insight and future-self reveal. The method's mechanics (landline fed by buried cables, fragments of coordinates and names) shape her chart work and readiness. Essential to escalation and closure, though the future-self twist is a late rule addition that wasn't fully seeded.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The starlit signal station is anchored immediately ("starlit signal station"), its failed hydraulics force manual construction, its cracked windows and rocks supply key details, and its isolation grounds Mira's choice to stay. The station's mechanical bones provide salvage materials, and the final beacon test occurs there with starlight fracturing across the water. Setting pressures every major choice and charges the closure image; removing it would break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the hydraulics fail" frames the opening ("The hydraulics failed on a Tuesday") and motivates Mira's stay and pivot to manual construction. The timeframe is present in the setup and drives the initial choice, but once established, it functions more as static context than active pressure. The "three months ago" recovery of the censer and nightly call rhythm provide some temporal texture, but no escalating clock tightens decisions after the opening. Two gates (setup, enabling middle choice) with modest causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Navigate the geography of loss" is introduced explicitly early and dramatized through Mira's chart work, her recovery of the censer, and her grief-driven construction project. Friction between wanting to guide the lost home and the impossibility of literal return charges multiple choices, and the final shift from "bringing back what was lost" to "creating a path for loss itself to find meaning" reweights the motivation at closure. Desire is both told and shown in action; visible cost in her raw hands and transformed grief.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Raw solace" is embodied in Mira's grief-work (raw hands, sorrow as building material) and the beacon's flickering presence in darkness. Tone modulates from opening desolation through purposeful labor to the charged final image without tipping into sentimentality. The phrase "flickering in raw solace against the endless dark" explicitly charges the closure. Coherent through turns, though the tone occasionally leans into slightly elevated lyricism ("indifferent and eternal," "returning lights") that edges away from the grounded rawness elsewhere. Strong but not indispensable.</comment>
