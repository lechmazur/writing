<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivations are clear and rooted in personal tragedy, with embodied detail ("The patch pressed against her thigh"). Internal contradiction appears in her methodical observation versus impatience for action, though the struggle could be sharper at peak moments. The choice to continue surveying despite dismissal shows character under pressure, but the ending doesn't force a costly trade-off that tests her core values—she simply continues her established pattern. Competence is balanced with genuine failure (too late to save her father, unable to convince management).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The piece follows a causal lens: Mira's father's death → her obsessive documentation → discovery of the wind pattern → determination to prevent the next accident. One meaningful tightening occurs when her readings "confirmed what she suspected" at Vasquez's death site, narrowing her mission. The closure operates as Earned Stasis with visible cost: she walks alone, unheard, carrying forward her solitary investigation despite rejection. The cost is legible in "By morning, she would have another page of warnings documented. By next week, perhaps, someone would listen"—the price of her commitment is isolation and deferred impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vivid and constrains action throughout: "metal walls rose seven stories high," wind funnels through "Row J and Stack 14," containers "groaned around her, metal contracting." Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Mira's investigator lens. The anemometer functions as both tool and recurring anchor, appearing in multiple beats. The environment directly shapes her work and the final image: "metal canyons" echo her father's voice, charging the closure. The port's "respiratory system" metaphor integrates setting into the story's conceptual logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly signaled: prevent the next container death. One meaningful tightening occurs when readings at the death site confirm her theory, raising the cost of being ignored. Agency is present in her choice to continue despite dismissal, but this is endurance rather than a difficult pivot. The escalation relies more on accumulative evidence than a dramatic reversal—she documents, confirms, and persists. Pressure remains coherent under a causal lens, though the lack of a moment forcing her to risk something immediate (her job, her safety in a concrete way) keeps this from the high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "the language of almost, of nearly, of one degree's difference between safety and disaster." The father's patch returns with shifted weight, moving from memento to "method—a reminder that her purpose was to cultivate foresight in action." No overt moralizing; the theme of preventable tragedy develops through Mira's investigation and her father's death. The final image answers the thematic question through action: "the wind speaks first. Mira listened, documented, and prepared to speak second." Subtext operates in the gaps—her unheard warnings, the widow's children, the sleeping city.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices wind patterns, structural details, and danger signs others miss. Diction remains consistent and professional without becoming clinical. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during her readings and memory of her father. No dialogue appears, so those bullets don't apply. The prose reflects her methodical mind: "She sketched the flows in her notebook with hazy precision, capturing the approximate boundaries of danger zones while acknowledging that the system changed nightly." Voice modulates with pressure, tightening during the measurements and opening slightly in reflective beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively, balancing longer analytical passages with terse observations. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor scaffold appears in "She thought of Vasquez... She thought of her father"—a template stem that could tighten. The metaphor "containers funneled and compressed the air like the chambers of a vast, metal heart" is vivid but borders on overwrought for the established register. Opening and closing lines anchor well. No loops or paraphrase cycles that dull momentum. Overall clarity and propulsion are strong with only hairline slips in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—investigating wind patterns as invisible disaster agents—offers a fresh angle on workplace tragedy investigation. The container labyrinth as a "living instrument played by invisible forces" is specific and non-obvious. Emotional truth in Mira's grief and guilt feels earned rather than generic. The "hazy precision" concept and her father's aviation background integrate organically. Risk is moderate: the piece commits to its atmospheric investigation without high structural experimentation. The resolution of continued solitary work is credible but not bold. Transformation test: the core would lose significant texture if stripped to generic investigator + generic disaster.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira Chen as accident investigator is present throughout and drives the narrative arc. She makes the choice to enter the container maze (setup), conducts readings at the death site (development), and commits to continuing despite dismissal (closure participation). Her decisions alter tactics: she documents, maps, and prepares her case for management. Two beats clearly hinge on her investigator role: the death site confirmation and the decision to return tomorrow. The role is causally necessary—swap to another profession and the story breaks. Cost is visible: isolation, repeated rejection, carrying the weight of past failure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The flight engineer's patch appears in setup ("in her pocket"), development ("pressed against her thigh as she crouched"), and closure ("stayed in her pocket, warm against her leg"). It returns with reweighted meaning as "method—a reminder that her purpose was to cultivate foresight" rather than mere memento. However, it doesn't actively constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it remains symbolic rather than functional. The patch charges the final image by linking her father's voice to her present mission, but its role is more thematic resonance than causal pressure. Specificity is present (flight engineer, not generic), but swappable with another inherited item.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Singular convergence" is signaled early and shapes the entire investigation: "points of singular convergence where air pressure could spike without warning." It drives her methodology (mapping convergence points), alters her tactics (measuring at the intersection where Vasquez died), and appears in closure logic: waiting to "predict the next point of singular convergence—the place where wind and weight and time collapsed into catastrophe." The concept is causally active, not merely thematic. It narrows her options by requiring specific measurement locations and creates visible cost: her findings are dismissed because management doesn't understand convergence dynamics. Irreplaceable—remove it and the investigation's logic fails.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Rapidly adapting" as environmental attribute appears in setup: "this environment was rapidly adapting to forces no one was measuring. The containers shifted minutely with temperature changes, creating new corridors, new wind tunnels." It constrains her work by requiring nightly verification and shapes her explanation to management: "the entire port was a living instrument." The trait enables her argument but also creates the obstacle—adaptation makes patterns less predictable, contributing to dismissal. Visible cost: "She would finish tonight's survey by midnight, add the data to her models, and return tomorrow to verify." The need for repeated measurement is a direct consequence of adaptation. Not label-only; shows through "shifted minutely" and "groaned around her, metal contracting."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Survey" as action anchors the entire structure. Setup establishes it: "beginning her nightly survey of the corridors." Development: "crouched to measure ground-level turbulence," documented readings at the death site. Closure: "She would finish tonight's survey by midnight... and return tomorrow to verify." Every major turn traces to survey activity: entering the maze, confirming the wind pattern, mapping danger zones. Not swappable—replace with "inspection" or "patrol" and the anemometer work loses specificity. The action creates cost: time alone at night, repeated rejection when presenting findings, isolation from colleagues who "trusted sensors and structural reports." Surveying is the mechanism of her foresight cultivation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Documenting wind patterns between buildings" appears in setup ("documenting wind patterns between buildings"), drives development beats (anemometer readings, sketching flows, photographing instruments), and directly shapes closure: waiting to build undeniable patterns. The method is signaled and its mechanics matter: "Wind entered from the harbor at seven miles per hour, but by the time it reached the intersection of Row J and Stack 14, it had accelerated to thirty-two." Her approach differentiates her from colleagues and creates both her insight and her isolation. The documentation method enables her to "cultivate foresight" and creates cost: "her methodology seemed eccentric to colleagues." Two distinct beats rely on it: the measurements and the decision to add tonight's data to her models.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "towering labyrinth of shipping containers in a port city" is essential throughout. Setup: "container labyrinth where metal walls rose seven stories high." Development: the environment creates wind tunnels, forces navigation ("deeper into the maze"), and supplies the death site at "Row J and Stack 14." Closure: "metal canyons" echo her father's voice, charging the final image. The setting pressures every choice—where to measure, which corridors amplify wind, how containers "funneled and compressed the air." Spatial choreography is vivid: "seven stories high," "narrow passages," "corridors." Remove the container labyrinth and replace with generic industrial setting—the wind dynamics, navigation challenges, and "respiratory system" metaphor all collapse. The port silence at 9:47 PM creates the investigation window.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"After the town goes silent" (adapted to "the port fell silent at exactly 9:47 PM") anchors the timeframe and creates the investigation window. Setup: silence enables her work. Development: "cooling night air" affects container contraction and measurements. Closure: "By morning, she would have another page... By next week, perhaps, someone would listen." The nighttime frame tightens decisions by isolating her and limiting her window before daytime operations resume. Time pressure is present but not acute—she has until midnight, and the work is routine rather than crisis. The silence is necessary (can't measure during crane operations) but doesn't create a ticking-clock urgency that alters moves beat-to-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"To cultivate foresight in action" as motivation is signaled early: "her purpose was to cultivate foresight in action, to see the accident before it became inevitable." Development shows friction: she has foresight (confirmed readings) but lacks the power to act (management dismisses her). Closure crystallizes the cost: continuing to document despite being unheard, waiting for patterns to "become undeniable." The desire is dramatized through repeated survey work, visits to Vasquez's widow, and carrying her father's patch as method. Internal conflict between wanting immediate prevention and accepting deferred impact creates tension. Not merely told—shown through her solitary walks, detailed mapping, and persistent return despite rejection. The motivation shapes every beat and forecloses easy abandonment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Hazy precision" as tone is present throughout: "She sketched the flows in her notebook with hazy precision, capturing the approximate boundaries of danger zones while acknowledging that the system changed nightly." The diction balances exactitude ("exactly 9:47 PM," "thirty-two" mph) with uncertainty ("seemed eccentric," "invisible forces"). The tone modulates appropriately—tightening during measurements, opening during reflection. It charges the final image: precise documentation of unpredictable patterns, clear voice carrying uncertain prophecy. The phrase "hazy precision" itself appears only once, but the tonal quality pervades: specific wind speeds within acknowledged mutability, concrete action toward abstract prevention. Coherent through turns and integral to her investigator stance.</comment>
