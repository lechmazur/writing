<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's core motivation—to recover her deleted mother—is clear and embodied through concrete actions (reading coffee grounds, descending to the chamber, pressing her palm to the sphere). Internal contradiction appears when she obeys the tide master's prohibition for two days before defying it, showing genuine ambivalence. However, the final choice feels under-pressured: the sphere recognizes her bloodline and her mother's voice simply tells her what to do, reducing agency at the pivotal moment. The backstory dominates (~35% of text) but does anchor present choices and primes the closure; minor micro-choices (holding the book toward the sphere, striking flint) alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraphs. The story delivers a Decisive Change—Mira steps through the door with lantern raised, closing her eleven-year role as dock-lighter and opening a new boundary-keeper path—with visible cost (leaving her known world, stepping into transparency). Causality holds: whale beaches → sphere extracted → Mira investigates → coffee grounds guide her → she uses her mother's book → sphere cracks → she lights the hidden lantern → door opens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sphere cracks and her mother's voice directs her. Cost is present but muted: the final image emphasizes triumph and reunion more than sacrifice, and the "gleaming silence" she leaves behind reads more poetic than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber is vividly rendered with tactile detail (walls glittering white, silence gleaming like polished glass, fluctuating gravity lifting hair and buckling knees) and constrains Mira's movement in the key beat. The setting's gravity pockets and luminescence charge the closure scene when the sphere cracks open. Micro-setting details (cramped quarters, harbor lanterns, lighthouse panel) are economical and purposeful. Minor slip: the whale carcass and dock-side world are established early but do not evolve or constrain later action; they serve as backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering her erased mother and the deleted memories—is signaled early and drives all choices. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sphere cracks and Mira understands her mother's bargain, narrowing her path to a single action: light the hidden lantern. Agency is present but soft: Mira makes the descent and uses the book, but the sphere "recognizes" her bloodline without struggle, and her mother's voice provides explicit instruction, reducing the protagonist's problem-solving at the peak. The cost is implied (leaving her known life) but not dramatized with friction or visible forfeit on the page; the final image leans toward empowerment rather than trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—erasure is displacement, not permanence; recovery requires lighting hidden boundaries—emerges organically from Mira's actions and the sphere's mechanics without overt statement. The recurring image of lantern-lighting shifts meaning: from dock-side routine to metaphysical boundary-keeping, charging the closure when she strikes flint to the black-iron lantern. The final image offers a resonant answer to the central question (where do deleted things go?) without moralizing. Minor weakness: the mother's voice articulates the thesis ("You found where deleted memories go") in near-prompt language, edging toward thematic echo rather than letting the image speak alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Mira notices brine-thick air, calloused hands, the hollow ache of missing memories, and reads coffee grounds through her mother's divination books. Diction remains consistent (sea-glass, salt chamber, sphere's luminescence) and modulates under pressure without register drift. No head-hopping. The prose carries distinct texture in rhythm and word choice ("silence gleamed, thick and crystalline"). Minor slip: the phrase "fluctuated mysteriously" and "silence gleamed" repeat as descriptors rather than evolving through Mira's changing perception, creating slight template cadence in the middle third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high (each paragraph advances character, plot, or atmosphere). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language (silver fire, moon's edge smile, sea glass transparency) is vivid but deployed judiciously. Minor artifact: "fluctuated mysteriously" / "fluctuation" appears three times as a stock descriptor without fresh angle, and "silence gleamed" recurs twice in near-identical construction, creating minor template echo. The final line ("leaving the salt chamber's silence gleaming behind her") elegantly closes the image loop but relies on the repeated phrase. Propulsion is strong; no momentum drag. Overall craft is clean with hairline repetition in peak descriptors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—deleted memories accumulate in gravity pockets within a sphere carried by a whale—offers a fresh synthesis of erasure mythology and speculative physics. The lantern-lighter occupation transforms into boundary-keeper lineage, a purposeful trope shift. However, the emotional arc (orphan discovers hidden heritage and magical parent) follows a well-worn template, and key turns rely on inherited power (bloodline recognition) rather than Mira's ingenuity. The sphere cracks because she holds her mother's book toward it, but the mechanics feel convenient rather than hard-won. The coffee-ground divination and pressed-flower key are specific details but function as inherited tools rather than fresh problem-solving. The story commits fully to its premise and executes competently within the template, but the core journey does not surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira (dock-side lantern lighter) is introduced immediately and her occupation frames the opening and closing images. Setup: clear by paragraph one. Development: she makes the key choice to descend to the chamber instead of lighting harbor lanterns (night three), altering tactics. Payoff: the final beat transforms her from dock-lighter to boundary-keeper, striking flint to the hidden lantern. Her decisions drive the two major turns (entering the chamber, lighting the new lantern). Causal pressure is moderate; the sphere and her mother's voice guide her more than her own problem-solving at the peak, reducing irreplaceability slightly. Two distinct beats shaped by her choices; closure participation is strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressed wildflowers appear in three beats: hidden beneath floorboards as proof of her mother, held toward the sphere in the chamber (triggering the crack), and the back-cover salt key revealed as "pressed flat as any flower." Setup: signaled early (paragraph five). Development: Mira opens the book and the flowers are drawn into the sphere's gravity, cracking it open—a causal enabler. Payoff: the key's presence in the book allows her to unlock the hidden lantern. The flowers are specific (forget-me-nots, sea lavender, yarrow) and their use is irreplaceable to the sphere's opening. Cost is moderate: without them, the chamber scene fails. Strong integration across all three gates with visible causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pockets of gravity are introduced when the sphere is extracted (paragraph four) and shape the entire chamber scene: hair lifts, knees buckle, flowers are seized and drawn into the light. Setup: clear by paragraph four. Development: the fluctuating gravity constrains Mira's movement and enables the flowers to enter the sphere. Payoff: the gravity stabilizes when Mira presses her palm to the sphere, recognizing her bloodline—directly shaping the ending's mechanics. The concept is not merely thematic; it alters on-page tactics and enables closure. Specificity is high (tears in reality where deleted things accumulate). Three beats; causal pressure moderate to strong; closure linkage clear.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fluctuates mysteriously describes the sphere's behavior in three passages: when extracted, in the chamber (gravity and luminescence), and when Mira steadies it. Setup: paragraph four. Development: the fluctuation creates physical constraint (gravity shifts) during the chamber scene. Payoff: the fluctuation steadies at Mira's touch, signaling bloodline recognition and enabling the next step. The trait is dramatized through embodied effect (hair lifting, knees buckling) rather than label-only. However, "mysteriously" is a vague modifier; the mechanics remain opaque, reducing specificity. The trait enables action but could be replaced with "unstable" or "volatile" with minor rewording. Two beats with causal work; moderate cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Exhume appears thematically (coffee grounds show "exhumation," bringing buried things to light) and structurally: Mira descends to the sealed chamber, cracks the sphere open, and retrieves her mother's compressed memories. Setup: coffee grounds in paragraph six signal the concept. Development: entering the forbidden chamber and opening the sphere enact the exhumation. Payoff: the action enables the mother's voice to return and guide Mira to the hidden lantern. The action is central but partially metaphorical; the physical "exhumation" is the sphere's cracking rather than a literal grave-digging. Swappability is moderate: "unlock," "release," or "recover" could substitute with edits. Two beats; causal role clear; moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Coffee grounds appear once in a single paragraph (six): Mira reads the pattern (spiral descending into closed eye) from her mother's divination books. Setup: present by mid-story. Development: the pattern prompts her decision to descend that night instead of lighting lanterns. Payoff: absent—coffee grounds do not reappear or shape the ending. The method is functional (it triggers the key choice) but replaceable: a dream, intuition, or direct memory could serve the same role. The mechanics are gestured at (divination books, pattern recognition) but not deepened. One beat; no closure participation; swappable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The salt crystal growing chamber is introduced in paragraph four and becomes the primary setting for the climactic scene. Setup: clear by paragraph four. Development: the chamber's walls (glittering white, silence gleaming), the suspended sphere, and fluctuating gravity constrain Mira's movement and enable the flowers to be drawn into the sphere. Payoff: Mira presses her palm to the sphere in the chamber, steadying it and hearing her mother's voice; she then climbs from the chamber to the lighthouse. The setting supplies resources (sphere, gravity, enclosed space) and pressures the climax. Specificity is high (salt crystals, luminescence casting silver fire). Three beats; strong causal work; closure participation clear; irreplaceable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe is established in the opening line ("three days" after the whale's death) and structures the story's clock: day one (extraction), days one-two (Mira obeys the seal), day three morning (coffee grounds), day three night (descent and climax). Setup: immediate. Development: the three-day span tracks Mira's internal conflict (obedience versus compulsion). Payoff: "that night" she descends, and the ending occurs as "dawn broke over the harbor." The clock is present and tracked but does not tighten decisions; Mira could have acted on day two or four without altering the story. No visible urgency or decay tied to the whale's beaching pressures her timing. Two beats; moderate tracking; weak causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—to find where deleted memories go—is seeded early (hollow ache, fragments of her mother, town records showing no marriage or birth) and drives every choice: reading coffee grounds, defying the seal, using the book, pressing her palm to the sphere. Setup: clear by paragraph five. Development: the motivation shapes her decision to enter the chamber and use the wildflowers. Payoff: she discovers the answer (deleted things accumulate in the sphere) and steps through the door to "bring them home," closing the arc. Friction is present (two days of obedience, the hollow ache) but mild; the sphere's cooperation reduces cost. Three beats; strong causal pressure; closure participation unmistakable; visible cost moderate (leaving her life behind is asserted more than dramatized).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Gleaming silence appears four times: salt chamber's silence "gleamed like polished glass" (paragraph five), "silence gleamed, thick and crystalline" (paragraph nine), and twice more in descriptions of the chamber's atmosphere. Setup: paragraph five establishes the tone. Development: the phrase recurs in the climactic chamber scene, modulating with Mira's pressure (silence presses against eardrums, thick and crystalline under gravity). Payoff: the final line ("leaving the salt chamber's silence gleaming behind her") reprises the image, reweighting it as what she abandons rather than confronts. Tone is coherent and purposeful, creating a luminous, crystalline mood that supports the sphere's otherworldly quality. However, the exact phrase "silence gleamed" recurs without variation, trending toward motif checklist rather than evolved charge. Lyric reprise reweights the stake; closure linkage clear; specificity high; moderate template reliance.</comment>
