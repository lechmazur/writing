<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena's methodical observation and professional filter create a coherent perceptual stance. Her choice to write the report that "would determine whether the whispered chapel was sealed again or finally allowed to speak" carries genuine consequence, and the line "she typed until dawn" dramatizes commitment with temporal cost. Internal contradiction appears in "shielded openness" and "professional distance that allowed her to see clearly while still feeling," but these remain somewhat abstract. The final stasis—not looking up while typing—reads as earned endurance under pressure, though the embodied cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative lens is inferred and held: Elena gathers evidence through video comparison, and pressure tightens as differences accumulate (pigment loss, new expressions on stones, the torn map). Closure arrives as Charged Poise—she commits to writing the report with visible cost ("typed until dawn") and the chapel "at last, began to whisper," reconfiguring the silence into potential speech. The orientation anchors (Elena, vault, laptop footage) land cleanly within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the henge stones' impossible new expressions force her interpretive stance to crystallize.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault, henge stones, and laptop setup provide tactile grounding. The torn map on the far wall—dividing known from unknown—constrains Elena's interpretive frame and charges the final image when the henge stones "cast shadows that seemed... to reach toward her like hands." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: damp stone chill, mold-scented crate, blue laptop glow, rain drumming. The vault's three-hundred-year erosion and the medieval painter's blank territories function as micro-setting that pressures her decision to unseal or preserve.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to recommend sealing or opening the chapel—is signaled early and shapes Elena's methodical review. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stone faces show impossible new expressions of "grief... or recognition," forcing her to choose between dismissing the evidence and honoring what "the evidence suggested." The final decision to type "until dawn" forecloses retreat with temporal and professional cost. Agency is decision and endurance under accumulative pressure. Escalation is subtle but present: the coincidental changes (pigment, expressions) complicate but do not resolve; Elena's interpretive stance crystallizes the stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of boundaries, silence, and empathy: "boundaries were always negotiations," blank map spaces "revealed as much as the detailed ones," and "not everything unknown wishes to remain so." The torn map literalizes the division between known and unmapped, and the henge stones occupy that boundary. The final image—chapel beginning to whisper as Elena types—offers a resonant answer to whether silence can be interpreted without violation. No explicit moralizing; the ending reweights prior material (the painted saints turning, shadows reaching) with conceptual cost tied to opening what was sealed. Subtext operates in gesture and implication throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled; perceptual signature is distinct ("methodically curious by nature, the kind of person who took notes on her notes"). Diction matches Elena's professional lens: "map framer by trade," "blank spaces revealed as much as the detailed ones," "shielded openness." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during video comparison and relaxing for context. No head-hopping. Some figurative language edges toward elevated register ("patient as prayer," "erosion of painted prayers") but remains voice-motivated and legible. One mild filter-verb cluster ("seemed to shift," "seemed to turn") in mid-passage but does not dull immediacy at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, evidence, or stake. Rhythm varies well, and sentence openings are diverse. Two paraphrase loops appear: "The painted saints watched" echoes earlier "saints... on the curved ceiling" without added pressure, and "seemed to" recurs three times in close proximity ("seemed to shift," "seemed to turn," "seemed... to reach") creating mild scaffold. The line "Unless they had. Unless decades of silence had changed them" delivers effective compression. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, but the cumulative minor loops reduce propulsion slightly in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes map-framing expertise, video archaeology, and ambient haunting into a fresh angle: a professional interpreter of blank spaces confronts a chapel where boundaries themselves are eroding. The henge-beneath-vault detail and the torn map that divides territories are specific and non-obvious. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and the quiet, poise-based ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The emotional truth—choosing to honor what cannot be fully known—avoids generic template. One friction: the whispered-chapel trope echoes familiar Gothic ground, but the interpretive lens and map-framing particulars transform it sufficiently.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's perceptive observation drives the video comparison and the final decision to write the report. Her methodical cross-referencing ("second screen," "exact moment," "rewound both videos") creates the evidence accumulation. The choice to type "until dawn" knowing her words "would determine whether the whispered chapel was sealed again or finally allowed to speak" is a key turn with visible cost. Setup early, involved in middle comparison beats, and closure-shaping. Causal pressure is moderate; the character's perception enables the conflict but the chapel's changes are independent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The henge stones appear in both 1962 and present footage, anchor the vault's mystery, and occupy the boundary "neither fully in the documented territory nor entirely in the unmapped darkness beyond." Their impossible new expressions ("grief... or recognition") force Elena's interpretive crisis. Shadows that "seemed... to reach toward her like hands" charge the final image. Setup early, middle beat (expression discovery), and closure linkage. Cost connection: their presence at the torn-map boundary shapes her decision. Specificity high; circular arrangement and medieval context are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The whispered chapel frames the entire investigation: locals' name, never consecrated, sealed for unknown reasons, and the heritage council's reluctance. The final line—"the chapel, at last, began to whisper"—reweights the silence into potential speech and justifies Elena's decision. Setup immediate, middle stakes (whether to reseal), and closure payoff. The concept shapes Elena's empathetic interpretive stance and the tactical question of preservation versus revelation. Cost is conceptual: opening what was sealed. Specificity moderate; "whispered" could be replaced with "silent" or "hidden" with minor rewriting.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Methodically curious by nature" is demonstrated through cross-referencing ("notes on her notes"), three permission requests, and simultaneous video playback at "exact moment" markers. The trait enables the evidence accumulation but does not constrain a choice with visible cost; her methodical approach is an asset without tradeoff. Setup early, middle involvement (video analysis), mentioned at closure ("typed until dawn" implies sustained method). Causal work is moderate; the trait supports but does not narrow options. Swappable with "thorough" or "systematic."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Reopening the sealed chamber is the inciting action: "requested permission... three times before the heritage council finally relented." The act exposes the impossible changes (new stone expressions, torn map) that create the interpretive crisis. The middle turn—discovering the differences—traces directly to this reopening. Closure hinges on whether her report will reseal or open further. Setup by paragraph two, middle causality strong, closure stakes tied to it. Irreplaceable: without reopening, no video comparison, no new evidence, no decision. Cost connection: the council's reluctance and her three requests show prior friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Video comparison is the investigative method throughout: "footage played without sound," "second screen," "paused both videos at the exact moment," "rewound both videos." The method reveals all key evidence: pigment loss, vanished arm, new stone expressions, torn map. Setup early (paragraph three), middle beats (each discovery), and shapes the closure decision by making the impossible changes undeniable. Mechanics matter: "same angles, same deliberate pacing" and "simultaneously" watching establish rigor. Irreplaceable; without this exact method, the time-based changes cannot be proven. Causal pressure high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault provides persistent atmosphere: rain "working on the fresco... for three hundred years," "damp stone wall," "chill that never left," rain "intensified... drumming against the vault's stones." The vault's erosion mirrors the investigative process and the decision to let the chapel speak or remain sealed. Setup immediate, middle pressure (ambient chill, mold-scented crate ground the comparison work), and closure: rain drumming as Elena types "until dawn." The setting constrains by its dampness and decay, and the vault's curve and fading frescoes charge the final image. Irreplaceable physical space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The torn map "dividing known from unknown" appears twice: once in the video comparison and again when Elena touches the screen at that boundary. The henge stones "stood exactly at that boundary" and the medieval painter's blank spaces embody the unknown. The metaphor shapes Elena's interpretive lens ("boundaries were always negotiations") but does not tighten decision timing or create a live clock. Setup second half, thematic echo at closure, but no temporal pressure. Swappable with "threshold" or "edge" with minor rewording. Cost is conceptual, not tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To interpret silence with empathy" is stated explicitly ("come here to interpret silence with empathy") and demonstrated: Elena's "shielded openness," belief that "blank spaces revealed as much as the detailed ones," and choice to honor "what the evidence suggested" rather than dismiss it. The motivation drives the report decision and the final image of typing "until dawn." Setup mid-story (paragraph ten), closure linkage strong. Friction: the desire is told more than shown in contradictory choices. Cost is temporal and professional (writing all night, risking credibility). One beat of visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Shielded openness" and "professional distance that allowed her to see clearly while still feeling" are stated and modeled: Elena neither dismisses the impossible changes nor succumbs to uncritical belief. Tone is consistently measured, balancing dread ("troubled her most") with curiosity. The final image—typing without looking up as shadows reach—sustains the stance. Setup mid-story, stable through turns, and charges the ending by maintaining poise under accumulation. Coherent but somewhat abstract; the tension between shield and openness could be more embodied in contradictory actions. Modulation is subtle rather than pronounced.</comment>
