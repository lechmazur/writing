<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and consistently rendered through concrete action (handling the fragment, reconstructing listings). Her borrowed-years backstory is purpose-driven, anchoring her work without stalling momentum. However, her arc lacks genuine internal contradiction—she never struggles against her chosen path or faces a meaningful trade-off between competing desires. The final stance ("no longer felt borrowed") is asserted rather than earned through a dramatized choice that forecloses an alternative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds meaning through layered discovery (fragment → hologram → garage sale listings → Elena's method) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Vera commits to continuing Elena's work. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly by the second paragraph. The closure reweights Vera's borrowed time from debt to vocation with felt cost (seventeen years dedicated to an invisible, patient archive), and the lens holds. One tightening occurs when the fragment unlocks the capsule's true purpose, narrowing Vera's options to a single, essential role.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The emerald silo is vividly rendered ("glass walls catching light," "green waves") and returns at closure to charge the final image ("emerald walls pulsed"). The urn fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining Vera's discovery and providing the key that repairs the capsule. Sensory detail is selective and supports the textural lens. The post-Reformation world (numbers as emotions, clocks displaying feelings) is consistent and integrated into Vera's work without info-dump.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Vera's need to understand temporal texture, signaled early and sustained. The fragment discovery reverses her task from cataloging anomalies to reconstructing Elena's intentional archive, tightening her purpose. The cost is clear: seventeen borrowed years now committed to an invisible, patient labor. Agency is renunciation of "more life" in favor of "understanding," dramatized through her repair of the capsule and acceptance of the role. Pressure deepens rather than escalates through multiple reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (preservation of moments through mundane vessels) emerges organically from the garage sale listings and Elena's method without meta-commentary. The final image—capsule sealed, messages embedded in ordinary transactions—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how time's texture can be held. The borrowed-years motif returns with reweighted meaning (from debt to essential bridge). Subtext operates through the contrast between emotional timekeeping and Elena's hidden coordinates. No thematic echo or final-paragraph moralizing; the ending trusts image over assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in Vera's perceptual signature (sensing "temporal decay," feeling "sediment layers" through touch). Diction is elevated but consistent, voice-motivated by the conceptual premise. The phrase "suddenly timeless" recurs as a leitmotif rather than head-hopping. No dialogue appears. One register slip: "emotional archaeology" and "anticipated mysteries" edge toward abstraction in a piece otherwise grounded in concrete sensation. Psychic distance is controlled; no filter-verb stacks or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clear with purposeful figurative density ("seconds visible as shimmering green waves," "time collects like dust on forgotten shelves"). However, several adjacent lines restate the capsule's purpose without added pressure ("wasn't meant to preserve objects... meant to preserve a method"), triggering a paraphrase-loop deduction. Minor stock phrasing: "anticipated mysteries yet to unfold" and "texture of all our passing" lean toward generic lyricism. The closure image is clean and propulsive, but mid-section scaffold slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The core synthesis—numbers as emotional weight + time capsule + garage sale listings as temporal archive—is specific and non-obvious. Elena's method (embedding coordinates in mundane commerce) transforms the familiar premise of time capsules through lived, occupational detail. The Numerical Reformation world-rule is boldly committed and followed through without retreat. Minor derivative echo: the "borrowed time" trope is common in speculative fiction, though here it's integrated into Vera's role rather than a mere plot device. The ending resists easy answers, trusting image over explanation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera (borrowed-time timekeeper) is present throughout, makes the key discovery (urn fragment), reconstructs Elena's listings, and completes the capsule repair. Her choices drive all major beats and the closure (committing her remaining years to continuing Elena's work). Setup early, developed in middle, shapes ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cremation urn fragment is handled in beat one (discovery), analyzed for inscriptions in beat two, and placed into the repaired seal at closure, completing Elena's circuit. Its specific properties (name, microscopic inscriptions, lodged position) are irreplaceable. It constrains Vera's access to the capsule's contents and charges the final image by making the repair possible.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The damaged time capsule frames the premise, creates the obstacle (jammed mechanism), reveals its contents (holographic listings), and is repaired at closure. The crack's cause (Numerical Reformation) anchors the world-rule. Vera's entire job and the story's stakes depend on this capsule; removing it collapses all causality. Setup, development, and closure all hinge on it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" appears twice as descriptor (capsule hums, final image). It colors tone but does not constrain an on-page action or force a trade-off. The attribute is more atmospheric than causal—Vera's choices would proceed identically without this exact phrase. Present in setup and closure but ornamental rather than load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Rediscover" drives Vera's recognition that Elena's listings are coordinates for reliving moments, the story's central revelation. This action defines the middle turn and her decision to continue the work. The entire thematic payoff depends on rediscovery as method. Setup (Vera's job), development (listings decoded), closure (committing to embed new moments). Swapping to "decode" or "translate" would alter nuance but the beat structure holds.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Embedding messages in garage sale item descriptions is revealed mid-story, defines Elena's technique, and becomes Vera's mission at closure. The method is specific (descriptions with hidden coordinates) and irreplaceable—no other encoding would preserve the mundane-vessel theme. It shapes two beats (discovery and commitment) and charges the final image. Late first appearance (past midpoint) and not pre-signaled caps the score despite strong closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The emerald silo is named early, its glass walls and green light are vivid and recurring, and it houses the capsule (pressuring access). The setting enables Vera's role and charges the closure image ("emerald walls pulsed"). It does not dynamically alter her tactics within the scene, functioning more as atmospheric anchor than active constraint. Setup, weak middle development, strong closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe (after the Numerical Reformation) is established early, explains the capsule's damage, and defines the world-rule (numbers as emotions, clocks show feelings). It contextualizes Vera's role as bridge between old and new systems. However, it does not tighten on-page decisions—Vera's work proceeds without temporal pressure or deadline. Setup strong, development thematic rather than tactical, closure participation via the capsule's forward journey.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vera's motivation (to understand time's texture) is stated early ("This was why she had accepted the borrowed years"), dramatized through her sensory work with the fragment, tested when she grasps Elena's method, and fulfilled at closure when she commits her remaining years. The desire drives her reconstruction work and final choice. Friction appears between "more life" and "understanding," though the text asserts resolution rather than showing competing pulls in a single difficult moment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Anticipated mysteries" appears in the final paragraph and once earlier ("suddenly timeless, as if responding"). The tone is consistently contemplative and layered with discovery, modulating from cataloging (opening) to revelation (middle) to commitment (closure). It charges the final image ("ready to journey forward into futures") but is more stated than embodied through syntax or rhythm. Coherent across turns, closure participation present but labeled rather than enacted through prose texture.</comment>
