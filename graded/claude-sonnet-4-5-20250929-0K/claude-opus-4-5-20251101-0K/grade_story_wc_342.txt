<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's prosopagnosia and tactile gift are established early and motivate her choices consistently. The interiority carries specific texture ("fractally precise patterns," "landscapes of texture") and her final choice to walk away with the knowledge is earned by the guild's loss and her revelatory experience. However, the change feels more thematic than decisively character-driven; she enters seeking what the scholars hid and exits having found it, but the cost to her person remains abstract rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through layered images (coin, tree, manuscript, portrait) and the closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara walks away carrying secrets, having understood that "discovering limits means learning they are not prisons but doorways." Cost is conceptual (the tree's destruction, the failed mirror-heaven project) and felt through the final stillness. Orientation anchors (Elara, Great Oak library, night before demolition) land cleanly within the first several paragraphs. One tightening occurs when she decodes the coin and finds the hidden manuscript; the ending reweights her blindness and the scholars' failure into a purposeful threshold moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Great Oak library is vividly rendered: "hollowed trunk," "shelves of crumbling manuscripts," "chambers where the tree's heartwood had been carved with such precision that starlight filtered through in calculated constellations." Spatial choreography tracks her movement from outer trunk to hidden hollow. The setting constrains her search (hidden panel, secret book safe carved to resemble bark) and charges the final image (condemned oak in heightened stillness). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through her tactile bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Find what the scholars hid before demolition. The coin's tactile map tightens pressure by guiding Elara deeper; discovering the manuscript and theorem is a meaningful deepening that reweights her understanding of limits. Agency is present (she decodes, searches, draws, walks away with the knowledge) but the escalation is gentle—no live opposition or reversals, only accumulative discovery. The cost is conceptual (the tree's loss, the failed mirroring project) rather than a personal forfeiture that alters her tactics or future options on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—discovering limits as thresholds rather than endpoints—emerges organically from Elara's blindness-as-gift, the scholars' failed heaven-mirroring, and the final image of walking away with hidden knowledge. The theorem "that knowledge has no ceiling, only walls we mistake for sky" is stated but earned by the tree's imminent destruction and Elara's fractally precise portrait. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: limits become "doorways," "the precise edge where known becomes unknown, where blindness becomes a different kind of sight." No overt moralizing; complexity and ambiguity linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable and clean throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct—Elara notices texture, temperature, geometry—and diction ("fractally precise," "landscapes of texture," "infinite geometries") suits her artist's sensibility. Psychic distance is consistent. One brief elision (the scholars' backstory, the guild's condemnation) is efficiently compressed and does not withhold facts Elara knows. Minor repetition in sentence stems ("She drew the way bark feels…She drew blindness as a gift…") creates a deliberate cadence but edges toward template rhythm in the crafting passage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and often propulsive; information density is high in the coin-decoding and manuscript-discovery beats. Figurative language ("fractally precise," "suspended breath between existence and absence," "limits were not prisons but doorways") suits the accumulative lens but clusters heavily in the final third, risking slight overwriting. Minimal loops; one paraphrase near the end ("the strange freedom of experiencing a world unmapped by others' expectations" echoes earlier interiority). Sentence openings vary, and the final image ("carrying its secrets in her hands, feeling the coin's ancient indentations press against her palm like a heartbeat, like a message, like a map") is rhythmically controlled. No major artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of prosopagnosia, tactile artistry, and a doomed tree-library is specific and non-obvious. The scholars' attempt to "mirror heaven's perfect arrangement within their earthen library" transforms the discovery-quest trope into a meditation on epistemological limits. Elara's final act—drawing the library itself as a portrait—is fresh and thematically resonant. The piece commits fully to its accumulative design and takes the risk of a quiet, reflective closure that reweights rather than resolves, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's prosopagnosia and tactile perception frame her approach to the coin and manuscript (setup, development). Her final choice to walk away carrying the knowledge participates in closure. She decodes the coin, searches the library, and crafts a portrait—three distinct beats shaped by her perceptual mode. Causal pressure is moderate; her blindness enables the tactile reading but does not force trade-offs or visible costs on the page. Specificity and closure linkage elevate the score, but the lack of on-page friction or cost tied directly to her face-blindness caps higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The secret book safe appears late (near midpoint), is opened once, and yields the manuscript—functional but not revisited or reweighted at closure. It serves a necessary plot function (hiding the scholars' final theorem) but is swappable with any hidden container. No evolving use or charged reprise; static involvement in one beat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Discovering limits" is signaled early (the scholars' quest to "discover the limits of human knowledge") and shapes Elara's stakes throughout. The manuscript's theorem directly articulates it, and the final image reweights limits as "doorways" and "the precise edge where known becomes unknown." The concept drives her interpretation of the scholars' failure and her own blindness-as-gift, participating decisively in the closure reconfiguration. Cost is conceptual but undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" is established early as Elara's perceptual signature and enables her to decode the coin's micro-geography (development beat). It colors her portrait-making and her understanding of infinite geometries. The trait is label-heavy but does appear in on-page action (tracing the coin, mapping features). However, no visible trade-off or cost is tied to this precision; it functions as pure enabler without friction, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Craft" appears in three beats: Elara is introduced as a portrait artist, she crafts a drawing in the dying light, and the drawing reframes the library's meaning at closure. The final crafting act participates in the ending's thematic reconfiguration. However, the drawing could be replaced with another form of preservation (writing, memory) without breaking story logic; the specific act of drawing is thematically apt but not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The coin and its faint indentations are introduced early, decoded through tactile reading (development beat), and mentioned again in the final image ("feeling the coin's ancient indentations press against her palm like a heartbeat"). The method shapes her search tactics and charges the final image with layered meaning. Two distinct beats plus closure reprise; causal pressure is clear. Specificity (centuries-old, corroded, microscopic geography) makes it irreplaceable as the access key.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is established in the opening, provides spatial architecture (hollow trunk, carved chambers, hidden panel, false bark), and pressures the search with imminent demolition. It supplies the manuscript, constrains Elara's movements, and is present in her final drawing and the closing image of the condemned oak awaiting destruction. Three gates met; causal and atmospheric pressure across multiple beats; participates decisively in closure. The setting's uniqueness (living wood carved into library, starlight constellations) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe ("Tomorrow, the wrecking crews would arrive. Tonight, the tree stood condemned"; "the hush that precedes destruction") is signaled early and provides urgency. The final paragraph tracks dawn's arrival and the assembling crews, tightening the window. However, the clock does not force mid-scene tactical shifts or trade-offs; Elara completes her search and drawing without visible time pressure altering her choices. The timeframe shapes atmosphere and stakes but does not constrain on-page action with cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To mirror the sky inside walls" is the scholars' historical motivation, narrated as backstory. It is thematically resonant and frames the library's purpose, but it is not Elara's desire and does not create on-page friction or choices. Told rather than dramatized; the scholars are absent. The motivation enriches theme but does not drive present action or closure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Heightened stillness" is established early ("the hush that precedes destruction") and maintained throughout: "the building groaned around her, settling into its final hours," "the precise moment when stillness would shatter," "the Great Oak waited in heightened stillness for its destruction." Tone modulates subtly with discovery beats but remains coherent and charges the final image powerfully. The stillness contrasts the imminent demolition and mirrors Elara's tactile, non-visual perception. Indispensable to atmosphere and closure resonance.</comment>
