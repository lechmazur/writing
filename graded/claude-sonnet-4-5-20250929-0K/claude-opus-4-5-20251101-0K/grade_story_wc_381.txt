<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to hush the prophecy is clear, but her interiority remains largely abstract—phrases like "fierce and peaceful simultaneously" and "tranquil blaze" label states rather than embody them through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The climactic ritual unfolds as a descriptive meditation rather than a sequence of micro-choices under pressure; we are told she stretches silence and transforms the prophecy but never see a moment where competing impulses or genuine struggle threaten the outcome. The ending renunciation (the prophecy "hushed into a gentler shape") reads as summary rather than earned cost, and no visible path is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who, where, and when efficiently in the opening paragraphs, and the dominant stake (hush the prophecy to prevent violence) is signaled early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Mira's expanding awareness and the ritual's lyric progression aim to deepen rather than reverse causally. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Mira retrieves the wing, smiles, and returns home without forfeiting a live option or paying a price legible in action or image. The final paragraph asserts that "the world had been given the gift of uncertainty" but does not dramatize what Mira lost or relinquished to achieve it, leaving the Resonant Reconfiguration incomplete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven, willows, brook, and origami wing are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (the stream "moved without sound," the wing "caught moonlight and seemed almost to breathe"). Spatial choreography is clean throughout the ritual sequence. The origami wing qualifies as a micro-setting element that constrains the ritual—Mira places it on water, tracks its journey, retrieves it—thereby charging the final image with tactile presence and fulfilling the 9+ gate for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (prevent a violent hunt for the prophesied child) is declared early and remains coherent. However, the piece lacks on-page tightening or reversal: Mira performs the ritual without obstacle, setback, or moment when the prophecy resists her work. The cost at closure is asserted ("she had hushed it into a gentler shape") but not dramatized—no live option is foreclosed, no tactical shift forced, no price paid in action or image. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift that narrows options is required; here the ritual unfolds as sustained description without escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of silence as presence and prophecy as mutable emerges organically from the ritual and Mira's craft. The final image of the bird filling silence with "new and harmless sound" offers a quiet thematic answer without overt moralizing. However, the ending drifts toward thematic summary ("the gift of uncertainty, that most precious form of hope") rather than letting the image alone carry the resonance. The piece resists easy binaries and invites reflection, but the lack of cost at closure limits the reweighting of prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable and the narrative voice carries a lyric, elevated register consistent with Mira's contemplative craft. Perceptual signature is present in phrases like "the sensation was terrestrially cosmic" and the attention to silence as texture. However, the diction occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze," "fierce and peaceful simultaneously") that labels states rather than grounding them in embodied perception. Under peak ritual pressure, the voice does not compress or modulate; it maintains a uniform meditative register that flattens urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose is generally clear and rhythmically controlled, but several passages suffer from decorative density that slows momentum without adding causal pressure. "The sensation was terrestrially cosmic, grounding her in soil and stone even as it connected her to the vast machinery of celestial movement" stacks modifiers and abstract nouns where concrete action would sharpen the beat. Synonym loops appear: "hushed"/"hush"/"stillness"/"silence" cycle without functional variation, and scaffold phrases ("she knew," "she had discovered," "she needed") recur. The ritual sequence, which should anchor the climax, reads as extended summary rather than beat-by-beat propulsion, reducing information density and dimming closure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise of a summoner who works with silence rather than spirits offers a fresh angle, and the concept of "mapping silence" to transform prophecy is inventive. However, the execution leans on familiar contemplative-fantasy tropes: the solitary mystic, the nocturnal ritual, the origami token, the cosmic-grounding duality. The ritual itself unfolds without surprise or friction, and the resolution (prophecy hushed into gentler form) arrives without an earned turn or non-obvious insight. The piece commits to its lyric register but does not take structural or perspectival risks that would elevate ingenuity into the higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her role as summoner frames the story, satisfying setup and closure participation. However, her choices do not create key turns—she decides to perform the ritual, does so without complication, and succeeds. The ritual sequence is descriptive rather than decision-driven; no on-page moment shows her altering tactics under pressure or choosing between competing costs. Mid-band functional use without causal pressure or middle development that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The origami wing appears early (first third), is placed on water during the ritual (middle beat), and is retrieved at closure, satisfying all three gates. It functions as a tactile anchor and charges the final image. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose cost—Mira uses it as a ritual tool without friction, and its retrieval does not reweight prior material or alter her stance. Two-gate involvement with closure presence, but no causal pressure or irreplaceability that would push higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The concept of "smoothed hush" is seeded early and drives the ritual's mechanics (stretching gaps between syllables, expanding silence). It shapes Mira's method on the page and is named in the closure paragraph ("the smoothed hush she created"). However, it does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost—Mira applies the concept without complication or tradeoff. Setup, development, and closure presence met, but no friction or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" appears once in a descriptive passage during the ritual: "The sensation was terrestrially cosmic, grounding her in soil and stone even as it connected her to the vast machinery of celestial movement." It is label-only, does not enable or constrain an action, and carries no cost. Mentioned but ornamental; no setup signal, no causal work, no closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Flow" appears in Mira's expanding awareness ("let her awareness flow outward, following the wing's journey") and in the brook's continuity at closure. It is present in the ritual's middle beat and at the ending image, satisfying two gates. However, the action is descriptive rather than causal—Mira's flow does not encounter resistance or force a tactical choice. Functional use with closure presence but swappable (e.g., "expand," "extend") and no pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is introduced early ("By mapping silence, she had discovered, one could trace the negative space around any utterance") and governs the ritual method in the middle beat ("She found the hushed spaces between each coded syllable and began to stretch them"). It shapes Mira's approach and is implied at closure. Setup, development, and closure presence met, but the method is asserted rather than tested—no friction, complication, or cost tied to the mapping itself. Functional involvement without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the brook is established in the opening, provides the ritual space throughout, and is affirmed at closure ("The haven remained what she had made it"). It supplies atmosphere and continuity but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Mira's work would unfold identically in any quiet setting. Lyric reprise that reweights the dominant stake (sanctuary of intention → place where secrets rest) with closure presence, but no causal pressure. Eligible for mid-6s under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" appears in the opening paragraph's scene-setting and is echoed in the final paragraph ("a place where whispered secrets came to rest"). It does not tighten decisions or track time—the ritual's duration is vague ("Time passed strangely"), and the timeframe functions as mood rather than constraint. Setup and closure presence met, but no middle development or pressure. Functional but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to hush the prophecy is declared early, dramatized in the ritual sequence (Mira acts to stretch silence and transform the prophecy's urgency), and affirmed at closure. It drives Mira's actions across all three gates. However, the motivation is not conflicted on the page—Mira never weighs competing desires, faces a cost that tests her commitment, or hesitates. The prophecy's threat is told (fear and violence spreading) rather than shown resisting her work. Strong setup and involvement, but no friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is named once in the ritual beat ("the intensity of blazing concentration, yet she maintained a tranquil blaze within herself") and echoed in the ending's mood (quiet confidence). It modulates slightly—calm opening, concentrated ritual, peaceful closure—but remains a static label rather than a tonal texture that charges the final image under pressure. Functional presence across beats without distinct modulation or closure charge.</comment>
