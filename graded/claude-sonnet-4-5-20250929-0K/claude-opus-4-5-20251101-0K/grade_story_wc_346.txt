<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is embodied through the puppet head and her decades-long vigil, but her emotional progression feels too smooth—no genuine contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The reflective blocks dominate (~40% of text) yet remain abstract: "beautifully flawed existence" and "some callings demand everything" read as thesis statements rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice (singing the lullaby) arrives without visible on-page cost that forecloses a competing path; we're told she had "nothing left to give" but no present-tense renunciation dramatizes that loss. Internal experience stays contemplative and controlled even at the climactic beat, missing the irrational layering under peak stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Mira is and her exact situation emerge gradually through reflection rather than early anchoring (−0.3). The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens through nested time imagery and the lullaby's refraction, and closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the clock freezes, the lullaby reaches all children. However, the cost remains asserted ("nothing left to give") rather than shown on the page in the final beat; no visible forfeiture or alteration of Mira's state occurs in the ending lines. The causal link between adjusting the clock and the lullaby's propagation is explained retrospectively ("she had spent a lifetime calculating") rather than dramatized through a because/therefore chain of on-page moves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse, obsidian clock, and "pane of hush" anchor the piece with vivid, purpose-driven detail. The glass walls transforming into a window and the beam igniting inward constrain and charge the closure image directly. Spatial choreography remains clear (spiral stairs, lantern room, console). Sensory selection is strong: "amber and bruise," "dust on her cheeks," "hollow eye socket now somehow full of stars." The timeframe "dusk" and "liminal hours" integrate tightly with the threshold concept, and the broken puppet head functions as both memory anchor and ritual object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mira's effort to send the lullaby across time—is signaled by midpoint and coheres under the Accumulative lens. However, the hands "nearly converged" at the start, yet no on-page obstacle or tightening pressure tests Mira's ability to complete the adjustment; she begins the work and it succeeds without reversal or cost-imposing choice. The "frozen at one second to midnight" outcome averts catastrophe, but we don't see what Mira sacrificed or what option she foreclosed by choosing this particular adjustment over another. Agency reads as execution of a pre-calculated plan rather than a decision under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: endings can be softened, not stopped; love persists through nested time; imperfect guardians choose connection over prevention. The lullaby and puppet head accumulate meaning without overt moralizing, and the final image—stars in the hollow eye socket, children everywhere receiving the song—resonates as a non-literal answer to the premise. The line "some callings demand everything and vouchsafe nothing but purpose" skirts thesis territory but is rescued by the specificity of the lullaby and Elena's name. Minor penalty for "beautifully flawed" recurring as prompt-label rather than fully dramatized trait, yet the thematic synthesis (mother's grief refracted into universal comfort) feels earned and particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV control is clean with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("vouchsafe," "liminal," "hush of time's final ripple"), matching the mythic-philosophical register appropriate to a cosmic sentinel. Reflection dominates but remains anchored to present stimuli (the puppet head, the clock's hands). However, perceptual signature lacks idiosyncratic bias—Mira's way of noticing reads poetic-omniscient rather than character-particular. The prose occasionally drifts into authorial summary: "She understood now why the role required…" explains the premise rather than letting action reveal it. No dialogue present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and figurative language ("sentinel watching over the hush," "pane of hush") mostly lands without muddle. Two issues lower the score: paraphrase loops ("she had spent decades adjusting" / "she had spent a lifetime calculating") and template stems in the reflective passages ("She wanted…" / "She understood…"). The phrase "beautifully flawed" recurs three times without evolving meaning, reading as prompt-echo rather than organic motif. Mechanical construction: "Before the first clock struck its warning. Before Mira learned…" uses parallel structure without pressure payoff. No filter-verb stacks or major line-level opacity, but cumulative scaffold prevents entry to high band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The doomsday-clock-as-resonance-device and lullaby-across-time synthesis offers a fresh angle on apocalypse narratives. The "pane of hush" image and the lighthouse visible only during liminal hours show ingenuity. However, the "beautifully flawed guardian who lost a child" and the "some endings can only be softened" wisdom trend toward familiar archetypes and therapeutic-fable resolution. The transformation test is borderline: swap "clock adjuster" for "reality weaver" and the emotional arc holds unchanged. Risk-taking in structure (heavy reflection, lyric accumulation) is present but does not fully heighten stakes, as closure remains contemplative rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira appears early, her role frames the entire piece, and her action (adjusting the clock, singing) drives the ending. However, her choices do not create meaningful turns—she executes a pre-planned calculation without on-page decision friction. Middle beat: she positions the puppet head and begins adjustments (functional but not a reversal). Closure: she sings and the clock freezes (participates but as fulfillment, not choice under competing pressure). Swappable with "grief-stricken mother with technical skill" without altering structure. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but low causal pressure and high swappability −0.8 each.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The puppet head is introduced early (paragraph 4), handled in two beats (positioned on console, pressed to lips during lullaby), and returns transformed in the final image ("hollow eye socket now somehow full of stars"). The object charges the closure and embodies Mira's link to Elena, making it irreplaceable. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose cost—Mira's action would proceed identically without it; the puppet serves as emotional anchor rather than tactical necessity. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, but no causal pressure or cost connection −0.5 to −0.7 total.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Pane of hush" appears late (final third) as a metaphor for the transformed glass walls, described but not used as a constraint. It does not shape Mira's tactics or decisions; it functions as poetic setting description during the climax. The concept is vivid and title-linked, but ornamental in execution. One beat (closure scene description) +0.4, closure presence (descriptive, not causal) +0.3, but late arrival −0.7, ornamental use −0.8, swappable with "threshold" or "veil" −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Beautifully flawed" is mentioned three times as a label tied to theme: Mira's "beautifully flawed existence," the role requiring "someone beautifully flawed," and the gift as "beautifully flawed." The trait is asserted rather than shown constraining action or enabling a choice with visible tradeoff. No on-page moment demonstrates how her specific flaw (grief? imperfection?) shapes her method or forecloses an option. Present across the text +0.3, closure mention +0.4, but label-only use −0.9, no causal pressure −1.0, high swappability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" appears twice: in the framing ("vouchsafe nothing but purpose") and the penultimate paragraph ("vouchsafed by a woman"). The action is thematic rather than plot-driving—Mira's gift is vouchsafed (guaranteed, granted) across time, but the word does not anchor a specific beat or constrain her method. It enriches tone and ties to the nested-time concept, yet removing it would not alter story logic. Two mentions across framing and closure +0.6, thematic coherence +0.4, but no causal pressure −1.0, easily swappable with "given" or "transmitted" −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Nested patterns" is signaled early (paragraph 2: "learning the nested patterns—the way seconds folded into centuries") and shapes Mira's method conceptually. The mechanics appear again when she adjusts the clock ("patterns she had spent a lifetime calculating"). However, the method is told retrospectively rather than dramatized—we don't see the nested adjustments unfold or constrain her attempts. Early signal +0.6, two mentions +0.5, closure relevance (the adjustments enable the ending) +0.7, but summary-only execution −0.8, no on-page constraint or tactical friction −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The hidden lighthouse appears early (title echo, paragraph 3), its liminality ("visible only during liminal hours") and location ("spit of land on no chart") frame the stakes, and the lantern room is the sole setting for the climax. The lighthouse's beam "igniting inward" directly charges the closure image. The spiral stairs, obsidian clock, and glass walls supply concrete spatial anchors that pressure Mira's choices (she must reach the lantern room at dusk). Early signal +0.7, continuous presence across multiple beats +1.2, closure shaping (beam, glass transformation) +1.4, irreplaceable specificity +0.7, constrains timing and access +0.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Hush of time's final ripple" appears in paragraph 3 as atmospheric framing and recurs in the penultimate paragraph. The timeframe (dusk, the moment when the hands nearly converge) creates urgency, but no on-page clock tracks elapsed seconds or tightens Mira's window. The piece treats time as metaphysical span rather than tactical constraint—Mira completes her work without visible pressure from diminishing minutes. Early mention +0.4, closure reprise +0.5, thematic coherence +0.4, but no tactical constraint or live countdown −1.0, summary rather than dramatized urgency −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The desire to "whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes" is signaled by midpoint ("What drove her… was simpler and more desperate") and drives the climax (she sings the lullaby, achieving her goal). The motivation is anchored to Elena's memory and embodied through the puppet head. However, no on-page friction tests this want against a competing need or fear—Mira's choice to sing is unopposed. Middle signal +0.5, closure action (singing) +1.2, embodied through Elena/puppet +0.7, drives final beat +1.0, but no conflicted choice or visible cost tied to this specific desire −1.0, want vs. cost tension absent −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Bruised awe" coheres throughout: the sun "bled into the horizon, painting the glass in shades of amber and bruise," Mira's tears, the "beautifully flawed" refrain, the stars filling the hollow socket. Tone modulates appropriately—contemplative in reflection, hushed wonder in the climax—and charges the final image (the lighthouse beam, the children sleeping) without tipping into sentimentality. The piece sustains reverent melancholy under pressure. Present across all beats +1.2, modulates with scene pressure +0.8, closure charge (beam, stars, tears) +1.5, idiom consistency +0.6, pervasive without being static +0.8.</comment>
