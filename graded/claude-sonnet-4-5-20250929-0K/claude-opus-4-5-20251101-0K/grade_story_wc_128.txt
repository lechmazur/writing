<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's choices drive the story from curiosity through action to ceremony, with micro-choices about opening the envelope and tracking Rosa's legacy. However, her interior remains largely declarative rather than embodied under pressure; "cautious exuberance" is stated, not shown through contradictory impulses. Elias is functional but secondary, present mainly as recipient. The grandmother's voice intrudes as a thematic echo ("We rise on the shoulders of those the records forget") without friction or current cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal, with some Accumulative texture. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (cycle continues; Marina commits to ongoing work) with felt cost in the time and influence spent. The midpoint tightening—Elias's emotional response and Marina's decision to open her archives—narrows options and forecloses the simple return of the envelope. However, the ceremony montage and final two paragraphs summarize rather than dramatize the closure beat, muting the cost. The cost is legible (Marina's resources, Elias's catharsis) but told, not shown in a decisive moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rooftop library recurs with purpose: stars, spiral staircase, retractable glass, grandmother's ledgers. The setting constrains Marina's archive work and charges the final image ("breezy library under the open sky"). Harbor dock configurations in photographs tie past to present. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Marina's broker attention. The setting exceeds postcard description and participates in closure, meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: honoring invisible contributors. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marina finds verification in her grandmother's ledgers and commits influence. The turn is protagonist-driven but the escalation is mild; Marina encounters no friction (the archives cooperate, Elias accepts, the commission agrees). The ceremony summarizes the payoff rather than dramatizing a cost-laden choice. No visible price (opportunity, resource, social credit) alters later tactics. Cost is conceptual (inherited obligation) but not felt on the page in a climactic beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of invisible labor and inherited obligation emerges organically through action and archive work. The final image (Marina compiling the next list under stars) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, the grandmother's direct thematic statement ("We rise on the shoulders...") is an on-page echo, and "the cycle doesn't work if we wait to be asked" in the final third borders on articulating thesis. The cycle metaphor recurs with reweighting but is occasionally explicit. No false equivalence or sentimentality; ambiguity is present in Marina's "uncertain good."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV held cleanly; Marina's perceptual signature (broker's mind, whimsical attention to discrepancies) is consistent. Dialogue is brief, natural, and goal-driven ("My mother..."; "I have verification"). Psychic distance is stable. The grandmother's voice intrudes once as remembered speech without filter distortion. No head-hopping. Diction remains within Marina's register (shrewd, compassionate broker) with no therapy-speak in peak beats. Rhythm modulates appropriately from concert dispersal to archive intimacy to ceremony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Clarity is high; no spatial or temporal confusion. Information density is good in the archive and Elias beats. However, the final two paragraphs loop thematically: "the cycle continued" is restated via "passing it forward," "inherited, communal, eternal," and the stars/harbor/library reprise. The ceremony paragraph summarizes fifteen families and the unveiling without scene pressure. Sentence openings vary; no filter-verb stacks. Minor scaffold ("her considerable influence") and a paraphrase loop in the ending dock the score within the 6–7 band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Premise—misdirected envelope reveals forgotten laborers—is familiar (mistaken-mail meet-cute; social-justice reparation arc). The rooftop library and broker's archives offer fresh specificity, and Rosa Thorne's loading-system innovation is concrete. However, the arc is linear and conflict-free; no antagonist or friction tests Marina's commitment. The transformation test is marginal: names and setting could shift with minor edits. The cycle metaphor and "shoulders of those the records forget" echo common idiom. Solid craft, modest originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marina is present throughout; her shrewdness surfaces in recognizing the dock configuration and in calculating how to use her influence. She makes the key choice to open her archives and throw her weight behind Elias's cause. However, the "shrewd" trait is more told (broker's mind, considerable influence) than shown through a tactical negotiation or difficult trade-off. The broker role enables action but does not constrain with visible cost. Two beats: opening envelope, opening archives. Closure linkage: she compiles the next list, continuing the cycle.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The locket photo appears in the final third ("the locket photo of his mother pressed against his heart—he'd had it encased after Marina found matching images"). It is mentioned once, not handled across beats, and introduced late without prior setup. The photograph in the envelope drives the plot; the locket is a summary detail at the ceremony. Swappable with any keepsake. Late arrival and ornamental use cap the score; no mid-scene development or reweighted reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Cycles of compassion" is the thematic spine and grandmother's teaching. It shapes Marina's decision to search for Elias and to open the archives ("the cycle doesn't work if we wait to be asked"). The cycle recurs in the final image (Marina compiling the next list). However, the concept is more thematic resonance than tactical constraint; it does not create on-page friction or a difficult trade-off. Present early, developed in middle choice, echoed at closure, but the pressure is conceptual rather than scene-driven cost. Solid thematic integration without dramatic escalation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Whimsically attentive" is signaled early (postman's error "whimsically attentive to similarity but blind to crucial difference") and Marina's nature ("her tendency to notice small discrepancies and follow them to unexpected places") enables the archive work. The trait drives her pause over the envelope and her tracking of descendants. However, no visible cost or constraint: the trait is purely enabling, never a liability or source of friction. Two beats: noticing the misdirection, tracking discrepancies in records. Functional but lacks demonstrated trade-off or on-page price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Initiate" appears on-page: "The next morning, she initiated her search." The action triggers the meeting with Elias and the archive revelation, redefining options. However, the verb is brief and functional; the escalation comes from the search results, not the initiation itself. The story would fracture without Marina's decision to act, but the action is more pivot than pressure point. Present, causal, and central to the turn, but not charged with difficulty or cost in the initiating moment. Essential but not irreplaceable in phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mistaken address is the inciting incident, signaled in paragraph four and sustained: Marina pauses over it, it delivers the photograph, the misdirection brings her to Elias ("47 Anchor Lane—her address was 47 Anchor Row"). The friendship kindles from this error: "What began as a corrected envelope became something larger. The friendship kindled by mistaken address deepened into shared purpose." The method recurs and is causally indispensable; no other element could replace it without rewriting the entire chain. Three gates met; causal pressure high; closure participation explicit.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "breezy library under stars" appears in the opening (rooftop library, retractable glass ceiling, canopy of stars) and recurs as the Thursday meeting place and the final image ("in the breezy library under the open sky, Marina Voss began compiling her next list"). The setting supplies the archives (grandmother's ledgers) that enable verification and the repeated spatial anchor for the friendship. It constrains (rooftop access, archive location) and charges the closure image. Present in three beats; irreplaceable for the grandmother's legacy and the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"After the symphony ends" is stated twice: opening ("The last notes...dissolved") and the Thursday meetings ("Every Thursday evening after the harbor symphony ended"). The timeframe anchors the story's rhythm but does not create urgency or tighten decisions; months pass in summary ("September evening"). No ticking clock or pressure from elapsed time. The timeframe is a recurring motif (concert-goers, symphony playing Rosa's piece at the ceremony) but ornamental rather than tactical. Present, coherent, but does not constrain choices or alter moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To uplift silent contributors" is Marina's explicit motivation, rooted in her grandmother's teaching and dramatized through the search, archive opening, and ceremony. The desire faces mild friction in the historical society's prior rejections (told) but no on-page conflict over resources, time, or social cost. Marina's "uncertain good" and "cautious exuberance" suggest internal ambivalence, but the story does not dramatize a moment where this want conflicts with another need. Two beats: decision to search, decision to open archives. Closure participation: compiling the next list. Motivation is clear and consistent; cost is conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is named once in the final third ("the cautious exuberance that came with doing uncertain good"). The opening tone is contemplative (stars, harbor symphony); the archive and Elias beats are warm and purposeful; the ceremony is celebratory. The tone is coherent but does not modulate sharply under pressure or charge the final image with ambivalence. The phrase itself arrives late and is told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. Tonally consistent but not dynamically charged; single mood with a late label.</comment>
