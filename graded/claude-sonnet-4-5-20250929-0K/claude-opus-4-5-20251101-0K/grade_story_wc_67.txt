<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's internal state is embodied through action (grinding charcoal, donning the mask) and her contradictory impulses—wanting to crystallize grief while understanding its impermanence—act simultaneously in scene. The grandmother's teaching about partial portraits reveals character through worldview, and Marina's final choice to continue the work demonstrates earned endurance with visible cost (sitting in the empty chair). Minor slip: the interiority occasionally edges toward elevated retrospection ("somber marvel of standing at the threshold") that slightly softens the immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marina accepts the inheritance and re-animates the chair, foreclosing any path away from grief work with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density (ash mixing, mask warming, vanishing point pulsing) and the final rocking restores presence through pattern. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two (Marina, gallery, grandmother's death). One meaningful deepening occurs when Marina dons the mask and the gallery transforms, reweighting her understanding of the work's purpose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mask's sharp edges "smoothed only where the wearer's skin would touch" and the gallery's impossible perspective constrain Marina's choices—she must wear the mask to see the gallery's true function, and the vanishing point physically receives the ashes. The worktable, urn, mortar, and rocking chair are tactilely engaged across multiple beats. Sensory hierarchy reflects Marina's dual focus: visual (dust motes, paintings breathing) and tactile (grinding, powder between fingers) details anchor the ritual's physical demands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Marina can perform the scattering and accept the inheritance—is signaled early and tightens when she lifts the mask. Agency is renunciation with cost: she cannot keep the emotion crystallized, accepts ephemerality, and commits to the work ("Tomorrow she would open the gallery again"). The grinding and scattering sequence narrows options through embodied action. One clear tightening: donning the mask transforms her perception and commits her to the role with no retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the gallery's dual lesson (incomplete information allows healing; everything vanishes into perspective) enacted in Marina's ritual rather than stated. The mask's fragmented vision, partial charcoal portraits, and vanishing point converge to answer the question of how to offer comfort honestly—through managed incompleteness that invites memory without overwhelming. The final rocking image reweights presence/absence without moralizing. "Mirage of safety" as concept charges the ending: hope without false promise becomes the only honest gift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with Marina's perceptual signature (charcoal artist noticing "shadow that revealed more than light"). Diction stays character-grounded except one brief elevation ("somber marvel"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tight during the grinding/scattering, pulling back slightly for the gallery's history, then intimate again at closure. The prose rhythms reflect Marina's state: short, precise sentences during ritual action, longer contemplative ones during reflection. No head-hopping; all knowledge remains Marina-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively ("She mixed... She stepped... The mask grew warm") and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "partial flowers, half-formed birds" describes the mask while seeding the incompleteness motif). Minor loop: "her grandmother had taught her" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs. One register slip: "somber marvel" and "crystallize this fleeting emotion" edge slightly above Marina's otherwise grounded voice. No template cadence; figurative language (vanishing point pulsing "like a heartbeat remembered") remains coherent and spaced.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief ritual with visual-art perspective theory (vanishing point as literal/metaphorical convergence) feels specific and non-obvious. The partial-portrait philosophy transforms the familiar grief-work premise through concrete craft detail. Risk: the gallery's impossible geometry could feel gimmicky, but it's anchored by the scattering practice and Marina's inheritance dilemma. Slight hedging in the "mirage of safety" frame—"persistent hope" carefully avoids claiming too much—keeps the piece from bold metaphysical commitment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marina (charcoal portrait ash scatterer) drives all key turns: lifting the mask, grinding the ash blend, donning the mask (which transforms her perception), scattering the ashes, and re-animating the chair. Her decisions alter tactics (she moves from observer to ritual participant to inheritor-in-practice) and the closure hinges on her choice to continue the work. Present in setup, middle action, and closure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mask appears in three beats: introduction at the worktable (tactile detail of smoothed edges), donning it (transforms gallery perception), and removal beside the empty urn (closure frame). Its fragmented construction from shards mirrors the partial-portrait philosophy and its eyeholes literally enact incomplete vision. The mask enables Marina's perceptual shift and charges the middle turn. Strong integration but slightly swappable for another ritual garment without breaking core logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Mirage of safety" is named once and operates as the gallery's gift to visitors: "not actual peace, but the persistent hope of it." It shapes Marina's understanding of her role (honest comfort without false promises) and the ending's refusal to claim reunion. The concept pressures her ritual choices—she must scatter without claiming knowledge she doesn't possess—but the mechanics remain implicit rather than tested through a conflicting option on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" constrains multiple on-page actions: Marina's partial charcoal portraits reveal "only what the grieving could bear to see," her grandmother scattered "always with that same careful honesty," and Marina's own scattering carries forward this practice of managed disclosure. The attribute costs Marina ease (she cannot offer false reunion) and directs her method. Visible in setup (teaching), development (ash-mixing reflection), and closure (tomorrow's work promise).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Powdering/grinding the charcoal-and-ash blend is the story's hinge action: it occupies the longest single beat, enacts the ritual's mixing principle ("ash to ash"), and produces the physical medium for the scattering. Marina's tactile work ("between her fingers until she couldn't distinguish one from the other") demonstrates the incompleteness teaching and the action's completion enables the climax. Removing this action would collapse the ritual's causality and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Through incomplete information" governs the partial-portrait philosophy (showing fragments so mourners "fill in the rest with their own memories") and is enacted in Marina's ritual: she scatters without promising reunion, offers hope without certainty. The method shapes her craft choices and the gallery's design (vanishing point as infinite recession, not destination). Signaled early and present at closure, though the mechanics are more philosophical stance than tested procedure under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The vanishing point gallery supplies the story's core constraint and resource: its impossible perspective teaches ephemerality, its threshold receives the ashes, and its paintings watch Marina through the mask's vision. The space's geometry (narrow corridor, infinite recession) physically limits and enables the ritual. The gallery transforms when Marina dons the mask (middle pressure) and "pulses" at climax, then frames closure as Marina commits to reopening it. The setting is indispensable—removing it breaks all logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The rocking chair's cessation opens the story ("finally slowed to a stop") and its re-animation closes it ("set it moving again"), creating a clear before/after frame. The timeframe pressures Marina's acceptance: the chair is empty now, demanding she fill the role. The frame charges the ending image with felt cost (presence/absence). However, the middle ritual sequence doesn't track time urgently—Marina could perform these steps faster or slower without altering outcomes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marina's desire "to crystallize this fleeting emotion" is dramatized on the page: she wants to hold the "somber marvel" but recognizes "emotions couldn't be kept." This friction drives her choice to perform the scattering (enacting rather than freezing grief) and accept the role (ongoing ritual rather than preserved moment). The want conflicts with the gallery's lesson (everything vanishes) and the cost is her relinquishing permanence. Present in setup reflection, tested in scattering action, resolved in closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Somber marvel" coheres across the piece: grief-weight paired with awe at the gallery's impossible geometry and the ritual's transformative power. Tone modulates appropriately—heavier during the opening stillness, charged during the mask-vision, quiet-resonant at closure. The diction ("patient understanding," "breathless moment," "rhythm filling the silence") maintains tonal consistency. The final rocking beat sustains somber marvel without tipping into sentimentality, charging the image of presence-through-absence.</comment>
