<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The line walker's motivation is clear and her choices drive the plot, but interiority remains somewhat generic ("strangely honest for someone in my profession" tells rather than embodies). The keeper provides immediate pressure and his emotional stakes (grandmother's voice, daughter's laugh) feel concrete. However, the prophet's confrontation lacks dramatic friction—his rage is declared but never truly threatens her work, and the final exchange resolves too easily without forcing a meaningful trade-off or visible cost to her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who, where, temporal frame). The drive lens reads as Causal: the line walker's decision to use the kinetic parapet enables the conjured clearing, which protects the voices from the prophet's fire. Closure lands on the page with the consecration complete and the murmuring preserved—a Decisive Change with felt cost (she walks away having preserved wisdom, the keeper weeps with relief). One escalation point (descent to the parapet, channeling voices, confrontation) tightens options. The cost is somewhat diffuse: she completes her mission successfully, but the story does not clearly foreclose a path or exact a visible price beyond effort expended.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion is vividly rendered (thousand silk panels, ancestors' final breaths woven in) and the kinetic parapet beneath the dunes supplies a concrete infrastructure that enables the climactic move. Spatial choreography is clear across pavilion, dunes, and underground engine room. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than constraint—the line walker encounters no access difficulty, no resistance from the machinery, no environmental cost that alters her tactics. The micro-setting (obsidian mask, peripheral awareness) charges her perception but does not force a choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early: preserve ancestral wisdom before the prophet silences it. The descent to the parapet and overnight work meaningfully tighten pressure, and the confrontation with the prophet tests commitment. However, escalation lacks friction—no tool breaks, no clearing falters, no moment where success hangs in doubt. The prophet's followers hesitate but never act, deflating the declared threat. The consecration completes without visible cost or trade-off; the line walker departs unscathed, mission fulfilled. A more decisive constraint or sacrifice during the ritual would lift this into high-7s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between preservation and erasure, tradition and certainty. The half-mask (one eye on past, one on present) and the line walker's role as boundary-crosser resonate without over-explanation. The final image—voices drifting in the invisible sanctuary, waiting for wise ears—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of how wisdom survives hostile doctrine. Minor slip: "strangely honest" and the keeper's dialogue edge toward thematic statement ("walk the lines between worlds"), and the closing paragraph's "next dying song" risks abstract uplift rather than grounded particularity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on the line walker; perceptual signature (peripheral awareness, sensing edges) is distinct. Narrative distance is consistent, and diction stays within an elevated but character-appropriate register. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the keeper's lines carry subtext (grief, hope), though the prophet's exchange feels slightly generic ("You walk lines that should not be crossed"). Filter verbs ("extending her peripheral awareness," "understood") appear but do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping or tense breaks. Minor template cadence in expository beats ("This was why she had come," "This was her gift") slightly flattens momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high—nearly every line advances character, world, or pressure. Clarity and concision are strong; no paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Minor elevations in diction ("kinetic parapet," "consecrate," "whisperfield calm") fit the established voice without jarring. One small simultaneity slip: "spoke the old words while the prophet's followers hesitated" compresses timeline slightly, but does not obscure causality. Zero pronoun ambiguity; spatial choreography tracks across all moves.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—magical infrastructure preserving cultural memory against dogmatic erasure—offers a fresh synthesis of fantasy mechanism and thematic weight. The kinetic parapet and conjured clearings feel specific rather than generic. However, the emotional arc follows a familiar chosen-one competence path: the line walker arrives, completes her mission without meaningful friction, and departs. The prophet's threat deflates on contact. Risk-taking is present in the world-building but not in the protagonist's journey; she encounters no genuine surprise or cost that transforms her understanding. A more specific complication or moral calculus would lift originality into the 8-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The half-masked line walker's choices drive every major turn: she decides to descend to the parapet, channels the murmurs through the night, and completes the consecration that seals the clearing. She is present in or shapes the opening (arrival at pavilion), middle (descent and overnight work), and closure (confrontation and consecration). Her peripheral awareness and mask are tied to her method and role. Without this exact character, the story's premise and closure collapse. The mask's symbolic dual-sight function is established early and motivates her boundary-walking role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet appears in setup (detected beneath dunes via peripheral awareness), development (she descends to the engine room and works through the night using its machinery to create the clearing), and closure (the final paragraph confirms it guards the voices "until the world itself forgot how to listen"). It is irreplaceable: without the parapet's mechanism, no conjured clearing can be made. However, the parapet is passive infrastructure—she encounters no resistance, no cost of activation, no trade-off in using it. A second distinct beat where its properties constrain her choice would push this higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Conjured clearings shape the central tactic: the line walker's entire mission is to create one to preserve the murmurs. The concept is introduced early (she has "used such clearings before"), governs the middle action (channeling voices into the newly conjured clearing), and appears at closure (she seals it via consecration). Stakes hinge on it: without the clearing, the voices burn. However, the mechanics remain abstract—no cost, failure risk, or constraint on its creation is dramatized. It is essential but not tested.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Strangely honest" is declared once in dialogue ("I am strangely honest for someone in my profession. I cannot promise salvation. But I can promise to try.") and has no causal impact. It does not constrain a choice, create friction, or return at closure. The line walker's actions throughout read as competent and mission-focused, not as tests of honesty versus deception. The trait is ornamental label-speak rather than embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consecration is the climactic action that seals the clearing and links it eternally to the pavilion. It appears at closure, resolves the dominant stake, and is irreplaceable—without it, the clearing remains unprotected. Setup exists (she knows the ritual), and the act itself is dramatized on the page ("began to consecrate the ground," "spoke the old words"). However, the ritual completes without friction, cost, or risk; no price is paid, no constraint overcome. A visible trade-off during the consecration would elevate this to the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Peripheral awareness is signaled early ("extending her peripheral awareness through the pavilion's boundaries") and enables the key detection (kinetic parapet beneath dunes) and the overnight work (guiding whispers into the clearing "through peripheral awareness"). It shapes two distinct beats and is tied to her identity as a line walker. However, the method's mechanics remain abstract—no cost, fatigue, or limit is dramatized. It functions as a given ability rather than a constrained resource that alters tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion frames the story (opening arrival, closing departure), supplies the central stake (silk panels hold ancestors' voices), and is the site of the final confrontation. The keeper's emotional anchors (grandmother's voice in the third panel, daughter's laugh in the canopy) make it concrete. The pavilion's voices are the object being saved. However, it does not constrain the line walker's choices—she leaves it to work underground, and the prophet's threat to burn it is deflected off-page. It is essential but passive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "three days after the prophet" anchors the story's urgency and is referenced at closure ("When dawn approached"). The overnight work creates a visible clock that compresses the middle action. However, the three-day gap is not leveraged—no ticking countdown, no escalating threat from the prophet's doctrine during those days. Time shapes one beat (the night's work) but does not tighten multiple decisions or force trade-offs. Present and functional, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve ancestral wisdom drives every choice: her arrival, descent, overnight channeling, and final consecration. It is dramatized through the keeper's grief and her willingness to work through the night. The motivation is tested at closure when the prophet confronts her, though the test lacks friction. Cost is implied (effort, risk of confrontation) but not made visible—she succeeds fully without sacrifice. The motivation is essential and coherent but not conflicted or costly enough to reach the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Whisperfield calm" appears once, in the penultimate paragraph, to describe the aftermath of her work. Tone throughout reads as measured, elevated, and contemplative, consistent with the phrase. However, the tone does not modulate meaningfully with pressure—the descent, overnight work, and confrontation maintain the same narrative distance and diction as the reflective opening. The tone is coherent but static, and its single late mention does not recharge the closure image or constrain prior choices.</comment>
