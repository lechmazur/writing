<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore creativity is clear and her choice to release the stardust is decisive, but her internal life remains somewhat abstract. The "hearing unspoken words" trait functions mainly as atmospheric flavor rather than creating genuine internal contradiction or embodied conflict. Her decision to rest beneath the archway feels more like a poetic flourish than an earned character choice with visible cost. The piece avoids therapy-speak but leans toward label-only interiority ("moonstruck dreamer") without sufficient micro-choices under pressure to ground her particular psychology.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear Causal lens: Elara climbs, finds the instrument, understands its function, releases the stardust, and rests. Orientation anchors arrive early (mountain peak, archway, aurora). The closure—releasing the stardust and witnessing its return—constitutes a Decisive Change with visible consequences (valley reawakening). However, the cost feels diluted: Elara's rest and peace seem more reward than price, and the instrument's crumbling reads as convenient rather than a trade-off she must navigate. The seven-night climb is mentioned but not dramatized, weakening escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway is vivid and purposeful, anchoring the setting early and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective—frost, tarnished brass, shimmering trails—and filtered through Elara's perception. The archway "existed before anyone thought to mark time" creates atmospheric specificity, though the valley below remains somewhat generic. The astronomical instrument constrains Elara's action (she must find and manipulate it), meeting the micro-setting test for choice participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Elara's discovery of the instrument and her choice to turn the dial constitute one meaningful tightening. However, the escalation is thin: she faces no real obstacles, the release mechanism is simply found and turned, and the consequences (valley reawakening) occur off-page. The cost is conceptual (the astronomer's fear absolved, the instrument crumbles) rather than a trade-off Elara must navigate with visible personal price. No secondary pressure complicates her goal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the stardust conceit: creativity as cosmic inheritance, hoarding versus release, fear calcifying into constraint. The piece avoids moralizing and the final image—"its path untraced, its stardust free"—offers a resonant answer without stating a thesis. The astronomer's backstory (fear of fading brilliance) deepens the thematic question. Minor slip: "moonstruck dreamer no more alone in her reaching" tilts toward thematic summary rather than pure image, though it remains tied to particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Voice carries a lyric, fairy-tale register—"curtains of green and violet light," "songs that died in throats"—that suits the fantastical premise. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices unspoken words, colors unnamed, melodies unhummed. Minor register drift: phrases like "capacity to dream" and "celestial memory" edge toward abstraction that feels slightly external to the established voice. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The prose remains distinct and purposeful across emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Information density is high in the instrument discovery beat. Minor scaffold: "She knew what festered in that valley—creativity trapped like birds in amber, songs that died in throats, paintings that never escaped their imagined canvases" is a list-like construction that pauses momentum. "Remembered stardust" repeats across multiple paragraphs without added meaning. Figurative language is controlled but occasionally dense ("calcified into this machine, his desperation crystallized into brass and glass"). No major loops or template cadence; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "stardust as creativity" metaphor is familiar but executed with specific grounding—the astronomical instrument, the aurora, the valley's collective loss. The astronomer's backstory (stealing to avoid his own fading brilliance) adds psychological specificity. However, the core arc—discover magical object, release trapped essence, restore community—follows a recognizable template without a sharp transformative turn. The "unspoken words" trait and the archway "outside time" offer lyric texture but don't fundamentally alter the expected shape. Risk-taking is modest; the piece prioritizes poetic execution over structural surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara as "moonstruck dreamer" is established early and her climb/release decision drives the plot. She appears in setup, middle (instrument manipulation), and ending (rest and descent decision). However, her choices feel somewhat predetermined by the premise rather than constrained by competing impulses. The "dreamer" label does work—it motivates her climb and frames the village's view—but she lacks a visible cost or trade-off tied specifically to this trait. Present across all three gates; causal role in two beats (climb, release); moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The astronomical instrument is introduced early, handled in the discovery beat, manipulated (dial turned) in the climax, and crumbles in the ending. It constrains Elara's action (she must find and operate it) and its release mechanism is the pivot for the stardust's return. The instrument's backstory (astronomer's fear) charges its meaning. Present in setup, middle, and closure; drives two distinct beats (discovery, release); high irreplaceability (the story's logic depends on this exact object). The crumbling adds symbolic weight but the cost is the astronomer's, not Elara's.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Remembered stardust" as cosmic creativity is the story's conceptual engine. It shapes Elara's goal (release it) and the valley's condition (deprived of it). The concept is seeded early, explained at the midpoint, and enacted at the climax. However, its mechanics are more told than shown—we don't see Elara wrestle with how stardust works or test competing theories. It changes options (release versus hoard) but the cost is abstract. Present in all three gates; drives the climax; moderate causal pressure; some swappability (could be "creative essence" or similar).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Hears unspoken words" is established in the opening paragraph and motivates Elara's understanding of the valley's plight. She hears the instrument's "unuttered truths" at the climax. However, the trait never constrains a choice or imposes a visible cost—it functions as a passive gift rather than a doubleedged ability. Setup present; development weak (no middle choice enabled/constrained); closure participation minimal (she hears the instrument but this doesn't alter her action). Ornamental use; high swappability (empathy or insight could replace it).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Rest" as major action appears in the ending: "Elara allowed herself to rest." It follows the stardust release and precedes her descent. The rest is framed as peace after exertion, and she dreams of cosmic creation. However, the rest doesn't drive a turn—it's a pause, not a pivot. The story could function with "descended immediately" with minor edits. Setup absent (rest isn't foreshadowed); development absent; closure participation present but passive. Functional but replaceable; no visible cost tied to resting versus descending immediately.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Tracing the path of falling stars" is the method by which Elara releases the stardust: "She began by tracing the path of falling stars through the instrument's lens." This action is signaled, executed on the page, and leads directly to the release mechanism. The method is specific to the instrument's function. Setup implied (instrument collects star-paths); development present (tracing action); closure linkage strong (method enables climax). One distinct beat; moderate causal pressure; some swappability (could be "observing" or "following" without major structural change).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "aurora-lit archway" is introduced in paragraph two, provides the setting for the instrument discovery and release, and frames the ending ("the aurora had faded to whispers of green"). The archway "existed before anyone thought to mark time," linking to the "unwritten calendar." It pressures Elara's climb (she must reach it) and charges the final image. Setup early; development strong (contains key action); closure participation strong (final image anchored there). Drives two beats; high specificity; moderate irreplaceability (a peak shrine could substitute, though aurora + archway is a strong pairing).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across an unwritten calendar" appears as description of the archway ("beneath curtains of green and violet light that danced across an unwritten calendar") and thematically (archway "before anyone thought to mark time"). However, this timeframe element never constrains a choice or tightens tactics—it's atmospheric rather than functional. The seven-night climb is mentioned but not tracked on the page. Setup present as motif; development absent; closure absent. Ornamental use; no causal pressure; high swappability (timeless setting could be conveyed other ways).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To free trapped creativity" is Elara's stated motivation, signaled early: "Someone had stolen their stardust, and Elara meant to return it." This desire drives her climb, instrument discovery, and release action. The motivation is tested at the climax (turning the dial) and realized in the ending (valley reawakens). However, the motivation is never conflicted—she faces no temptation to hoard, no cost that makes her hesitate. Setup early; development present (drives middle and climax); closure strong. Two beats; causal pressure moderate; cost is abstract (village benefit, not personal trade-off).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Shadowed rapture" as tone is present in the lyric, elevated register and the final rest scene: "wrapped in the shadowed rapture of the aurora's embrace." The tone balances darkness (stolen creativity, astronomer's fear, frost and memory) with ecstasy (aurora blazing, cascade of silver and gold, dreams of nebulae). The tone modulates subtly across the climb, discovery, and release, then breathes at the ending. Setup established; development coherent; closure charged by the phrase itself. Tone supports pressure without overwhelming it. One-point reprise; moderate specificity; some register drift into abstraction weakens consistency.</comment>
