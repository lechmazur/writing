<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miriam's interiority is concrete and character-particular—her observation of dust patterns, her comfort with ghosts since childhood—but her choices are largely dictated by the ghost rather than internal conflict. The grandmother anecdote and career backstory provide texture, but the protagonist follows rather than struggles; her decision to take the mainspring feels inevitable without visible cost or competing impulse. Embodied emotion is present ("that familiar pull in her chest") but the lack of contradictory wants in the key moment limits characterization depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Miriam encounters the ghost, discovers the mainspring, learns Eleanor's story, and commits to remembering her name. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of Miriam sitting with "the weightless burden" reweights the premise with felt cost—she carries the responsibility of witnessing—but the cost remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized. Orientation is clear early; the single continuous scene with brief reflective anchors holds coherent pressure through to the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly rendered—peeling red paint, rusted turnstile, dust patterns—and the setting constrains Miriam's investigation (the hidden panel behind the baseboard). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional eye. The mainspring barrel functions as micro-setting, its weight and craftsmanship charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what the building hides and honoring Eleanor's legacy—is signaled early and tightens when the ghost reveals the insurance investigators' suspicion. Miriam's agency is decision (to deliver the mainspring to the historical society), but the choice feels preordained; no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. The tightening from "assessing the elevator" to "salvaging Eleanor's memory" is meaningful but lacks a tactical trade-off or pressure that forces Miriam to renounce something on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—witnessing hidden histories, the unseen labor of marginalized creators—emerges organically through Eleanor's story and Miriam's role as the one "willing to look up." "Cracks in the facade" recurs with purposeful reweighting: literal architectural flaws become metaphors for systemic erasure. The final image of "the weightless burden" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the ghost's sad eyes and the insurance investigators' refusal to believe "a circus girl." No thesis statement mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Miriam notices dust accumulation patterns, ceiling strata, the seam in the baseboard—details filtered through her technician's lens. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("voices like wind through paper," "geological strata"). The ghost's dialogue feels natural and purposeful, advancing plot through revelation. Psychic distance modulates intentionally during the flashback to Miriam's grandmother. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is clean with varied rhythm and strong information density. "The weight of it surprised her, substantial yet somehow carrying its own lightness, a weightless burden of memory and craft" threads motif without redundancy. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Minor softness: "remarkable detailed" could tighten to "detailed," and "the boundary between the two" slightly hedges. The phrase "skillfully observant" in paragraph four reads as light tell rather than embodied observation, but the closure beat is artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ghost-technician premise is familiar, but the specific synthesis—dust patterns as forensic evidence, the horologist's mainspring as both literal artifact and symbol of erased female craft—feels purposeful. The circus setting and Eleanor's story add texture, though the insurance-investigator suspicion is sketched rather than dramatized. The ending avoids safety-hedging and commits to its premise. Transformation is present but incremental; the emotional arc could work with different names and a different hidden object, suggesting mid-range freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Miriam is present throughout and her professional skills (reading dust, finding the hidden panel) enable the discovery. Her choice to deliver the mainspring to the historical society is the story's closure action. However, she is reactive—the ghost directs her to the artifact and names the destination—limiting agency. The character is seeded early, drives two beats (investigation, decision), and shapes closure, but lacks a choice that narrows live options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mainspring barrel is discovered mid-story, handled physically ("lifted carefully," "wrapped in her jacket"), and returns in the final image where Miriam sits with its weight. Its craftsmanship and Eleanor's authorship drive the thematic stakes. The object is irreplaceable—its specific history matters—and it charges the closure image ("the weightless burden"). Present in three beats (discovery, wrapping, final reflection) with causal and thematic pressure. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Cracks in the facade" appears literally (Miriam's work on building flaws) and metaphorically (the insurance investigators' dismissal of Eleanor). The concept is seeded early ("Cracks in facades, both literal and otherwise") and reweighted at closure via the ghost's revelation. It shapes Miriam's perception and thematic stance but does not directly constrain a middle choice or alter tactics. Lyric resonance is clear; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Skillfully observant" is labeled in paragraph four ("remained still, skillfully observant") and demonstrated through dust-pattern analysis and finding the seam. However, the trait does not constrain a choice or impose a visible tradeoff; Miriam's observation is purely enabling. The attribute is present and functional but replaceable—"perceptive" or "methodical" would serve equally well. No cost tied to the skill.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Engage" structures the story's arc: Miriam moves from assessing the elevator (detached observation) to deciding to honor Eleanor's name (active engagement). The shift is explicit ("She would engage with this history, not simply observe it") and drives the closure choice. Two beats depend on this action (the decision moment, the final commitment to call the historical society). The verb is thematically charged and shapes the ending, though the mechanics of engagement could be more specific.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dust-pattern analysis is seeded early ("analyzing dust accumulation patterns before she'd even unpacked her tools") and demonstrates Miriam's expertise, revealing that someone has disturbed the elevator doors. The method enables the investigation but does not constrain later tactics or shape the closure—once the ghost appears, dust analysis is superseded. Functional in one beat; present but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office provides vivid texture (peeling red paint, rusted turnstile, phantom calliope music) and supplies the hidden panel where the mainspring is concealed. The setting's history—condemned since 1987, site of a fire—directly informs Eleanor's tragedy and Miriam's stakes. Spatial details (baseboard seam, elevator shaft) enable key actions. The setting is irreplaceable; no generic abandoned building would carry the circus craft and fire narrative. Present across all three gates with causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The fluorescent buzz frames the ghost's appearance: "When the overhead fluorescent buzz died off, the silence that followed was absolute. That was when she saw him." The timeframe is seeded early (buzzing for three hours) and creates the threshold moment for the supernatural encounter. It returns at the ghost's departure ("flickered back on"). The element provides atmospheric pressure and marks a narrative hinge, but does not constrain Miriam's choices or tighten decisions under a clock. Lyric function with moderate integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation "to discover what ceilings hide" is seeded explicitly ("that familiar pull in her chest...that need to discover what ceilings hide") and demonstrated through her career choice and final gesture (looking up at the ceiling). The desire drives her acceptance of the job and her decision to pursue Eleanor's story, but it is not dramatized as conflicted—no friction between this want and a competing cost or fear. Thematic through-line is clear; dramatized friction is limited.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Weightless burden" is introduced late but purposefully: the mainspring is "substantial yet somehow carrying its own lightness, a weightless burden of memory and craft," then returns in the final paragraph ("the weightless burden of being the one who sees"). The tone encapsulates the story's emotional calculus—responsibility without oppression—and charges the closure image. The phrase is specific and irreplaceable, modulating from literal (the object's paradoxical weight) to thematic (Miriam's witness role). Strong lyric integration despite late first appearance.</comment>
