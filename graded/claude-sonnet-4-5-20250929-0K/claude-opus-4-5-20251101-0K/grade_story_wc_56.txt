<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and particular—her seven-year quest to understand deception shows embodied through her handling of the sundial and her reaction to discovering contraband documentation. The final letter earns her shift from seeker to witness, foreclosing the path of restoring her father's legend with visible cost. Minor slip: the phrase "serene upheaval" appears as a label for her emotional state rather than fully dramatized contradiction, though the surrounding action supports it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren retrieves the evidence, reads the letter, and faces the decision of what to do with truth, crystallizing options with felt cost. The piece operates under a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage—coordinates lead to evidence, evidence reframes her father's mythology, the letter reconfigures her inheritance as the ability to see clearly. The barge's forward momentum into "canals she had never traveled" charges the final image with undeniable pressure and unresolved consequence. One meaningful tightening (discovery narrows her understanding) is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The twilight canal setting constrains action—she must use her father's coordinates at the junction where four waterways meet, and retrieves the case by hand from the water. The pocket sundial functions as micro-setting, returning dark and useless in the final beat to reweight the inheritance motif. Sensory hierarchy reflects her investigative focus: tarnished brass, corroded case, amber light swallowed by water. The barge's drift and engine cut create spatial rhythm that supports the accumulative pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding her father's architecture of lies—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful reversal: she arrives seeking a treasure site and discovers a criminal drop point, which narrows her options to expose, bury, or carry the truth forward. The discovery of the letter forces a trade-off with visible cost: clarity means witnessing the collapse of everything she loved. Agency is renunciation and endurance with on-page consequence. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens without requiring multiple reversals at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—truth as inheritance and burden—emerges through concrete particulars: the useless sundial that measures only absence, the waterproof case heavy with documentation, the canal junction where twilight made everything "beautiful and indistinct." The father's letter offers a resonant answer to the central question (why men build lies) without stating a moral: "the truth offers no shelter." The final image of the barge moving into untraveled canals reweights prior material, leaving Maren's choice open with undeniable thematic pressure. No thematic echo orSermonizingEnd penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; Maren's perceptual signature favors architectural and structural metaphors ("foundations of fabricated stone," "hollow spaces in narratives"). Diction remains within her investigative lens with purposeful elevation ("serene upheaval," "hindsight clarity") that fits a legend seeker's vocabulary. Minor slip: the phrase "by training instincts over years of seeking" reads slightly expository in rhythm, though it advances causality. No head-hopping; no dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Time reveals what intention conceals" primes both the sundial motif and thematic question). Clarity remains strong through the retrieval sequence. Two minor frictions: "serene upheaval" and "thoughtfully clear" appear as stock intensifiers in the final third without full dramatization, and the phrase "hindsight clarity was a cruel gift, but it was clarity nonetheless" loops conceptually. These artifacts approach but do not obscure the closure image. No Template-cadence or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise—discovering a parent's criminal past hidden as legend—is familiar but transformed through specific detail: the silent morning radio frequencies used for smuggling coordinates, the canal junction as drop point rather than treasure site. The sundial motif (useless in practical sense, dark at closure) provides a fresh inflection on inheritance. The piece commits to its investigative frame without retreat. Transformation test passes: the emotional arc would not work with generic "truth-seeker finds family secret" scaffolding due to the legend-architecture specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's identity as errant legend seeker frames expectation in the opening and her training enables the discovery—she has learned to "feel the hollow spaces in narratives." Her choice at closure (expose, bury, or carry forward) is deferred but the decision space is crystallized with cost. Present in setup, drives the salvage beat, and shapes the ending stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pocket sundial appears in three beats: initial handling with inscription reading, implicit presence during discovery (she kneels with it in her palm), and final beat where it "showed nothing now, its face dark, measuring only absence." The inscription "Time reveals what intention conceals" primes the thematic question. The final reprise reweights the inheritance motif. Scores in the 6-band due to strong setup/payoff but limited middle development—it does not constrain a mid-story choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Hindsight clarity shapes stakes directly: "hindsight clarity was a cruel gift, but it was clarity nonetheless" and the entire discovery reframes her seven-year quest. The concept enables her to see the "hollow spaces in narratives" and understand the criminal coordinates. It appears explicitly at the closure decision point ("the ability to see clearly, even when clarity meant witnessing the collapse"). Causal role in one major beat with purposeful early-final reprise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully clear" appears as a label in the phrase "serene upheaval wash through her, that strange calm that comes when the world rearranges itself into something thoughtfully clear." It describes her state during discovery but does not constrain an on-page action with cost—she proceeds with the salvage regardless. The trait is consistent with her investigative training but remains more thematic accent than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Salvage is the central physical action: Maren retrieves the chain, pulls up the waterproof case hand over hand, and opens the documentation that redefines her father's legend as criminal evidence. The action drives the major turn (treasure site → drop point) and enables the closure unit (reading the letter, facing the decision). Present across setup (coordinates indicate the chain), the middle beat (retrieval), and directly shapes the ending. Removing salvage would eliminate the story's causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"By training instincts over years of seeking" is signaled explicitly and its mechanics matter: she has learned to "feel the hollow spaces in narratives" and recognize "places where truth had been removed." This trained perception enables her to understand the coordinates and the architecture of her father's lies. The method frames her capability in the opening third and pays off in the discovery beat, though it does not constrain a mid-story choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The twilight barge canal is present throughout and pressures choices: she must navigate to "the junction where four waterways met beneath a crumbling bridge," the narrowing canal between hollow warehouses mirrors her narrowing understanding, and the water itself supplies the retrieval resource (chain beneath the surface). The barge's drift and engine cut create urgency. The canal's twilight ambiguity ("made everything beautiful and indistinct") charges the thematic question. Micro-setting (bow, deck, water) alters tactics in the salvage beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"By the silence of morning radio" appears once as the moment of realization: "By the silence of morning radio, she had finally understood" when the tower keeper explained her father's smuggling transmissions during dead frequencies. This timeframe enables the causal turn but does not tighten on-page decisions—the story unfolds in twilight, not morning, and no live clock pressures her choices during the barge sequence. Functional setup without sustained presence or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the architecture of lies" is dramatized through seven years of chasing legends and surfaces explicitly in her reflection: "He had died believing his own mythology, and she had spent every year since trying to understand the architecture of lies he had built." This desire drives the journey to the canal coordinates and creates friction at closure—understanding means "witnessing the collapse of everything she had loved." The salvage action and final letter directly test this want against its cost. Present in setup, middle pressure, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" appears as explicit label ("she felt the serene upheaval wash through her") and is embodied through the barge's gliding momentum, the "strange calm" during discovery, and the final image of twilight holding her while she faces untraveled canals. Tone modulates with pressure—calm opening, tightening during retrieval, quiet crystallization at closure—and charges the final stance where she is "serene in its upheaval, clear in its shadows." The oxymoron is sustained through contrasting imagery (twilight beauty vs. criminal truth) rather than mere assertion.</comment>
