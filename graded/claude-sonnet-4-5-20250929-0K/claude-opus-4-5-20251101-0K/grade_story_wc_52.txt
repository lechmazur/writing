<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Marguerite's interiority is consistently embodied through her hands and the wood—"grief needed a container" lives in her palms and gouges. Her motivation to teach others to carve crystallizes loss into action with visible cost (transforming Viktor's studio, the recurring lions). Internal contradiction surfaces in "here and gone, she thought" threading through her choices, and the final acceptance "perhaps this was enough" feels earned by the accumulation of concrete micro-choices. The lack of a second on-page character limits relational pressure, but solitary POV is executed cleanly with embodied emotion and no therapy-speak in peak beats.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words (loft, skylight, kettle, Viktor's studio-turned-workshop). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered reflections and the recurring lion motif, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Marguerite's peace is crystallized—"perhaps this was enough"—with visible cost (the life she no longer has with Viktor). The tightening is a single deepening rather than a causal reversal, fitting the lens. However, the closure image lacks a sharp final price or foreclosed option made undeniable on the page; the cost is largely retrospective rather than a visible forfeiture in the ending beat, preventing entry to higher bands.</comment>

<comment>The loft's tactile details—rain-beaded skylight, weathered brick, copper pipes, sawdust in corners—anchor every beat and filter through Marguerite's grief-work POV. The ash wood blank and smallest gouge constrain her carving choice on the page, and the kettle's rising whistle structures the present window. October's "rust and amber" bleeding through glass directly charges the final image of "rust-hued peace," satisfying the 9+ gate test (environment shapes the final image). Sensory hierarchy is strong: sight and touch dominate during carving, sound (kettle, rain) marks time. No spatial drift or missed anchors.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Marguerite must contain and shape her grief to survive and teach others. The tightening is a single deepening—from "grief needed a container" to the final realization "perhaps this was enough"—rather than multiple reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens and 600–800-word scope. Agency is present in her choice to carve, to prepare tea Viktor's way, to continue teaching, each a small renunciation of the past with felt cost. However, the escalation is atmospheric rather than a sharp narrowing of options; no live choice with immediate consequence appears in the closure beat, and the cost is more conceptual than visceral, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—grief as transformation, memory as matter—emerges organically from the carving action and the "here and gone" refrain without thesis statements. The final image ("perhaps this was enough") offers a non-literal answer to the central question (how does one survive loss?) through the specific particulars of Viktor's tea, the lions in wood, and the rust-hued loft. "Time does not heal, it crystallizes" is close to theme-statement territory but remains grounded in the carving metaphor and earns its keep. The ending resists tidy moral closure while maintaining resonance. Minor deduction for one moment of abstract philosophizing ("nothing truly disappears, it only changes form") in the penultimate paragraph that edges toward summary rather than image.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>POV is stable third limited with clean focalization; perceptual signature is consistent (hands, wood grain, light through water). Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "grief needed a container," "hauntingly practical," "rust-hued peace." Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close (ash wood warming in palms) to slightly elevated reflections without head-hopping. No dialogue to judge. Minor penalty for one filter-verb stack in the opening ("letting the gray light wash over her hands") and slight register elevation in "harvested from loss" that, while thematically resonant, edges toward writerly abstraction rather than character-bound thought. The prose as character test is met; syntax reflects Marguerite's deliberate, patient mind.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse; information density is high with most lines doing double duty (e.g., "the loft held that same hue—weathered brick walls, copper pipes greening with age" gives setting and tone). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. However, figurative language clusters in several high-pressure beats without full payoff: "time does not heal, it crystallizes" and "nothing truly disappears, it only changes form" are polished but edge toward overwriting in proximity. Stock metaphor "rust and amber" recurs without transformation. "Here and gone" functions as a refrain but its fourth appearance ("here and gone between one breath and the next") feels decorative rather than pressure-adding. Apply −0.5 for density of metaphor in reflective passages that slightly dulls momentum, preventing 8.0+.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The widow-teaching-grief-through-carving premise transforms a familiar recovery arc through the specificity of Viktor's lion-taming past and the workshop conversion. The rust-hued loft, ash wood, and recurring lion motif are particular to this narrator. However, the emotional template—grief → acceptance via craft—is well-trodden, and the story does not take bold structural or perspectival risks that would elevate originality. The "perhaps this was enough" ending, while earned, is a median craft choice rather than a surprising synthesis. The proximity check is clean; no famous echoes. Transformation test: the core emotional arc could transfer to other contexts (pottery, gardening) with minimal friction, indicating moderate rather than high originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Marguerite (the widow) is present throughout and her choices—picking up the gouge, making tea Viktor's way, planning tomorrow's lesson—create small turns in her stance toward loss. Setup is immediate; development threads through the middle (carving the lion, reflecting on students); closure is shaped by her final acceptance. However, her decisions are reflective micro-choices rather than high-stakes actions that alter plot options. The "lion tamer's widow" identity anchors motivation and setting transformation but does not constrain a pivotal choice with sharp cost in the ending beat, preventing higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The ash wood blank is handled in three distinct beats: warming in palms (opening), first gouge stroke (middle), and the promise to continue tomorrow (closure). Its grain and form guide Marguerite's carving and embody the containment metaphor. Setup is early (~100 words); development is on-page action (gouge work); closure references the unfinished lion waiting. The blank enables the carving choice and charges the final image of patience and ongoing work. Specificity (ash, tight grain) matters. However, the blank does not constrain a difficult choice with visible tradeoff in the ending beat—it remains a vessel rather than an agent of pressure—capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Here and gone" is seeded early (Viktor "here and gone," sawdust and musk), recurs in the middle (grief moving in waves), and returns in the final image (water droplets "here and gone between one breath"). It shapes the thematic stakes—impermanence and transformation—but does not directly alter tactical choices on the page. The concept reweights the closure image with lyric resonance (droplets as lenses containing sky) and underpins Marguerite's acceptance. However, it functions more as a thematic refrain than a constraint that narrows options in a high-pressure beat, placing it in the 6.0–7.0 band per the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>"Hauntingly practical" appears once as a descriptor of the transformed loft and is implied in Marguerite's teaching method (making grief "hold still" through carving). Setup is present by ~150 words; the trait enables the workshop's existence and her choice to teach rather than collapse. However, the attribute is more label than lived constraint—it does not force a visible tradeoff or complicate a choice in a dramatized beat. The practical transformation (props-to-teaching-tools) is told rather than shown with cost. Closure does not hinge on this trait's mechanics, and it could be swapped for "quietly functional" without structural loss, capping at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>"Contain" is the story's engine: Marguerite contains grief in wooden forms, Viktor contained his fear in careful motions, and the ending reaffirms this method ("the knowledge that nothing truly disappears, it only changes form"). Setup is early ("mourning needed a container"); development threads through carving beats (gouge work, lion emerging); closure is the crystallized peace that results from sustained containment. The action enables her survival and teaching, and it recharges the final image (tea cup warming palms "the way the ash wood had"). However, the containment is a sustained method rather than a single pivotal act with sharp cost in the ending beat, and it could be reframed as "transform" or "preserve" with minor edits, preventing entry to 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>"Crystallized time" is signaled early ("time does not heal, it crystallizes") and the ending image of peace as something "sturdy" that can "bear weight" implies solidification. The method (turning liquid, impossible-to-grasp moments into solid, examinable forms via carving) shapes Marguerite's workshop practice and her teaching. However, the mechanics are more metaphorical than tactile—we see her carve but not a specific moment where crystallization visibly alters a choice or tactic. The method underpins theme but does not constrain a middle beat or charge the final image with irreplaceable specificity. Lyric presence across the arc earns mid-5s, but lack of causal pressure or closure-beat necessity caps below 6.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The "rain-beaded skylight loft" anchors every beat: gray light washing over hands (opening), rain tapping irregular rhythms (middle), light shifting through droplets (closure). The skylight's rain-beads supply the final image—each droplet a lens "containing the whole sky, here and gone"—directly charging closure with the core concept. The loft's weathered brick, copper pipes, and sawdust corners give tactile grounding, and the space's transformation from Viktor's studio pressures Marguerite's choices (converting props to teaching tools). Setup is immediate; development is continuous; closure is crystallized through the skylight image. The setting's dual past/present function and its role in the final image push toward 8.0, but the loft does not force a tactical tradeoff in a middle beat, holding it just below.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>The kettle is introduced early ("began its slow climb toward singing"), recurs at midpoint ("still minutes from its full cry"), and resolves when Marguerite sets down tools to make tea. However, the timeframe does not tighten a decision—Marguerite works at her own pace, the students will arrive "in the afternoon" (vague), and the kettle's boil does not create urgency or force a choice. The clock is present but ornamental; removing it would not alter tactics or closure. The kettle functions more as atmospheric detail and a cue for tea-making than as a pressure device. Setup and closure participation earn low-mid band, but lack of middle constraint and swappability (could be "until the rain stops" or "before students arrive") cap at 4.6 per the integration rules.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>"To harvest lessons from loss" is Marguerite's stated motivation ("this was what she had harvested from loss") and drives her teaching practice and carving. Setup is early (transforming grief into lessons); development is shown through her preparing for students and carving the lion; closure affirms the harvest ("perhaps this was enough"). The motivation is dramatized in micro-choices (picking up the gouge, making Viktor's tea, planning tomorrow's lesson) and carries cost (the life she no longer has, the ongoing work of containment). However, the desire is never sharply conflicted on the page—no moment where harvesting lessons competes with another want or forces a visible tradeoff in the ending beat. Friction between wants and costs is implied rather than dramatized, capping below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>"Rust-hued peace" is established by the middle ("October painted the city in rust and amber," "the loft held that same hue") and dominates the closure ("A rust-hued peace had settled over her life"). Tone is coherent and modulates subtly: opening melancholy ("still she could smell the sawdust and musk"), middle acceptance ("she no longer drowned"), ending affirmation ("perhaps this was enough"). The tone charges the final image (warmth, sturdiness, weathered rather than bright joy) and is inseparable from the closure effect. The rust metaphor recurs with specificity (weathered brick, copper greening, sawdust brown) and ties directly to the Earned Stasis reconfiguration. Tone is not static but deepens through pressure, satisfying the high-band test. Minor cap for one moment of slight tonal drift (the abstract "nothing truly disappears") that momentarily elevates above the established register.</comment>
