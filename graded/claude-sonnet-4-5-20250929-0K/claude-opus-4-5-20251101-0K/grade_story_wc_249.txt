<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her micro-choices (breaking rules, climbing, drumming) are embodied. However, the piece relies heavily on reflection about Elias rather than showing Mira's internal contradictions acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice feels like completion of a plan rather than a decision under conflicting pressures. Her renunciation of Elias's presence is stated ("felt him leaving") but the cost reads more as relief than genuine loss with visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered sensory description and memory until the drumming sequence releases Elias into the garden. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Mira completes the transfer and accepts solitude with visible cost ("the loneliness felt different now"). Orientation anchors clearly (Mira, sound wave garden, night). One meaningful deepening occurs when drumming triggers the lagoon response and sculptures release their sounds, reweighting Mira's entanglement into a permanent vessel for Elias's dream.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly rendered through concrete sensory detail (crystalline paths, acoustic sculptures, bioluminescent lagoon pulsing gold/amber). The environment constrains choice: Mira must climb the spiral staircase to reach the observation platform where she can drum and trigger the garden's resonance. The auric lagoon returns in the final image, charged as the permanent vessel for Elias's composition. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the ascent and drumming sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: giving Elias's dream its first breath. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira's drumming triggers the garden's resonance, forcing the separation ("felt him leaving her"). Agency is renunciation—she lets Elias go into the garden with visible cost (the space in her mind "growing quiet"). The escalation reads as accumulative deepening under the textural lens: sensory density builds until the release. However, the drumming feels pre-planned rather than a decision made under conflicting pressure in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: memory as both haunting and gift, grief made luminous through art. The drumming sequence avoids moralizing; the final image ("she had given a dead man's dream its first breath") answers the thematic question through concrete action rather than abstraction. Subtext operates in the tension between Mira's compliance ("she would be compliant, cooperative") and her night rebellion. The auroral sorrow motif charges the ending without stating a moral. One minor slip: "something that mattered" in the penultimate section edges toward thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: Mira notices through her altered nervous system ("frequencies only Mira could feel"). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("small defiances that kept her soul from calcifying under authority"). No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully between close embodiment and slightly elevated lyricism. Narrative certainty matches what Mira can know; Elias's memories are clearly framed as entangled with hers. One minor register wobble: "auroral sorrow filled the air" reads slightly explanatory rather than strictly filtered through Mira's perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density and rhythm variation; opening establishes voice immediately. Minor paraphrase loop: "His memories had become entangled" / "his dreams remained, woven into hers" restates the fusion concept across adjacent paragraphs (−0.2). Figurative language is mostly apt ("grief made luminous") but "the universe exhaled" bookend feels slightly ornamental without strong causal linkage to Mira's action. Sentence openings vary well. No clarity or propulsion issues at closure. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The quantum-fiber nervous system and sound-storing sculptures offer fresh SF specifics. The premise (entangled consciousness seeks closure through environmental resonance) transforms familiar "haunted by the dead" material through grounded world-building and the particular image of the auric lagoon. The drumming-as-composition turn feels earned in hindsight. However, the Resonance Project setup and Volunteer numbering read close to clinical-trial templates without full transformation; the world feels designed to serve the closure rather than lived-in beyond this moment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira as "Volunteer Seventeen, an experimental treatment guinea pig" is established early (setup ✓). Her guinea-pig status enables the entangled memories that drive the stakes (development ✓). The closure—releasing Elias and accepting solitude—completes her arc from haunted subject to active agent (payoff ✓). Her choice to drum and release Elias is causally rooted in her experimental alteration. However, the guinea-pig aspect is more backstory frame than active constraint in the drumming scene itself; her choices feel driven by grief and love rather than the experimental-subject identity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The auric lagoon appears in Elias's sketches (setup via memory, ~25%), Mira recognizes it as the place from his dreams (beat 1, middle third), it responds first to her drumming rhythm with intensified glow and wave patterns (beat 2, climax), and the final paragraph anchors closure in its shimmer where she hears Elias (payoff ✓). The lagoon's bioluminescent response is causally active—it validates the entanglement and provides sensory proof of success. Strong irreplaceability: no generic body of water could carry the auric/golden specificity tied to "auroral sorrow."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Entangled memories are introduced immediately ("memories could be transmitted between consciousness"), drive Mira's motivation throughout (she hears Elias, carries his dreams), constrain her tactics (she must find the lagoon he sketched), and the closure is the untangling—his consciousness separating into the garden (payoff ✓). The concept shapes every beat: the recognition scene, the drumming as shared rhythm, the final separation. High causal pressure and closure linkage. Cost is visible: the quiet space left in her mind.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Quietly rebellious" is signaled early ("breaking rules since childhood, small defiances") and shown on-page: she violates protocols by accessing the garden after dark. However, the trait enables the plot convenience (access when needed) without generating meaningful friction or cost. The rebellion reads as setup for her being there rather than a contested choice with visible tradeoff. Present in two beats (childhood frame + night access) but swappable with "determined" or "rule-breaking" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Perch" appears at the platform observation point and frames the drumming sequence (setup and middle ✓). Mira's perching position enables the drumming-on-multiple-surfaces action and provides the vantage to observe the lagoon's response (causal ✓). The closure image recalls the platform indirectly ("she descended the spiral staircase"). However, "perch" as physical position could be replaced with "stand" or "sit" without breaking the story's logic; it is the elevation and proximity that matter more than the specific posture. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Drumming is seeded via Elias's musician background early, becomes the method in the climax ("began drumming on everything within reach"), and directly triggers the garden's resonance and Elias's release (payoff ✓). The mechanics matter: each surface answers in its own voice, the rhythm is "between her heartbeat and the pulse of Elias's memory," and the lagoon responds first. Strong causal pressure and closure participation. Irreplaceable: the multi-surface percussion is the specific means of activating the sound wave garden's stored frequencies.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is introduced in the opening line, its purpose explained (capture dying languages, extinct birdsongs), Mira navigates its paths and climbs its largest sculpture (beat 1), the sculptures release stored sounds in response to her drumming (beat 2, climax), and the final image confirms "The sound wave garden would keep breathing for him forever" (payoff ✓). The garden's mechanics—molecular lattice storing sounds—are causally essential: it is the vessel that receives and perpetuates Elias's dream. High irreplaceability and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"At the hush of the universe inhaling" appears in the second paragraph as lyric frame and is bookended by "The universe exhaled" at closure (setup + payoff ✓). However, the timeframe remains abstract and does not constrain Mira's choices or tactics; she has unlimited time to drum, and no urgency tightens decisions. The cosmic breathing metaphor charges tone but does not function as a live clock. Missing middle development (no mid-scene time pressure). Lyric reprise without causal pressure caps the score in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to breathe life into a shared dream" is dramatized throughout: Mira climbs to the platform to complete Elias's unfulfilled composition, drums to encode it into matter, and the closure confirms success ("His dream was alive now"). The want is conflicted—she must lose Elias to fulfill his dream, and the cost (loneliness, the quiet space in her mind) is visible on the page. Strong causal pressure across all three beats (setup, drumming, release) and high closure participation. The friction between grief and gift is embodied rather than told.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" is named explicitly midway ("Auroral sorrow filled the air—grief made luminous, loss transformed into light") and modulates the tone throughout: the haunting, the tears during drumming, the charged final image of starlight bent through water. The tone is coherent through turns—sorrow remains present even as the dream is fulfilled—and charges the closure without flattening into single-note melancholy. One small dock: the phrase "auroral sorrow" itself reads slightly ornamental when named directly rather than purely embodied, edging toward label.</comment>
