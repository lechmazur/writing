<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through her sensory methods, but her competence lacks genuine struggle—every diagnostic choice succeeds without error or false starts. The merchant and his anxiety provide functional pressure but remain a stock figure. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves through repair beats with unwavering confidence, and the final smile feels like a tidy emotional bow rather than earned complexity. The "heartfelt artisan" framing verges on label-speak ("believed that everything broken carried within it the memory of wholeness") without dramatized cost to that belief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (who, where, when by the opening paragraphs). The story follows a causal lens: merchant arrives with broken drone → Elara diagnoses and repairs → maiden voyage proceeds. One meaningful tightening occurs (harbor bells mark time pressure), and closure lands on-page with the ship departing and Elara returning to her shop. The cost, however, is conceptual rather than felt—no option is foreclosed, no visible price paid; she simply succeeds and waits for the next customer. The ending reconfigures her stance as an ongoing pattern but lacks the decisive change or charged poise that would elevate closure under a causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot and converted cargo car are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (warmth patterns, displaced air, brass basin). Spatial choreography is clear, and the environment contributes atmosphere. However, setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—Elara could perform the same repair in any workshop. The micro-setting (water basin, workbench tools) functions as technique display rather than a resource that alters tactics under pressure. Solid execution but setting remains backdrop rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (repair the drone before the ship's anchor lifts) is signaled early and tracked through harbor bells. Time pressure provides a causal tightening, but Elara's choices never narrow options or force a trade-off—she methodically succeeds at each step without setback, false lead, or visible cost. No reversal tests her commitment; luck does not complicate. The resolution is competent execution rather than agency under constraint. The single tightening (bells ringing closer to noon) is present but does not foreclose a path or reveal a price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (decoding damage into direction, learning to listen) emerges through image and action rather than overt statement, and the final paragraph offers a resonant closure without moralizing. However, the ending drifts toward abstraction ("full of messages," "her gift, her purpose, her magnetic calm") and the thematic answer feels pre-installed rather than discovered through struggle. The hummingbird and water-refraction motifs are purposeful but do not accumulate pressure or shift meaning at closure. Competent thematic coherence without the non-literal charge or conceptual repricing that would enter the 8-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (heat, sound, moisture patterns filter Elara's sensory world). Dialogue is minimal but functional. The prose demonstrates controlled diction and rhythm, modulating between technical precision and lyric observation. Minor slip: "frequencies most people had forgotten existed" and "her gift, her purpose, her magnetic calm" edge toward external commentary rather than strict focalization. No head-hopping, and the narrative distance remains consistent. Voice is competent and clean, though not exceptional under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high. Clarity is maintained throughout. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "She was blind, had been since the accident that took her sight but sharpened everything else" recaps information implied by "listening to the world speak in frequencies"; "She smiled and returned to her repair shop, where other broken things waited to be understood" echoes the opening's established pattern without fresh pressure. The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("damage," "messages," "darkness and light," "fractures") that feel like scaffold rather than earned closure language. Minor template cadence in sensory beats ("She felt X, she heard Y") across multiple paragraphs. Deduction −0.6 for loops and scaffold touching the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The blind artisan premise offers a fresh angle, and the water-refraction diagnostic method is specific and memorable. However, the emotional arc (competent repair → satisfied customer → return to work) follows a familiar service-encounter template without transformation. The story resists the median middle through sensory specificity, but the lack of risk or complication keeps it in safe territory. Proximity check passes; no close echoes of famous lines. The synthesis of blindness, sensory repair methods, and steampunk-adjacent setting is non-obvious but not fully realized through conflict.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara appears in all beats and makes repair choices (selects molecular pen, tests rotors, installs parts). However, these are technical decisions without moral calculus or visible cost—each choice succeeds without forcing a trade-off. She does not face a key turn where her "heartfelt artisan" stance is tested. Present across beats and shapes the middle, but swappable with any competent mechanic without altering story logic. Causal role is functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drone is handled across multiple beats: merchant brings it (setup), Elara diagnoses fracture and replaces rotors (development), she tests and returns it, and the ship's departure confirms success (payoff). It drives two distinct beats and contributes to closure. However, removing the hummingbird and substituting any navigation device would require only cosmetic edits—no unique property (its flight, its sensors, its symbolism) constrains Elara's choices or charges the final image. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The repair shop frames every beat and shapes Elara's identity and methods. It provides the setting, tools, and social function. However, the "repair shop" as concept does not constrain a choice under pressure—Elara could practice her craft anywhere with similar tools. The shop is backdrop and occupation rather than a dilemma or resource with unique properties. Present in setup, development, and closure, but its conceptual role is atmospheric rather than causal. Functional across beats but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Blindness enables Elara's sensory methods (heat, sound, water refraction) and is dramatized in multiple beats: she holds the drone toward light to feel warmth, selects tools by texture, spins rotors to test hum. It constrains her approach and differentiates her from sighted mechanics. However, no on-page cost or trade-off is tied to blindness—she never misses a cue, makes an error, or faces a limitation that another character must compensate for. The trait is functional and visible but lacks the friction or price that would make it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The patch action (molecular bonding pen on hairline fracture) is a key middle beat that enables the drone's repair. Signaled early, executed on-page, and necessary for success. However, it is one step in a sequence of repairs (also replacing rotors, running diagnostics), and substituting a different repair technique would not alter story logic. The action matters but is not the sole or irreplaceable turn. Causal role in one major beat, purposeful, but moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Water-refraction diagnosis is signaled early (brass basin, submerging components, warmth scatter revealing cracks) and used in the middle beat to identify the hairline fracture. It shapes Elara's diagnostic method and differentiates her approach. However, the mechanics do not recur or constrain later choices—once the fracture is found, the method disappears. Present in setup and development but absent from closure. Functional and specific but not indispensable across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The mist-coated rail depot provides vivid atmosphere and anchors the opening and closing images. It frames Elara's world and supplies the cargo-car workshop. However, setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—the repair could occur in any workshop. The depot is present in setup and closure (lyric reprise of mist), but its role is scenic rather than causal. Atmospheric integration without mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The anchor-lifting timeframe is signaled early ("anchor lifts at noon"), tracked through harbor bells in the middle, and confirmed at closure ("the splash of an anchor breaking free"). It provides a live clock that frames urgency. However, the time pressure does not alter Elara's tactics or force a trade-off—she works methodically without rushing or skipping steps. The timeframe is present in all three gates and supplies urgency, but its causal role is atmospheric rather than decisive. Functional across beats with closure linkage, but moderate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation ("to decode feedback into direction") is stated explicitly in reflection and demonstrated through Elara's sensory methods. However, it is never dramatized in a choice with friction—she decodes successfully without misreading, doubt, or cost. The desire is told and illustrated but not tested. Present as theme and occupation, but not conflicted or charged with visible price. Label-level integration without on-page stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Magnetic calm is established through Elara's steady hands, methodical pacing, and the lyric description of mist and sensory work. Tone is coherent and modulates subtly (merchant's anxiety contrasts her composure). However, the tone remains static—no moment of doubt, urgency, or pressure breaks the calm, and the final paragraph repeats the opening's serene texture without transformation. Coherent through turns but does not charge the final image with new weight. Consistent execution without escalation or cost.</comment>
