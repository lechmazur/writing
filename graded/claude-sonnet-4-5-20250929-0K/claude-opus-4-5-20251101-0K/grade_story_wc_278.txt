<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear—to heal generational guilt—and her final action (tattooing the constellation, whispering the letters) is causally rooted in her seven-year search for backward communication. However, interiority leans toward lyric summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure: "a tether cut, a frequency finally finding its match" tells the release rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The piece lacks micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost; Vera proceeds without friction or trade-off, and the ending grants emotional resolution without dramatizing what she forfeits or risks in the attempt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of charged images (amber, insect, letters, resonance chamber) accumulates toward a final cadence shift that reweights the guilt-strand. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Vera releases the tether without changing the past, accepting that "some silences were not emptiness at all." Cost is conceptual and felt—she stops searching for backward repair—but the on-page sentence "Perhaps her mother had still died believing herself unloved" acknowledges uncertainty without visible forfeiture of tactics or relationship. The fold mechanism and amber-translation remain abstract; causality is poetic rather than because/therefore, which fits the lens but leaves the closure unit at the edge of legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The laboratory's "crystalline walls," "resonance chambers," and "fold between midnight and dawn" create a vivid, purposeful atmosphere that mirrors the thematic search for lost frequencies. The amber recurs across beats (found in the desk, tested against the chamber, pressed to Vera's chest, cooled at the end) and constrains her method: its "haunted firmware" translates baby cries, shaping her discovery and final action. Micro-setting objects (Victorian desk, answering machine tape, workbench) charge the closure by anchoring the letters spatially. Spatial choreography is clear throughout; the laboratory's acoustics and meteor-fall backdrop support tone without becoming postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing generational guilt—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Vera places the amber against the chamber and hears her mother's infant cry layered with her grandmother's apology, narrowing her goal to tattooing the constellation into the fold. However, escalation is primarily accumulative rather than agonistic: no on-page obstacle tests Vera's commitment, no reversal forces a trade-off, and the laboratory's mechanics enable her without friction. The ending forecloses her search (Earned Stasis), but the cost is conceptual acceptance rather than a visible price that alters tactics or sacrifices a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—love mistranslated by frequency, silence as unheard presence—emerges through the amber-as-translator conceit, the letters-as-constellation mapping, and the final image of "love waiting to find its proper frequency." The story resists moralizing; the line "some silences were not emptiness at all" reconfigures prior material without summary. However, the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic echo: "she felt something release… a tether cut, a frequency finally finding its match" articulates the thesis rather than letting the tattooing action speak. The closing sentence—"some silences… love waiting to find its proper frequency"—is resonant but borders on restating the conceit. Still, the particulars (insect, amber, letters, fold) ground the abstraction sufficiently to avoid pure didacticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistently lyric-literary with a distinct perceptual signature: "time curled back upon itself like smoke remembering flame," "hours sometimes ran backward through her fingers," "sounds the world had forgotten." POV is stable third-person limited with clean focalization; no head-hopping. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats: "dissonance of that guilt had haunted Vera's bloodline like corrupted code in ancient machinery" mixes metaphor vehicles (biological bloodline, digital code, mechanical parts) without grounding. Filter verbs ("she understood now," "she didn't know if") cluster in the final third, dulling immediacy when embodied perception would sharpen the release. Psychic distance is controlled but leans toward summary during the closure sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and sentences vary in structure, supporting the lyric accumulation. However, figurative density in high-pressure beats risks overwriting: "time curled back upon itself like smoke remembering flame" and "corrupted code in ancient machinery" appear within the opening setup, and "frequencies that spiraled backward through the fold" in the climax mixes metaphor vehicles (spiral motion, backward time, spatial fold) without coherent grounding. Template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "She had been searching… She had been drawn… She understood now why…" (three "She had/understood" stems in close succession). The final paragraph contains two near-paraphrase loops: "Some things… simply needed to be translated" and "some silences were not emptiness… but love waiting to find its proper frequency" restate the same insight. No major causality breaks, but these artifacts dull momentum at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—constellation tattooing + amber-as-translator + letters found in antique furniture + time-folding laboratory—is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template plot. The amber's function (translating baby cries via "haunted firmware") is a fresh, committed inflection on the memory-reparation trope. However, the emotional arc (discovering letters, translating guilt, releasing the tether) follows a familiar redemption structure without transformation through lived detail or moral calculus that complicates forgiveness. The laboratory's mechanics remain abstract; no on-page constraint from the fold's physics tests Vera's method. Risk-taking is present in the lyric accumulation and conceptual closure, but the piece hedges toward safety by granting Vera emotional release without visible sacrifice or failed attempt.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vera is present throughout and her choices (pressing amber to chamber, tattooing the constellation, whispering letters into the fold) drive the climax. She appears in the first paragraph and her decision to tattoo is the story's turning action. However, her role is more enactor than decider-under-pressure: no on-page obstacle tests her commitment, no reversal forces her to adapt tactics, and the laboratory enables her without friction. The ending acknowledges uncertainty ("Perhaps her mother had still died believing herself unloved") but does not dramatize a cost Vera pays to attempt the tether. Setup and closure participation are strong; middle development lacks causal pressure tied to her choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amber is introduced early (found in the desk three weeks prior, mentioned in paragraph four), handled across three beats (tested against the chamber, pressed to Vera's chest during the fold, cooled and placed beside the letters at the end), and its unique property (translates baby cries via prehistoric insect firmware) is irreplaceable—no substitute object could perform this function. It constrains Vera's method and charges the closure by cooling "at last" after the transmission, signaling completion. However, the amber does not impose a visible cost or narrow Vera's options; it enables without friction. Strong setup, development, and payoff, but lacks the trade-off or sacrifice that would push it into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The concept frames the premise: amber contains "haunted firmware, biological programming millions of years old that somehow still processed input." It shapes Vera's discovery (the insect "twitched" during transmission) and appears in the climax ("ancient circuitry"). However, "haunted firmware" functions primarily as metaphor rather than a rule-set with on-page constraints or costs. The story does not dramatize what the firmware demands, limits, or risks; it simply translates. Present in setup and closure, but its mechanics do not narrow options or force trade-offs, leaving it thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The attribute is introduced early ("translated baby cries") and its narrow function initially puzzles Vera, creating mild dramatic irony. It enables the key discovery: when amber meets the grandmother's voice recording, Vera hears her mother's infant cry carrying "pure emotional frequency" and her grandmother's sub-audible apology. This translation is the story's hinge, shaping Vera's goal to send frequencies backward. However, the trait does not constrain or complicate: it works without friction, cost, or failed attempts. Strong setup and development; payoff is indirect (the tattooing uses the insight rather than the translation itself). No visible trade-off lowers the ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Tethering appears as Vera's explicit goal: "she had spent her life trying to preserve sounds before they vanished into silence… trying to send messages backward, to tether the present to wounds that still bled in the past." The climax action—tattooing the constellation and whispering letters into the fold—is a tethering attempt, and the ending acknowledges release: "a tether cut, a frequency finally finding its match." Present in motivation, middle reflection, and closure. However, "tether" functions as metaphor rather than a specific on-page action with mechanics or cost. The tattooing itself is the concrete act; "tether" could be replaced with "connect," "bridge," or "bind" without structural change. Setup and payoff are strong, but swappability and lack of unique constraint hold it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The letters are introduced early (found in the Victorian desk three weeks ago, bound in ribbon), and their content (forty-three apologies from grandmother to Sophie) motivates Vera's entire arc. They reappear in the climax as the constellation blueprint ("the pattern formed by her grandmother's letters laid out on her workbench, each envelope a point of light") and in the ending when Vera places the amber beside them. The method is specific and irreplaceable: the letters' physical arrangement becomes the star-map Vera tattoos. However, the "antique furniture" vehicle (Victorian writing desk with secret drawer) is functional setup but not developed—once the letters are extracted, the desk vanishes. Strong setup and payoff; middle use is the letters themselves rather than the discovery method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The laboratory is introduced in the opening line, detailed across the first third (resonance chambers, crystalline walls, hungry acoustics, fold-time mechanics), and its central chamber is the instrument Vera uses at climax. The setting enables her method: "the one that fed sound into the fold itself" is the specific tool she tattoos and speaks into. The laboratory's founder discovered amber's translation function, providing the rule-set. The "meteor hush" and "fold between midnight and the first breath of dawn" charge the final action's timing. However, the setting does not pressure Vera's choices—it grants access without obstacle or cost. Environment shapes tactics but does not constrain or threaten. Strong setup, development, and payoff, but lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The fold timeframe is introduced early ("the fold between midnight and the first breath of dawn, a place where time curled back upon itself") and Vera explicitly chooses "this moment precisely—the fold, the technicians called it, when time doubled back and whispered to itself." The fold is present at climax (meteors fall in slow silence, time's fabric ripples) and the ending transitions to "a dawn that tasted… like forgiveness," marking passage out of the fold. However, the fold does not impose urgency or tighten Vera's window; she has worked at the laboratory for seven years and chose this fold-night without on-page constraint. Present in setup and closure, but the timeframe does not narrow options or create time-pressure tactics. Atmosphere rather than tactic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation is explicit and present throughout: "the dissonance of that guilt had haunted Vera's bloodline," she seeks "to tether the present to wounds that still bled in the past," and the climax states "The dissonance quieted." It drives her seven-year career and her choice to tattoo the constellation. The ending delivers release: "a tether cut, a frequency finally finding its match." However, the motivation is told more than embodied in contradictory choices under pressure. Vera does not wrestle with competing wants (e.g., fear of failure, doubt about meddling with the past); she proceeds without friction. Setup, development, and payoff are clear, but lack of on-page conflict between desire and cost holds it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tone—"meteor hush"—is established in the climax paragraph ("meteors fell in slow silence") and closing image ("dawn that tasted… like forgiveness. The sounds of the world rushed back"). The laboratory's "hungry acoustics" and Vera's laughter "swallowed immediately" reinforce the hush throughout. Tone modulates purposefully from the eerie laboratory silence to the sound-rich dawn, charging the ending by contrast. However, "meteor hush" as a phrase does not appear until late, and the tone is more atmospheric consistency than a constraint on Vera's choices. Present in setup (implied by laboratory acoustics) and strong in payoff, but middle development is ambient rather than pressure-shaping. Coherent and charged, but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>
