<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Celia's maintenance expertise and sensory skills are well-established through concrete detail ("every rust spot, every groan"). Her decision to follow the stranger and eventually guide him shows agency under pressure. The man's motivation (finding his father's hidden legacy) lands with embodied emotion ("eyes wet"), though his backstory arrives via summary rather than dramatized contradiction. Minor: Celia's interior voice remains consistent but her final choice to help feels slightly under-motivated given the stated risks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Celia follows footsteps → discovers the man → decodes the key-as-template → navigates to the container. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure—finding the father's archive—lands on the page with felt emotional cost (the man's grief, Celia's complicity in revealing hidden knowledge). One meaningful tightening occurs when the key's true function is revealed, narrowing the path to resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vividly rendered through sound-borne navigation, fluorescent markers flickering under electromagnetic interference, and maintenance passages. The geomagnetic storm supplies concrete sensory detail (green/violet aurora) and constrains Celia's usual methods (compass failure). The zodiac-marked container and the key's teeth aligning with map notches show micro-setting elements that directly enable the closure beat. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding the hidden archive. Pressure escalates when normal navigation fails, forcing reliance on sound and memory, then tightens when the key reveals a new route through worker-only passages. The man's agency (three years studying maps, producing the key) drives the turn; Celia's expertise enables it. The cost—revealing a secret meant to outlast conventional knowledge—is conceptual and felt in the final beat. One clear reversal when the key's function is discovered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: whispers travel farther than shouts, secrets preserved carefully outlast declarations. The labyrinth itself embodies the philosophy ("understood by those who listened, impenetrable to those who demanded"). The father's cartography and Celia's sound-based navigation converge without overt statement. The final image—storm crackling above, labyrinth holding secrets close—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor: the man's exposition about his father's beliefs edges toward direct theme statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable on Celia throughout. Her perceptual signature (identifying walks, trusting sound over sight) is character-specific and consistent. Dialogue feels natural and advances plot; the man's lines pursue goals ("help me find what I'm looking for"). Distance control is clean with no head-hopping. Minor: some diction ("cartographer," "geomagnetic storm") sits at the edge of Celia's working-class register without fully breaking it, and the man's philosophical speech feels slightly elevated for the moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing images are strong. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. A few template cadence runs appear: "Lots of people hide things here. Most of it stays hidden" and "I maintain this place" / "Then perhaps you can help me" exchange feels slightly scaffolded. Minor synonym variation in "folding and refolding" / "fold hiding a secret until you needed it." No loops touch the closure beat, so impact is contained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—folded maps as memory aids, a key as template for decoding—offers a fresh angle on hidden-knowledge narratives. The sound-navigation skill and the geomagnetic storm's interference combine elements organically. The ending avoids easy sentiment, letting the archive discovery and the storm's indifference stand as the final image. Minor: the "whispers travel farther than shouts" philosophy, while executed through particulars, echoes familiar counter-cultural epistemology without fully transforming it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Celia's expertise (maintenance, sound identification) frames the opening, enables the middle turn (decoding the key), and drives the final navigation through hidden passages. Her challenge and decision to guide shape the story's arc. Removing her occupation would break the logic of access and knowledge.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The zodiac coin appears twice: when the man shows it and when it matches the container's symbol. It signals the father's legacy and provides visual continuity, but does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—the key and maps do that work. The coin's meaning does not shift; it remains a static identifier.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Folded maps shape the premise (the man has studied them for three years), drive the key turn (the key's teeth align with map notches to reveal a new route), and are present in the closure beat (the archive of cartography). The concept constrains options and enables the solution. Removing it would collapse the story's central mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Celia's ability to identify walks is established early ("dock supervisors strode with metronomic precision") and motivates her decision to follow the stranger ("footsteps she heard now belonged to no one"). It enables one key turn but does not constrain later choices or appear in the closure. The skill could be replaced with visual recognition without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Celia's challenge ("I challenge you to keep up") marks the transition from negotiation to action and signals her decision to trust the man. It drives the final third's momentum and reflects her professional pride. The specific phrasing matters less than the decision it encodes, but it charges the shift and ties to the "calculated spontaneity" tone.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The key is introduced mid-story, shown as "brass, ornate, clearly old," and its function (template for map-folding rather than lock-turning) drives the pivotal turn. Celia's insight and the key's mechanics enable the hidden route. It appears in two beats (introduction, decoding) and is essential to reaching the closure. Late arrival caps upside slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is established in the opening line, supplies obstacles (rust, settling metal, paths that lead nowhere), and forces tactical choices (sound over sight, maintenance passages). The geomagnetic storm recharges the setting by disrupting normal navigation. The zodiac-marked container is the closure destination. Setting is indispensable to every major beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The geomagnetic storm is present from the opening, disables compass and markers (forcing Celia's sound-based navigation), and provides atmospheric charge throughout. It does not impose a ticking clock or escalate pressure temporally, but it alters tactics and is woven into the final image ("the geomagnetic storm crackled and sang"). Strong presence; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "whispers travel farther than shouts" philosophy is articulated by the man and reflected in Celia's methods (whispering in the maze, sound over sight). It frames theme and appears in the closure line ("the labyrinth held its secrets close, revealing them only to those who knew how to listen"). However, it is more thematic resonance than a contested choice with visible cost. It shapes tone but does not drive a dramatic turn.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Calculated spontaneity is embodied in Celia's navigation: "decisions that seemed random but weren't, trusting patterns she'd absorbed over years." The tone modulates with the storm's interference and the journey's mounting precision. It charges the challenge beat and the final passage through unmapped routes. The pairing of deliberate expertise and intuitive improvisation is coherent and heightens the ending without obscuring clarity.</comment>
