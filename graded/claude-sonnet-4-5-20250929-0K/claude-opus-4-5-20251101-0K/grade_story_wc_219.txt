<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior voice shows academic skepticism through specific professional history ("written papers about manufactured meaning"), and her final shift from skepticism to luminous certainty is signaled. However, the transformation feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she moves from one pole to another without dramatized internal friction. The elderly man's tears and the other five pilgrims remain functionally interchangeable, applying no relational pressure. The "chemistry of homecoming" reflection anchors in the amber but the epiphany arrives through extended meditation rather than a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes Mira's skeptical frame, accumulates sensory and conceptual density around the amber, then delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (luminous certainty replacing skepticism) in the final third. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure cost is felt—Mira's academic rebelliousness is implicitly renounced—but the exact on-page sentence where this foreclosure becomes undeniable is diffuse across the descent paragraphs rather than crystallized in a single image. The "ready to tell them yes" gesture closes the loop but reads slightly summary rather than a charged decisive beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower, bronze-lit chamber, and amber on the pedestal are vivid and selective. Spatial choreography is clean (worn steps, tall windows, pedestal at center). The amber functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: Mira touches its cool surface, and the fly's preservation becomes the conceptual anchor for the closure. Spring rain modulates from active to stopped, mirroring the tonal shift. No occupational or professional detail intrudes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Mira's need to understand why she feels the pull of artificial pilgrimage. The amber deepens her comprehension in one meaningful accumulation, but no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The aliens' coordinates and the convergence of six pilgrims establish external pressure, yet Mira's agency is passive observation until the final descent decision. The cost—renouncing her career-long skepticism—is implied but not foregrounded as a visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (continuity, preservation, the molecular bond of meaning-seeking) emerges from the amber's particulars and the aliens' choice of preservation sites. The final image—Mira "luminous now, lit from within by a certainty"—reweights her prior skepticism without stating a moral. The "chemistry of homecoming" meditation is earned by the concrete fly-in-resin and avoids platitude. One slip: "The need to understand was the thread, the molecular bond that held consciousness together across the void" edges toward thematic echo but stays anchored in the amber's materiality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV, third-limited on Mira, remains stable. Perceptual signature is academic-turned-experiential: "She had studied chemistry before turning to anthropology" filters the amber through molecular knowledge. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("bronze quiet," "artificial pilgrimage"). No dialogue on the page. The phrase "luminous now, lit from within" risks slight abstraction under peak pressure but the closing descent grounds it in action. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the amber meditation paragraphs. Two minor loops: "They had been watching Earth for a long time. Long enough to see forests rise and fall, species emerge and vanish, continents reshape themselves" restates duration; "always searching, always returning, always trying" uses parallel template stems. The "bronze quiet" recurs cleanly (windows, final chamber beat). No scaffold or mixed metaphors. Propulsion is steady but the extended reflection in the middle third slightly softens momentum before the descent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—aliens send coordinates to preservation sites—offers a non-obvious synthesis of first contact and material memory. The fly amber as cross-species message is specific and memorable. The "artificial pilgrimage" frame transforms the trope of sacred journey by making sacredness externally granted. Risk: the extended meditation on molecular memory and continuity leans toward abstraction in places ("the thread, the molecular bond") rather than embodied discovery. The ending's "ready to tell them yes" feels slightly template in phrasing but the overall vision coheres.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her skepticism frames the opening. Her final choice to descend and affirm understanding alters her stance with implicit cost (renouncing career-long skepticism). However, the transformation is largely internal and reflective; no on-page beat shows her skepticism forcing a difficult trade-off mid-scene. The "luminous" shift is told more than dramatized through a micro-choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fly amber appears in the chamber description, is touched by Mira, and anchors the extended chemistry-of-homecoming meditation. It returns in the final third when Mira's touch crystallizes her understanding. The amber's molecular signature and forty-million-year preservation drive the aliens' message and Mira's epiphany. Removing it would collapse the story's central image and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept is named early ("artificial pilgrimage") and frames Mira's academic stance. It shapes her journey to the tower and her curiosity about why she feels the pull. However, it functions more as thematic context than on-page tactical pressure—no choice in the chamber hinges on the artificiality of the pilgrimage. The concept seeds the opening but does not reappear with reweighted meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The attribute is mentioned once: "Her colleagues at the university had called her academically rebellious, too willing to dismantle comfortable beliefs." It contextualizes her skepticism but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. No later beat shows her rebelliousness forcing a tradeoff or shaping her response to the amber or the other pilgrims.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Converge" is signaled in the opening ("all converging on this place after the signal") and enacted when the six pilgrims are present in the chamber. The convergence creates the communal witness context for Mira's realization and the elderly man's tears. It shapes the middle beat and underpins the aliens' distributed-coordinate strategy. A different gathering mechanism would alter the story's distributed-sacred logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The phrase appears once in the final third: "They had converged here via dusty footprints left on an overgrown sculpture path." It is summary context rather than a means dramatized in scene. Mira's boots leave "dusty footprints" on the tower steps in the opening, which lightly echoes the method, but the sculpture path itself does not shape her climb or choices. Swappable with "via the old road" with minimal impact.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower is present in the opening image and frames the ascent/descent structure. The worn steps, tall windows, and bronze-lit chamber provide spatial anchors and the rain's modulation (streaking → stopped) mirrors the emotional arc. The tower's vertical structure enables the closing descent choice. The setting constrains movement and charges the final image when Mira descends "ready to tell them yes."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Three months since first contact" anchors the timeframe early and establishes the aliens' signal as the inciting event. The timeframe shapes the context (humanity still deciding whether to celebrate or mourn) but does not create on-page urgency—no ticking clock tightens Mira's decisions in the chamber. The "after" framing is essential to the premise but does not escalate tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation is signaled in the opening ("to understand why even she felt the pull") and the chemistry-of-homecoming reflection occupies the story's thematic center. Mira's desire to understand drives her climb and her extended meditation on the amber. The final "ready to tell them yes" fulfills the motivation. Friction between her skepticism and the pull is present but not sharply dramatized as conflicting wants in a single high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" appears twice: "Rain streaked the tall windows, casting everything in bronze quiet" and "The six pilgrims stood in bronze quiet as spring rain washed the tower clean." The tone is coherent, modulates with the rain's cessation, and charges the final image of shared witness. It supports the accumulative lens and the meditative pacing. The tone remains stable rather than intensifying under pressure, fitting the design.</comment>
