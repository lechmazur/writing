<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Helena's claustrophobia is embodied through physical sensations ("pressed against her chest like a physical weight") and drives her core conflict between fear and determination. The grandmother backstory anchors motivation but occupies substantial space without altering present choices until the final discovery. Internal contradiction shows in "negotiate with her fear rather than surrender," yet the crawl through the passage reads more as straightforward perseverance than simultaneous warring impulses. The final sitting among archives feels like arrival rather than a choice that forecloses paths with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Closure is a Decisive Change—Helena unlocks the archives and photographs them—but the cost registers as wistful reflection on her grandmother rather than a felt price paid by Helena herself on the page. Orientation anchors cleanly (observatory ruins, autumn, St. Aldric's Cathedral). The sequence from organ chord to revealed passage to compass-point lock is motivated and legible. One meaningful tightening occurs when the horizontal passage tests her claustrophobia, narrowing her options to crawl or abandon the quest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The setting provides concrete pressure: the collapsed dome, the narrow three-foot passage, the belltower stairs all constrain Helena's movement and test her claustrophobia. The organ's preserved state and the hidden panel's resonance mechanism supply resources that affect outcome. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("dust motes suspended in the moonbeams," "teeth ache"). The compass point functions as micro-setting, charging the final lock mechanism and shaping the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: find the Meridian Key to unlock the archives. One meaningful tightening occurs when the organ reveals the horizontal passage, forcing Helena to crawl despite her claustrophobia—a choice that narrows options with embodied cost. The lock mechanism's discovery and the door opening constitute resolution, but the final sitting and photographing deflate urgency rather than deepen it. Coincidence does not resolve (the organ and compass work as seeded tools), but the grandmother's pre-mapped solution reduces Helena's agency at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of courage as "spatial mutiny" against one's own limitations emerges through concrete action (the crawl, the organ sequence). However, "spatial mutiny" is stated twice as a label rather than arising purely from event and image. The phrase "wistful rebellion against time itself" in the penultimate section edges toward direct thematic summary. The final image of photographing documents while church bells ring offers some resonance, reweighting the grandmother's loss, but the closure leans on telling ("somewhere, Helena believed, her grandmother was finally at peace") rather than image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and voice is distinct ("shadowed nexus," "prudently adventurous," "negotiate with her fear"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the crawl and opening for reflection. Diction occasionally elevates beyond the moment's urgency ("transfix the very dust motes"), and the phrase "the rebellion of a woman whose own body betrayed her" reads slightly essayistic. No dialogue present. Perceptual signature is consistent: Helena notices architectural details and emotional stakes in equal measure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and most sentences advance story or atmosphere. However, several passages loop or overwrite: "She was claustrophobic, yes. She was afraid of small spaces and tight corners and the feeling of walls closing in" recycles prior content without added pressure. "Spatial mutiny" appears twice as a label. The phrase "transfix the very dust motes suspended in the moonbeams" stacks modifiers where simpler prose would sharpen. Filter verbs ("felt the vibration," "thought of her grandmother") are present but voice-motivated. Clarity and propulsion hold overall, with minor density loss in reflective passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The claustrophobic treasure-hunter premise is familiar; the transformation comes through the specific grandmother connection and the organ-as-key mechanism. "Spatial mutiny" as a coined phrase attempts freshness but is stated rather than embodied. The compass point separated from its body and the resonance-lock are concrete, specific details that elevate above generic quest structure. The ending's wistful tone and the grandmother's absence provide emotional specificity, though the final peace declaration edges toward sentiment. No close echoes of famous work detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Helena is present throughout and her claustrophobia constrains the crawl choice (middle beat). Setup occurs early (paragraph one). The final archive moment involves her photographing documents, but the decision to proceed through the passage was already made; the ending is consequence rather than a new claustrophobic choice. Two beats: initial framing and the crawl. Closure participation is observational (sitting, photographing) rather than a choice that tests claustrophobia again. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (crawl) +0.8, closure linkage weak +0.2, swappability (could be another phobia) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The compass point appears in paragraph four (early setup), Helena clutches it during the crawl (middle beat), and inserts it into the lock mechanism to open the archives (closure beat). Three distinct beats +1.4, early signal +0.6, causal pressure (unlocks door) +1.2, closure linkage (final action before discovery) +1.4, specificity (separated from compass body, shaped for this lock) +0.6. Total pushes toward 8+; slight swappability (any small tool could theoretically work if reshaped) −0.3 rounds down to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Spatial mutiny" is named twice as a label but does not shape tactics or alter Helena's options on the page beyond serving as thematic echo. The crawl is the only moment where rebellion against spatial limits changes a choice, and that beat would function identically if framed as "courage" or "determination." Setup as label paragraph three, no middle development as mechanic, mentioned again near end (closure participation weak). Ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.7, label-only −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Prudently adventurous in her calculations of risk versus revelation" appears once as a descriptive label in paragraph one. No later beat demonstrates this trait constraining or enabling an action with visible cost; Helena's choices read as determined rather than calculated. Missing middle development gate (cap 3.4) and missing closure participation gate (cap 2.8); lowest cap 2.8 applies. Label-only −0.3, but presence in first paragraph +0.3 and swappability moderate −0.5 nudge within the cap band yields 3.8 (round down from attempted 3.9 under gate ceiling resistance).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Transfix" appears when the organ chord's purity seems "to transfix the very dust motes," a metaphorical use rather than a physical action that alters Helena's state or the plot's direction. The organ moment is pivotal (reveals the passage), but "transfix" itself is ornamental description rather than the mechanism. Setup present (organ scene middle third), beat involvement (organ moment) one beat +0.4, no closure use, swappability (could write "suspend" or "freeze") −0.7, summary/decorative −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The organ reverberation is seeded in paragraph four via grandmother's journals, executed in paragraphs eight and nine (specific chord sequence causes stone panel to open), and directly enables the middle turn. Setup early +0.6, one distinct beat (organ sequence) +0.4, causal pressure (unlocks passage) +1.1, specificity (frequencies, chord names) +0.5, closure linkage indirect (enables path to lock) +0.4. Missing direct closure participation (organ not present at final lock) −0.3, but strong middle mechanics support 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Shadowed nexus under starlight" frames the opening and closing (dawn pales the sky through a crack). It provides atmospheric anchor but does not constrain choices or supply resources that alter outcome; the actual pressure comes from the narrow passage and belltower, which are distinct locations. Setup paragraph one +0.4, lyric reprise (starlight to dawn) +0.6, ornamental framing −0.7, swappability (any ruin descriptor) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Autumn's fallow period" appears in paragraph one and again in the final paragraph ("fallow fields"). No on-page choice is tightened by seasonal time; the night-to-dawn window provides mild urgency, but "fallow period" itself is descriptive rather than a constraint that alters tactics. Setup present +0.3, closure mention (final line) +0.3, ornamental use −0.8, swappability (any season) −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quest to find the Meridian Key and unlock the archives drives every choice: approaching the cathedral, playing the organ, crawling through the passage, inserting the compass point. Setup paragraph two +0.7, three beats (cathedral, organ, lock) +1.4, causal pressure throughout +1.4, closure linkage (archives opened) +1.3, cost present (claustrophobic crawl, grandmother's absence) +0.5. Slightly generic (treasure quest) −0.4 yields 7.6 after rounding.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Wistful rebellion" is articulated late ("wistful rebellion against time itself") but the tone is present earlier in Helena's grief-tinged determination and the phrase "negotiate with her fear." Tone modulates with pressure (tightens during crawl, opens for reflection at end) and charges the final image of church bells and peace. Setup implicit early, tone label stated late (second third) −0.3, modulation across beats +0.8, closure charge (bells, grandmother's peace) +1.2, coherence +0.6, late explicit naming −0.4 rounds to 6.7.</comment>
