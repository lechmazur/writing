<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The guardian's silence, her use of the dental mirror, and her shutter-weaving are grounded in backstory and consistently embodied through selective perception. Her motivation to prevent another drowning is earned, and the final choice—remaining at her post after the boy leaves—constitutes Earned Stasis with visible cost (ongoing vigil, unresolved grief). The boy's interiority is limited to observation, reducing the interplay that would elevate this to high 8s. Minor deduction for the phrase "spiralingly calm" appearing twice as a label without dramatized contradiction in-scene.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the guardian's patterns build density and cadence through shutter manipulation until the boy's departure reweights the vigil. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she remains, the canal "no longer sounding hungry," and "secrets…better left half-spoken" crystallizes her stance with felt cost. Orientation anchors (cobalt dock, canal, guardian's position) land early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy shifts attention from water to light patterns, and the cost (ongoing solitary vigil) is legible in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The cobalt dock, canal water, and boathouse shutters are vividly rendered and purposefully filtered through the guardian's professional bias (dental mirror, meticulous habits). The shutters constrain her method and charge the final image when "real stars…replace her artificial ones." Sensory detail (rain-pooled planks, "stillwater tension," scattered diamonds on water) supports pressure without catalog listing. Minor cap due to slight spatial vagueness regarding the boy's exact position relative to the guardian during the shutter sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is clear: prevent the boy from succumbing to the same darkness that took her brother. One meaningful tightening occurs when the boy watches the light patterns and his attention shifts from the canal's depths. The guardian's silence and shutter-weaving constitute constrained agency, and the boy's departure with a raised hand forecloses immediate danger with visible cost (her ongoing vigil, unresolved grief). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme—darkness as canvas, silent witness as intervention—emerges from the shutter patterns and the guardian's vigil without meta-commentary. The dental mirror and "half-spoken secret" motif recur with reweighted meaning at closure: "some secrets were better left half-spoken because their completion existed in how we chose to live with them." The final image (real stars replacing artificial ones, canal no longer hungry) offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Minor deduction for one phrase ("This was how she taught darkness the value of stars") that edges toward thematic echo, though it remains grounded in on-page action.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature (meticulous noticing, dental mirror as tool, silence as language) consistently filtering all detail. Distance modulates purposefully: close during shutter manipulation, wider during the boy's departure. Diction ("stillwater tension," "spiralingly calm") is voice-motivated and rhythmically controlled under pressure. Minor deduction for one instance of elevated register ("acknowledgment…promise that being witnessed was enough") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon, and the recycled phrase "spiralingly calm" appearing twice without fresh texture.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; information density is high (the dental mirror simultaneously anchors grief, profession, and method). Line-level clarity is strong, with no major loops or scaffold. Deductions: "spiralingly calm" appears twice as an unearned adverb phrase; "the darkness was courting him" and "the darkness that had whispered to her brother" abstract a concrete threat into metaphor without fresh vehicle; and "Something passed between them that words would have only diminished" is a telling summary that could be cut for tighter closure. These stack to −0.6 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The premise—silent guardian using light patterns to intervene—offers a fresh angle on grief-vigil narratives. The dental mirror and boathouse shutters are specific, grounded choices that avoid cliché. The emotional arc (silent witness as lifeline) synthesizes familiar material through the particular method of shutter-weaving and the earned stasis closure. Deduction for moderate proximity to "lighthouse keeper" and "silent mentor" templates; the transformation is present but not yet fully irreplaceable. No bold structural risk attempted.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The silent canal guardian is established in paragraph one, drives the shutter-weaving in the middle beats, and her decision to remain at her post anchors the closure (Earned Stasis). Her choices (positioning, mirror use, shutter adjustment) create the key turn when the boy shifts attention from water to light. Visible cost: ongoing vigil, unresolved grief, "spiralingly calm" as constrained stance. All three gates present; causal pressure and closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The dental mirror appears in paragraph three (backstory anchor) and again when the guardian directs a beam to the boy's chest (closure beat). Two distinct beats. However, its function is largely symbolic (grief token, professional link) rather than mechanically necessary; the shutter patterns could achieve the intervention without the mirror. Swappability moderate; closure linkage present but not indispensable. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Silent empathy shapes the guardian's entire method: no words, only light patterns and presence. It constrains her tactics (she "did not call out") and drives the key turn (the boy's shift from suicidal focus to witnessing beauty). Closure directly articulates the concept: "being witnessed was enough" and "silence could carry kindness." All three gates met; causal pressure high; closure linkage explicit. Cost: her ongoing silence, unresolved grief.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>"Spiralingly calm" appears twice as a label (first shutter pattern, final vigil description) but does not demonstrably constrain an on-page choice or create visible tradeoff. The phrase gestures toward the guardian's controlled state and the spiral motif, yet removing it would not break story logic. Setup and payoff gates met (first and final paragraphs); development gate missing. Lyric reprise with modest reweighting; reaches mid-5s on resonance alone.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>"Weave" appears explicitly ("weaving meaning into the geometric play," "wove increasingly complex patterns") and implicitly structures the middle sequence where the guardian adjusts shutters to create constellations, spirals, and faces. The action enables the boy's attention shift and charges the closure image (real stars replacing artificial patterns). All three gates met; two distinct beats; causal pressure and closure linkage strong. Slightly swappable with "arrange" or "compose" but the textile/tactile connotation fits the meticulous craft theme.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Creating patterns with shutters is signaled early ("wooden shutters that lined its face…Each shutter could be angled independently"), drives the entire middle sequence (spiral, scattered diamonds, constellation, face/hand), and shapes the closure when "real stars emerged to replace her artificial ones." Mechanics matter: independent angling enables varied communication. All three gates met; three beats; causal pressure high; irreplaceability strong (method is specific to boathouse architecture). Cost: ongoing solitary practice, unspoken language.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The cobalt dock after rain anchors every scene: water-pooled planks, the junction of old waterway and concrete channels, "stillwater tension," mooring posts. The setting supplies the boathouse shutters (resource) and the dangerous canal water (pressure on the boy). Rain's cessation is noted ("after rain," "rain's final touch," "when the rain stopped") and charges the atmosphere. All three gates met; environment constrains tactics and charges closure image. Slightly generic "dock at dusk" frame lowers irreplaceability to mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>"Within the edge of a half-spoken secret" is established early (her brother's last words, paragraph two) and recurs at closure ("some secrets were better left half-spoken"). However, it functions as thematic frame rather than live temporal pressure; no countdown or decision window tightens. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate (mid-scene tightening) missing. Lyric reprise without causal urgency caps score near the 5.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>"To teach darkness the value of stars" is dramatized on the page: the guardian creates light patterns to shift the boy's focus, and the closure image (real stars replacing artificial ones) reweights the motivation. Friction between the guardian's grief and her vigil duty is implicit (cost: ongoing silence, unresolved loss). Setup (shutter practice, "spiralingly calm"), development (shutter sequence), and payoff (boy's departure, continued vigil) all present. Causal pressure and closure linkage strong; visible cost legible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>"Stillwater tension" is named early ("canal water held that peculiar stillwater tension") and sustained through "overcast sky," "darkness gathering thickest," the boy's hunched intensity, and the guardian's controlled vigilance. Tone modulates with pressure: calm description → the boy's danger → shutter intervention → quiet resolution. Final image ("canal whispered…no longer sounding hungry") reweights tension into release without resolving ambiguity. Coherent through turns; charges closure; high integration.</comment>
