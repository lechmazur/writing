<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Helena's motivations are rooted in specific backstory (copyist background, memorized architecture of music) and present through concrete micro-choices: adjusting the dial when patrols approach, embedding coordinates via symphonic fragments. The "dust remembers" metaphor occasionally slips toward abstraction, but her diligent habit of weaving coded messages and the physical handling of equipment keep her grounded. Internal contradiction appears in her initial strangeness about teaching dust versus her later peace with thorns, though this reads as evolution rather than inconsistency. The final composing of tomorrow's broadcast shows endurance with visible cost (isolation, risk) rather than decisive change, meeting the Earned Stasis bar.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Helena continues broadcasting despite risk, and the piece demonstrates that memory is "banked, waiting for someone diligent enough to coax it back to flame." Cost is visible in her solitary life, constant patrol evasion, and the ongoing danger. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density builds through examples (blacksmith humming, children drawing) and the cadence shifts at the ending from broadcast urgency to quiet resolve. One friction: the "dust learning to speak/remember" metaphor drifts slightly abstract in places, but the concrete broadcast mechanics and listener responses anchor it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ember alcove and mist function as tactical constraints: the mist's thickness determines broadcast safety, and the alcove's hidden glow enables secrecy. Sensory detail is selective (orange glow, velvet-heavy mist, fox passing) and filtered through Helena's priorities. The micro-setting (radio dial as tool, alcove as refuge) charges the final image when dawn approaches and patrols return. One slip: "thistled calm" in the shepherd tale feels decorative rather than spatially grounded, and the village/port examples (Thornwick, Sallow Bay) are named but not inhabited.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—keeping stories alive under authoritarian suppression—is signaled early and tightens when the fox noise interrupts and patrols sweep closer. Helena's agency appears in micro-adjustments (frequency dial, embedding coordinates) and the final commitment to compose tomorrow's broadcast despite ongoing risk. One meaningful deepening occurs when listeners begin creating their own stories (children drawing, blacksmith humming), showing the broadcast's cumulative effect. Cost is legible: isolation, constant danger, and the foreclosed path of a safer, silent life. No secondary reversals are required at this length, and the escalation fits the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: dust as carrier of memory, stories as resistance, the shepherd tale's "lost is itself a kind of finding" mirroring Helena's solitary work. The final image—memory as "fire that could never be fully extinguished—only banked"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the embedded symphonic codes and the contrast between authorities hearing "only a strange woman telling children's tales" while families gather in secret. One friction: "dust remembers" occasionally edges toward assertion rather than embodied demonstration, though the blacksmith and children examples ground it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance; Helena's perceptual signature (copyist's precision, symphonic vocabulary) is distinct. Diction stays controlled: "thistled calm," "amber light casting shadows," "velvet" mist. Free indirect style is clean ("her motivation had seemed strange even to her at first"). One friction: the phrase "breadcrumbs along the mountain paths" feels slightly generic for this voice, and "authorities heard only a strange woman" shifts briefly toward omniscient certainty without dramatized evidence. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the broadcast mechanics (dial adjustment, frequency sweep, three-note Beethoven signal). One loop appears: "dust was learning to speak again" in mid-story and "The dust had learned to speak" near the end paraphrase without added pressure. A second template-cadence run: "In the village... In the port town..." constructions mechanically cycle examples. "Story famine" and "Silence Decrees" are established early and reused efficiently. Clarity remains high throughout; no major figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—pirate radio broadcasting coded stories under authoritarian suppression—is familiar dystopian material but gains specificity through the copyist's symphonic codes (Mahler = supply drop, Debussy = safe house) and the "dust remembers" metaphor. The shepherd-and-stars tale within the frame offers a fresh inflection on the meta-story. Risk-taking is modest: the structure is straightforward, and the emotional arc follows a predictable resistance-narrative template. Transformation test: swapping names and removing the symphonic codes would weaken but not collapse the arc, suggesting mid-range freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "diligent orchestra copyist" background shapes Helena's tactics throughout: her hands "memorizing the architecture of music" enables the symphonic code system, and her careful embedding of coordinates/dates via Mahler and Debussy fragments drives multiple beats. Setup occurs early (second paragraph), development appears in the broadcast mechanics (adjusting dial, embedding codes), and payoff surfaces when listeners begin humming melodies and when the final paragraph invokes her "diligent enough to coax" memory back to flame. Cost is visible in her isolation and risk. Specificity is high; a generic "musician" could not execute this exact system.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shortwave radio dial appears in at least three beats: initial broadcast setup ("twisted the dial," "amber light"), mid-story frequency adjustment as patrols sweep, and final power-down ("radio dial's glow fading like a closing eye"). The "secretly luminous, modified to emit no visible light from outside" attribute constrains her tactics (broadcast only in mist) and charges the closure image (dial as closing eye). Setup is early, development shows tactical adjustment under pressure, and payoff appears in the final dimming. Swappability is low; the dial's specific luminous secrecy matters.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Pirate broadcast" frames the entire narrative: Helena's transmission is illegal, coded, and tactical. Setup occurs in paragraph four ("pirate broadcast had found its frequency"), development drives the embedding of coordinates via song lyrics and the evasion of patrol scanners, and closure hinges on her commitment to "tomorrow's broadcast" despite ongoing risk. The concept shapes stakes (authoritarian suppression, discovery risk) and tactics (frequency adjustment, mist timing) across multiple beats. Removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Secretly luminous" (the dial "modified to emit no visible light from outside the alcove") constrains Helena's tactics: she broadcasts only when mist cloaks the signal. Setup appears early (paragraph four), development shows the mist-timing decision, and payoff occurs when dawn approaches and she powers down to avoid detection. The trait enables one key tactic (mist-cloak timing) and is mentioned in the final dimming image. Cost is tied to the timing constraint (limited broadcast windows). Specificity is moderate; a generic "hidden" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Cloak" appears implicitly in the mist that "cloak[s] her signal from the patrol scanners" and explicitly shapes her decision to broadcast only when mist is heavy. Setup is early (mist description, signal cloaking), development shows her waiting for thick mist and adjusting frequency as patrols sweep, and payoff occurs when the mist begins to thin and she signs off. The action constrains one major beat (timing the broadcast) but does not drive a turn or redefine options at closure. Swappability is moderate; "hide" or "conceal" could replace with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Via elusive song lyrics" is the method by which Helena encodes tactical information: "A phrase from Mahler's Fourth meant a supply drop near the eastern ridge. A fragment of Debussy signaled a safe house had opened in the valley." Setup occurs mid-story (the symphonic code is explained), development drives the broadcast beat (she embeds coordinates via these fragments), and payoff appears when listeners recognize the codes and act (supply drops, safe houses). The method shapes her copyist background and is indispensable to her resistance tactics. Removing it would break the causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "ember alcove" provides warmth and concealment; the mist supplies tactical cover for the broadcast. Setup is immediate (opening line), development shows the mist-timing constraint and the alcove's hidden location ("a woman living alone in a hillside cave, seemingly harmless"), and closure returns to the alcove as she watches mist dissolve into morning. The alcove constrains one choice (location secrecy) and the mist constrains another (broadcast timing). Both are present in the final image, though their causal pressure is moderate. Swappability is low for the mist, moderate for the alcove.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"After the story famine" establishes the temporal setting: "Three years had passed since the Silence Decrees." Setup is early (paragraph two), development appears in Helena's memory of her pre-famine copyist work and the present broadcast resistance, and closure invokes the famine ending ("one whispered tale at a time"). The timeframe shapes motivation (memory of a time before suppression) and stakes (ongoing authoritarian control) but does not impose a live clock that alters tactics beat-to-beat. It functions as context rather than urgent constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To teach dust to tell stories" is Helena's stated motivation: "dust was what remained of everything—books, bodies, buildings, dreams." Setup appears in paragraph six ("this compulsion to teach dust to tell stories"), development shows her weaving tales and the dust "learning to speak again" through listener responses, and closure lands on "The dust had learned to speak. Now it was learning to remember." The motivation is dramatized through the broadcast choices and listener effects (blacksmith, children). Cost is visible in her isolation and risk. One friction: the metaphor occasionally drifts abstract rather than remaining embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Thistled calm" describes Helena's voice and stance: "the thistled calm of someone who had made peace with thorns, who understood that beauty and pain grew from the same root." Setup appears mid-story during the shepherd tale, tone modulates with pressure (the fox interruption creates a breath-catch, patrols sweeping closer tighten urgency), and closure returns to calm resolve as she watches mist dissolve and composes tomorrow's broadcast. The tone charges the final image (quiet endurance despite danger). Coherence is strong; the oxymoron holds across beats.</comment>
