<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Helena's motivation is clear and her interior life is concrete—she traces the worry stone repeatedly, remembers teaching moments—but her choices on the page feel observational rather than conflicted. The exile backstory and teaching philosophy are told with specificity, yet no contradictory impulse complicates her present stance; she arrives decided and leaves affirmed. The final walk back carries stated melancholy but no visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority leans toward summary of her philosophy rather than embodied pressure in the nexus moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: Helena's night at the nexus accumulates sensory and reflective density toward a closure image of renewal and shared mission. Orientation anchors (exiled tutor, magnetic nexus, twilight) arrive early. The closure is Charged Poise—she leaves with journal and resolve to find another exile—but the cost remains asserted rather than demonstrated; no live option is foreclosed on the page, and the "game continues" line summarizes rather than reconfigures. One meaningful deepening (her realization that the covenant can renew in "two hearts") occurs, but it arrives via reflection rather than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is vivid and purposeful: iron-rich boulders, spinning compass needles, electromagnetic hum, and the basalt worry stone all anchor the scene with sensory specificity. The setting constrains her choice to wait and document through the night, and the magnetic field's pulse acknowledges her presence at closure. Spatial choreography is clean—flat stone, boulders as sentinels, moon rising east. The worry stone functions as micro-setting, warming in her grip and charging the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—renew the eclipsed covenant by documenting the nexus—is signaled early and coherent under the Accumulative lens. However, no on-page reversal or external pressure tests her commitment; she arrives, waits, writes, and departs as planned. The memory of her exiled student and the knight-sacrifice lesson add thematic texture but do not narrow present options. Agency is present (she chooses to document and to seek another exile) but the cost is future-facing and told rather than felt. One deepening occurs when she realizes she must "correlate her loneliness with theirs," yet it lacks immediate friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the knight sacrifice, the dent in the worry stone, the covenant "eclipsed not by betrayal but by forgetting." The story resists moralizing and allows "defeat contained its own terrible beauty" to arise through memory and image rather than assertion. The final image—carrying beauty born from exile "like a torch against the dark"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of preserving wisdom against institutional forgetting. Minor slip: "hopeful melancholy" is named repeatedly rather than shown through contradictory sensory detail, and the "game continues" line edges toward thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Helena's chess-tutor lens filters the nexus through strategic vocabulary ("correlating," "translating," "variations") and the basalt stone's dent is noticed with tactile specificity. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider reflection. Minor slips: some filter verbs ("She could feel," "She had been thoughtfully precise") dull immediacy, and the phrase "translating silence into understanding" recurs without fresh embodiment. Diction remains within Helena's plausible lexicon; no head-hopping or tense drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with strong images: "twilight painted the sky in bruised violets," "basalt absorbed the twilight rather than reflecting it." Information density is high in the opening third. However, paraphrase loops appear: "translating silence into understanding" / "translating silence into connection," and "thoughtfully precise" recurs as a label without fresh dramatization. Template cadence in the middle ("She began translating... She pulled out... She pressed her thumb...") and the phrase "Before the next phase... After the next phase" create mechanical symmetry. No filter-verb stacks or register drift, but the loops touch non-closure beats and lower momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess pedagogy, magnetic nexus, and covenant renewal is specific and purposeful, avoiding stock exile-and-return templates. The worry stone's dent and the knight-sacrifice lesson personalize Helena's philosophy. However, the core emotional arc—solitary teacher affirms her wisdom and vows to find a successor—follows a recognizable template without a non-obvious turn. The magnetic nexus and eclipsed covenant feel ornamental; their mechanics do not constrain her choices on the page. Risk-taking is modest; the piece commits fully to its reflective mode but does not subvert or heighten stakes in unexpected ways.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Helena is present throughout and her past decisions (teaching forbidden variations, walking three days) frame the story. On the page, however, her choices are observational: she settles, listens, writes, and departs. No key turn results from a difficult present decision; the resolve to find another exile is stated rather than tested. Present by setup, minimal middle development, absent from a causal closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The worry stone appears in at least three beats: initial pocket trace, held up at twilight to watch shadow, final thumb press with smile. Its dent is specific and charged with meaning (ten thousand matches). However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as a comfort object whose meaning remains static. The final reprise reweights the tone but not the stakes. Setup strong, closure reprise present, middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The eclipsed covenant frames the premise and is explained in backstory: old masters' silence until stars align. Helena's mission is to renew it by documenting the nexus. Yet the covenant's mechanics never constrain a present choice; it remains abstract thematic architecture. She arrives knowing what to do and executes without friction. Present by setup, absent from middle pressure, mentioned at closure but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully precise" is named twice and shown in her preparation (correlating maps, astronomical charts, translating marginalia) and her night documentation. However, it does not create on-page friction or enable a tactical choice under pressure. It characterizes her method but does not alter outcomes or force a trade-off. Label-heavy, minimal cost, late reprise without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Correlate" appears in multiple beats: she correlates maps and charts before arrival, correlates sensations with symbols while writing, and resolves to "correlate her loneliness" with another exile's. The final usage shifts meaning slightly (loneliness → connection) but the action itself is intellectual and summarized rather than dramatized. Present throughout, shapes the ending thematically, but does not create a key turn or visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Translating silence" is named in two beats: midpoint ("translating silence into understanding") and near closure ("translating silence into connection"). The method is abstract and not mechanically demonstrated; we see her write but not how she translates silence. It frames her approach but does not constrain tactics or create friction. Signaled by midpoint, present at closure, but the mechanics remain ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is established early with vivid detail (compass needles spin, earth hums, iron boulders, electromagnetic whisper) and constrains her choice to wait and document through the night. The setting's pulse "acknowledges her presence" at closure, charging the final image. It supplies the resource (silent forces she must interpret) and shapes her tactics (settling, listening, waiting for revelation). Setup strong, middle pressure present, closure linkage clear.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Before the next phase" is mentioned twice (setup and near closure) and creates mild urgency: she must document "before the next phase of the moon." However, the timeframe is vague (one night? weeks?) and does not tighten on-page decisions; she completes her task within "the night's first hour" with no clock pressure. Present by setup, absent from middle escalation, mentioned at closure without tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Helena's desire to discover beauty in difficulty is dramatized through the knight-sacrifice memory and her refusal to let chess become "merely winning." It motivates her exile and her mission to renew the covenant. However, no present choice enacts this desire with friction; she affirms rather than tests it. The motivation shapes backstory and theme but does not create on-page conflict between wants and costs. Present by setup, drives premise, static at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Hopeful melancholy" is named explicitly and embodied through contrasts: "bittersweet knowledge that some endings contained seeds of beginning," smiling at the darkening sky while carrying exile's cost. Tone modulates with the scene's rhythm (violet twilight → full darkness → moonrise) and charges the final image of walking "hopeful and melancholy and finally at peace." Coherent throughout, supports closure, minor penalty for direct labeling rather than purely embodied delivery.</comment>
