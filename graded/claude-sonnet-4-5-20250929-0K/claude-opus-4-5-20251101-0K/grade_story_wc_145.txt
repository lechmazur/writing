<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is rooted in concrete professional obsession and personal void, with embodied loneliness ("competence had never been enough to make her lovable"). Her internal contradiction—seeking answerable geographic truth to compensate for unanswerable personal loss—drives the journey with visible cost. The micro-choices (checking GPS, instructing Volkov about the green folder) reveal hierarchy of values. Minor slip: the backstory about daughter and wife, while anchoring present stance, skirts diagnostic phrasing ("Why competence had never been enough") without full embodiment in a high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal elements. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: Maren walks north toward an unmapped source, trusting that "finding it would be enough"—a crystallized stance that forecloses return with felt cost (the twelve-day instruction to Volkov, the physical risk). The piece deepens through recurring condensation/water imagery that reweights meaning at the end. One meaningful tightening occurs when the falcon's return confirms the brief window, narrowing her options and forcing immediate departure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and ice-crystal details are vivid and purposeful. The condensation-on-glass moment becomes a micro-setting that constrains Maren's method ("moisture gathered differently where the glass was scratched versus smooth"). Spatial choreography is clear (outpost interior to lake surface), and the environment subtly guides the final choice (ice holding, passage open). Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities (she reads condensation patterns as diagnostic). The setting charges the final image without becoming a postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>One dominant stake—documenting the Selenga's true headwaters—is signaled early and tightened when the falcon returns, opening a brief window. The tightening forecloses the option of waiting: "three days, perhaps four" creates live urgency. Agency is Maren's decision to walk north despite mortal risk, foreclosing safety with on-page cost (the twelve-day fail-safe instruction, physical exposure). Volkov's warnings complicate without resolving. The price is unmistakable in the final paragraph: she commits to the unmarked ice with no guarantee of return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from condensation imagery, the phrasebook's mistranslation ("the place where water remembers its purpose"), and Maren's personal void driving geographic obsession. The final image—walking toward "the source of something, trusting that finding it would be enough"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of origins without moralizing. The contrast between mappable rivers and unmappable personal loss creates meaningful ambiguity. The particulars (seventeen-day wait, forty-three incorrect atlases, subtly confident red pen) anchor the theme in scene work rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Perceptual signature is distinct: Maren notices condensation differentials, phrasebook mistranslations, and ice vocabulary as a cartographer would. Dialogue (Volkov's exchanges) carries subtext and advances conflict; his "worrying tranquility" contrasts with Maren's resolve. Diction stays within her professional-scholarly register without drift. The prose rhythm modulates effectively: longer, reflective sentences in the outpost compress to shorter declaratives on the ice. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph structure breathes. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "rivers had origins you could stand in" delivers motive, metaphor, and stakes simultaneously). Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled and coherent: condensation-on-glass, ice groaning "its ancient vocabulary," breath as "small temporary clouds" all serve the accumulative water/memory pattern. One minor register lift: "subtly confident resolve" in the penultimate paragraph reads slightly elevated for the moment's urgency, but does not obscure the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of geographic obsession and personal void through the condensation/water-memory motif feels specific and earned. The mistranslated phrasebook detail and the forty-three-atlas error anchor originality in verifiable professional texture. The ending avoids both neat resolution and forced ambiguity, instead offering a quiet, risk-committed departure. Trope transformation: the lone-scientist-in-wilderness frame gains freshness through Maren's professional precision and the accumulative imagery. Risk-taking in the ending's restraint heightens stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (dry-witted atlas editor) is present throughout and drives the key decision to walk north. Her professional voice ("Rivers don't begin where you want them to") and the detail about correcting atlases with "subtly confident strokes" establish wit and competence early. The decision to depart—instructing Volkov about the green folder, shouldering the pack—is causally rooted in her character and alters tactics (she commits to the ice despite known risk). The trait shapes the closure: she walks north "with the subtly confident resolve of someone who had stopped asking permission." Strong integration across setup, middle choice, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The phrasebook with its dog-eared page appears twice: on the desk where Maren notes the mistranslation, then slipped into her pack before departure. The mistranslation detail ("the place where water remembers its purpose") seeds the thematic resonance but does not constrain a tactical choice on the page. The object is present at setup and carried forward but does not return with reweighted meaning at closure. Functional across two beats but not indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Singular convergence" is named explicitly ("This was her singular convergence—the moment when timing, terrain, and terrible stubbornness aligned") and shapes the dominant stake: the brief window when the northern passage opens. It drives the decision to leave immediately rather than wait, altering tactics and foreclosing safety. The concept charges the ending, where Maren commits to the convergence despite mortal risk. Present early, it narrows options in the middle and defines the final image. Strong causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Subtly confident" appears twice: first in the backstory about her red-pen corrections, then in the penultimate paragraph describing her resolve. The trait enables the decision to walk north without external permission and constrains her reaction to Volkov's warnings (she dismisses them with professional certainty). The cost is implicit in the final commitment: confidence drives her onto unmarked ice. The trait is embodied in action (shouldering the pack, ignoring doubt) rather than labeled only. Setup and payoff are clear, with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Herald" appears once in dialogue ("Someone has to herald the correction") and frames Maren's mission as announcement rather than discovery alone. The word choice colors her motive but does not create a major turn; she could pursue correction without the herald framing. The action is thematic rather than tactically decisive. Present and logically consistent but not essential to the story's structure; the journey toward the headwaters would proceed identically without this specific verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The condensation-on-glass pattern is introduced early ("She pressed her fingertip to the window and drew a line through the condensation, tracing the route the falcon had flown") and explicitly tied to her method: "moisture gathered differently where the glass was scratched versus smooth. The same principle applied to watersheds." It shapes her interpretive lens and charges the thematic closure (water following paths of least resistance, scars in geography). The method appears in two beats—observation at the window, then internalized principle—and is essential to her professional epistemology. Strong integration across setup, middle, and thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The rusted outpost by the frozen lake is established in the opening paragraphs and provides spatial grounding throughout. It supplies resources (the falcon's perch, communications, the green folder) and pressures the departure: the outpost is "the last waypoint before the unmapped territories," making Maren's northward walk the only option for reaching the headwaters. The frozen lake accepts her weight in the closing beat, becoming the literal path forward. The setting constrains tactics (limited window, no alternative route) and charges the final image (outpost lights fading, ice holding). Essential across setup, middle, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the falcon returns" anchors the story's present and creates urgency: Maren has been waiting seventeen days, and the falcon's return signals a three-to-four-day window before the ice closes again. The twelve-day instruction to Volkov establishes a deadline that tightens the departure decision. Time is tracked and shapes tactics (she must leave immediately). The constraint is live and visible, though not micro-managed beat-to-beat. Strong integration in setup and middle; the ending references the window implicitly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"To find where the rivers begin" is dramatized throughout: the Selenga mistranslation detail, the forty-three incorrect atlases, and the personal void driving the quest. The motivation is conflicted on the page—Maren admits rivers are answerable because personal questions (daughter, wife, lovability) are not—and the friction between professional obsession and personal loss charges every choice. The desire forecloses safety at closure: she walks north trusting that "finding it would be enough" despite knowing she may not return. Setup, middle friction, and ending are all tied to this motive with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Worrying tranquility" is established through Volkov's voice ("the worrying tranquility of a man who had stopped being surprised by death") and sustained in the outpost's "worryingly peaceful" lights against the white expanse. The tone coheres through turns: calm professionalism in the opening, quiet resolve in the departure, and restrained dread in the final image ("The ice held. The silence held"). It modulates with pressure—tightening as Maren commits to the unmarked ice—and charges the ending without breaking into overt anxiety. Strong tonal control across the arc.</comment>
