<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mariam's interiority is concrete and embodied through somatic markers, though some passages lean toward diagnostic self-awareness ("she'd learned to track her body's signals through somatic markers"). Internal contradiction appears genuinely in the hawk freeze moment where panic and rational naming coexist. The final choice to continue tending seedlings carries visible cost—acknowledging pain's persistence—but the trajectory from photograph ritual to greenhouse feels more like textured endurance than a decision that forecloses a competing path. Therapy-speak in peak beats ("somatic markers," "freeze response") edges toward label-only interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accumulates through layered memory, sensory anchoring, and the photograph ritual until the final seedling image reweights the dominant stake (survival vs. despair). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—specifically Earned Stasis—where Mariam's return to the greenhouse with "each one a small vote for the future" forecloses retreat into paralysis, with the cost legible in "not the absence of pain, but the presence of something larger." The cost is felt rather than dramatic, fitting the lens. One friction: the hawk freeze feels like a discrete beat rather than causally tightening options toward the ending, making escalation more textural than driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The arboretum setting constrains choice throughout: salt-blasted soil demands specific patience, the cliff's edge mirrors precariousness, and the orchids' stress signals parallel Mariam's own. The photograph as micro-object charges both the opening ritual and the final image of seedlings as counter-ballast. Sensory detail is purposeful—fog, soil texture, hawk overhead—and filtered through trauma-attuned perception. The lighthouse keeper's ghost anchors the timeframe and thematic recursion (human witness vs. automated systems). Small friction: "black rocks, white foam, the endless gray-green water" at noon reads slightly postcard-like, but the detail recovers by connecting to "horizons she'd never see."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Mariam can anchor optimism without false hope—is signaled early and sustained. The hawk freeze provides one meaningful tightening where the body's freeze response tests her somatic toolkit, and her recovery narrows options (she must stay present or collapse). The photograph ritual deepens rather than reverses, moving from Fatima's face to the earrings as iterative reweighting. Agency reads as endurance and micro-choice (tucking the photograph away, picking up tools), fitting Earned Stasis. The cost is legible in the acknowledgment that "the world could grow gentler. She also believed it might not." One gap: the escalation is more accumulative density than causal pressure—no live option is foreclosed until the very end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the photograph, the orchids, and the pearl-of-stillness formulation without overt moralizing. The final image—"seedlings waited in their careful rows, each one a small vote for the future"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether survival can coexist with grief. The crescent earrings ("The dead lived in the living") and the extinct lighthouse keeper both function as recurring motifs that reweight rather than decorate. One small slip: "quietly talented" in the evaluation and the line "She believed the world could grow gentler. She also believed it might not" edge close to thematic echo, though they stop short of sermonizing. The piece resists false comfort and embraces complexity without hedging.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during the freeze, wider when surveying the coastline). Perceptual signature is strong: Mariam notices stress signals in plants because she reads them in herself. Some diction slips toward clinical register mid-crisis ("somatic markers," "freeze response claiming her nervous system like a hostile country") where embodied sensation would sharpen voice under pressure. The simile "like a hostile country" and "like tide water receding" are vivid but slightly elevated for the moment's urgency. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Sentence rhythm varies, though a few template stems appear ("She placed one hand... She counted... She extracted").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean and propulsive with strong imagery ("salt-blasted soil," "pearl of stillness," "small vote for the future"). Information density is high; most lines do double duty. Two friction points: mild paraphrase loop in "The hawk was just a hawk. The sky held only weather" repeating the reassurance structure, and a cluster of filter verbs during the freeze beat ("She felt that warmth," "She placed," "She counted") that slightly dull immediacy. The line "everything she'd known had been reorganized into categories of before and after" is vivid but leans abstract. The final paragraph's rhythm effectively decelerates to match closure. No major loops or scaffold, but the figurative density in the opening third (rusted watering can as ghost trace, orchids as survivors) occasionally slows momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of PTSD recovery, horticulture as metaphor, and refugee survival is specific and non-obvious, avoiding trauma-recovery templates through the arboretum's concrete anchoring and the somatic-marker toolkit. The photograph ritual and the pearl-of-stillness formulation offer fresh angles on grief work. Two constraints: the "wedding destroyed by airstrike" premise is widely used in contemporary literary fiction, and the piece does not fully transform it—Fatima remains a catalyst rather than a dimensional presence. The orchid-as-survivor parallel, while apt, trends toward expected metaphor. The piece's strength lies in execution and voice rather than structural risk; the ending is quiet and earned but not bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The survivor identity is seeded immediately ("the wedding that ended in fire from a cloudless sky") and drives every beat: the photograph ritual, the freeze response to the hawk, the decision to continue tending seedlings. The final choice—returning to the orchids tomorrow—is shaped by survivor agency (voting for the future despite uncertainty). The attribute constrains tactics (she cannot ignore aircraft overhead) and enables tactics (reading plant stress through her own). Cost is visible in the acknowledgment that pain persists. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The photograph is handled in three beats: carried as "patient wound" in the opening, studied mid-scene for the pearl of stillness (earrings detail), and tucked away before returning to work. Its meaning reweights from raw grief to integrated memorial ("The dead lived in the living"). The object constrains choice (the ritual must be completed before work can proceed) and charges the final seedling image as counter-ballast. Early signal, evolving use, closure linkage, and visible cost (carrying it for four years) push this toward indispensable. Small friction: the photograph itself does not appear in the final image, limiting the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The pearl of stillness is named explicitly twice: in the photograph ritual ("searching for what she called a pearl of stillness") and in the noon reflection ("The pearl of stillness lived in moments like this"). It shapes stakes by defining Mariam's goal (finding contained pain rather than its absence) and reappears at closure in the seedling metaphor. The concept enables her tactic of selective focus (the earrings today). Two-gate participation (setup, payoff) with thematic resonance but limited middle development. The specificity of "pearl" within "stillness" elevates above generic calm, but the concept is more guiding metaphor than concrete constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The attribute is seeded through the head botanist's evaluation ("quietly talented... remarkable intuition for plant stress signals") and then explained through Mariam's lived causality: she reads stress because she's learned to track it in herself. The trait enables one major on-page action—successfully tending the endangered orchids—and constrains her social presence (she "never spoke of how she'd learned patience"). It charges the thematic irony that her greatest skill is a trauma byproduct. Setup, development, and payoff are present with visible tradeoff (the cost of the skill's origin). Swappability is low; the specific talent matters to both plot and theme.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The freeze response appears in two beats: the hawk moment (major turn where "muscles locking, breath catching, that ancient freeze response claiming her nervous system") and implicitly in the backstory of the wall concussion. The hawk freeze is the story's central test of whether her somatic toolkit works, and her recovery ("Slowly, like tide water receding, the panic ebbed") enables the continuation to the greenhouse. The action is irreplaceable; swapping freeze for another trauma response would alter the story's physiological specificity and the toolkit's design. Causal pressure, closure linkage (she can return tomorrow because she survived today's freeze), and cost (the body's involuntary claim) are all present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Somatic markers are explicitly named and used during the hawk freeze: "She counted the somatic markers—racing pulse, contracted diaphragm, tunnel vision—and named them without judgment." The method is seeded in the therapist mention and shapes one key attempt (navigating the freeze by tracking rather than fighting). The mechanics matter—naming without judgment allows the panic to ebb—and the method enables the ending choice to continue working. Two-gate participation (setup, development) with implied payoff; the method is present at closure by implication (she can return tomorrow because the toolkit works) but not explicitly invoked in the final image. Causal pressure and specificity are strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The arboretum setting is introduced in the opening line, pressures every choice (salt-blasted soil demands patience, cliffside precariousness mirrors psychological state, endangered orchids require specific care), and anchors the final image (greenhouse, seedlings). The micro-geography is clear: cypress grove, sequoias, potting shed, cliff edge, greenhouse. The setting supplies resources (protective netting, tools) and constrains tactics (wind tears netting, requiring repair). The arboretum's dual nature—cultivated beauty above indifferent ocean—charges the thematic calculus. Early signal, beat involvement across the full arc, closure linkage, causal pressure, and irreplaceability (the story cannot function in a generic garden) all present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is anchored in the opening ("seventeen years" after the lighthouse keeper) and the backstory ("four years" carrying the photograph, "forty-three more minutes" before the missile). The timeframe establishes context but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. The story unfolds in a single morning (fog rolls through, by noon the fog lifts) without urgency. The temporal distance from the wedding is thematically relevant (enough time for partial recovery) but does not constrain the present-day choices. Setup is present; development and payoff are weak. Swappable with other post-trauma durations.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation is explicitly named ("Mariam had learned to anchor optimism in realism rather than false hope") and dramatized through the dual truth she holds: "She believed the world could grow gentler. She also believed it might not." The desire drives the photograph ritual (finding the pearl without denial), the freeze recovery (naming panic without fighting it), and the ending choice (tending seedlings as votes for an uncertain future). Friction between wants and costs appears in the acknowledgment that "pain" is not absent but "contained." The motivation is seeded, developed, and shapes closure. Small deduction: the explicit statement in the text edges toward told-only, though the ending dramatizes it through action.</comment>
