<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's interior voice is distinct and her motivations are rooted in consistent contradictory impulses—building hospitals with poisoned-aquifer money, creating drought to prevent worse poisoning. The choice to leave the egg and speaker is motivated by her stated "sentimental weakness," though her interiority occasionally leans toward diagnostic self-awareness ("killed that weakness...or thought she had"). The final act of kneeling in dissolving salt and walking away without looking back embodies her renunciation with visible cost, forecloses sentimentality as redemption, and reads as earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines. The piece accumulates density through Eleanor's reflection on the drought, her guilt, and extinct species, then crystallizes in the act of placing the egg and activating the speaker—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options and stakes are reweighted. The cost is conceptual and felt: she performs a futile gesture knowing it changes nothing, forecloses any hope of redemption, and walks away. One tightening is evident and sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The salt flat is vivid and constrains Eleanor's choice: she reads the cracks as a map to the cavern, kneels on the crystalline crust, and the rain begins to dissolve the salt around her knees, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her POV. The micro-setting (body, salt, rain) recurs and charges closure, meeting the 9+ test's spirit, but the occupational detail (geologists, acoustic resonance) is told rather than dramatically tested, capping the score just under 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Eleanor's need to preserve extinct voices as a gesture against her lifetime of destruction. The drought backstory provides context but is told; the on-page tightening occurs when she kneels, traces the cracks, and activates the speaker, narrowing options from intent to irreversible action. The cost is legible—she performs a futile act knowing no one will hear it, forecloses redemption, and walks away—but the escalation is a single deepening rather than a compounding pressure, fitting this length yet lacking the layered turns that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the particulars of Eleanor's actions rather than statement: love and destruction as the same gesture, the mathematics of mercy, the preservation of echoes no one will hear. The final image—extinct bird calls descending into darkness while she walks away without looking back—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of whether futile gestures have value. The piece resists moralizing and embraces complexity, though one line ("love and destruction were sometimes the same gesture, made with the same trembling hands") edges toward articulating the theme rather than letting it remain fully implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Eleanor filters the salt flat through her guilt and sentiment, notices "the mathematics of mercy," and hears "the fractured grace of lost songs." Psychic distance is controlled and modulates appropriately. Some diction ("manufactured drought had been her masterpiece," "sentimental nonsense") reads slightly elevated for peak moments but remains within her lexicon as a wealthy industrialist. No dialogue to evaluate. The voice is confident and particular, though a few phrases ("stubborn as grief") lean toward lyricism that could be tightened.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies appropriately, opening with long sentences that compress to shorter beats at closure. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. One paraphrase loop: "She had no illusions about redemption. She would die as she had lived, neither hero nor villain but something more honest" restates the prior paragraph's amoral-philanthropist framing without added pressure (−0.2). A few filter verbs ("she could hear," "she knew") slightly dull immediacy. No significant template cadence or mixed metaphors, and the closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The amoral-philanthropist premise is familiar, but the story transforms it through the specific gesture of burying extinct bird calls in a cavern beneath a manufactured drought's salt flat—a synthesis that feels earned and non-obvious. The turns arise from Eleanor's established character rather than late rule changes. The risk of a quiet, futile ending without redemption heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One friction: the "newspapers said" framing and the journalist's misunderstanding read slightly expository, nudging the piece toward a well-executed template rather than a fully original vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's amoral-philanthropist identity shapes the drought backstory and her final choice to preserve extinct voices as a futile gesture. Present throughout, it drives the kneeling act and the decision to walk away without redemption, altering tactics (she accepts irredeemability) and participating in closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dodo egg is mentioned early, handled when Eleanor kneels, and placed beside the speaker as a burial offering. It appears in two beats (opening reflection, placement) and charges the closure image, but its specific properties (last verified specimen) do not constrain tactics or alter options beyond symbolic weight, making it somewhat swappable with another extinct-species artifact.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The manufactured drought is signaled early, provides the salt flat setting, and explains Eleanor's guilt and the cavern system. It drives the on-page choice to kneel on the dried lakebed, read the cracks, and activate the speaker. The drought shapes stakes (her need to atone) and enables the acoustic resonance tactic, participating causally in closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Eleanor's secret sentimentality is mentioned early ("killed that weakness...or thought she had"), motivates her recording of extinct bird calls, and drives her kneeling act despite knowing it is "pointless." The trait constrains her final choice (she cannot walk away without the gesture) with visible cost (she accepts futility and irredeemability), appearing in at least two beats and shaping closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The release (activating the speaker) is the story's climactic action, prepared by the drought backstory and the kneeling beat. It initiates the Kauai oo's call descending into the cavern, triggers the rain, and redefines Eleanor's options from intent to irreversible act. Removing this action would collapse the closure; it is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cracks in the dried riverbed are mentioned early as coordinates "drawn by catastrophe," Eleanor traces them on-page to locate the cavern, and they guide her choice of placement. The map method appears in at least two beats (reflection on the patterns, tracing them while kneeling) and enables the acoustic-resonance tactic, shaping the ending's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The salt flat is present from the opening line, pressures Eleanor's choice (she kneels on the crystalline crust, reads the cracks, feels rain dissolving the salt), and charges the closure image. The setting is not merely postcard description; it constrains her actions (the cavern location) and participates in the final beat (salt clinging "like a second skin"), meeting high-integration criteria.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thunder is mentioned in the opening and recurs twice ("closer now," "swallowed the bird calls"), marking the approach of rain that Eleanor's drought "finally allowed to return." The lull provides a momentary silence for her to hear the crystalline quiet, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock that alters tactics. It modulates atmosphere more than it pressures choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Eleanor's desire to preserve extinct bird calls is signaled early (she recorded every extinct bird voice), dramatized on-page when she activates the speaker, and conflicts with her knowledge that "no one would hear it" and it won't bring the birds back. The motivation drives the kneeling act and closure choice, with visible cost (she accepts futility and walks away without redemption).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fractured-grace tone is coherent throughout: "bruised plums" sky, "crystalline silence," "the fractured grace of lost songs descending into the earth's memory." The tone modulates with pressure (long reflective sentences compress to shorter beats at closure) and charges the final image of Eleanor walking away with salt clinging to her. The phrase "fractured grace" appears explicitly, which slightly reduces its emergent quality, but the effect is otherwise well-integrated.</comment>
