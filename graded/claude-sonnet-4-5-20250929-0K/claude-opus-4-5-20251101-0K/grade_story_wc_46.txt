<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with grief embodied through ritual handling of sea glass rather than therapy-speak. The progression from loss to understanding is earned through the polishing work, and the final choice to leave the spiral for others forecloses solitary mourning with visible cost. Minor deduction: the "pearl of stillness" moment ("Sorrow measured against love, loss against legacy") edges toward stated epiphany rather than fully embodied realization, and Lila remains more symbol than person despite scattered memories.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through repeated polishing motions, memory fragments, and sea-glass arrangement toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—she accepts sharing over solitary watching, foreclosing private grief with the cost of exposure). Orientation anchors quickly (grotto, Maren, memory work). The spiral creation and decision to leave it constitute a meaningful deepening that reweights her relationship to loss. Cost is visible: she walks away from her private sanctuary, opening it to strangers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto's mist and acoustics shape the work—amplifying movements, catching light, enabling the cold-glow effect that distinguishes this from fire. The grotto's curved ledge is the repeated work surface, and the mist follows her out in the final image, charging closure. Spatial choreography is clear (ledge, entrance, coastal path implied). The gem-polishing tools and sea glass function as micro-setting elements that constrain her method and charge the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: how to share what she sees (the stars, the loss) without the fire that recalls fever. Pressure tightens through the polishing work until the blue piece "suddenly" crystallizes understanding—a causal turn under the Accumulative lens. The spiral arrangement and decision to leave it constitute agency (endurance of exposure) with visible cost: strangers will enter her private space. The weigh/balance micro-choice deepens stakes without resolving them tidily.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: polished glass vs. fire, cold light vs. heat, sharing vs. solitary watching. The final image—"patient glow, sustained itself on nothing but presence"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the grief-versus-connection question without stating a moral. The sea-glass spiral becomes a community beacon, transforming personal ritual into shared vocabulary. "Fire devours" risks overt statement but is anchored by the physical spiral and mist, keeping it image-driven.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable; perceptual signature is consistent (grief filtered through craft metaphors: "frosted surfaces reflectively vibrant," "pearl of stillness"). Distance modulates purposefully—closer during polishing, pulling back for the grotto description. Diction stays within a bereaved artisan's lexicon without register drift. The "suddenly Maren understood" pivot is a brief tell that compresses insight efficiently rather than violating POV, and the final paragraphs' rhythm slows to match her departure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong through the polishing sequence. Information density is high: most lines advance memory, atmosphere, or the spiral's construction. Minor deductions: "reflectively vibrant" (para 4) is slightly strained; "zephyr bloom" metaphor feels ornamental rather than weight-bearing; the "pearl of stillness" phrase borders on purple without full embodiment. The closing mist image is precise and earns its resonance. No loops or template cadence detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The transformation of sea glass into a grief beacon is specific and earns the "cold light vs. fire" premise through Maren's polishing craft rather than abstract metaphor. The grotto as workshop and the spiral arrangement feel particular to this character's history. The "zephyr bloom" simile and some of the star-watcher exposition trend toward expected grief-memoir territory, preventing a higher score. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure and the refusal of cathartic confrontation add +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren's star-watching is established in backstory ("spent years as an earthbound star watcher") and returns in the final paragraph ("Tonight she would watch them again"), reweighting her solitary habit toward shared presence. The attribute does not drive a key turn but frames her isolation and the story's light-sharing stakes, participating in closure. Scores in the lyric-resonance allowance zone: early seed, closure reprise, stakes connection, but no middle choice driven by this role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sea glass appears in setup (satchel, emerald fragment, collection), drives the middle polishing work across multiple beats (blue piece, spiral arrangement), and anchors closure (emerald at spiral's heart, pieces left for others). Removal would collapse the story's central action and visual metaphor. The glass enables the cold-light discovery and constrains her method (no fire). High irreplaceability and closure linkage; cost is tied to leaving it behind.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"A pearl of stillness" appears once as a felt realization ("A pearl of stillness formed in her chest, that rare moment when grief and gratitude balanced perfectly") during the polishing work, reframing her emotional calculus and enabling the spiral decision. It does not recur or shape tactics elsewhere. The concept influences one key turn (understanding balance) and primes closure but is not indispensable—"moment of clarity" would function similarly. Scores for single-beat causal work and closure linkage, capped by swappability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Reflectively vibrant" describes the sea glass ("their frosted surfaces reflectively vibrant even in the grotto's dim atmosphere") in one line, establishing the glass's light-catching property that later enables the spiral's glow. The trait is functional but replaceable—"luminous" or "light-gathering" would serve. Present in setup, enables the ending's visual effect, but does not constrain a choice or impose cost. Scores for logical contribution without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Weigh" appears twice with distinct functions: the gem-weighing scale metaphor ("she had once weighed gemstones on her precision scale") and the immediate application ("She could weigh this feeling…Sorrow measured against love, loss against legacy"). The second instance drives the key realization that enables the spiral decision, connecting her craft to emotional calculus. Removal would weaken the causal bridge between polishing and sharing. Scores for two-beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage; capped slightly below 8.0 by replaceability (other craft verbs could serve).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Gem polishing is signaled early (tools, thirty-year career), drives the middle work (polishing blue glass, working each piece), and its patient method contrasts with fire throughout, shaping her solution. The mechanics matter: smoothing edges, revealing hidden beauty. Removal would eliminate the story's central action and metaphorical engine. Scores for setup, beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage; modest cap for the method being somewhat replaceable with another craft.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto supplies mist (enables cold light), acoustics (amplifies movements), curved ledge (work surface), and isolation that Maren will sacrifice. The setting enables her discovery and imposes the cost of exposure when she leaves it open to others. The mist follows her out in the final image, charging closure. Removal would break the story's light effect and the spatial stakes. Scores for setup, middle constraints, closure participation, and high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Time operates as "as memories resurface"—the polishing work triggers Lila fragments ("Lila at seven…at twelve…at sixteen") that deepen Maren's grief and prime the sharing impulse. The timeframe structures the middle section and connects past loss to present action. It does not create a ticking clock but shapes the story's reflective mode and stakes. Scores for setup (forty years, decades of glass), development (memory beats), and thematic linkage; capped by lack of tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The desire to share light without fire is dramatized early ("fire reminded her too much of fever's heat"), drives the polishing discovery ("No flame, no heat. Just cold light"), and resolves in the spiral she leaves for others. The motivation faces friction (her private grotto must become public) and the cost is visible (exposure, strangers). Removal would collapse the story's central question and ending. Scores for setup, causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Zephyr bloom" appears once as simile ("gentle as a zephyr bloom, those first spring flowers that opened to wind rather than sun"), establishing a soft, wind-driven opening that contrasts with fire and matches the cold-light tone. The tone is coherent (quiet, accumulative, no melodrama) and modulates with Maren's shift from solitary grief to shared presence. The bloom image charges the light-without-heat motif but is not structurally indispensable. Scores for tonal coherence and closure linkage; capped by ornamental single use.</comment>
