<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sera's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits—artist, rebel, preserver of complexity. Her mother's contradictory nature is told rather than shown in action, relying on summary ("healer who sometimes harmed"). Internal conflict is present but largely reflective; the ritual itself lacks embodied contradiction beyond the opening of her mouth. The final choice feels earned by setup but the renunciation cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story layers detail (towers, echoes, names, poets in shadow) toward a cadence shift at the ritual. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "a complete woman, complicated and unflattened, forgiven without being diminished" reweights the premise with conceptual cost (Elders' authority dissolved, unprecedented absorption). Orientation anchors early; one meaningful deepening (Sera speaks seven truths, not one) coheres under the lens. The cost is conceptual and social rather than visceral, but undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bone towers, canyon echoes, and mist are vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography is clear (base of tallest spire, poets along canyon walls). The canyon's amplification mechanic constrains the ritual tactic (refraction through echoes), directly shaping the climax. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The towers hum at closure, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve her mother's complexity against the Elders' demand for single truth. One meaningful tightening: the ritual deadline forces Sera's refraction tactic into action. Agency is clear (decision to speak seven truths), and the cost is legible (Elders' commands "dissolved," authority overturned). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through gathering poets, rehearsal, then execution. The trade-off—preserving complexity at the price of defying the system—is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges clearly from events: "the price of forgiveness should not be the flattening of a soul." The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, the mother's line "the price of forgiveness is the death of complexity" is nearly a thesis statement, and the ending risks stating rather than embodying its thematic answer. The bone towers absorbing "something unprecedented" reads as authorial summary rather than charged particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Sera with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present (paint-stained fingers, artist's noticing). Diction is controlled and purposeful, avoiding filter-verb stacks. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are N/A. The phrase "forged hush" is elegant but slightly elevated for peak pressure; otherwise voice remains clean and embodied throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. "Through impromptu poetry sessions" is light scaffolding but functional. Minor register drift: "unauthorized memory," "elegantly subversive," "ambient murmur" feel slightly elevated for the POV's internal texture under stress. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Information density is high; propulsion is steady. The closure beat is clear and artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—ritual demands single truth, protagonist refracts it into many via canyon echoes—is fresh and specific. The bone towers as physical repository of names is vivid. Emotional arc and thematic question cohere. The mechanics (echo refraction, poets stationed to reshape words) are worked out with commitment. Risk is present in the unconventional ritual climax. No close echoes of famous lines; the synthesis feels earned rather than template-derived.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sera drives the entire arc: gathers poets, rehearses refraction, speaks seven truths at the ritual, overturning the Elders' authority. Her defiance is the causal engine. Setup, development, and closure all hinge on her choices. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The pale spire appears in the opening (base of tallest spire), midpoint (poets meet "in the shadow of the pale spire in mist"), and closure (light breaks over it, "pale spire now held something unprecedented"). Early signal, recurring anchor, closure participation. However, it functions more as stage setting than active constraint on choice; the canyon's echo mechanics do the causal work. Lyric reprise present but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The price of forgiveness is the dominant stake: ritual demands erasure as the cost of absolution; Sera refuses that price and redefines it. The concept shapes every tactic (refraction to preserve complexity, gathering poets, speaking seven truths). It appears early ("the price of forgiveness… is the death of complexity"), governs the conflict, and is resolved at closure ("forgiven without being diminished"). Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, specificity, and visible conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Innocently mischievous" is established in childhood (painted symbols, nonsense rhymes) and links to adult refraction tactic ("that same nature served a different purpose"). Early signal and development present. However, the trait is more summarized backstory than on-page constraint; the ritual climax would work without this childhood detail. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Refract" is the core action: Sera refracts truth like light through glass, speaks seven truths that refract through canyon echoes, and the resolution hinges on refraction overcoming the Elders' demand. Early signal ("Let it refract"), development (rehearsal), and closure (speaking seven truths, Elders' commands "dissolved in the reverberations"). Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability. Removing "refract" would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Impromptu poetry sessions are signaled early (Sera gathers poets, they develop refraction technique through sessions). The method matters: poets are stationed to catch and reshape words at the ritual. Setup and development present. However, the mechanics at closure are vague ("other poets joined in, their voices weaving new truths from old syllables"); the sessions enable the tactic but the on-page execution is summarized rather than dramatized. Functional causal role but could be more specific.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The canyon of bone towers supplies the physical mechanism (echo amplification) that enables refraction. Early signal (towers, canyon echoes), development (rehearsal of echo mechanics), closure (echoes multiply Sera's truths, dissolve Elders' commands). The setting is not postcard; it actively constrains the ritual tactic and shapes the outcome. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Before the ritual" and "dawn" frame the urgency. The ritual begins "when the first light touched the highest spire," and "the first light broke over the pale spire" triggers the climax. Time tightens decisions (three days' notice, gathering poets in secret, rehearsal). However, the clock is more setup than live pressure during the ritual itself; the ending does not track elapsed seconds. Functional causal role with closure participation but not maximal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sera's motivation—refract a single truth into many to preserve her mother's complexity—is the engine of the plot. Established early ("no intention of letting a single truth stand"), developed through gathering poets and rehearsal, and executed at closure. The friction between preserving complexity and defying authority is visible; the cost (authority dissolved, unprecedented absorption) is on the page. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Forged hush" appears in the phrase "in the forged hush before the ritual" and modulates to "mist began to thin," "first light broke." The tone is purposeful and coherent, supporting the ritualistic pressure. However, "forged" is elegant but slightly static; the tone does not shift dramatically under peak pressure. Functional participation in setup and closure but not maximal modulation or charge.</comment>
