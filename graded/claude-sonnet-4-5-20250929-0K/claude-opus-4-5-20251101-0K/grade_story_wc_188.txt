<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's grief and motivation are established clearly, though her interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The grandmother's return feels unmotivated—"cruel and necessary" is asserted rather than earned through prior causality. The final choice to continue walking lacks visible cost; it reads as continuation rather than foreclosure of a path. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally lapses into label-speak ("gnawing anxiety").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly (who/where/when by the portcullis). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: grief → walking → mosaic message → tower reunion → fireworks display → renewed purpose. One meaningful deepening occurs when the grandmother reframes the kerosene knot, though this arrives via coincidence (her unexpected presence) rather than Elara's agency. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (renewed stance: "she would walk again, chanting, carrying fire"), but the cost is more asserted than felt on the page—what exactly has she forfeited or transformed?</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The blooming fortress is vividly rendered with jasmine, mosaics, and tile details that create strong atmosphere. The kerosene knot appears multiple times and charges the final image by being "tucked back" as a relic. Spatial choreography (courtyard, tower stairs, battlement) tracks clearly. The starless sky functions as canvas, constraining the fireworks' impact. Dusk timing and sensory hierarchy (fire, scent, visual cascades) support the stakes without crowding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming grief into light—is signaled early and tightens when Elara confronts her grandmother and must choose whether to ignite the display. However, the grandmother's arrival is coincidental and resolves Elara's isolation without her agency driving the turn. The fireworks sequence offers spectacle but no on-page obstacle or choice under pressure; success is assured. One deepening occurs (reframing the knot), but the final act feels ceremonial rather than costly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (grief transformed into purposeful creation) emerges through the kerosene knot, chanting, and fireworks without overt moralizing. The final image—tucking the singed knot back, ready to walk again—offers a non-literal answer with resonance. Subtext operates in the grandmother's "cruel and necessary" line and the fortress waking to wonder. Minor slip: "stubborn refusal to surrender to darkness" in the fireworks paragraph borders on thematic summary rather than letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; Elara's perceptual signature (chanting rhythms, ambient awareness, fire-craft focus) is distinct. Dialogue between Elara and her grandmother is sparse but goal-driven and carries subtext. Diction is elevated and lyrical, fitting the voice, though occasional phrases ("serious playfulness," "purposeful ambient awareness") feel slightly like prompt labels rather than organic thought. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with strong rhythm and imagery ("dusk bled the sky into bruised purples," "tiny mouths gasping"). Information density is high; sentences often layer image, action, and emotion. Minor issues: "Fire remembers what flesh forgets" and similar aphorisms border on purple without clear payoff. "Serious playfulness" in the preparation paragraph reads as imported descriptor rather than dramatized state. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though some metaphors ("something liberated") lack specificity. Opening and closing lines anchor effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The wandering pyrotechnician mourning a brother through fireworks offers a fresh synthesis of grief and spectacle. The mosaic message and blooming fortress provide vivid, non-generic setting. However, the grandmother's resurrection leans toward convenience, and the emotional arc (grief → display → renewed purpose) follows a familiar trajectory without bold transformation. The ending image (walking again, carrying fire) is resonant but not entirely non-obvious. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits to its lyrical mode but retreats from harder choices (e.g., the grandmother could have remained dead, forcing Elara to ignite alone).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her profession shapes the setting and final action. However, her key choice—to light the fireworks—is not significantly contested or pressured; the grandmother enables rather than complicates. She observes and performs more than she decides under opposing forces. Present in closure (continues walking) but the decision feels like continuation rather than a turn that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The kerosene knot appears in three beats: carried in the satchel, drawn out and repressed by the grandmother, then used to ignite the display and finally tucked back singed. It accrues meaning (relic → ignition point → proof of survival) and charges the final image. However, its role is largely symbolic; removing it would weaken resonance but the fireworks sequence and closure could proceed with another ignition tool. Strong lyric integration but not indispensable to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The mosaic message appears once, mid-story, to direct Elara to the tower. It frames expectation and adds mystery but does not constrain later choices or return with reweighted meaning. Swappable with any other message form (letter, voice) with minor edits. Functional but replaceable; ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Chanting appears in the opening ("rhythms to keep the darkness at bay"), during the walk, and again during the fireworks preparation ("humming her walking chants"). It characterizes Elara's coping mechanism but does not visibly constrain or enable a choice with cost. Label-only trait; no scene where chanting versus silence alters tactics or outcome. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Filter" appears once in the preparation scene: "Her grandmother filtered each choice through ambient awareness, sensing wind patterns." This describes the grandmother's method, not Elara's action. It does not drive a turn or create cost. Summary-only use; easily swappable with "assessed" or "judged." Functional mention but no causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Ambient awareness is described twice: Elara "letting her ambient awareness expand" to read the mosaic message, and the grandmother filtering choices through it during preparation. It characterizes perception style but does not shape a key choice or tighten stakes. The message could be read without this specific method. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blooming fortress is established early (vines, jasmine, mosaics) and shapes multiple beats: the mosaic message discovered in the courtyard, the tower climb, the battlement as launch site, and the mosaics reflecting fireworks at closure. The starless night provides canvas, the elevation supplies vantage, and the fortress waking below gives the display its audience and meaning. Setting constrains staging and charges the final image. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"During the hush of a night with no stars" is signaled at the tower arrival and provides atmospheric canvas for the fireworks. The starless sky matters for visual contrast but does not tighten decisions or create time pressure. The hush is descriptive mood rather than a constraint that alters tactics. Present and purposeful but not causal; could be replaced with "clear night" or similar without breaking logic. Functional use, one beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "defy the gravity of hopelessness" is stated early and drives her journey to the fortress and her choice to perform despite grief. The grandmother's reframing ("burn brighter for his absence") tests and redirects it. However, the motivation is more told than dramatized in conflicted choice—she never seriously considers not lighting the display. Desire shapes the arc but lacks on-page friction between want and cost at the peak beat. Present in closure but not visibly contested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Serious playfulness is named once ("Elara worked with serious playfulness") and implied in the juxtaposition of grief-driven ritual with explosive spectacle. Tone modulates from somber opening to celebratory fireworks to quiet resolve at dawn. The tonal arc supports the thematic shift and charges the final image (singed knot, readiness to walk). Coherent through turns, though the label itself reads as prompt echo rather than fully embodied modulation. Strong contribution to closure mood.</comment>
