<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's skepticism and her purpose to learn about weather-carriers provide consistent motivation, and her final realization that she carries invisible weather shows genuine interiority. However, her brother's disappearance functions more as backstory than lived contradiction, and the convergence with the three weather-carriers feels more allegorical than deeply conflicted. The embodiment is present ("tongue pressed against the cold air, tasting copper and ozone") but the peak choice—accepting the leaf and understanding her purpose—arrives without visible cost or foreclosed alternatives. The cast of weather-bearers remains functionally interchangeable, applying pressure through exposition rather than distinct relational friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors Vera on the lavender bluff early, and the three weather-carriers converging creates forward motion. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Vera recognizes her own invisible weather and accepts her role), but the cost remains abstract—no visible path is foreclosed, no concrete price paid on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (aurora, taste, ring, forest votes layer toward a final synthesis), yet the brother's lightning-aspen merger and Vera's acceptance both arrive through exposition rather than dramatized turns. The "final votes" and "tomorrow, bright as copper" gesture toward reconfiguration, but the felt cost required for high-band closure is not legible in a specific sentence or image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lavender bluff, aurora, and forest setting are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Vera's synesthetic perception (metallic sweetness, chlorophyll sharp as ambition). The tin compass ring's empty center functions as both object and micro-setting, used twice (framing her grandmother's promise, then revealing the converging figures) and charged at the end when she tastes tomorrow through it. Spatial choreography is clear (below/above, bluff path, canopy/understory), and the setting's magnetic fluctuations and voting forest constrain Vera's understanding. The environment charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning why some carry weather—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on the three weather-carriers' arrival and their exposition about Vera's brother and her own role, not on Vera's agency narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. The brother's story and the aspens' electoral victory are recounted, not dramatized; Vera's acceptance of the leaf and her recognition lack a visible price or foreclosed alternative. One meaningful deepening occurs (Vera realizes she carries invisible weather), but the cost is asserted ("her future on the leaf's surface") rather than felt in a specific consequence or renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the layered images of emergent compass, forest elections, personal atmospheres, and bridging worlds (terrestrially cosmic, root and star). The final image—Vera tasting tomorrow through the ring, recognizing her invisible weather—reweights prior material without overt moralizing. The concept of climate needing human anchors and Vera's skepticism-as-weather offers a non-obvious synthesis. However, phrases like "futuristic nostalgia," "ancient negotiations between earth and sky," and "bright as copper, vast as the space between stars" trend toward abstraction; the thematic answer feels more asserted than earned through specific, irreversible on-page action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-close on Vera with a distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic taste (copper, ozone, seawater, cinnamon, mint, petrichor) and the emergent compass. Diction is elevated and lyric ("luminous skeptic," "terrestrially cosmic," "climate had grown so unstable it needed human anchors"), consistent with the futuristic-nostalgia tone. Brief dialogue from the three weather-carriers is functional but interchangeable in register. Under peak pressure (the brother reveal, Vera's recognition), the prose maintains its metaphoric density without compression or embodied breakdown, which softens urgency. No head-hopping, and the narrative stance holds, but the heightened register throughout reduces the contrast needed to charge the closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("doubt had dismantled a hundred false prophets," "chemical campaigns through root and soil," "sorrow so pure it made her eyes water"), but the metaphoric load appears in nearly every sentence, risking overwriting. Sentence openings vary, and information density is high. However, minor loops appear: "carrying" and "convergence" recur without reweighting, and phrases like "emergent compass," "terrestrially cosmic," and "futuristic nostalgia" are introduced, glossed, then reprised without deepening. The final paragraph stacks abstract images ("petrichor and possibility," "bright as copper, vast as the space between stars") that blur rather than sharpen the closure. No major scaffold or template cadence, but the cumulative figurative density in peak beats reduces propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthetic sensing, forest elections, weather-carriers, and emergent compass is specific and non-obvious. The brother-becomes-aspen-lightning and Vera's invisible pressure-system-of-questions offer fresh inflections on climate-as-metaphor. However, the core arc—protagonist discovers their latent power through encounter with those who already possess it—follows a familiar template. The futuristic-nostalgia frame and "luminous skeptic" label feel more decorative than transformative. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative layering) and voice (lyric density) is present, but the closure lands on recognition rather than irreversible consequence, and the elevated register throughout reduces lived-in specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Vera is present throughout and her choices frame the arc (she came to learn, she observes, she takes the leaf, she understands her purpose). However, her decisions do not create key turns; the weather-carriers' arrival and exposition drive the middle, and her final acceptance is passive receipt rather than a choice with visible alternatives or cost. She is the lens, not the agent of escalation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tin compass ring appears in three beats: introduced with backstory (grandmother's promise, emptiness as orientation), used to see the converging figures through its empty center, and charged at the end when Vera tastes tomorrow through it. Its evolving use (from void-as-guide to framing-device to charged conduit) and its presence in the closure image earn solid integration. Not indispensable—sensing could occur without it—but its specific mechanics (emptiness, pointing toward purpose rather than north) shape Vera's arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The emergent compass concept is seeded early (the ring reveals connections forming in real time) and returns at closure (Vera's ring "finally pointing toward something"). However, it functions more as metaphor than on-page constraint; it does not alter Vera's tactics or narrow her options in the middle beats. The concept charges the ending thematically but lacks causal pressure—Vera could arrive at the same recognition without it. One setup, one thematic reprise, minimal development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" is applied to the aurora and to phenomena bridging worlds, but it remains descriptive rather than constraining. Vera finds comfort in such phenomena, yet this trait does not enable or prevent any on-page action. It colors her worldview but imposes no visible cost or tradeoff. Present and thematically resonant, but ornamental in function.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Converge" drives the structure: Vera senses storm-carriers converging, the three weather-bearers climb the bluff path and converge on her position, and their personal atmospheres mingle at closure. The action is both physical (the approach) and conceptual (systems merging), and it enables the key turn—Vera learning about her brother and her own role. Not easily swappable; the convergence mechanic is specific to the emergent-compass and weather-carrier logic. Present in setup, development, and closure with causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Synesthetic taste is signaled early (copper, ozone, chlorophyll, metallic sweetness) and used in multiple beats: Vera tastes the forest ballot, tastes truth in the fog-bearer's words, tastes distinct flavors of fog/heat/snow, tastes her future on the aspen leaf, and tastes tomorrow through the ring. The method shapes her perception throughout and charges the closure image. However, it does not constrain her choices or impose a cost; it is perceptual texture rather than tactical pressure. Strong lyric integration but limited causal force.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The lavender bluff under aurora is the setting throughout, anchored early and charged at closure (lavender releases scent in magnetic waves, aurora intensifies as Vera understands). The bluff's position above the voting forest and its response to the aurora provide atmospheric pressure. However, the setting does not alter Vera's tactics or supply a resource that affects outcome; it frames rather than constrains. Strong lyric reprise (first paragraph → ending image) but limited causal role. Eligible for mid-6s under the lyric allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The forest election timeframe is introduced early ("every generation," "three seasons now") and referenced at closure ("forest cast its final votes"). However, time does not tighten Vera's decisions or create urgency; the election is backdrop rather than clock. The aspens' losing-then-winning arc is recounted, not dramatized, and does not pressure Vera's choices. Present in setup and closure with thematic resonance but no tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Vera's motivation—to learn why some carry weather—is stated early, drives her presence on the bluff, and is satisfied at closure when she learns her brother merged with the aspens and she herself carries invisible weather. The desire is clear and pursued consistently. However, it is not visibly conflicted; no competing want or cost complicates her search. The brother's disappearance provides emotional weight but does not create on-page friction between desire and price. One dominant stake with clean setup, development, and payoff, but limited dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Futuristic nostalgia" is named once ("that quality of futuristic nostalgia that permeated everything now, as if the world remembered futures that never happened") and implied in the synthesis of ancient oaks, aurora, emergent compass, and climate anchors. The tone is consistent—lyric, elevated, layered with metaphor—but does not modulate with pressure; the same register holds from opening to closure. Coherent and purposeful, but static rather than dynamic. Present and thematically apt, yet it does not charge the final image in a way that reweights prior material.</comment>
