<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and consistent—returning to archive work to honor the dead—but her interiority remains largely abstract ("reactive vision," "patterns in fragments") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The widow and father moments show impact on others, not Elena's internal conflict. Her final stance (patient continuance) feels declarative rather than earned through on-page struggle that forecloses a path with visible cost. No relationship crucible on the page to test her in real time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates absences and salvaged fragments toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Elena accepts her role as keeper of loss. Orientation anchors by ~120 words (Elena, Ivory Harbor, Archive). The closure—Elena lighting her lamp to continue work—crystallizes her stance with visible cost (endless vigil, no personal resolution), but the cost is asserted in reflection ("she could not change what had been lost") rather than dramatized through a present-tense choice that narrows options. One meaningful deepening occurs when families visit and absences cohere into narratives, reweighting her exile's meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor after rain is vivid and purposeful: "particular luminescence," limestone quays, salt and aged paper. The trumpet valve as micro-setting anchors Elena's work and charges the final image (valve on desk, "testament"). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through archival priorities. Spatial choreography is clear (quay, archive, desk). The setting subtly guides choice through the valve's repaired soldering technique, which constrains her investigative path. Strong economy and specificity elevate this above postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: honoring the dead by reconstructing their stories. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elena proves the husband saved the cabin boy and the father's son chose to sail, reweighting prior guilt—but these are recounted impacts on others, not Elena's own tactical shift under live pressure. The exile backstory (bribed lighthouse keeper) is told, not tested on the page. No on-page reversal that narrows Elena's options or forces a trade-off; the families' visits deepen thematic resonance without altering her stance. Cost (endless work, solitary vigil) is implied at closure but not dramatized through a present choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—navigated absences and what loss teaches the living—emerges organically from the valve, manifests, and family visits. The final image (valve as testament, Elena's patient work) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how absence becomes navigable without moralizing. "Dignity of understanding" and "navigated absences" risk abstraction but remain tethered to concrete archival work. Subtext operates in "gaps in the record," "silence between documented facts," and the lighthouse beam as trust. Minor slip: "what absence could teach the living about how to carry on" leans expository in the penultimate paragraph, nearly crossing into theme summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, Elena's perceptual signature filters details through archival priorities ("verdigris," "soldering technique"). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("reactive vision," "staggered intervals"), though "reactively visionary quality" and "navigated absences" risk elevated register. The phrase "watched their faces transform as scattered memories cohered" tells rather than shows transformation. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance is consistent. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she noticed," "she thought") in reflective passages, but voice remains anchored to Elena's professional lexicon. Prose texture is distinct but not rhythmically varied under peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are mostly strong, but reflective scaffolding accumulates: "She had learned long ago that navigated absences…" and "The harbor recovered slowly, its wounds healing in the same staggered intervals…" restate thematic content without advancing action. Paraphrase loop between "She could not change what had been lost" and "the lost were not forgotten" in consecutive lines (−0.2). Template cadence in the family-visit paragraph: "One widow wept… A father finally stopped…" (−0.4). Metaphor "patient as salt" is fresh, but "ever-growing map of what absence could teach" tilts abstract. Information density is high in the valve-repair beat; other passages summarize rather than dramatize.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ocean-spray archivist and reactive vision offer a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The valve as investigative anchor and "navigated absences" as method feel fresh. However, the exile-and-return frame, the redemptive closure (Elena lighting her lamp to continue), and the families-finding-peace beats follow familiar redemption arcs. Emotional specificity (widow weeping, father's self-blame) avoids generic templates, but the final paragraph's "patient as salt, ready to compile another fragment" leans toward stock resilience imagery. No close echoes of famous lines, but the structure (exile → return → healing through work) is well-trodden. Risk-taking is modest; the piece commits to its premise without bold formal or perspectival choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elena (ocean-spray archivist) is present throughout and her archival work drives the narrative arc. Setup: first paragraph. Development: she examines the valve, cross-references repair records, and reconstructs the fleet's voyage—constraining her investigative path. Closure: she lights her lamp to continue work, crystallizing her stance. Her choices (methodical analysis, showing families the valve) create key turns in the families' emotional states, but Elena herself does not face a live decision that alters her own tactics or forecloses a path on the page. The exile backstory primes her return but is not tested in present action. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) with weak middle agency caps eligibility ~6.0; beat involvement and causal pressure for others lift slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The herald's trumpet valve appears in multiple beats: Elena lifts it (first examination), notices the soldering repair (investigative constraint), shows it to families (narrative turn), and it sits on her desk at closure ("testament"). Setup: early. Development: the valve's repair technique cross-references records, shaping Elena's reconstruction. Closure: final image charges it as symbol of ongoing work and waiting fragments. The valve is irreplaceable (unique repair detail) and carries conceptual cost (herald drowned, instrument scattered). Three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage elevate. Minor cap: the valve does not narrow Elena's own options on the page, only deepens her understanding, so it remains below indispensable threshold.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Navigated absences (core concept) is signaled early ("reactive vision," "patterns in fragments") and shapes Elena's method: she compiles meaning from gaps in manifests and journals. Development: "navigated absences often revealed more than presence" explicitly frames her tactic. Closure: the concept recurs in "absences they left behind became navigable paths." However, the concept is largely thematic/reflective rather than constraining on-page choices with visible cost. Elena does not face a live dilemma where absence blocks or enables a tactic. Three-gate presence (setup, middle reflection, closure echo) with weak causal pressure places it mid-band; lyric reprise elevates slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Reactively visionary (attribute) is introduced early: "reactive vision, the ability to see patterns in fragments… insights arrived unbidden." Development: the trait explains her value to families and danger to corrupt officials, but is told rather than shown constraining a present choice. No on-page moment where Elena's reactive process forces a tradeoff or fails under pressure. Closure: the attribute does not reappear or shape the final image. Setup and weak development present; no closure participation caps at ~4.6, but the backstory framing (made her "invaluable… and dangerous") provides slight narrative pressure, lifting minimally.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Hearten (action) is signaled in the family-visit beat: Elena "used each revelation to hearten them, not with false comfort but with the dignity of understanding." Development: two examples (widow, father) show the action's impact. Closure: the final image (Elena continuing work) implies ongoing heartening but does not dramatize it. The action is swappable with "comfort" or "console" with minor edits, reducing irreplaceability. Setup late (second half); development present; closure participation weak. Two gates met; causal role in emotional turns for families, but not Elena's own arc, caps at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Staggered intervals (method) is signaled early: "spacing her analysis across hours and days rather than rushing… allowed her mind to make connections." Development: "Day after day, Elena reconstructed" dramatizes the method. Closure: "The harbor recovered slowly… in the same staggered intervals Elena employed" echoes the method thematically. The method shapes Elena's tactic (measured approach) and is irreplaceable to her process, but does not create on-page friction or cost—no moment where haste tempts or delay risks loss. Three gates met; causal shaping and specificity elevate, but lack of visible tradeoff caps below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor after rain (setting) is vivid in the opening: "limestone quays… glistening with the particular luminescence that gave the harbor its name." The archive's smell ("salt and aged paper") anchors Elena's workspace. Closure: rain begins again, washing the harbor clean—lyric reprise. However, the setting does not constrain Elena's choices or supply resources that alter tactics; it functions as atmospheric backdrop. The valve and desk (micro-setting) do more causal work than the harbor itself. Setup strong; development ornamental; closure reprise reweights mood but not stakes. Two gates (setup, closure) with weak development and no tactical constraint caps ~5.5; specificity and lyric payoff lift slightly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>After the exile ends (timeframe) is established in the first sentence: "The exile ended on a Tuesday, and Elena returned… after seven years." The past (exile, bribed lighthouse keeper) is recounted but does not tighten present decisions. The present action (examining valve, visiting families) unfolds over unspecified "hours and days" without a live clock. Closure: evening falls, Elena continues work—no deadline or temporal pressure. Setup present; development absent (no ticking clock); closure does not use time to narrow options. One gate (setup) caps at ~4.6; the seven-year gap provides thematic weight (long absence, new leadership), lifting minimally.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>To compile fragments into meaning (motivation) is signaled early: Elena "spent her former life cataloguing the fragments… and reconstruct the stories of the dead." Development: she examines the valve, cross-references records, and compiles meaning from absences—multiple beats dramatize the motivation. Closure: "compile another fragment into the ever-growing map" restates the drive. The motivation is irreplaceable and shapes all on-page work, but faces no live friction—no moment where personal cost (loneliness, futility) tempts her to abandon the task. Three gates met; strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but lack of visible tradeoff (want vs. fear) caps below 8.0.</comment>
