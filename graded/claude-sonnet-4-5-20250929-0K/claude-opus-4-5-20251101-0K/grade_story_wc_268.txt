<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is well-realized—her patient, methodical approach to uncovering the pretender's plot feels character-rooted. Motivation is clear and drives her choices: she compresses the iron gall pellet, paints the rune, descends through library levels, and places evidence where it will be found. The final renunciation ("She did not need to be large to hold up the weight of truth") earns modest closure. However, internal contradiction or competing impulses never surface; her path is untroubled, which limits depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Mira, ancient temple library, pause between constellations) arrive early. Drive lens is Causal-Accumulative hybrid: Mira discovers messages → interprets → retrieves evidence → places it for the scholar. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the evidence is positioned, the false dynasty will fall "not to armies but to ink and vellum," and Mira returns to watch—options have shifted with cost (she has intervened, breaking her vigil pattern). Cost is oblique but legible in the final image. One tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The library's timeless, multi-level architecture is vivid and constrains Mira's movements (descending chambers, corridors folding through time). The iron gall ink pellet, eternal spring, and reading alcove function as micro-setting elements that shape her tactics. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("dust settled on scrolls," "acid still eating into the vellum"). The library's temporal suspension charges the closure: stars shifting mark the end of an age and her intervention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmask the pretender) is signaled early and drives all moves. Escalation is modest: discovery of messages → interpretation → retrieval of evidence → placement. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira finds the misfiled genealogical record, narrowing her options to intervention. Agency is decision-based (she paints the rune, gathers documents, places them). Cost is visible: she breaks her long vigil pattern and acts in the mortal world. No reversal, but the lens (Causal-Accumulative) allows linear deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth's quiet power to topple false legitimacy, the titan's paradox of small stature and immense patience. The final image ("She did not need to be large to hold up the weight of truth") reweights the opening shadow metaphor without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the cryptic messages and Mira's choice to act through paperwork rather than violence. No overt thematic statements mar the ending; resonance arises from the library's record-keeping and the graceful collapse motif.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distant-intimate, matching Mira's eon-spanning perspective. Diction is elevated but consistent ("regally unpretentious," "breath between one celestial arrangement and the next"). Perceptual signature is clear: she notices manuscripts, ink formulas, genealogical records—filters befitting a guardian librarian. Sentence rhythm modulates appropriately (shorter at discovery beats, longer during reflection). No dialogue, so subtext operates through imagery and action. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Information density is high: most sentences advance character, world, or plot. Minor overwriting: "the breath between one celestial arrangement and the next" and "graceful collapse" recur without clear escalation. One paraphrase loop: "The library remembered everything" near the top echoes thematically later without new pressure. Figurative language ("shadow stretched...like a mourning veil," "bloomed like smoke") is coherent but dense in the opening third. No template cadence or major artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The diminutive titan guardian concept is fresh and well-executed. Transformation of the usurper trope through library records and cryptic margin messages offers a non-obvious angle. The final move—defeating a pretender with paperwork—feels specific and earned. Emotional complexity (patience vs. intervention) adds depth. Risk-taking is moderate: the timeless-library conceit and the cryptic-message method are inventive but not bold structurally. No close echoes of famous works detected.</comment>
