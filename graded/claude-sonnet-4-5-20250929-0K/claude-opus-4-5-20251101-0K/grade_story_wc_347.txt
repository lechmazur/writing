<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is concrete and rooted in her inherited burden, shown through embodied choice (marking the path, pulling travelers up). Internal contradiction appears when she reflects "never wanted to be its caretaker" yet acts decisively, though this could deepen with more visceral cost in the moment. The final acceptance "some burdens chose their bearers" edges toward thesis statement but is mostly earned by prior action. Minor deduction for the grandmother's backstory occupying ~15% without sufficient micro-choices in the present to fully tilt current stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal/Situational Hybrid—Maren's choice to mark the path reactivates the birds (causal), pressure coheres around the frost deadline (situational). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she turns toward home accepting the orchard's purpose, a stance crystallization with felt cost (perpetual duty, bitter nuts). Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when the birds respond to the nut marks, narrowing options and enabling rescue. Cost is visible in her resignation to caretaking and the orchard's curse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and frost create immediate spatial and temporal pressure. The nut's luminescent marks function as micro-setting that constrains choice and enables the rescue. Sensory details (copper warnings, green glow, ice crystals forming) are purposeful and filtered through urgency. The final valley description "graceless beauty, all sharp angles and honest ugliness" charges the ending image. Minor gap: the orchard itself remains abstract; we never see or feel the twisted hazel grove that anchors Maren's burden.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and urgent: guide travelers to safety before frost ices the paths. The nut's use to reactivate the birds constitutes a meaningful tightening that narrows options and raises the cost of failure. Agency is visible: Maren's decision to mark the path and her physical act of pulling them up drive the rescue. The timeframe (frost approaching) imposes real constraint. Slight deduction: the travelers themselves remain passive recipients; no secondary pressure or complication from their actions tests Maren's commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of inherited burden and reluctant purpose emerges through concrete action—marking paths, pulling travelers, accepting return to the orchard—without overt statement until the final paragraph's "some burdens chose their bearers," which edges toward moralizing but is mostly earned. The nut/birds connection and the valley's "graceless beauty" offer non-literal answers to the question of finding meaning in unwanted duty. Minor deduction: the grandmother's blueprint discovery is told rather than shown, and the final thematic line risks spelling out what the prior images already conveyed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "offhandedly exact precision," "graceless beauty, all sharp angles and honest ugliness" carry Maren's pragmatic, unsentimental perspective. POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the rescue, pulling back slightly for the final image. Dialogue is sparse, functional, goal-driven ("Stay where you are. The frost comes soon."). Diction stays consistent with the focalizer's practical idiom. The prose rhythm varies naturally, sentence openings shift, and no filter-verb stacks or template cadence appear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: information density is high, no paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected, and figurative language (copper warnings, ghostly light, graceless beauty) serves pressure without overwriting. Sentence rhythm varies naturally and propels the rescue sequence. Minor deduction: "bitter and strange," "darkness, one glowing mark at a time," and "emptiness, bare trees and stone houses" edge toward paired modifier stacks that slightly slow momentum. The opening and closing images are vivid and resonant. Grammar, tense, and spatial choreography remain clean throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of cursed orchard, mechanical birds, and luminescent nuts offers a fresh angle on inherited-duty narratives. The connection between grove and labyrinth via groundwater and the forgotten blueprint provides non-obvious world logic. "Graceless beauty" and the nuts' non-contact impressions are specific, memorable details. Minor deduction: the reluctant-caretaker-finds-purpose arc follows a recognizable template, and the emotional resolution (acceptance of burden) is familiar. The piece transforms tropes through grounded detail and avoids safety-hedging, but the core trajectory remains within genre expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is introduced early (paragraph 2), her reluctance and duty dramatized through concrete choices: marking the path, guiding travelers, accepting return to the orchard. Her caretaker role drives the entire rescue sequence and shapes the ending stance. Visible cost: perpetual servitude to the cursed orchard. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Setup, development, and payoff all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The nut appears early (paragraph 1), is used actively in at least three beats (held against wall, marking trail, enabling bird response), and its properties (luminescent marks without contact) are irreplaceable mechanics. Closure linkage: the rescue succeeds because of the nut, and Maren's final thought references "heavy with bitter nuts." Setup, development, and payoff all strong. High causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The blueprint is introduced mid-story (paragraph 8), revealed in backstory as the key to understanding the birds' original purpose. It enables Maren's strategy (mark paths to reactivate birds) and thus shapes the rescue. Missing early setup; appears in second third. Development and payoff present: the blueprint's knowledge drives the climactic action. Swappability moderate: another knowledge source could serve similarly. Solid causal work despite late signal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Offhandedly exact precision" appears early (paragraph 5), describing Maren's movement through the labyrinth, and her navigation skill enables the rescue. However, the trait is mostly told rather than shown through specific action with visible tradeoff. It constrains one key choice (knowing the maze) but lacks a felt cost or complication tied specifically to this exactness. Setup and development present; payoff indirect. Mid-band for functional but replaceable role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Assemble" is signaled mid-story ("Tonight, Maren intended to assemble what remained," paragraph 7) and enacted through marking the path to reconnect birds and orchard. The action drives the rescue and constitutes the story's central turn. Strong causal pressure: without assembling the system, travelers die. Closure linkage: birds "sang their first true song in centuries." Setup arrives late (second third), but development and payoff are strong. Irreplaceable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The method (leaving impressions without touching) is introduced early (paragraph 6), demonstrated actively ("pressed the nut near each wall"), and its mechanics matter: the marks guide travelers and reactivate birds. Appears in multiple beats (marking trail, traveler seeing green light, birds responding). Drives the rescue and charges the closure (birds sing, Maren returns with purpose). Setup, development, payoff all strong. Highly specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth and mechanical birds appear in the opening line, create immediate spatial pressure (narrow paths, false turns, cliff edges), and supply both obstacle and resource (birds patrol, then guide). The setting constrains every choice and enables the final resolution (birds reactivated, travelers rescued). Frost adds temporal urgency. Setup, development, and payoff all robust. Environment shapes tactics and charges the ending image (birds singing, valley spread below).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frost deadline is signaled early (paragraph 1: "dying light"; paragraph 2: cold approaching; paragraph 5: "before the night frost forms") and tightens decisions throughout the rescue. Ice crystals begin forming during the climb, making the clock live and urgent. The timeframe drives pacing and raises stakes. Setup, development, and payoff present. Strong causal pressure. Minor deduction: exact elapsed time is not tracked, but urgency is maintained.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to guide travelers is introduced early (paragraph 3: dreams of lost travelers pleading) and dramatized through concrete action (descending the maze, marking paths, pulling them to safety). Internal friction appears: she never wanted this duty but acts decisively. The motivation drives the entire plot and shapes the ending (acceptance of caretaker role). Setup, development, payoff all strong. Visible cost: perpetual obligation to the orchard.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tone phrase "graceless beauty" appears only in the final paragraph, describing the valley: "all sharp angles and honest ugliness, bare trees and stone houses." It charges the ending image and crystallizes Maren's unsentimental acceptance. The tone (pragmatic, unromantic, beauty-in-harshness) coheres throughout—copper warnings, bitter nuts, twisted grove, honest ugliness—but the exact phrase arrives late. Lyric reprise that reweights the stake with conceptual cost. Missing early setup; strong payoff.</comment>
