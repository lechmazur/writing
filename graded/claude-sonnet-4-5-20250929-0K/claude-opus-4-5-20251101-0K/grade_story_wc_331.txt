<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation to find "the place where stories live" drives her nocturnal search, and the final discovery feels earned by her grandmother's legacy and the scarf-as-map reveal. However, the internal experience remains somewhat abstract—we see her walking aisles and observing patrons, but contradictory impulses don't wrestle on the page. The ending choice (to continue cataloging) forecloses the search phase with visible cost (solitude understood rather than escaped), meeting the minimum bar, but the embodied struggle stays thin. "Sanely eccentric" is told more than shown through concrete micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of surreal geometry and analog-memory motifs by the midpoint, then delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) when Eleanor stands in the impossible room and understands the scarf as map. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (librarian, three-a.m. opening, scientific poetry collection). The cost is felt—her solitude shifts from observed to "understood," foreclosing the option of ordinary connection—and the lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful deepening (geometry shifting → room discovery → scarf revelation) suffices at this length, though the conceptual stakes remain more asserted than tested.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is vividly particular (wax cylinders, punch cards, magnetic tape, hyperbolic-shelf curves), and the scarf's texture (machine oil, lavender, frayed edges) becomes a tactile anchor. The surreal geometry constrains Eleanor's path and charges the final image when the scarf reveals itself as map. Sensory selection (voices murmuring equations, frequencies felt in teeth) supports the accumulative design. However, the patrons remain postcard figures—graduate student, elderly man, sleeping teenager—whose presence pressures the tone more than Eleanor's tactical choices, keeping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the literal place where stories live—is signaled early and pursued on-page. The geometry shift and reawakening memories constitute one meaningful tightening that narrows Eleanor's path to the impossible room. Agency appears in her choice to walk by instinct and later to continue cataloging, foreclosing the search phase with felt cost. Yet the escalation reads more as atmospheric deepening than a turn that raises price; no live option is tested and refused, and Eleanor never faces a competing pull (e.g., a patron's need, a deadline, a personal cost of staying). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but remains gentle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—the coexistence of solitary worlds and the literal geography of story—emerges organically from the library's odd hours, analog formats, and hyperbolic architecture. The scarf and frayed edges function as a recurring image that shifts meaning at the end (damage reinterpreted as doorways), and the final notebook annotation offers a quiet, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The "sanely eccentric" grandmother wisdom risks platitude but stays grounded in the scarf's weave and Eleanor's concrete work. Subtext operates in the patrons' oblivious browsing and Eleanor's solitude reweighted as vocation rather than isolation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Eleanor notices what a cataloger would (shelf curves, patron positions, archive formats). The prose modulates appropriately—compressed syntax during the geometry shift, richer description in the impossible room. No dialogue, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. The phrase "her grandmother's hands that she had inherited along with the library" drifts toward lyric overreach, but the voice remains coherent and the scarf's sensory anchoring (oil, lavender, warmth) keeps interiority concrete. Purposeful compression in the final room is legible and pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, sentences open diversely, and information density is high (wax cylinders spinning without phonographs, punch cards casting shadow-odes). However, a paraphrase loop appears: "certain hours held better light" / "some knowledge requires inconvenient timing" restates the same idea within the opening paragraph. The phrase "observed solitude" recurs three times without additional pressure or detail, risking synonym churn. "The place where stories live" is invoked four times across the piece, functional for motif but edging toward template. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors mar peak beats, and the final image (scarf wound tighter, notebook open) propels cleanly. Cumulative artifact penalty: −0.4 for paraphrase loop plus repetitive stems, keeping the score under 7.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The fusion of scientific poetry, analog memory formats, and hyperbolic geometry offers a fresh synthesis, and the scarf-as-map reveal feels earned rather than imported. Yet the core frame—secret room accessed by walking library aisles, inherited quest from wise grandmother—follows a familiar template (magical library, hidden knowledge, lineage keeper). The emotional truth (solitude as vocation) is specific, and the wax-cylinder / punch-card details avoid generic quirk-for-quirk's-sake. Transformation test: swap "scientific poetry" for "alchemical treatises" and the arc holds with minimal edits, signaling mid-range freshness. The hyperbolic geometry and analog-memories concept elevate but do not fully escape the archetype.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Eleanor (odd-hour librarian) is present throughout, frames the opening schedule, and makes the key choice to walk the aisles by instinct (middle beat) and later to continue cataloging (closure beat). Her occupation shapes perception (noticing shelf geometry, catalog methods) and the grandmother inheritance provides motive. All three gates satisfied. However, her decisions are more observational than high-cost: she follows instinct rather than weighing competing goods, and the final choice (continue cataloging) feels like confirmation rather than a turn that narrows options. Causal pressure is present but gentle; irreplaceability moderate. Band: essential across beats but not indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tattered silk scarf appears in the opening (Eleanor wears it, smells oil and lavender), the middle (trails against spines, grows warm during the walk), and the ending (reveals itself as map, Eleanor winds it tighter). It constrains her attention (she touches it to remember) and charges the final image when its frayed edges are reweighted as doorways. The scarf's sensory texture (frayed, oil, lavender, warmth) and its narrative function (inheritance, map, motif) make it irreplaceable. All three gates satisfied, causal pressure clear, closure linkage strong. Cost: visible in the sensory charge and the realization that her grandmother's journey was encoded in the weave. High band but not indispensable (the impossible room could exist without it, though the ending's resonance would flatten).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Analog memories (wax cylinders, punch cards, magnetic tape) are introduced early, shape the middle beat (they reawaken, murmur, flutter), and define the archive Eleanor will catalog in the ending. The concept alters tactics (Eleanor must preserve these non-text formats) and sets the library's texture apart from generic magical-library templates. Setup and development gates satisfied; payoff gate met via the closing line "preserve the analog memories of every voice." However, the concept does not narrow a live choice or impose a felt cost—Eleanor never faces a trade-off between analog and digital, preservation and access, or competing claims. Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is thematic rather than tactical. Mid-band for shaping one key turn (reawakening) and contributing to ending, but not essential to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is told explicitly ("her grandmother had always said") near the midpoint but not dramatized through a choice with visible cost. Eleanor believes impossible things and searches for them, which aligns with the label, but the trait does not constrain an on-page action or enable a risky move—her search is methodical and safe. The attribute appears too late (past the first third) and remains ornamental rather than tactical. Missing setup gate; development gate weak; closure gate absent. Late appearance cap 4.6, label-only deduction −0.3, swappability (could be "determined," "visionary") −0.4. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The action "reawaken" drives the middle turn: wax cylinders spin, punch cards flutter, tapes hum, triggering Eleanor's arrival at the impossible room. It is signaled early (the archive exists "as grooves pressed into wax") and the verb "reawaken" appears on-page during the transformation. Setup and development gates satisfied; payoff gate met (Eleanor's new work is to preserve these reawakened voices). However, the action is not irreplaceable—"activate," "stir," "come alive" could substitute with minor edits. Causal pressure is present (reawakening enables the geometry shift), but the mechanics are vague (what caused it? Eleanor's walk? Her scarf?). Mid-to-upper band for shaping two beats (middle transformation, ending cataloging) without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is mentioned early (grandmother's notes, "parallel lines meeting, triangles with angles summing to more than one hundred eighty degrees") and structures the middle beat when Eleanor recognizes the signs and the shelves curve impossibly. It enables her access to the room that "shouldn't have existed." Setup and development gates satisfied; closure participation weak (the geometry "settled into its ordinary disguise" but does not shape the final choice or image). The method matters to the middle turn but could be replaced with "recursive architecture," "non-Euclidean space," or any surreal-geometry synonym. Specificity moderate; cost connection absent. One key turn shaped; swappability high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is established immediately (opening hours, collection described by paragraph two) and pressures Eleanor's choices throughout: the odd schedule reflects her inheritance and belief system, the analog archive defines her search, the hyperbolic shelves enable the impossible room, and the closing image returns her to the desk with notebook open. All three gates satisfied. The library's particulars (wax cylinders, punch cards, quarks sonnets, benzene-ring songs) are irreplaceable and shape multiple beats (opening, middle transformation, ending vocation). However, the setting does not impose a live constraint or trade-off that alters Eleanor's tactics—she faces no rival claim on the space, no funding crisis, no patron emergency. Essential across beats and ending; causal pressure clear; cost connection implicit (her solitude is tied to the place). High band but not indispensable (the story logic would survive a generic "archive" with some loss of texture).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "while patrons browse" is signaled in the opening (library hours listed) and present on-page (graduate student, elderly man, teenager browsing in the corner). It sets the atmosphere and provides witnesses to Eleanor's solitude. However, the patrons never pressure Eleanor's choices—they remain oblivious, and no browsing deadline or interruption threatens her search. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. Setup gate satisfied; development and payoff gates missing. Functional but replaceable (could be "after closing" or "during inventory" with minimal edits). Present in two beats (opening, middle observation) but ornamental. Cap for missing development and closure gates: 3.4 ceiling; lift for atmosphere and witness function to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation "to find the place where stories live" is stated explicitly in paragraph three and drives her nocturnal walks, her instinct-led search, and her final discovery. It shapes two beats (middle geometry shift, ending room revelation) and is present at closure (she has found it and now begins cataloging). All three gates satisfied. However, the desire is told more than dramatized—Eleanor never weighs this search against a competing pull (e.g., patron need, personal cost, doubt), and the friction between want and cost remains abstract. The motivation is functional and consistent but could be swapped for "to map the library's hidden architecture" with minor edits. Mid-band for shaping key turns without irreplaceability or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone "observed solitude" is established early (patrons in "customary silence," each in "a private universe") and modulates through the piece: neutral observation in the opening, wonder during the transformation ("wrapping in their observed solitudes like cocoons"), and resolution in the ending ("her solitude was no longer something merely observed but finally, wonderfully, understood"). The tone charges the final image by reweighting Eleanor's isolation as vocation rather than loneliness. All three gates satisfied; closure linkage strong. However, the phrase "observed solitude" is repeated three times without varied texture, risking template rather than modulation. Coherent through turns, purposeful deepening, irreplaceable to the ending's emotional effect. High band for tonal control and closure charge.</comment>
