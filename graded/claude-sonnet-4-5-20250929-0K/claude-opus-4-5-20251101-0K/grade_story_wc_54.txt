<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya is grounded in concrete engineering knowledge and her actions—mapping corridors, sketching frameworks—stem from consistent traits. However, her journey from passive observation to creating a plan lacks meaningful internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The change feels more like a natural unfolding than a choice that forecloses paths with felt cost. Her interiority remains too abstract ("stoic wonder," "equations for hope") without embodied tension or genuine struggle against competing desires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph (Maya, Gate 47, post-carnival). The piece follows an Accumulative lens: Maya's exploration through the terminal gathers density toward a final plan. However, the closure lacks on-page cost—she walks away with a plan and warm determination, but no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. The resonant reconfiguration needed for RR (Charged Poise or Earned Stasis) doesn't materialize; the ending asserts forward momentum without dramatizing what she's risking or losing now.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The terminal is vividly rendered with selective detail (dripping water, frozen departure boards, dust patterns) that reflects Maya's engineering perspective. Spatial choreography through gates and corridors is coherent. The sextant piece and terminal infrastructure constrain her thinking and charge the final movement, though the environment doesn't force a pivotal choice. Strong atmosphere and POV-filtered specificity, but the setting remains more backdrop than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reviving the terminal and her purpose—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through her exploration and calculations, culminating in a viable plan. However, no meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs; Maya encounters no resistance, doubt, or cost that narrows her options. The "thirty percent capacity" discovery feels like validation rather than a hard-won turn. One accumulative deepening is present but lacks the felt price needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from concrete images: navigation through uncertainty, intentional design versus decay, resurrection through infrastructure. The sextant piece and maze metaphor deepen without stating a moral. The final image—gates waiting to open, destinations in "patient dark"—offers resonant ambiguity. However, the closing paragraphs edge toward explicit thematic summary ("Some mazes were built to confuse...") that slightly dilutes the earned resonance. Strong thematic coherence overall with minor late drift toward statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with Maya's engineering lens filtering all perception. Diction stays consistent and purposeful ("redirected flows," "functionally creative") without unmotivated register shifts. Perceptual signature is clear: she sees structure and potential where others see abandonment. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with her emotional state. The voice remains distinct and controlled, though some phrases ("stoic wonder," "patient as stone") lean slightly generic. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Information density is high in technical passages. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "terminal's bones were sound" echoed by "basic architecture" and "existing infrastructure"; "maze of intentions" repeated conceptually across multiple paragraphs. The phrase "functionally creative" appears twice without clear evolution. Filter verbs ("could hear," "wanted to understand") stack in a few lines. These patterns don't obscure closure but dull propulsion in middle beats. Deduct −0.6 for loops and template stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The abandoned-spaceport-as-hope premise is fresh, and Maya's engineering perspective offers a non-obvious angle. The sextant piece as navigation metaphor is apt but not transformative. The story commits to its concept but plays it safely: no bold structural risks, no unexpected turns. The emotional arc (despair → determination) follows a familiar template. Specificity in technical detail elevates above generic execution, but the synthesis feels more competent than urgent or inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's engineering background informs her perception throughout and drives her final plan creation. She appears in every beat. However, her "curious" quality is more shown through observation than decision-making that alters tactics. Her intern status is setup only. Present across beats and shapes the ending framework, but her choices don't create key reversals—she discovers and plans without meaningful resistance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sextant appears in three distinct beats: discovery mention, held up to light with reflection on the navigator, and added to presentation file at the end. It seeds early, recurs with shifting symbolic weight (broken tool → navigation metaphor → symbol for investors), and charges the final walk. However, it remains more symbolic than causal—removing it wouldn't break plot logic, only thematic resonance. Lyric reprise with cost connection lifts it into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Maze of intentions" appears as metaphor in the title concept and closing insight ("Some mazes were built to confuse. Others were built to guide"). Maya walks through "the terminal's maze of intentions" and recognizes design genius, but the concept doesn't constrain her choices or alter tactics on the page. It functions as thematic overlay rather than active stake-shaper. Present and coherent but largely ornamental to the plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" appears twice as label: once describing ancient engineers' decisions and once in Maya's self-assessment of her plan. It characterizes her approach but doesn't demonstrably constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost. The attribute describes her method rather than creating friction or trade-offs. Swappable with "pragmatic" or "inventive" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Resurrect" is signaled early (carnival "briefly resurrected the illusion"), frames Maya's goal throughout, and anchors the ending plan to demonstrate viability. Her entire exploration serves this aim. The action shapes all her beats—mapping, calculating, presenting. Removing "resurrect" as the core action would require fundamental rewriting. Strong causal role and closure linkage, though the resurrection itself remains planned rather than enacted on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Through redirected flows" appears explicitly in Maya's thinking: "Water, air, people, purpose. All systems followed similar principles." She examines floor drains and maps water/electrical lines, applying civil infrastructure principles. The method shapes her solution framework and is seeded in her internship backstory. However, the mechanics remain abstract—we don't see her redirect anything on the page, only plan to. Present in setup and development, conceptual role at closure, but not dramatized in action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The terminal is present from the opening line, provides all resources Maya uses (infrastructure, drains, corridors), shapes every beat through spatial exploration, and stands "patient as stone" in the final image. Its post-carnival abandonment creates the opportunity. Removing this specific setting (not just any abandoned building but a designed passenger terminal with intact systems) would collapse the story's logic. Essential across all three gates with high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the carnival leaves" is established in the opening ("departed three days ago") and the ending notes "the carnival's distant lights had vanished beyond the horizon." However, time doesn't tighten decisions—Maya has unlimited time to explore and plan. The three-day gap and "tomorrow she would present" are mentioned but don't create urgency or alter tactics. Present in setup and closure frame but doesn't function as pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To puzzle out new equations for hope" is attributed to the lost navigator, then mirrored in Maya's own work: "calculating the next equation in the series that might lead humanity back to the stars." Her entire arc dramatizes this motivation through her mapping and framework creation. The desire drives her exploration and plan. However, it faces no meaningful friction or competing want—she simply pursues it successfully. Motivation is clear and shapes multiple beats but lacks on-page conflict between desire and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" is maintained consistently: Maya's awe at architectural genius paired with methodical calculation, her mixture of "fear and determination," measuring with "stoic wonder that had carried her through the collapse." The tone modulates appropriately—quieter in observation, intensifying during calculation, resolute at the end. It charges the final image of patient structures and forward momentum. Coherent through all turns and integral to voice, though slightly stated rather than purely embodied.</comment>
