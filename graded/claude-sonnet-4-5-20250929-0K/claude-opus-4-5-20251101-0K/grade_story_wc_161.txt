<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is richly textured with embodied detail (the meteorite making her weep, swallowing the old lie). The decision to tell Mira the truth constitutes a meaningful choice with visible cost—abandoning the protective silence that defined three years. However, the pigeons and scandal backstory arrives largely as exposition rather than embodied memory pressing on present action, and the final journal moment edges toward therapeutic self-awareness ("Trust, she wrote, is learning...") that slightly flattens character-particular voice. The micro-choice to share the meteorite and the confession scene carry genuine pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates through recurring images (dust motes, meteorite, birds) and deepens from silence to confession. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis shifting to nascent trust): Elara's journal entry and the blooming metaphor reconfigure her relationship to secrecy with felt cost—the vulnerability of creating a paper trail after fleeing one. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The cost is legible in "something that had long been withering finally began to bloom," though the exact price (exposure risk, loss of protective anonymity) could be sharper on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira listens without judgment and Elara places the meteorite in her hand.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The attic functions as micro-setting that constrains daily ritual (trunk, skylight, dust-mote mapping) and the meteorite arrives embedded in estate-sale clutter, grounding the discovery in tactile detail. The skylight becomes a literal lens for Elara's meditative practice, shaping her daily choices. Sensory selection is purposeful: decay and possibility, dust swirling in a single beam, the chip "dark as dried blood." The setting subtly guides the confession scene by making the attic a shared contemplative space. Spatial choreography is clean (trunk, skylight, windowsill) and the 1962 newspaper clipping roots the meteorite in verifiable history.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: learning to trust again after self-imposed exile. The confession to Mira—"No," she said, and the word bloomed in her chest—constitutes the primary tightening, foreclosing the option of continued anonymity with visible emotional cost. The meteorite functions as a pressure object, its survived fall mirroring Elara's trajectory and prompting vulnerability. However, Mira's arrival and request ("Show me") unfold without significant resistance or complication; the turn from lie to truth is clean but not deeply tested by counter-pressure. The journal decision at the end extends the cost (creating her own paper trail) but arrives as coda rather than a second reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from meteorite, pigeons, and dust motes as messengers bearing meaning across distance. The final journal passage risks thematic echo ("Trust, she wrote, is learning...") by articulating the premise in near-prompt language, though it remains rooted in the meteorite's concrete image. The piece resists tidy resolution: Elara's blooming is nascent, not triumphant, and the cost of vulnerability remains present. "It fell and was forgotten and found again" reweights prior material without moralizing. The skylight ritual and dust-mote mapping function as embodied spiritual practice rather than symbolic convenience, and the piece invites reflection on transformation and endurance without forcing a binary lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: "dust motes swirl in the single beam," "the word bloomed in her chest." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the confession beat. However, the final journal passage ("Trust, she wrote, is learning...") drifts toward essayistic summary that feels slightly outside Elara's immediate voice under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but functional, naturalistic in Mira's "Show me" and the exchange about birds. Free indirect style is clean throughout. The prose reflects Elara's contemplative stance without filter-verb stacking, though the closing metaphor ("something that had long been withering finally began to bloom") edges toward declarative certainty that could be more image-anchored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with multi-job lines: "She found it wrapped in a 1962 newspaper clipping about the Chassigny fall, a genuine fragment of Mars tucked between astronomy texts and star charts." Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, especially in the confession beat where short syntax ("No," she said) lands cleanly. Two minor artifacts: "carrying words they could never understand across distances that must have felt infinite to their small hearts" layers sentiment that edges toward overwriting, and the journal passage recycles the fall/transform motif without fresh compression. No loops or scaffold clutter. The opening anchors voice and decay/possibility immediately. Clarity remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The meteorite-as-messenger synthesis is fresh and tightly integrated with the pigeons and dust motes, creating a coherent vocabulary of distance and arrival. The attic meditation practice and the skylight ritual feel specific to Elara's history and avoidance. However, the core arc—exile to trust via confession prompted by a younger researcher—follows a familiar template of redemption-through-vulnerability. The journal-writing ending, while thematically apt, leans toward a conventional gesture of reclamation. The piece transforms its elements through Elara's particular voice and the meteorite's charged specificity, lifting it above generic execution, but the structural beats do not surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present in backstory and invoked at the meteorite discovery ("She thought of her pigeons then"). Shapes the confession choice by framing Elara's flight and her understanding of the meteorite as fellow messenger. Does not appear in the middle or drive a distinct beat beyond thematic resonance. Causal linkage to the confession is real but indirect.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Introduced early (estate sale box), handled twice (Elara weeps holding it; places it in Mira's palm), and present in the final image on the windowsill as "small dark promise." Drives the confession beat by prompting reflection on survival and transformation. The chip's dual-atmosphere survival provides the story's central metaphor and directly enables the vulnerable exchange with Mira.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Signaled early (investigators, destroyed trails, fleeing a history), returns at closure when Elara begins her own journal "a paper trail of her own making." Shapes the dominant stake (trust after exile) and the cost of the ending (vulnerability of documentation). Does not constrain middle tactics but bookends the arc with thematic and causal pressure, reversing the opening flight.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Establishes the premise in paragraph two ("someone else entirely") and drives the confession turn when Elara swallows the old lie and tells Mira the truth, foreclosing continued anonymity. The reinvention enabled three years of safety; abandoning it is the story's primary cost. Does not constrain middle action but the ending journal explicitly extends the choice to document rather than hide.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The skylight ritual (standing on the trunk, watching dust motes) frames Elara's practice and returns when she invites Mira to "Show me," making it the site of shared vulnerability. Balancing on the trunk becomes the physical staging for the meteorite exchange. However, the balancing itself does not create jeopardy or constrain the confession; it is setting more than action. Present in opening, middle, and closure, but the verb "balance" functions as location rather than decisive act.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Introduced early ("mapping their movements, she learned to read the attic's moods") as spiritual practice. Does not constrain a middle choice or solve a problem. Returns obliquely in the ending when "dust settled into darkness, waiting for tomorrow's sun to make it dance again," charging the final image with continuity. The mapping taught patience but does not alter tactics or outcome on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Present from the opening line, houses the skylight ritual, supplies the meteorite via estate-sale box, and stages the confession scene. The attic's decay/possibility duality anchors tone and enables Elara's three-year reinvention. The space constrains the story to a contemplative register and its forgotten objects (meteorite, books) shape the plot. The setting is essential across setup, middle discovery, and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The three-year arc from flight to confession frames the story and the autumn visit by Mira marks the transition point. Trust accumulates "in fragments...so slowly you barely noticed," matching the timeframe's gradual pressure. The journal decision extends trust-building forward. However, the story does not tighten urgency via a live clock; the timeframe is scaffolding rather than active constraint. Present across all beats but does not narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stated late (end of fourth-to-last paragraph: "because someone on the other side might need to hear them") after being embodied in the pigeon backstory and meteorite reflection. Drives the confession choice—Elara shares her history so Mira can hear a parallel story of survival. The desire to preserve lost songs motivates both the pigeon work and the final journal. Dramatized through the telling and the meteorite exchange, though the phrase itself arrives as summary.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Blooming/withering anchors the opening ("decay and possibility") and the closing line ("something that had long been withering finally began to bloom"). The duality modulates across beats: decay in secrecy and isolation, possibility in Mira's non-judgment, blooming in the journal decision. Tone charges the final image by reversing the opening's decay into nascent growth. The meteorite's survival through "burning" bridges both poles. Coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
