<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kira's internal contradiction—carrying shadows to protect others while denying herself compassion—is present but remains more told than dramatized through on-page micro-choices. The keeper's diagnostic insight "you've given so much empathy to others that you've forgotten how to feel it for yourself" reads as therapy-speak that explains rather than embodies. The change at closure (shadows as "loyal hounds rather than hungry ghosts") is asserted through metaphor rather than earned through a visible forfeiture or renunciation with felt cost. Interiority leans toward abstract self-awareness ("To map empathy onto action... I have to include myself in that map") instead of embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (lighthouse orchard, peacekeeper, shadows, fragment). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the mirrors accumulate glimpses of past mercy, the crystal reconstitutes via borrowed light, and the final image reweights Kira's relationship to her shadows. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shadows shift from chains to companions, the crystal whole) with felt cost implied in the metaphor shift. However, cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture or tactical constraint is visible in the ending beat itself, only the assertion that she "would carry these glimpses with her now."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard on a cliff above shifting ice floes is vivid and particular ("gnarled apple trees dusted with salt spray," "ice groaned and rearranged itself"). The mirrors as salvage from a drowned village root the setting in loss and transformation. The fragment warms against her hip, providing tactile specificity that anchors the present. The ice floes and orchard recur in the final image, charging the closure moment, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Kira's depletion from carrying shadows and the keeper's cryptic summons. The tightening occurs when the keeper reveals the mirrors hold her acts of mercy and the fragment begins to glow, narrowing her stance toward self-inclusion. However, escalation lacks protagonist agency—the keeper orchestrates the revelation, and Kira's role is largely receptive. No live option is foreclosed on the page; the shift from shadows-as-chains to shadows-as-hounds is metaphorical reconfiguration without a visible trade-off or refusal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme (empathy must include the self; courage as connection rather than self-denial) emerges from the mirror images and the crystal's reconstitution. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the shadows' transformation and the crystal as compass. However, the keeper's exposition "peace isn't just the absence of conflict—it's the presence of connection" borders on thesis statement. The final image (shadows as "loyal hounds," crystal pulsing "toward every act of mercy yet to come") resonates but leans declarative rather than irreducible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Kira with a distinct perceptual signature: "calmly intuitive sense," salt spray, shadows that "clung... as though alive." Diction stays within character ("glimpses," "splinter she couldn't remove"). The keeper's dialogue "You're the anomaly they whisper about" and his revelatory speech maintain clarity without head-hopping. Minor elevation: "nodded during the weighted breath before reply, letting the silence hold its own meaning" shows purposeful modulation. No filter-verb stacks or register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (opening's long lyric line vs. terse dialogue). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("shadows... like chains," "compass pointing toward every act of mercy yet to come"). One mixed vehicle: "glimpses" as both visual memory and borrowed light threads blur the mechanics. Sentence stems vary; no paraphrase loops. The closing metaphor stack (shadows as hounds, crystal as compass, lighthouse beam sweeping) layers without contradiction but approaches overwriting in the final paragraph. Information density is high; momentum holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise (peacekeeper who carries shadows, broken oracle fragment, mirrors that show past acts of mercy) combines multiple genre elements in a lyric frame. The transformation of "courageous anomaly" into a meditation on self-compassion is earnest but the core emotional arc—woman learns to include herself in her circle of care—is familiar. The vintage-store mirrors and ice-floe setting provide texture, yet the keeper as oracle-expositor and the fragment's reconstitution via reflected light read as wish-fulfillment mechanics. No bold structural risk; the execution is competent but safe.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kira is present throughout (setup, development, payoff gates met). She makes the journey to the lighthouse (one beat) and accepts the crystal's reconstitution (closure beat). However, her agency is largely receptive—she observes, listens, and receives insight rather than initiating turns. The keeper drives the revelation. Two beats with closure linkage and early signal place her in mid-band, but passivity and the swappability of "peacekeeper" with any helper-archetype cap upward movement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fragment is introduced early (setup), warms when she reads the message (beat 1), is taken by the keeper and held to the mirrors (beat 2), then reconstitutes and becomes whole in her palm (closure). Four distinct beats with evolving state and causal pressure (the warmth signals the summons matters, the reconstitution enables her shift). Closure participation is strong. Irreplaceability is moderate—any broken magical token could serve similar function with minor edits—but the oracle provenance and "splinter she couldn't remove" metaphor add specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Courageous anomaly" is named by the keeper and echoed in exposition ("marked her as an anomaly among peacekeepers who'd grown cold"). It functions as theme label rather than on-page constraint. No choice is narrowed because she is an anomaly; the mirrors show her past acts, but those acts are told in summary. The concept is ornamental—present in dialogue and reflection but not shaping tactics or stakes in this scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive sense that had guided her through seventeen years" is mentioned once in backstory exposition. It does not constrain or enable any on-page action in this scene; the journey to the lighthouse and the acceptance of the keeper's insight proceed without visible intuition guiding a choice under pressure. Label-only, no development or closure participation. Swappable with "experienced" or "wise."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" governs the story's central image: the fragment glows, draws light from the mirrors, and becomes whole. This action is the pivot (beat 2) and charges the closure ("now whole in her palm"). Early signal is indirect (the fragment as "splinter she couldn't remove" implies incompleteness). The mechanics—light threads from mirrors—are unique enough to resist easy swap. However, the action is performed *on* Kira by the keeper and the mirrors rather than *by* Kira, reducing protagonist agency. Two gates (development, payoff) with causal pressure and specificity lift it into mid-high band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vintage store mirrors are introduced early (the keeper "surrounded by salvage from a vintage store"), their mechanics explained (they hold glimpses of her acts of mercy), and they enable the reconstitution by supplying light threads. Three beats: arrival/setup, the looking sequence where Kira sees herself in multiple mirrors, and the light-drawing moment that heals the fragment. The method is indispensable—no other means is offered, and the story's logic depends on these specific mirrors holding these specific images. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability are all strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes is introduced in the opening line (setup) and returns in the final image ("walked back through the frozen trees," "ice groaned and rearranged itself"). It provides vivid atmosphere but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. The mirrors and fragment drive the turn; the orchard is backdrop. The ice floes' movement and the apple trees' witness charge the closure image with metaphorical resonance (transformation, endurance) but do not impose cost or enable/block an action. Two gates (setup, payoff) with lyric reprise place it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"During the weighted breath before reply" appears once, when the keeper nods and lets silence hold meaning. It marks a micro-moment of charged pause rather than a tightening timeframe that governs the scene. The phrase is evocative and fits tone, but it does not create a clock or deadline that alters tactics. The story's temporal frame is a three-day journey concluded in one lighthouse encounter; "weighted breath" is a beat descriptor, not a governing constraint. Present in one beat with thematic resonance but minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To map empathy onto action" is voiced by Kira as epiphany ("I have to include myself in that map") and echoed in the keeper's exposition about feeding shadows with her own compassion. The motivation is told and summarized rather than dramatized through conflicting wants. It shapes the thematic stakes (her depletion, the need for self-inclusion) and the closure turn (accepting the glimpses, reweighting the shadows). Two gates (development as theme, payoff as stated realization) with closure linkage. Lack of friction—no on-page cost or competing desire—and the reliance on exposition cap the score.</comment>
