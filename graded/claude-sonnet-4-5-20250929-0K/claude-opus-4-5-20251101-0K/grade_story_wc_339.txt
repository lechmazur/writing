<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eleanor's interior life is richly embodied—"first name basis with death" drives her choices throughout, and grief becomes tangible through her handling of objects and environment. Internal contradiction appears in her oscillation between professional detachment and emotional surge. The final acceptance is earned through the accumulated weight of loss and the captain's pages, though the epiphany risks slight over-articulation ("grief was not an anchor but a current"). Minor deduction for the therapeutic framing in the penultimate section, but the cost of letting go is palpable on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation is clean within the first third; the piece establishes who/where/when efficiently. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise) at closure: Eleanor's decision to surface with the artifacts and internalize the captain's lesson reweights her relationship to grief with visible cost—she must carry forward both the public findings and private transformation. Causality is motivated by her search and discovery; the snow globe and captain's pages function as the pivot that deepens her understanding. One meaningful tightening occurs when she reads the captain's words and grasps the physics of surrender, narrowing her stance from holding on to releasing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sunken library is vividly particular—anemones as "displaced librarians," coral-encrusted shelves, mahogany preserved by depth. Sensory detail is filtered through Eleanor's professional eye (noting chemistry, blueprints) and modulates with her emotional state. The snow globe and captain's desk constrain her choices by providing the artifact and text that reshape her understanding, charging the final image. The submersible's ascent mirrors her internal shift, making the environment integral to closure rather than decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Eleanor's search for understanding grief's physics, signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when she finds the snow globe and captain's pages, which force her to confront her own holding-on versus the captain's surrender. One clear reversal: her professional detachment gives way to personal reckoning, and the cost is visible—she must internalize a lesson that demands she release the dead while carrying their artifacts forward. Agency is strong; her decision to secure the items and rise is active renunciation of her prior grip.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the snow globe's Latin inscription and the captain's meditation on surrender, avoiding direct statement until earned. The piece resists easy moralism: grief as current rather than anchor, love persisting through dissolution. The final image—Eleanor rising toward the sun that "had shone on drowned philosophers and lost aviators and everyone she had ever loved"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a thesis. The physics metaphor (bonds breaking, energy releasing) is integrated through Eleanor's lens rather than imposed. One small deduction for "the physics of letting go required not force but faith"—slightly didactic phrasing in the penultimate beat, though it reads as Eleanor's own formulation rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: Eleanor's scientific precision ("approach quietly analytic") colors her observations without flattening emotion. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose modulates effectively from clinical observation to lyric intensity at closure. Minor deduction for one filter-verb cluster in the final third ("The world kept turning despite the weight…") and slight register drift into abstract philosophy ("matter released energy when bonds broke") that, while character-appropriate, edges toward exposition. Dialogue is absent; internal voice remains consistent and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer contemplative passages yielding to shorter beats during the discovery. Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Minor loop detected: "She thought of…" repeats four times in the penultimate section, creating a mild template cadence. The opening and closing lines anchor effectively. One instance of elevated diction ("the profound sadness of drowned words") that borders on purple but remains voice-motivated. No major clarity issues, but the metaphoric density in the reflection passages risks slight overwriting without full payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The sunken library premise is fresh, and the snow globe—a miniature storm sealed for a century—offers a specific, non-obvious central image. The connection to Amelia Earhart frames the piece in a contemporary moment without heavy-handedness. Eleanor's "first name basis with death" and the floating academy's failure provide particular, earned ground for the theme. Risk-taking in the lyric final section heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: the "physics of letting go" frame, while executed well, echoes familiar grief-memoir idiom and could have been pushed further into Eleanor's specific scientific worldview to fully escape template territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's "first name basis with death" is established early and shapes her fearless descent and calm approach to discovery. It constrains her professional detachment (she can observe calmly because she's familiar with loss) and enables her to grasp the captain's lesson at closure. The trait appears in three beats: opening framing, her handling of the snow globe, and her final readiness to "break through." Cost is visible—her intimacy with death has stripped away fear but also isolated her from the living world she must now re-enter.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The snow globe appears in three distinct beats: discovery, examination (noting the Latin inscription and micro-ecology), and securing it for ascent. It drives the key turn when Eleanor reads its inscription and connects it to the captain's meditation. The object's specific properties—sealed water, artificial snow, the crack that allowed colonization—charge the final image by embodying the story's central paradox: containment and release, storm and stasis. Without this exact object, the closure would lose its concrete anchor.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "last transmission" is Eleanor's stated goal and the captain's pages provide it, shaping her understanding at the pivotal beat. The concept narrows her search tactics (she cross-references blueprints to find the captain's quarters) and reweights her grief by offering a model of acceptance. It's present in setup, middle discovery, and closure when she internalizes the lesson. However, the pages function more as thematic catalyst than active plot driver; they don't alter her physical options, only her internal stance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Quietly analytic" is demonstrated early ("her approach quietly analytic even as her heart registered the profound sadness") and recurs in her systematic noting of the snow globe's details. The trait enables her to ground emotion through observation ("The observations grounded her against the surge of emotion") and constrains her from full surrender until the captain's words give her permission. Label-only mention in the opening reduces the score, but the trait does constrain her response at the discovery beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Note" appears as Eleanor's action when examining the snow globe and captain's pages, reflecting her professional habit. It's present in two beats but doesn't drive major turns—she would discover and internalize the lesson whether she "noted" or simply observed. The action demonstrates her character trait (quietly analytic) but is swappable with "examine" or "record" without structural loss. Mid-band: functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" is signaled early and used literally when Eleanor cross-references blueprints with the coral-encrusted reality to find the captain's quarters. The method constrains her approach (she can't simply search randomly; she must decode the ship's layout) and enables the discovery. It appears in setup and at the key turning beat, shaping her tactics under pressure. The metaphoric echo ("untangling threads of information") ties to the theme of sorting through accumulated loss. One beat of active use limits the score from reaching higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sunken library is established early and provides essential resources (the snow globe, captain's pages) that alter Eleanor's understanding. The environment constrains her physically (submersible, depth, preservation conditions) and metaphorically (drowned knowledge, coral transmutation). It shapes three beats: descent/observation, discovery in captain's quarters, and ascent. Spatial details (collapsed shelf, telescope, desk) guide her search. The setting's specific properties—"quirk of chemistry and depth" preserving the desk—enable the plot rather than merely decorating it. Without this exact setting, the thematic resonance and discovery would collapse.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The Amelia Earhart discovery frames the opening ("Three weeks after the world celebrated") and recurs at closure ("lost aviators"), providing contemporary context and thematic parallel. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten Eleanor's decisions or create urgency; the dive would proceed identically without this anchor. The element functions more as atmospheric resonance than plot pressure. It's present in setup and closure but doesn't constrain tactics or alter options in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Eleanor's desire "to understand the physics of letting go" is stated early, dramatized through her handling of the snow globe and reading of the captain's pages, and resolved at closure when she internalizes the lesson. The motivation creates friction between her professional detachment and personal need, visible when "observations grounded her against the surge of emotion." It shapes three beats: framing the dive's purpose, guiding her focus during discovery, and crystallizing at the ending when she's "ready to break through." Cost is palpable—she must release her grip on the dead while carrying their lessons forward.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sophisticated melancholy is established immediately ("salt and silence," "first name basis with death") and sustained through the descent, discovery, and ascent without becoming maudlin or static. Tone modulates subtly: clinical observation during the search, lyric intensity at the snow globe discovery, quiet acceptance at closure. The register—elevated but not overwrought, scientific yet emotionally attuned—remains consistent and charges the final image ("the same sun that had shone on drowned philosophers"). Diction choices ("indifferent sea," "patient work of the ocean") embody the tone without declaring it.</comment>
