<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her resourcefulness shown through gap-research methodology, but her interior life remains thin—we get linguistic expertise labels without embodied contradiction under pressure. The time traveler's seventeen-version exposition dumps character knowledge rather than letting Mira discover it through friction. Her final insight ("The mountain doesn't trap people") arrives as epiphany without prior misbelief dramatized in choice. The botanical diary mechanics and Thessaly's rescue feel more plot-functional than emotionally inhabited.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly (who/where/when by the opening paragraphs). The causal chain—diary coordinates → gap research → speaking to the mountain → Thessaly's release—holds under a Causal lens. The closure delivers a Decisive Change (Thessaly emerges, they leave together) with cost legible in "three years of lessons" and the mountain's hopefulness. One escalation turn (understanding the mountain rescues rather than traps) meaningfully tightens options. The time traveler's arrival functions as complication but his exposition about seventeen versions feels like scaffold rather than earned pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The mountain-as-library conceit is vivid and the spiral-shelf imagery memorable, but the vast scale rarely constrains a specific choice—Mira moves freely through Philosophy/Prophecy/Recursive Fiction without spatial friction. The botanical diary (pressed dream-flowers, chlorophyll coordinates) supplies concrete detail that charges the closure via the "flower that blooms when observed by someone who forgot something important." The final image of sunlight "like a question" reweights the setting's meaning, meeting the 9+ gate partially, but mid-story the labyrinth functions more as backdrop than tactical shaper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the Library, rescue Thessaly) is signaled early and pressure coheres under the Causal lens. The key reversal—realizing the mountain rescues listeners rather than trapping them—narrows Mira's options from force to negotiation with visible cost (she must promise to teach, not just take). The time traveler's "seventeen versions" exposition asserts stakes without on-page demonstration. Mira's agency drives the turn, but the mountain's acceptance feels swift; we don't see her offer tested or a competing choice foreclosed with friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of unlearned lessons and humanity's refusal to listen emerges organically from the mountain-as-wounded-guardian conceit. The botanical diary's impossible flowers function as resonant particulars (knowledge that "would never exist"), and the final image—sunlight as "a question humanity might finally be ready to answer"—reweights prior material without stating a moral. The time traveler's line "fourteen gave up, three died" asserts thematic weight rather than earning it through scene pressure. Subtext operates cleanly in Mira's gap-language methodology, though the mountain's "hopefulness" in the final line edges toward overt declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mira; psychic distance is consistent. Diction carries a lyric-philosophical register ("unheard symphonies," "silence hopes to become sound") that fits the arcane-linguist frame, though phrases like "wounded guardian" and "patient as always, but perhaps—for the first time—hopeful" veer toward narrator-voice philosophizing rather than Mira's direct perception. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the time traveler's exposition ("I've seen seventeen versions") and Mira's aphoristic replies feel more thematic than embodied speech. Perceptual signature is present in the gap-research lens but not deeply idiosyncratic under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates appropriately (short beats at the mountain's shudder, longer exposition blocks earlier). Information density is high in the botanical diary descriptions and the gap-language conceit. Three distinct issues lower the score: (1) metaphor density in every other sentence without pattern-teaching ("chambers of a nautilus shell," "thread in an unheard symphony," "bloomed like impossible flowers") creating a lyric haze; (2) filter-verb stack in the time traveler's watch-and-admit sequence; (3) synonym churn around "knowledge/wisdom/lessons" in the final third. The closure image ("sunlight waited like a question") is vivid, but the prior line's "patient as always, but perhaps—for the first time—hopeful" is scaffold-like philosophizing. Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.0 in Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The mountain-as-living-library premise is familiar (sentient repositories, knowledge-as-memory); the twist—rescuing listeners rather than trapping seekers—offers a fresh moral inflection. The gap-research methodology (studying absences, words "deliberately left unsaid") and botanical diary of impossible flowers provide specific texture. The time traveler's arrival and seventeen-version exposition feel more like a convenience device than an organic complication. The rescue-via-negotiation rather than force is non-obvious, but the swift mountain-acceptance and Thessaly's emergence lack friction that would make the synthesis feel inevitable rather than thematically arranged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira (arcane linguist) is present throughout, her gap-research skill signals early and enables the key turn (speaking "in the language of growing things" to negotiate). She makes the decisive choice to offer teaching rather than taking, altering the outcome. Her linguistic expertise is shown in action (reading chlorophyll patterns, speaking between-words languages) across multiple beats and shapes closure. However, her interior decision process is thin—the epiphany arrives quickly without visible conflict between prior assumptions and new understanding. Stronger if we'd seen her attempt force or another method first with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears early (in her satchel, coordinates leading here), is handled/consulted mid-story (the flower-map observed by "someone who had forgotten something important"), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure (Thessaly clutches her own filled diary, "three years of lessons"). Its impossible-flowers conceit is irreplaceable and causally active—the chlorophyll coordinates guide the search, the flower-map enables the insight. Three distinct beats, closure linkage strong, specificity high. Could reach 8.5+ if the diary's mechanics had constrained an earlier failed attempt, making its final use feel harder-won.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rescue missions frame the story (Mira intends to rescue Thessaly; prior missions failed). The concept shapes the dominant stake and Mira's goal. The key turn redefines "rescue" (the mountain rescues listeners, not traps them), which is thematic reweighting but doesn't alter on-page tactics—Mira's method (gap-research, speaking to the mountain) wasn't shown failing first under the old assumption. Present in setup, thematically active at closure, but middle development is thin; the rescue unfolds smoothly once the insight lands. Functional across two gates but not indispensable to structure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is asserted in narration ("She had learned to be carefully resourceful") and demonstrated once via gap-research (studying absences, margins). The method enables the solution, but we don't see a prior resource constraint or a choice where caution/resourcefulness foreclosed a riskier path with visible cost. The trait is more told-then-shown than embodied across beats. Present in setup and payoff (the negotiation tactic reflects resourcefulness), but lacks middle friction where the trait's limits or costs are tested. One causal beat, modest specificity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Renegotiate" is introduced by the time traveler and becomes Mira's decisive action—she shifts from "rescue by finding" to "negotiate by offering to teach." The word is spoken on-page, the concept shapes the climax (speaking to the mountain, making the deal), and closure hinges on successful negotiation (Thessaly released). Two beats: time traveler's proposal and Mira's enactment. The action is specific and causally central. Could score higher if the negotiation itself had encountered resistance or cost on the page, rather than the mountain accepting immediately after one speech.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Researching gaps" is signaled early ("she researched gaps—the absences, the negative spaces, the words that manuscripts deliberately left unsaid"), demonstrated in the botanical diary work (finding the flower-map in margins), and becomes the method for the final insight (the Library hides "in the margins"). The method is irreplaceable to the solution's logic. However, it appears primarily in summary/telling rather than shown beats—we don't see Mira test and fail another approach first, making the gap-method feel more asserted than earned through friction. Present in setup and payoff, thematic integration strong, but dramatization thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The labyrinthine-bookstore-mountain is vividly rendered (spiral shelves, Philosophy/Prophecy sections, Recursive Fiction traps) and present throughout. It supplies the core constraint (the Library moves, hides) and the antagonist-function (the mountain as wounded guardian who won't release listeners). The setting's living-memory conceit is causally active—the mountain's fear of forgetting drives its behavior, and Mira's solution (speaking to it) addresses that wound. Three beats: initial search, understanding its nature, final negotiation. The spatial scale is more atmospheric than tactically binding (Mira moves freely), preventing top-band score, but closure linkage is strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the time traveler arrives" marks the narrative present; prior search (seventeen days) is backdrop. The timeframe isn't tracked as live pressure—no clock tightens, no urgency escalates. The time traveler's presence introduces the key information (mountain's nature, seventeen failed versions) but doesn't impose temporal cost. Thessaly's three-year captivity is mentioned at closure but doesn't constrain Mira's choices. Present in setup (he materializes early) and referenced at the end (fading "into a future that had just become possible"), but the element functions more as framing device than tactical shaper. Swappable with "after receiving the diary" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Finding the Library of Unlearned Lessons is Mira's stated goal from the opening, dramatized through the seventeen-day search and diary-guided methodology. The motivation is tested when she realizes the Library's nature (humanity's rejected wisdom) and must shift from taking to teaching. Friction emerges in the realization that "it cannot bear to let listeners leave," reweighting her goal from extraction to negotiation. The want is consistent, conflicted at the turn, and paid off at closure (Thessaly emerges, they carry lessons out together). Three beats, cost visible in the promise to teach, causal pressure strong. Could reach 8.5+ if the motivation had faced a harder temptation or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" appears in the opening description (books pulse with "unheard symphonies") and at the climax ("her voice a thread in an unheard symphony finally given sound"), creating a purposeful reprise that reweights meaning—Mira's act gives voice to silenced knowledge. The lyric-philosophical register is coherent throughout and modulates appropriately (wonder at the setting, urgency at the insight, quiet resolve at closure). However, the tone is more consistently elevated than dynamically charged; peak pressure (the mountain shudders) doesn't roughen diction or syntax. The metaphor is specific and tied to theme, meeting lyric-resonance criteria. First-paragraph seed and closure payoff earn mid-6s; fuller beat involvement would lift higher.</comment>
