<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and her operational gentleness shows through gesture ("fingers operatively gentle"), but the forty-three-year backstory compresses motivation into summary rather than live contradiction. Her choices at the terrace—handing pens, timing the alignment—feel more procedural than driven by conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final clipboard moment gestures toward endurance but doesn't dramatize a visible cost that forecloses a path; she simply continues. Internal conflict remains conceptual rather than embodied in competing wants colliding on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story patterns callbacks (clipboard, wildflowers, twin shadows) and deepens through Elara's choice to "keep paying," a Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis. Cost is legible: forty-three years, seventeen failures, and the weight of names. Orientation anchors quickly (ancient terrace, midsummer, Elara's role). However, the closure reconfiguration is more stated ("Redemption...was not a single payment") than crystallized in a charged final image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. The treaty signing itself feels ceremonial rather than a decisive tightening that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The terrace overlooking the Valley of Echoes is vivid and purposeful, grounding the ritual in shared reverence. The clipboard—handled, pressed to chest, opened—functions as micro-setting and constrains Elara's ritual choices. Wildflowers through bones and twin moons supply atmospheric texture. Spatial choreography (General arrives first, leaders take separate paths) remains coherent. However, the setting doesn't narrow tactical options at the climax; the terrace serves more as backdrop than constraint. The final descent is legible but doesn't charge the closure image with environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: ending the Forever War through celestial-anchored ritual. Pressure accumulates via Elara's history (seventeen broken ceasefires), Theron's and Kell's losses, and the ticking moons. The signing moment tightens options by linking treaty to cosmic convergence. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on stated exhaustion ("I know...every name") rather than a live reversal or deepening that forces a visible trade-off. The handshake and signature unfold without friction; coincidence (both leaders arrive, both sign) facilitates resolution rather than protagonist agency reshaping tactics under constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—redemption as ongoing practice, peace as repetition—emerges through clipboard lineage, wildflowers in bones, and Elara's commitment despite futility. The final image ("lifetime of installments") reweights prior material without explicit moralizing. Subtext operates in Theron's stiff handshake and Kell's flat acknowledgment. However, the phrase "price of redemption is not forgetting" and "anchor ideals in practice" approach thematic echo by articulating the story's thesis in near-prompt language. The ending offers resonance but leans toward statement rather than a non-literal image that dramatizes the question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at "throat constricted," wider at "indifferent...celestial bodies"). Diction fits a weary diplomat's register without filter-verb excess. Dialogue for Theron and Kell is spare and goal-driven, carrying subtext in brevity. Perceptual signature—Elara's "flawed beauty" lens—is consistent. Minor slip: "operatively gentle" reads slightly elevated for peak interiority, and the final paragraph's cadence ("She intended to keep paying") edges toward summary rather than scene-specific perception under pressure. No head-hopping or major voice breaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift purposefully. Information density is high in the opening (terrace history, clipboard lineage, Forever War context). However, paraphrase loops appear: "flawed beauty" recurs three times across paragraphs without evolving meaning; "She was tired. She had always been tired" is conceptual redundancy. Template cadence in the midsection: "She reviewed...She had learned...She opened" stacks protagonist-verb stems. The final metaphor "bleeding across the horizon, promising nothing, offering everything" strains coherence (how does bleeding promise?). No causality breaks, but scaffold and figurative muddle lower precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The celestial-alignment ritual and clipboard lineage offer specific angles on peace-negotiation tropes. The Forever War premise and weary mediator role read as familiar fantasy templates, and the story does not fully transform them through non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail that surprises. Elara's final descent and "installment" metaphor feel earned in hindsight but predictable from the opening's tone. Risk-taking is moderate; no bold structural or perspectival choices heighten stakes beyond the provided elements. Emotional specificity in Theron and Kell's losses adds texture but doesn't shift the trajectory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara appears in all beats, frames stakes, hands pens, times the signing, and descends at closure. Her decisions (using celestial convergence, giving identical documents) enable the treaty. However, key turns result more from the leaders' arrival and compliance than from Elara's tactical adjustments under pressure. She observes and facilitates; the signing itself is cooperative rather than a choice that alters her tactics. Present across setup, middle, and ending, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The clipboard is pressed to chest (armor), opened to withdraw documents, and used to record the moment. It appears in three beats with backstory anchoring (generations of negotiators). However, its meaning remains static: legacy and burden. No evolving use or reweighted reprise at closure; Elara simply holds it at the end. Swappable with "journal" or "ledger" without structural loss. Functional but not charged by the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"The price of redemption" is stated explicitly mid-story ("The price of redemption is not forgetting") and echoed at closure ("lifetime of installments"). It shapes Elara's motivation to continue despite failures and informs the choice to anchor the treaty in ritual. However, the concept is more thematic claim than on-page constraint; no scene dramatizes a trade-off where redemption costs Elara a specific option. Present and coherent, but does not narrow tactics with visible price.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Operatively gentle" is labeled ("her fingers operatively gentle") and linked to training ("She had learned that force accomplished nothing"). It motivates her soft approach (handing pens gently, whispering "Now"). However, no beat shows a cost or trade-off where gentleness constrains another option. Mentioned in setup, echoed in method, but absent from closure. Functional label without dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Muster" appears twice: Elara's innovation to "muster their shared reverence" and her final resolve to "muster whatever strength remained." It frames her strategy (using celestial alignment) and closure stance (ongoing effort). However, swappable with "summon" or "gather" without loss. The action is conceptual rather than a specific physical or social move that redefines options. Present in setup and ending but not causally irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ritual significance is signaled early ("anchoring the treaty...in the movements of the cosmos"), shapes the treaty's structure (simultaneous signatures at moon-touch), and charges the ending (torches gutter, moons drift apart). The mechanics matter: timing constrains the signing beat. However, the ritual could be replaced with another shared ceremony (harvest feast, solstice) without altering character arcs. Essential to this story's logic but not uniquely irreplaceable. Strong setup, middle constraint, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ancient terrace is established early (weathered limestone, overlooking Valley of Echoes), hosts the signing, and frames the final descent. Its age and shared reverence motivate both sides to attend. However, the setting does not constrain tactics; the treaty could occur in a temple or hall. Micro-setting (clipboard, torches) does more work than the terrace itself. Present across all beats but postcard-level rather than altering choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The celestial alignment is signaled ("within the hour"), tracked ("moons aligned overhead," "Now"), and concluded ("moons drifted apart, their conjunction ending"). Time tightens the signing decision and adds ritual weight. However, no beat shows Elara or the leaders adjusting tactics because the window is closing. The clock is present but not pressuring; they arrive, wait, and sign on cue. Functional setup and closure, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elara's desire to "anchor ideals in practice" is stated explicitly and motivates her ritual innovation and lifelong service. It drives her choice to use celestial convergence ("action repeated until it becomes tradition") and shapes the ending commitment. However, no scene dramatizes friction between this want and a competing cost. The motivation is declared and pursued without visible trade-off. Present and coherent but told more than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Flawed beauty is established in the Valley of Echoes ("wildflowers now grew between the bones"), echoed in the terrace's weathered state, and charged at closure ("flawed beauty of midsummer dawn...promising nothing, offering everything"). Tone modulates: exhaustion at the opening, tentative hope at signing, weary resolve at the end. The final image reweights the motif with thematic pressure. However, "flawed beauty" is also labeled three times, reducing subtlety. Strong setup, modulation, and closure participation; minor overstatement.</comment>
