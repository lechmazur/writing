<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivations are clear and embodied: desperation for funding, professional validation, and the pull of discovery. The internal conflict between scientific ambition and instinctual reverence is well-dramatized through her physical hesitation at the altar. Her choice to release rather than exploit the memories earns the final shift, though the dead explorer's motivations could be more distinctly rendered. Minor reliance on summary emotion ("the gathered hush pressed against her") slightly softens peak interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: Marina ascends with an empty vial, transforming from proof-seeker to witness-carrier, the cost visible in her abandoned career validation. The causal chain is strong—distress signal → temple discovery → memory encounter → choice to release → ascent with testimony. Orientation anchors quickly (underwater temple, Marina, diving suit). One minor velocity dip in the middle expository block about the priests and memory-vials, but it primes the central stakes and the ending reweights all prior pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The underwater temple setting actively constrains: oxygen timer forces urgency, depth isolates, the altar's physical presence shapes the climactic choice. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"water thick with suspended particles," "brass and leather contraption," faceted crystal scattering rainbows. The dead explorer's skeleton and the carved walls that "show" memories ground the mystical in tactile specificity. The vial as micro-object charges the final image, pressed against her heart during ascent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving consciousness can be bottled—is signaled early and tightens when Marina confronts the tangled memories. The oxygen warning provides external pressure; the choice between taking proof and honoring the sacred provides moral escalation. The reversal (from exploitation to release) is protagonist-driven and forecloses her academic validation with visible cost. The dead man's reaching fingers function as both constraint and moral compass, adding a secondary pressure that converges at the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars: the ephemeral can't be captured without destroying it, witness is more honest than proof. The empty vial at the end offers a resonant non-literal answer—testimony over science, carrying forward over possessing. No overt moralizing; the gathered hush and lonesome splendor recur with shifting weight. The piece resists tidy resolution: the university will likely reject her, but she has gained something irreproducible and finally understood.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, with strong perceptual signature: Marina notices the "lonesome splendor," interprets the dead man's posture as prayer, filters memory-touch through professional lens. Distance modulates appropriately—tighter during the altar encounter, slightly wider during transit. Diction is elevated but consistent ("gathered hush," "suspended starlight"), voice-motivated and legible. Occasional filter-verb stacks ("seemed to shift," "seemed thicker") are minor and don't dull immediacy at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with strong rhythm control and varied sentence structure. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "lonesome splendor" conveys both beauty and isolation). Minor scaffolding appears in expository middle section: "according to her research" feels inserted. The phrase "gathered hush" recurs five times, mostly purposeful but borders on over-reliance. No major loops or template cadence; figurative language is coherent and supports rather than obscures.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of underwater archaeology, memory-as-perfume, and the moral choice between proof and witness feels fresh and specific. The twist—releasing rather than taking—is earned and non-obvious. The 300-year distress signal frame adds narrative ingenuity. Some familiar beats (abandoned temple, mystical artifact, funding pressure) are elevated through execution and thematic integration, though the core "scientist learns to respect the sacred" arc is recognizable. Risk-taking in the quiet, renunciatory ending strengthens originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The distress signal sender (dead explorer) is present as skeleton and backstory but makes no on-page choices. His prior decision not to take the vial provides moral framing and stops Marina's hand momentarily, shaping one key beat. However, he functions more as symbol than active character; removing him would weaken thematic weight but the plot could proceed.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The crystal perfume vial appears in setup (hanging at Marina's belt), drives the middle encounter (reaching for it on the altar), and charges the closure (empty, pressed against her heart during ascent). Its specific property—designed to store distilled memories—enables the core conflict and the final inversion. The vial's emptiness at the end reweights its meaning from proof-vessel to testimony-carrier, with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Gathered hush" is signaled early ("the kind of quiet that had weight"), recurs throughout to define atmosphere, and directly shapes Marina's choice—the accumulated silence stops her as it stopped the dead man. It constrains her instinct to take and charges the final understanding. The concept is specific to this setting and stakes, not merely decorative, though its causal pressure is more atmospheric than mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's ability to touch and perceive memories (hands pressing flowers, child's steps, morning light through window) is demonstrated early and returns at the altar when she feels the tangled emotions. This trait enables the central action—unsnarling the memories—and creates a visible cost (she must experience the accumulated longing). The attribute is shown twice in functionally distinct beats and participates in closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" defines the climactic action: Marina works the tangled memories apart, giving each recognition before release. The action is irreplaceable—taking versus unsnarling is the moral and plot fulcrum. Setup (snarled/wrapped emotions described), execution (pressing fingers to altar, letting memories flow), and payoff (vial empty but no longer heavy) are all on-page. The verb choice is specific and redefines the expected "take the artifact" beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"By overriding instinct" is signaled when the text notes the dead man's instinct stopped him, then explicitly named when Marina "began to work" by overriding that same bone-deep knowledge. The method shapes the climactic choice—she must consciously reject the warning both men felt. It's seeded, executed, and its cost (going against sacred intuition) is legible, though the mechanics are more psychological than procedural.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater temple provides pressure throughout: crushing depth, isolation, and the mystical memory-architecture that stops intruders. The altar is the physical site of the climax; the carved walls deliver backstory via touch. The setting's "unfindable" design explains why no rescue came and why Marina's proof will remain unverifiable. Spatial details (antechamber, columns, sanctuary) track coherently and the environment charges the final image of ascent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Time pressure is established early ("three hours of oxygen remaining") and returns at closure ("oxygen meter beeped its warning"). The ticking clock tightens Marina's choice at the altar and forces her ascent, altering tactics. However, the timer is not tracked between setup and ending; the middle encounter feels untimed. The timeframe shapes two beats cleanly but does not accumulate pressure scene-by-scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marina's motivation "to harness the ephemeral" is dramatized from the first paragraph (funding dry, university dismissal, "lifetime of proof to retrieve") and tested at the altar when she must choose between capturing and releasing. The friction between professional need and reverence for the sacred drives the central conflict. The final inversion—testimony instead of proof—emerges from this motivation with visible cost (career forfeiture implied).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is named early, recurs as a charged phrase, and modulates through the arc: awe during exploration, reverence at the altar, bittersweet understanding during ascent. The tone is coherent—melancholy beauty without sentimentality—and intensifies under pressure without breaking voice. The final image (rising with the empty vial, temple settling back into silence) crystallizes the tone and charges the ending.</comment>
