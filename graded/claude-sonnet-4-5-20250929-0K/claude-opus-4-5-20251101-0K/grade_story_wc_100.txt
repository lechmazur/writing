<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ezra's characterization is solid: his inadvertent stubborn trait drives his refusal to abandon the lens, and his forty years of undertaking provides grounded authority. The underwater funeral work shows embodied action ("learned their names from the waterlogged records"), though his internal contradiction could be sharper—he moves from weary to purposeful without much visible struggle. The final shift to accepting stillness feels earned by the seven-night labor, but the exhaustion-to-purpose arc trends slightly mechanical. Minor: "inadvertently stubborn in ways he never recognized in himself" tells rather than dramatizes the trait through an on-page micro-choice early.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is prompt (undertaker, mortuary, Tuesday package), and the lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture: the lens fragments pulse → Ezra descends → learns names → lens reassembles → souls find peace. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Ezra stops running from stillness and the lens's purpose is fulfilled. Cost is visible—his deepening weariness and the seven-night labor—and the library's peace is confirmed on-page. One tightening: the distress signal escalates from pulse to immersion to the final beacon. No causality breaks, though the dream-or-death descent could signal its rules more concretely.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater library is vivid and purposeful: coral-crusted spires, bioluminescent fish, books-as-reefs, and impossible geometry all constrain Ezra's navigation and charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Ezra's professional lens (mortuary workbench, faces of the dead). The lens itself acts as a recurring object that transforms from broken to whole, shaping the closure. Minor: the "impossible spaces between the shelves where geometry bent like grief" borders on metaphorical decoration rather than tactical constraint, though it does color the atmosphere effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—give the unburied souls rest—is clear and drives all seven nights of work. One meaningful tightening: each funeral rite fuses a lens fragment, escalating toward the final beacon. Agency is present: Ezra chooses to descend and perform the rites despite deepening weariness. Cost is legible (exhaustion, seven nights of labor), though the lack of on-page friction or failure during the underwater work slightly dilutes pressure. The souls' cooperation and the straightforward assembly process reduce tension; no reversal complicates the path to closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the necessity of witness and burial for rest, the undertaker's refusal to abandon purpose, and "some things must be buried before they can be kept." The lens as a distress signal and the library's impossible architecture function as motifs that reweight at closure without overt statement. Subtext operates in Ezra's mirror-reflection exhaustion and the drowned woman's request. The final image—lens glowing, library sleeping, Ezra accepting stillness—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The closing line "refused to abandon broken things" risks slight redundancy with earlier material but stays within register.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and close to Ezra; perceptual signature is consistent (undertaker's professional distance, shoulder-bent grief). Diction fits the voice ("inadvertently stubborn," "chased silence"), and the prose modulates with pressure (short clauses during the pulse, longer reflection at closure). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: the drowned woman's "give rest a permanent address" advances the stake cleanly. Minor: "not ghosts, exactly, but not the living either" and "dreams or death or something between" hedge slightly, though the ambiguity serves the liminal setting. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well, and information density is high across most beats. Opening hooks with the kelp-wrapped package, and the final image recycles the lens with reweighted meaning. Line-level clarity is strong, though minor overwriting appears: "impossible spaces between the shelves where geometry bent like grief" stacks metaphor, and "the drowned had found their rest" + "refused to abandon broken things" in the final paragraph create slight synonym drift. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The "not X, exactly, but not Y either" construction recurs ("not ghosts, exactly" / "dreams or death or something between"), a modest tic that doesn't obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The underwater-library premise and lighthouse-lens-as-distress-signal offer a fresh synthesis, and the undertaker protagonist brings grounded specificity. The seven-night burial rite and impossible geometry add texture. However, the "weary professional finds purpose through supernatural task" frame is recognizable, and the lack of on-page complication or friction during the underwater work reduces boldness. Transformation is present but modest: the emotional arc (weariness → purpose) and the lens reassembly follow a fairly straight path. The final image's quiet resonance elevates, but the middle section's cooperative souls and seamless rite assembly trend safe.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ezra (weary undertaker) is present throughout and drives all key turns: he refuses to discard the lens (inciting), descends through the pulse (escalation), performs the seven-night burial work (middle labor), and accepts stillness at closure. His professional identity shapes his approach (learning names, giving rites), and his weariness contrasts with earned purpose. Cost is visible (deepening exhaustion, seven nights). Present in setup, middle, and payoff; essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The broken lighthouse lens is handled in setup (arrives in package, sits on workbench), escalation (pulses with distress rhythm, Ezra touches it), middle (reassembles fragment by fragment as he buries souls), and closure (blazes with final beacon, then sits intact catching morning sun). Its distress function drives the plot, its reassembly tracks progress, and its transformation charges the ending. Irreplaceable: story logic fails without this exact object. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Distress signals (core concept) shape stakes and tactics: the lens pulses with "a rhythm like a heartbeat transmitted through water, a distress signal from somewhere impossible," driving Ezra's descent. The souls have been "sending distress signals for centuries," and the final beacon answers them. The concept is active in setup, middle (souls searching), and closure (signal finally answered). It alters options: without the signal, Ezra would not descend; without his answer, souls remain lost. Cost and tactics trace to it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Inadvertently stubborn" is named early and constrains one key choice: Ezra "couldn't abandon broken things that had once served a purpose," driving his refusal to throw away the lens. This single beat launches the plot. However, the trait is largely told ("in ways he never recognized in himself") rather than shown through a second on-page tradeoff, and it does not visibly complicate later decisions underwater. Present in setup with one causal beat; modest middle/closure participation. Label-only texture lowers integration slightly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Revitalize" is the central action: "Each name he spoke aloud seemed to revitalize something in the corresponding spirit, their transparency solidifying slightly, their aimless drifting taking on direction." This mechanic drives the middle escalation (each funeral rite → lens fragment fuses → souls gain direction) and is essential to closure (all souls revitalized → final beacon). The action is unique and irreplaceable; no other verb captures the lens-reassembly + soul-solidification link. Strong causal and closure integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Occupying impossible spaces" is signaled in the underwater descent ("exist in ways that defied the architecture of reality—occupying impossible spaces between the shelves where geometry bent like grief") and used in the middle ("finding souls tucked into spaces that couldn't exist—between pages that opened into rooms, inside words that contained entire chambers"). This method shapes Ezra's search tactics and the library's internal logic. However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract; the geometry complicates the setting more than constraining specific choices with visible cost. Present in setup and middle; modest payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater city library is the primary setting for the middle and closure: its coral-crusted spires, bioluminescent fish, waterlogged records, and impossible architecture all constrain Ezra's movements and provide the resources (records, souls, geometry) that drive the burial work. The library's "restless energy finally still" at closure directly reflects the story's resolution. Early signal (descends "that night"), sustained middle presence, and closure participation. The setting is irreplaceable: no other locale offers the unburied souls + records logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the mysterious package arrives" is clear: package arrives Tuesday, Ezra descends "that night," works "for seven nights," and surfaces at "dawn." The seven-night span tracks progress (each night → one rite → one fragment fused) and escalates weariness, tightening the cost. However, the nightly rhythm does not create urgency or a live deadline that forces hard choices; the work proceeds cooperatively. Time structures the middle but does not pressure tactics at closure. Functional with modest escalation linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to give rest a permanent address" is dramatized on-page: the drowned woman requests "give rest a permanent address," Ezra responds "I bury people. That's all I know how to do," and he then performs seven nights of burial work. The desire drives all middle action and is fulfilled at closure ("the drowned had found their rest"). Cost is visible (deepening weariness, refusal to abandon the task). The motivation is specific and irreplaceable; conflict between his weariness and the souls' need generates pressure. Strong setup, middle, and payoff integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Chased stillness" operates as tone: Ezra has "been running from his own stillness," the library's "restless energy" mirrors the souls' unrest, and closure arrives when "the chased silence catch him at last" and "a library slept in peace." The tone modulates from restless distress (pulsing lens, drifting souls) to earned quiet (morning light, sleeping library), charging the final image. The phrase is conceptually present but could be more texturally embodied in syntax and rhythm across beats. Coherent through turns; clear payoff at closure.</comment>
