<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's grief is embodied through the spinning clock hand and her journey shows micro-choices (climbing to the observatory, choosing to stay), but her internal transformation feels summarized rather than dramatically earned through contradictory impulses in scene. Yua is vivid in gesture and speech but functions more as oracle than character with her own stake. The final decision to stay arrives too smoothly without visible cost or a path foreclosed—we don't see what Mira gives up or what staying forecloses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens with the spinning clock hand as anchor, and closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration (the clock stilling, Mira's decision to stay). Orientation is prompt by paragraph two. The cost of staying is conceptually present (accepting her father's departure, releasing the need to "fix" him) but remains mostly told rather than shown as a tactical sacrifice. One meaningful deepening occurs when the leaf's frequency stops the clock, reweighting Mira's understanding of her father's fate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lunar observatory, pale tree, and courtyard are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (silver leaves, dust from beams, starlight on domes). The spinning clock hand functions as micro-setting object that constrains and charges the closure beat when it finally stills. Spatial choreography is clean across chambers. The tree's leaf directly enables the method that resolves the clock, elevating setting from backdrop to causal participant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mira's need to understand and release her father's loss—is signaled early and tightens when Yua explains escape velocity as emotional release. The leaf-falling moment provides one meaningful turn that narrows options (acceptance vs. continued searching). However, the resolution feels more received than earned by Mira's agency; Yua's wisdom and the leaf do the work rather than a choice that costs Mira something legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the clock's motion, the observatory's function (capturing light from dying stars), and the leaf's delicate frequency—all converging on the idea that holding and releasing are intertwined. "Stillness isn't death, it's arrival" reweights the opening without stating a moral. The ephemeral-capture concept is interrogated through action (the clock, the father's fate, the falling leaf) rather than abstract philosophizing. Final image of the stilled clock pointing moonward offers resonant closure without neat resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual specificity ("luminous ache," "frozen breath," "whispered secret"). Dialogue feels purposeful and advances plot; Yua's lines carry subtext and her speech rhythm distinguishes her from Mira. Some diction ("restructuring itself," "escape velocity") edges toward concept-speak at peak moments, slightly elevating register beyond immediate embodied perception. Filter verbs ("saw in them," "thought she had misheard") are sparing and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with strong concrete images (spinning clock hand, silver leaves, fractured shadows). However, several lines rely on template cadence ("It was," "She found," "She had") and near-paraphrase loops appear in the father's backstory exposition. The phrase "changelessly constant" recurs as descriptor without evolving function. Some figurative language verges on overwriting ("prayer frozen in stone," "galaxy of motion in miniature") without pattern-teaching. The closure beat is clean, preventing deeper penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of camera repair/lens craft with grief and ephemeral capture shows thoughtful thematic braiding, and the leaf's frequency as solution is specific rather than generic. However, the sage-on-mountain + bereaved-seeker frame follows a familiar template, and the "let go to heal" arc is well-trodden. The lunar observatory and spinning clock hand provide fresh texture, but the emotional journey and mentor-student resolution lack a non-obvious turn that would break the mold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Yua is present throughout, handles the clock and leaf in multiple beats, and her decision to teach Mira directly shapes the ending. She delivers wisdom that alters Mira's stance. Her role is causal but mentor-archetype limits her to enabling Mira's arc rather than pursuing her own stake with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The clock hand appears in paragraph three, drives Mira's stated goal, is handled by Yua in the climax, and its stilling at the end anchors closure. It returns with reweighted meaning (pointing toward the moon = arrival rather than endless searching). Present across setup, development, and payoff with visible change in state that alters Mira's understanding.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Escape velocity is explained by Yua as metaphor for emotional release and frames the thematic question. It informs the father's fate and Mira's final acceptance. However, it remains largely conceptual/metaphorical rather than shaping on-page tactics or narrowing choices under pressure. Present in dialogue and closure interpretation but not enacted as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Changelessly constant" appears twice as descriptive label (Yua's hands, the moon) but does not enable or constrain an on-page action with cost. It functions as atmospheric adjective rather than trait that pressures choice. Swappable with "steady" or "eternal" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Restructure" appears in two contexts: the mountain's tremors restructuring its foundations, and Mira's emotional ache restructuring into peace. The concept links physical and emotional transformation thematically. However, the action itself does not drive a major turn—the leaf's frequency stops the clock, and the restructuring describes outcome rather than precipitating choice. Present in closure image but not causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method is signaled when Yua says "By the sound of a leaf falling," creating mystery and expectation. The courtyard scene dramatizes the leaf's detachment and its frequency's effect on the clock, making the mechanics matter. The method directly enables the clock's stilling and Mira's epiphany. Present in setup (Yua's statement), development (courtyard), and payoff (clock stops), with specificity that makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The lunar observatory frames the entire story, its elevation above clouds and role capturing dying starlight directly parallel Mira's quest. The eastern chamber, courtyard with pale tree, and telescope are handled spatially. The tree supplies the leaf that resolves the clock. The tremors add urgency and thematic resonance. Setting participates causally in closure and constrains action (altitude, specific tree location).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Foundation tremors punctuate three beats, reinforcing instability and change as motifs. Yua notes they "come more frequently now," adding temporal pressure. However, the timeframe does not tighten tactics or create a deadline—the tremors are atmospheric rather than clock-driven constraint. Present and thematically coherent but not decisive in narrowing Mira's options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The father's desire "to harness the ephemeral" is stated early, drives the clock's creation and his disappearance, and shapes Mira's inherited need to fix/understand. Yua's teaching reframes the motivation (release vs. capture), altering Mira's stance. The motivation is dramatized through the clock's behavior and Mira's choice to stay. Friction between wanting to hold and needing to let go generates the arc's tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" appears three times, modulating from Yua's witnessing eyes to Mira's chest pain to the "luminous dark" of release. The tone coheres across emotional beats and charges the final image. However, it risks label-reliance in peak moments rather than embodied sensation. Present and consistent but not irreplaceable—adjacent phrasing could achieve similar effect.</comment>
