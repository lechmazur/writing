<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and perceptive ("reading the gestures of the departed as others once read books"), with embodied emotion in key moments. However, her choices feel observational rather than genuinely conflicted—she accepts each ghost without internal resistance or cost that tests her commitment. The grandmother's motivational backstory anchors the covenant effectively, but Maren's three-year practice lacks visible strain or a hierarchy of competing values at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (scorched wasteland, cottage, Maren, post-ghost-visibility world). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: the mother-ghost encounter deepens the pattern established by the grandmother, and the final image reweights "silence" as both burden and communion with visible cost (Maren holding undelivered words, choosing patience over release). The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—options crystallize around whether to deliver the words, and the weight of preserved silences charges the ending. One persistent constraint (the stained glass box as container) shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The beekeeping oasis is rendered with specific, purposeful detail: "wooden hive boxes bleached bone-white," "irrigation channels filled with dust," stone cottage walls that "hold the desert's fury at bay." The stained glass box functions as micro-setting, repeatedly handled and visually charged ("threw bees of gold across the walls"). The wasteland pressures Maren's isolation and the ghosts' pilgrimage, and the box constrains her final choice by making the unspoken words portable yet withheld.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving unspoken words vs. delivering them to the living) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the mother-ghost deposits her secret—Maren recognizes "a child grown old might still be alive" but chooses patience. The decision forecloses immediate release with visible cost (the child may die before hearing the words). Accumulative pressure builds through the covenant's weight ("another stone in the cairn"), and the ending crystallizes the trade-off between preservation and deliverance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action and image: silence as weight, communion, and sacred burden rather than mere absence. The stained glass box accrues meaning across beats (grandmother's confession → mother's secret → cairn of silences), and the final image ("the silence told her everything") reprices muteness as eloquence without stating a moral. The piece resists tidy resolution—Maren's choice to wait carries genuine ambiguity about whether preservation or delivery better honors the dead.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, with perceptual signature filtering detail through Maren's tranquil attentiveness ("noting how they clutched invisible objects"). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("astonished still by how much silence could hold"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during the ghost encounter, pulling back for the reflective ending. No head-hopping; narrative certainty matches Maren's interpretive limits ("recognition, perhaps, or hope").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong rhythm and vivid imagery ("cracked earth bleeding heat into the copper sky," "mirages made manifest"). However, minor scaffold appears: "Now everyone could see them" and the immediate pivot to "But Maren stayed" reads slightly mechanical, and "understanding blooming like a flower in dry soil" verges on stock metaphor. Information density is high, and no paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks appear in peak beats. The closure image ("bees of gold across the walls") charges prior material effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—ghosts made universally visible yet still voiceless, and a recluse who reads their gestures—offers a fresh synthesis of familiar post-apocalyptic and medium tropes. The stained glass box as both memorial and container grounds the concept in specific, lived detail. However, the "keeper of silences" frame and the "chosen hermit who understands what others miss" lean toward recognizable archetypes without sufficient transformation through unexpected moral calculus or structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maren (astonished recluse) is present throughout, frames the opening, and makes the key closure decision to preserve rather than deliver the words. Her observation drives interpretation but her choices feel contemplative rather than pressured—she accepts each ghost without visible conflict. The trait "astonished still" appears only in the final third, reducing early signal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The stained glass box appears in four distinct beats: introduction with grandmother backstory, the mother-ghost encounter (opened and closed), the closure reflection (held against chest), and the final image (casting bees of gold). It constrains Maren's choice (to open or withhold), carries reweighted meaning (from personal relic to repository of many silences), and its specific properties (colored panels, bee/flower motifs) charge the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "tangled covenant" is named explicitly and shapes Maren's obligation to preserve unspoken words. It drives the three-year practice and the mother-ghost encounter, and returns in the final paragraph ("demanded patience"). However, the covenant's "tangled" quality—implying conflict or cost—is asserted more than dramatized; Maren's compliance appears tranquil rather than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" manifests in Maren's calm reading of ghostly gestures ("noting how they clutched invisible objects, how they turned toward distant memories"). The trait enables her unique function and appears in the opening and closure. However, it lacks visible tradeoff—tranquility never costs her urgency or connection, and perception never forces a painful realization.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Gaze operates across multiple beats: grandmother's gaze toward the box, Maren watching ghosts approach, the mother-ghost's gaze falling upon the box, and Maren's final attention to silence. Each instance drives interpretation and choice. The mother-ghost's gaze triggers recognition and the decision to open the box; Maren's sustained gaze structures the closure reflection. Removing "gaze" as the primary action would require substantial rewriting of how Maren receives and processes information.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Through contextual clues" is explicitly named in the opening ("reading the gestures of the departed") and demonstrated in the mother-ghost encounter (hand shapes, pointing, lip movements). The method shapes Maren's approach—she watches rather than hears, interprets rather than receives direct messages. However, the mechanics are straightforward and never fail or complicate her understanding, reducing friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis anchors setting throughout: bleached hive boxes, dust-filled channels, stone cottage. It provides shelter ("thick enough to hold the desert's fury at bay") and isolation that pressures Maren's reclusion and makes her sanctuary legible. The dead orchard marks the mother-ghost's arrival. The wasteland forces the long pilgrimage that proves ghosts' desperation. The bee motif (hive boxes, stained glass bees) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The timeframe "after ghosts become visible" is established immediately ("Now everyone could see them") and shapes the entire premise—Maren's three-year practice, the living's flight to cities, and the steady arrival of ghosts. The mother-ghost's secret points to "a child grown old," creating urgency around mortality. The ending decision ("not yet") makes time pressure explicit, though no immediate clock tightens tactics within the scene itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve unspoken words drives Maren's covenant with her grandmother, her three-year practice, and the mother-ghost encounter. The closure crystallizes the friction between preservation and deliverance: "Perhaps she would find her. Perhaps she would open the box... But not yet." The cost is legible—a living child may die waiting—and Maren's choice to prioritize the "weight of them" over release demonstrates hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Mute eloquence" structures tone throughout: silent ghosts whose gestures speak volumes, Maren's wordless communion, and the final assertion that "silence told her everything." The oxymoron is embedded in action (the mother breathes soundless words that carry weight) rather than asserted. Tone modulates appropriately—tranquil observation during approach, sharpened attention during the encounter, reflective weight at closure. The phrase appears explicitly only in the penultimate paragraph but governs diction and rhythm across the piece.</comment>
