<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to restore sacred practices is clear and her actions are consistent, but internal contradiction is thin—she moves from hesitation to singing without embodied resistance. The vine tendril's physical response provides some external pressure, but her emotional arc feels smoothed: "tears streamed down her cheeks" arrives as a label rather than emerging from contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to teach others next harvest is stated as decision rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses an alternative path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through the dying vines, lunar alignment, grandmother's journals, and song toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (the vines pulse green, Mira commits to teaching others). Closure effect is on the page with felt cost ("a single morning could not undo decades of forgetting"). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraphs. One structural hiccup: "Mira spins golden stories into the morning" mid-scene is a third-person observation that briefly breaks POV modesty, creating a micro-causality wobble, but the accumulative design and charged final image hold the lens through closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The arbor is vivid and purposeful: climbing roses, grapevines, moss-covered altar, and dawn light are woven through action. The harvest moon setting as sun rises is tracked and creates urgency. The device on the stone altar and the vine tendril wrapping Mira's wrist function as micro-setting elements that constrain choice and charge the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's priorities. No spatial confusion; bodies and objects track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring the vines through forgotten songs—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: Mira must sing herself despite never being musical, and the alignment occurs "only once per year." The vine tendril's physical response and the color spreading through the arbor provide visible escalation. Cost is present but soft: "this single morning could not undo decades of forgetting" is conceptual rather than a trade-off that narrows Mira's later options. The resolution feels enabled by the device and the moment rather than driven by a high-stakes protagonist choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory, restoration, and the cost of forgetting—emerges through image and action rather than statement. The contrast between shopping centers and orchards, the grandmother's journals as pressed flowers, and the blood-memory motif avoid abstraction. "Spins golden stories" is a purposeful image that reweights the songs. The ending resists a tidy moral: "They would not have to wait much longer" is hopeful but acknowledges incompleteness. One slip: "There would be other dawns, other alignments, other moments when the old and new could meet" edges toward a thematic summary rather than letting the image resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Mira, and narrative distance is generally controlled. Perceptual signature is present: Mira notices brass gears, lunar cycles, and the vine's tendril. One breach: "Mira spins golden stories into the morning, she realized" breaks modesty—Mira cannot observe her own mythic framing from outside. Diction is mostly clean, but "the desperate reaching of that tendril against her skin" and "infinite moment" lean slightly elevated for a tinkerer's immediate perception. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful and serve emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is strong; most lines advance situation or atmosphere. Minor scaffold: "The vines were dying" as a one-sentence paragraph feels like a structural signpost rather than organic perception, and "I know. I know what you need" is a paraphrase loop. "Ancient and renewed" in the final section is stock phrasing. The closure beat is clean with no artifacts touching it. Figurative language (harvest moon as "pale ghost," green spreading "like blood returning to cold limbs") is vivid and coherent with no mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The blend of tinkerer-inventor with folk-song restoration offers a fresh angle on "dying land needs ritual" material. The device that amplifies and harmonizes imperfect voice is a specific synthesis of old and new. However, the core arc—lone practitioner restores a sacred practice through forgotten knowledge—is a familiar template. Transformation is present in Mira's particular tools and the harvest moon alignment, but the emotional beats (tears, trembling, hopeful ending) follow a well-worn path. The vine tendril as physical respondent is a strong particular, but the piece does not take bold structural or moral risks.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her choices drive key turns: she calculates the alignment, builds the device, and decides to sing despite lacking musical skill. She shapes the ending by committing to teach others next harvest. Her agency is clear in the remedy action and the final disassembly/improvement beat. She is not merely observational; her decisions alter tactics and outcome.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vine tendril appears in three distinct beats: wrapping Mira's wrist seeking comfort, tightening then relaxing during the song, and releasing to stretch upward "strong and impossibly green" at closure. Its state evolves causally (brown → green) and it charges the final image. Mira touches it in the resolution, feeling life pulse. It is tightly integrated and its transformation is the visible proof of the remedy's success.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The harvest moon shapes the stakes: the alignment "happened only once per year" and Mira tracked lunar cycles for months. It creates urgency and frames the opening and closing images (setting west as sun rises east). However, its mechanics are slightly ornamental—the moon is a timer rather than a constraint that alters Mira's tactics mid-scene. It is essential to the setup and tone but does not complicate the middle action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Spins golden stories" appears once in a key beat: "Mira spins golden stories into the morning, she realized, not tales of words but of sound and light and growing things." It reframes the songs as story-spinning and connects to her grandmother's term. It does not constrain an on-page action with cost; it is a thematic label that enriches meaning but does not alter tactics. It is purposeful but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The remedy action—singing the forgotten songs through the device—is the story's fulcrum. Mira's decision "I know what you need" in the opening third sets it up, the dawn alignment tightens the window, and the act itself (singing despite her cracked voice) drives the climax. The vines' revival is the remedy's direct result. Removing or swapping this action would break the closure. It is causally central and shapes multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forgotten songs are signaled early (grandmother's journals, transcribed note by note) and shape Mira's method: she encodes them in the device and sings them herself. The songs pour through the dawn air and the device amplifies them. The mechanics matter—"machines alone could not heal what human forgetting had wounded"—and the method is tested on the page. It drives the climax and is irreplaceable; the vines respond specifically to the songs.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The verdant arbor at dawn supplies the physical setting and resource: climbing roses and grapevines are the subjects of the remedy, the moss-covered stone altar holds the device, and the dawn timing (moon setting, sun rising) is tracked and pressures the action. The arbor's transformation (leaves rustling, roses lifting, vines pulsing green) is the visible outcome. The setting is not postcard; it is the patient and the proof. It charges the final image and alters the emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The timeframe—"when everything aligns," harvest moon setting as sun rises, "only once per year"—is established early and tightens the window. Mira has "calculated this moment for months" and the alignment is "perfect." The time constraint shapes her urgency and the single-dawn attempt. However, once the song begins, the time pressure is not revisited mid-action; the moment stretches without real-time tracking. It matters at setup and closure but does not alter tactics during the peak beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to restore sacred practices is stated early ("decades of neglect," "forgotten songs") and dramatized through her months of preparation, device-building, and the choice to sing despite her voice cracking. The friction between her tinkerer identity and the need for human voice creates mild conflict. The cost—"this single morning could not undo decades"—is acknowledged and she commits to teaching others. The motivation is clear and drives action, though the internal struggle is brief.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gathering hush is established in the opening ("gathering hush of dawn settled over the arbor, that sacred stillness before birdsong") and modulates through the piece: silence, rustling leaves, Mira's cracked voice, and the device's sustained notes. The tone shifts with pressure—tentative opening, climactic amplification, post-song silence, and quiet hopeful resolve. It charges the final image: "ancient and renewed, waiting for the voices that would return." Coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
