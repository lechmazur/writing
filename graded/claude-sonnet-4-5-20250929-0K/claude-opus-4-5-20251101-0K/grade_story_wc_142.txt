<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's dual allegiance is embodied through concrete micro-choices (adding graffiti, translating between factions, deciding to approach the Marinero elders). Her interiority shows contradictory pulls—"belonged to everyone and no one"—but the final choice to build more bridges reads as an extension of her established trait rather than a costly renunciation or transformation that forecloses a path. The foundation stone chip is handled twice but remains a static comfort object rather than driving a visible trade-off. Backstory about grandmother and commune history stays brief and anchored to present stakes, meeting BRR allowance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening beat (Mira at the junction, raft city, privatization threat). Drive lens reads Situational: pressure accumulates through escalating external threat (investors, six-month deadline) and Mira's stance crystallizes in the final image—she will continue bridging despite fear. Closure is Charged Poise: the final moment ("went to find the Marinero elders. There were more bridges to build") reconfigures options with undeniable pressure, though the cost remains prospective rather than paid on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when the meeting hammers out legal structures, narrowing the path from passive resistance to organized response.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The raft city's physicality constrains action throughout: walkways, barges, rope bridges, underside passages shape Mira's movements and the graffiti's placement. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—accordion vs. steel drums, painted hulls, water reflections—filtered through Mira's familiarity. The foundation stone chip (micro-object) charges the final image by linking grandmother's platform-building to Mira's bridge-building, reweighting the closure. Spatial choreography remains clear across districts; the perpetual carnival atmosphere never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve communal governance against privatization—is signaled early and tightens through the six-month deadline and the meeting's legal-structure planning. One meaningful pressure point: Mira must persuade the reluctant Marinero elders, a task left unresolved but set up with visible cost (her exhaustion, fear, and the weight of being "the bridge"). Agency appears in the graffiti addition and her decision to continue persuading, though the tightening relies more on external deadline than protagonist-driven reversal. Coincidence does not resolve; the ending leaves the outcome open but the stance crystallized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—community resilience and adaptation under external threat—emerges through the raft city's three-generation history, the contrast between "sacred rhythm" and "real estate," and Mira's bridge-building role. The foundation stone chip and grandmother's platform-building offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: survival through construction and connection. However, the final paragraph's overt thematic statements ("by weaving them together until the seams became invisible," "kept refusing to sink") lean toward summary rather than letting the image speak. Subtext operates in the graffiti symbols and the investors' "hungry calculation," but the closing beat edges into moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization through Mira's perceptions. Voice carries a distinct texture—"orderly intuitive," "hopeful desperation"—through selective sensory detail and measured syntax. Dialogue is brief, goal-driven, and naturalistic ("You're late," "Then make them understand"). Diction stays within Mira's plausible lexicon; under peak stress (the meeting), compression is slight and does not obscure her internal texture. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to brief external observation of the carnival.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, setting, or pressure. Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The carnival continued... lights reflecting" restates mood already established, and "kept spinning, kept floating, kept refusing to sink" cycles synonyms without added pressure. Minor filter-verb stacks ("could sense," "watched," "noticed") in early beats slightly dull immediacy. The final paragraph's repetitive "kept [verb]" construction borders on template cadence but serves emphasis. Grammar and tense are clean; no pronoun ambiguity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The raft city setting and graffiti-as-organizing-tool offer fresh specificity within the gentrification-resistance frame. Mira's role as "culture shock absorber" and her orderly intuitive gift provide a non-obvious angle on the mediator archetype. However, the core premise—community organizing to resist outside privatization—follows a familiar activist-narrative template, and the emotional arc (fear → determination to continue bridging) proceeds along predictable lines. The foundation stone chip's symbolic recurrence and the graffiti symbols add texture, but the story does not transform the template through unexpected moral calculus or a turn that redefines the stakes. The ending's optimism ("still believing") feels earned but safe.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's role as culture shock absorber is signaled early, drives the meeting scene (translating between factions, smoothing conflicts), and shapes the ending choice to continue bridging. Her orderly intuitive gift enables her to sense conflict patterns and organize responses. Two distinct beats involve this role: the graffiti trail and the meeting facilitation. Closure linkage is strong—the final line ("more bridges to build") directly invokes her function. However, the role could be replaced with "mediator" or "organizer" without structural impact; the "culture shock absorber" label adds specificity but not unique causal constraints.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip appears in three beats: opening (Mira presses it), midpoint ("dual allegiance... pressed against her chest like the foundation stone chip"), and implied in the closing meditation on grandmother's platform-building. Early signal is strong; it primes the closure image by linking past construction to present bridge-building. However, it remains largely symbolic comfort rather than constraining a choice or altering tactics. The final reprise reweights meaning (foundation → continuity) but does not impose visible cost. Functional but closer to lyric-resonance allowance than indispensable integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dual allegiance shapes stakes throughout: "belonged to everyone and no one," trusted by both old families and newcomers, pulled between factions. It drives two key beats—the meeting's pressure ("both sides needed her to choose") and her graffiti addition (unity symbol blending resistance and organization). Closure linkage is direct: the final choice to approach the elders and continue bridging dramatizes her refusal to choose sides, sustaining the dual stance with visible cost (exhaustion, fear). The concept is irreplaceable; removing it collapses the story's central tension. Specificity is high: not generic "conflicted loyalty" but structural role as translator between old/new.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Orderly intuitive is labeled twice ("orderly intuitive gift," "could sense the shape of conflicts before they fully formed") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The gift appears to facilitate her organizing work, but no scene shows a trade-off where intuition enables one move while foreclosing another, or where she misreads a pattern with consequence. It functions as background trait rather than active constraint. Present in setup and development but not causally tested; swappable with "perceptive" or "experienced."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Reorganize drives the central conflict: the meeting's purpose is to "reorganize the entire raft city's governance," and the six-month deadline frames urgency. Two beats center on this action—the meeting planning session and the decision to document communal agreements. Closure linkage is strong: the final image of building more bridges extends the reorganization effort. Specificity matters: "reorganize" versus "resist" or "protest" signals proactive restructuring rather than mere opposition. Not easily swappable; the story's logic depends on this constructive, anticipatory move. Cost is dramatized through Mira's exhaustion and the unfinished task with the elders.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Graffiti as encoded messaging is signaled early (spiral, broken wave, anchor-in-thorns symbols), drives one key beat (following the trail to Tomás's barge), and appears in closure (Mira adds her unity symbol). Mechanics matter: the underside placement ("only raft-born children knew to look") and evolving symbol set create tactics and secrecy. However, the method could be replaced with word-of-mouth or notes without major structural loss; the graffiti adds flavor and community texture but doesn't impose unique constraints on the organizing effort. Two-gate participation (setup, closure) with functional middle use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The raft city is indispensable: floating platforms enable the underside graffiti, the communal mooring/shared resources frame the stakes, and the carnival atmosphere camouflages resistance meetings ("in the spaces between spectacle"). Setting pressures choices—walkway navigation, district divisions, ferry arrivals bringing investors. Micro-setting (rope bridges, barges, painted hulls) alters tactics throughout and charges the final image (grandmother's platform-building → Mira's bridge-building metaphor). Three-gate participation with high causal integration; removing the floating city collapses both logistics and metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The timeframe—before privatization, with a six-month deadline—tightens decisions and creates urgency. Signaled early ("whispers were growing louder," investors arrive), it drives the meeting's purpose (reorganize "before outside forces could do it for them") and shapes Mira's final choice to continue persuading the elders within the shrinking window. The deadline is tracked and matters; removing it would reduce pressure. However, the clock remains somewhat abstract (six months) rather than a live, beat-by-beat countdown that alters immediate tactics. Strong setup and development; moderate closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Navigate gentrification is the dominant stake, dramatized through the investors' arrival, the six-month privatization threat, and the community's legal-structure planning. Mira's desire is conflicted—preserve communal life while adapting to mainland bureaucracy ("building bridges from hopeful desperation")—and friction appears in her exhaustion, fear, and the unfinished Marinero persuasion. Three-gate participation: setup (investors, threat), development (meeting decisions), closure (continuing to bridge despite cost). The motivation is specific and irreplaceable; swapping "navigate gentrification" with generic "save community" would lose the story's adaptive, proactive stance. Cost is visible in Mira's emotional and physical toll.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hopeful desperation is coherent throughout: Mira's "exhausted and afraid and still believing," the community "building bridges from hopeful desperation," the carnival "eternal and defiant" yet threatened. Tone modulates with pressure—opening wonder and tradition, meeting urgency, closing weary determination. The final image charges this tone: "They might lose everything" followed by affirmation of their adaptive capacity. Diction and rhythm support the dual emotion (e.g., "fractured rainbows," "refusing to sink"). Not static; the tone tightens as the deadline materializes and crystallizes in the ending's poised continuation.</comment>
