<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's choices are coherent and motivated by her established philosophy of finding beauty in brokenness. Her decision to give the feather to the kite is grounded in prior reflection (grandmother's teaching) and her immediate perception of the damaged feather. The boy's arc is functional but remains surface-level; his shift from dismay to curiosity is shown but not complicated by internal contradiction. Emotional embodiment is adequate—"eyes red-rimmed but not quite crying"—though some passages drift toward summary ("his disappointment slowly shifting") rather than concrete action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is legible: the mended kite rising with the feather reweights the "incomplete" motif established by Mira's grandmother and the smudged notebook, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (Mira's willingness to give away the found object). The lens is Accumulative/Textural; the final image crystallizes the pattern of "woven dawns" and "beauty in broken things." One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira uses the feather, transforming her private philosophy into shared action. The causality is clean: storm → feather → boy's kite breaks → Mira mends → kite flies with new meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lagoon grounds the opening effectively with "cobalt," "burnished hush," and "sand still cool from the storm." Sensory detail is selective and apt—eucalyptus droplets, rain-washed earth and salt—without catalog excess. The feather's iridescence ("emerald to copper") is vivid and purposeful. However, the lagoon itself does not constrain a choice at closure; it functions as backdrop rather than tactical pressure. The micro-setting (feather, kite, kelp) charges the final image but does not force a trade-off, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mira's philosophy of incomplete beauty tested in a social moment—is signaled early and tightens when she must give away the feather she just found. The boy's distress creates immediate pressure, and Mira's choice to mend (not restore) the kite is agency with visible cost: she surrenders a meaningful object. One clear tightening occurs on the page. The cost is felt but modest in scale—she loses the feather but gains confirmation of her worldview—so the price does not foreclose a path with high consequence, preventing entry to the high 8s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the grandmother's teaching, the damaged feather, and the mended kite, avoiding overt statement until the final paragraph's "beauty that lived in broken things made whole in new ways"—which edges toward summary. The concept of "woven dawns" recurs purposefully and the feather's asymmetry dramatizes incompleteness. However, the ending tilts didactic: "adding another thread to her understanding" and "quiet offering to the burnished hush" feel like thematic bookkeeping rather than resonant image. The boy's line "Why that feather?" invites an answer that states theme rather than implies it, reducing subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira; distance is controlled and perceptual signature is present ("warmly attentive to its imperfections"). Dialogue is natural and advances plot—"It's ruined" and "Sometimes different carries its own kind of flight"—though the latter edges toward thesis statement. Diction is consistent and slightly elevated but remains within Mira's poetic sensibility. Free indirect style is clean. The boy's voice is distinct enough (child simplicity vs. Mira's lyricism). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the execution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with purposeful rhythm and selective sensory detail. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. However, minor loops appear: "warmly attentive" echoes "patient attention," and "burnished hush" recurs without reweighting. Template cadence is minimal. One figurative misstep: "The lagoon held its breath" at the end is a stock personification that dulls the closure image. Information density is generally high, but the final paragraph over-explains ("adding another thread") where image alone would suffice. No major artifacts touch closure, but the slight redundancy and one weak metaphor prevent entry to 8.0+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The core premise—finding beauty in brokenness—is familiar; the mended-kite scenario transforms it through specific detail (drake feather, iridescence, torn fabric pattern). Mira's role as "quiet shoreline poet" and the grandmother's "woven dawns" teaching add texture but remain within established tropes of poetic wisdom figures. The feather's integration into the kite is a fresh inflection that grows from prior particulars. Emotional honesty is present; no hedging or safety middle. The story commits fully but does not take structural or perspectival risk that would elevate originality into the high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's identity as "quiet shoreline poet" frames her perception and motivates her philosophy of incompleteness. Her choice to give the feather and mend the kite are key turns driven by this character trait. She is present in setup, middle choice, and closure. However, her role could function similarly if she were a "quiet artist" or "contemplative wanderer"—the specificity of "shoreline poet" adds flavor but does not create unique causal pressure. The notebook is handled twice but does not constrain her choice with the kite. Score: functional across beats, essential to the voice, but not irreplaceable in its exact form.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The feather is found early, handled in discovery and mending beats, and directly shapes the closure when attached to the kite. Its iridescence and asymmetry embody the theme and make the mending choice concrete. Removing the feather would collapse the story's visual and thematic anchor. It drives two beats (discovery, integration) and charges the final image ("the drake's feather glinting emerald and copper"). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Slight swappability friction: another damaged, beautiful object could serve a similar function with moderate rewrite, preventing a perfect 10.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Woven dawns" is introduced via grandmother's teaching, recurs in Mira's reflection at closure, and shapes her stake (proving incompleteness can be beautiful). However, it operates mainly as thematic frame rather than tactical constraint. Mira does not face a choice where "woven dawns" logic alters her options on the page; it confirms her existing philosophy. Setup and closure participation are present, but middle development is thematic rather than causal. Lyric reprise reweights meaning but does not narrow options or impose cost beyond what "find beauty in brokenness" already does.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Warmly attentive" appears once in the feather-discovery beat and enables Mira's perception of asymmetry, which then motivates her choice to use the feather. The trait is shown through action (noticing imperfections) rather than merely labeled. However, "warmly attentive" is not tested under pressure or friction; Mira's gentleness is uncontested. Setup and one middle beat are present; closure link is indirect (the trait enables the mending but is not itself reweighted). Swappability: "patient," "careful," or "tender" would function similarly. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Tend" is the pivotal action: Mira mends the kite by "harmonizing discord," and this act delivers the closure turn. The action is signaled ("her fingers working gently"), executed on the page, and shapes the ending. Removing "tend" would eliminate the story's central movement. However, "tend" is broad; the specific tactics (folding fabric, securing the feather) do the real causal work, and "tend" itself could be replaced by "repair" or "mend" with minimal loss. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but moderate specificity friction prevents a score above 8.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Harmonizing discord" is dramatized when Mira "began to tend to the broken thing…by harmonizing discord rather than forcing the pieces back to some original state." This method is signaled and shown (weaving torn fabric into a new pattern, not restoring it). It shapes the mending attempt and aligns with the theme. However, it appears primarily in one beat and is summarized more than mechanically detailed. Setup is late (second half); closure participation is indirect (the result, not the method itself, charges the final image). Functional use with thematic resonance but not three-gate integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The lagoon is anchored early with vivid detail ("cobalt," "burnished hush," post-storm coolness) and returns in the final image ("over the cobalt lagoon"). It establishes tone and grounds the scene. However, the lagoon does not pressure Mira's choice or alter tactics; the mending happens "at the water's edge" but could occur anywhere. The kelp and stone at the waterline supply the feather, which is functional but could be replaced by "driftwood" or "rock crevice" without major loss. Postcard description with modest causal work; lyric reprise at closure adds resonance but not necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The kite-string snap is the inciting incident; it creates the urgency that brings Mira and the boy together and motivates the mending. The timeframe is compressed and clear: storm just ended, feather found, string snaps, mending happens, kite flies—all within one continuous afternoon. The snap is dramatized on the page and drives the plot. However, the snap itself is a single beat; time does not tighten further or impose a live clock that alters Mira's tactics. Strong setup and middle involvement, adequate closure participation (the kite flies as a result), but no escalating time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to discover beauty in the incomplete" is established via grandmother's teaching and the smudged notebook, then tested when she finds the damaged feather and applies it to the boy's kite. The motivation is dramatized through choices (keeping the feather, giving it away) and embodied in her perception ("more beautiful to her, more honest about what survival required"). Friction is present but gentle: she must part with the feather, but the story does not force a trade-off between her philosophy and a competing want. Setup, development, and closure participation are all present. Cost is felt but modest, preventing a score in the high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Burnished hush" is named in the opening line and recurs in the closing paragraph ("burnished hush of the afternoon"), framing the piece. Tone is coherent: quiet, contemplative, gently lyric. The tone modulates slightly when the boy appears (urgency rises) but remains subdued and congruent with Mira's voice. However, the tone is largely static; it does not shift under pressure or charge the final image beyond restating the opening mood. Lyric reprise is purposeful but does not reweight meaning with new cost. Setup and closure participation are clear; middle modulation is minimal.</comment>
