<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's arc from grief-keeper to witness-maintainer is earned through on-page discovery and the cypress moment (forty-one units) carries specific emotional weight. Her interior voice remains consistent and the final palm-to-bark gesture embodies rather than explains the shift. Minor slip: the transition from measuring sorrow to understanding trees' role feels slightly compressed in the study scene, but the kneeling closure choice demonstrates genuine cost—she accepts perpetual tending rather than release.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: broken sextant → moonlight repair → deconstruction → remapping → understanding trees as witnesses. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren's work reweights from hedge-trimming to grief-maintenance, and the fourteen-unit release demonstrates visible cost while forty-one remain held. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph. One micro-slip: the "moment a pin is heard" arrives as poetic timestamp rather than pressure catalyst, but the assembly completion does narrow her role with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tower study—dust, cracked window, storm-washed grove—constrains the repair to moonlight and grounds the sextant work spatially. The labyrinth's trees function as micro-setting that charges the final image: specific trees (oak, willow, cypress) carry differentiated grief-loads. The sextant vibration and morning light warming her face are purposeful sensory anchors at closure. The storm itself remains atmospheric rather than choice-shaping, preventing the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding Vestris's note and the quantified sorrow—is signaled early and tightens when the sextant heals and she realizes trees witness rather than steal. The deconstruction choice narrows options (she commits to mapping dreams, foreclosing simple maintenance), and the cypress-held forty-one units establishes visible cost: some sorrows remain perpetual. Agency is clear in the assembly and the kneeling acceptance. Escalation is accumulative rather than reversals, fitting the lens, though one more mid-story pressure point would lift this higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—grief as witnessed rather than stolen, tending memory as vocation—emerges through the tree measurements and sextant remapping without thesis statements. The final image (palm to bark, whispered thanks, fourteen units released while forty-one stay) offers a non-literal answer: some sorrows are kept, and that is care. "Mundane miracles" recurs purposefully to charge small magics. The cypress forty-one reweights prior grief into chosen witness-work. Minor note: "Mapping the dreams that drifted like leaves" in the last line edges toward decorative, but the preceding embodied thank-you anchors thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with Maren's perception filter consistent: she notices grief-weight, tree particulars, brass mechanisms. Diction stays grounded except "collective unconscious of the ancient grove," which briefly drifts into analytical register mid-crisis. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (tightens during assembly, breathes at dawn). No head-hopping. The "whispered back" moment borders on attributing tree agency but reads as filtered through the sextant's vibration, preserving POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the assembly sequence. Two minor loops: "The trees had taken it, held it, kept it safe" and "Not stolen. Witnessed." restate without added pressure, costing ~−0.2. One template run: "The cypress dreamed... The oak dreamed... The willow dreamed..." spans three beats but serves patterned catalog, so penalty is light. Figurative language ("starlight," "moonlight like water") supports tone without muddling. Sentence openings vary. No filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—quantified emotional geography + sextant as dream-mapper + arboreal witness—feels specific and non-obvious. Transformation of the "grief counselor" template through measurement units and astronomical tool earns freshness. The "mundane miracles" frame and tree-as-memory-keeper avoid stock fantasy beats. Risk in the numbered-grief conceit pays off at closure when forty-one stays held. Slight hedge: the astronomer's note as inheritance-clue is familiar setup, but the execution through deconstruction and moonlight-repair specificity lifts it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren makes two key choices: climbing to the study (setup) and deconstructing/reassembling the sextant (middle development). Her final kneeling and acceptance of perpetual witness-work (closure participation) completes the arc. All three gates present; causal pressure in the assembly decision narrows her role; closure shows visible cost (some grief remains). Swappability is low—her seventeen years of labyrinth knowledge and the inherited sextant tie her specifically to this logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sextant appears in oilcloth (setup), heals in moonlight (middle beat one), is deconstructed and reassembled (middle beat two), shows her the grove's memories (pre-closure), and hangs at her belt as she kneels (closure). Five beats with evolving function. Causal pressure: without deconstruction she cannot remap dreams. Closure linkage: its vibration is the tree's whispered reply. High irreplaceability and visible cost (her vocation transforms). Slight dock: the vibration at closure is a single-line detail rather than fully dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Quantified sorrow is seeded early ("Fourteen units... Twenty-three... Forty-one"), drives her search for understanding (middle), and is central to closure when fourteen release and forty-one remain. It shapes her realization that trees witness, not steal, and redefines her maintenance work. Causal pressure: the measurements prompt the study ascent and sextant use. Closure: the numbers articulate felt cost. The concept is indispensable to the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Moonlight healing occurs on-page in the study (middle beat), enables the sextant's repair, and creates the conditions for deconstruction. Setup is implicit (she carries it broken); closure shows it functional at her belt. Two gates clearly present; causal role is strong—without moonlight repair, no reassembly or mapping. Cost: she must wait for moonlight, and the trait defines the tower's role. Dock: the healing itself is passive (watched rather than used), slightly reducing agency linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Deconstruction appears in the study (middle), is the pivotal choice that lets her understand the sextant maps dreams not stars, and directly enables the reassembly that reveals tree-witness knowledge. Closure: her new vocation is "mapping the dreams." Three beats; high causal irreplaceability—without this action the story's central turn does not occur. Setup is brief but present in the oilcloth wrapping (promise of repair). Visible cost: she commits to dream-mapping, foreclosing simple maintenance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mapping scattered dreams is named in Vestris's note (setup), inferred during reassembly (middle: "charting the collective unconscious"), and enacted at closure ("mapping the dreams that drifted like leaves"). The method shapes her realization and final vocation. Causal role: understanding the method unlocks tree-witness knowledge. Slight dock: the mechanics remain metaphorical rather than procedurally detailed, so "how" is less concrete than "what" or "why," keeping it from the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stormlit tower provides the study with cracked window for moonlight (setup and middle: repair scene), and moonlight charges the final grove image at dawn. The tower's height lets her see the grove below through the sextant. Two beats plus closure framing. Causal: moonlight access and vantage are necessary. The storm breath-holding ("the storm held its breath") times the assembly completion. Dock: storm itself is atmospheric rather than constraint-forcing; moonlight does more tactical work than the tower structure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pin-drop silence timestamps the assembly completion and signals a threshold moment ("At the moment a pin is heard... Maren completed her work. The storm held its breath."). It appears in the closure third and charges that beat with crystalline finality. However, it is introduced late (past midpoint) without prior setup, and does not shape earlier tactics or tighten decisions—it is a poetic marker rather than a pressure device. Two gates (middle appearance, closure framing) but no setup; late arrival and ornamental role limit score per guidance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maren's desire to understand Vestris's note and the tree-sorrow is named early, drives her ascent and sextant work (middle), and is fulfilled at closure when she comprehends witness-work and kneels in gratitude. The motivation is dramatized through choices (climbing, deconstructing, reassembling) and conflicted by grief (forty-one units, her sister's death). Three gates; causal pressure and closure linkage strong. Cost: accepting perpetual witness-duty. Slight dock: the discovery itself feels more cognitive than emotionally resisted, so friction between want and obstacle is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mundane-miracles tone is named by Vestris, demonstrated in the moonlight-healing and sextant-vibration moments, and charges the final image (morning light, whispered thanks, gentle vibration). The tone modulates from mystery (broken sextant, quantified sorrow) to wonder (self-healing brass) to quiet acceptance (kneeling, fourteen units released). Coherent across all turns and integral to the ending's resonance. High integration: removing this tone would flatten the story into either clinical measurement or high fantasy, neither of which fits the closure.</comment>
