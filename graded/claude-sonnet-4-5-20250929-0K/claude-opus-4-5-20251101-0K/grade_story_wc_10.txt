<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margaret's interiority is richly embodied through thermal perception and silence. Her motivation—rebuilding lost sound through temperature data—is particular and drives consistent micro-choices (selecting specimens, striking tuning forks, transcribing thermal readings). The final smile and choice to "keep writing" demonstrate earned endurance with visible cost (acceptance of permanent silence, commitment to a new language). Minor weakness: the backstory weight (~25%) anchors well but edges toward exposition; however, the ocean trauma primes every on-page choice and the piece meets the BRR exception tests.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story deepens through density increase and cadence shift—each specimen interaction builds toward the final realization that silence itself is a new language. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Margaret accepts permanent silence and commits to thermal translation, foreclosing recovery of hearing with visible emotional cost ("drowned her hearing," "learning to listen with her eyes"). Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words. One meaningful deepening (specimen work → self-recognition via thermal sensors painting her own emotion gold) satisfies scope. Cost is legible on the page in the final paragraph's acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The conservatory's crystalline walls, frozen specimens, and thermal sensors function as micro-setting that constrains and enables Margaret's method throughout. Sensory detail is filtered through her silence (visual and tactile priority, no auditory cues), and the environment charges the final image: "crystalline cathedral of frozen life" mirrors her own suspended state. The workbench, sensors, and tuning fork case are handled in multiple beats, and the conservatory's "silence lived here naturally, without violence" reweights at closure when Margaret finds peace in it. Spatial choreography remains clear across specimen stations.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and tightens through each specimen test. Agency is clear: Margaret strikes forks, positions sensors, transcribes notation, and chooses to continue despite discovering the music will never "sound the way she remembered." The final act of picking up her pen and "kept writing" is protagonist-driven with visible cost (renunciation of recovered hearing, acceptance of a new sensory paradigm). One meaningful deepening occurs when her own thermal signature appears in gold, shifting her understanding from technical translation to self-recognition. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—creating beauty after devastation, finding new languages when old ones fail—emerges organically from Margaret's specimen work and the conservatory's "unshaken marvels." The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: music "worth every moment of silence" reweights all prior struggle. Subtext operates through thermal color (blues = grief, gold = acceptance) and the parallel between frozen flowers and Margaret's frozen hearing. No thematic echo or prompt-label intrusion. The piece earns its insight through concrete action (heat-mapping, transcribing) rather than abstraction, and the ending reconfigures "silence" from trauma to creative medium with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Margaret's world is thermal, visual, tactile—never auditory. Diction remains consistent ("spectral fragments," "alchemical process," "thermal fluctuations") without register drift. No dialogue present; interiority avoids therapy-speak and stays concrete ("ice settled into her auditory cortex" is metaphor, not diagnostic). Rhythm modulates effectively from reflective openings to compressed specimen-work beats. Free indirect style is clean. The only minor slip: "stubborn refusal to stop creating beauty" edges toward authorial summary rather than Margaret's idiom, though it remains within the established lyrical register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and figurative language ("silence lived here naturally, without violence," "orchestra...played on in colors") is coherent and purpose-driven. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor density issue: "She understood only that silence lived here naturally, without violence" and the later paragraph "true silence now, comfortable as a familiar room" restate comfort-with-silence across two beats without added pressure—borderline loop (−0.2). Filter-verb stack in paragraph four ("had discovered," "had found," "had ever encountered") slightly dulls immediacy but remains voice-motivated. Strong opening and closing lines anchor stakes and image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of trauma-induced silence, thermal translation of plant "music," and frozen botanical specimens is specific and non-obvious. The conservatory setting and heat-mapping method avoid template plots. Transformation is evident: the familiar "artist rebuilding after trauma" frame is freshened by the hard-science thermal sensors, the oxymoron of frozen-yet-alive specimens, and Margaret's acceptance rather than recovery arc. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and sensory inversion (seeing sound, hearing with skin) elevates without obscuring clarity. Minor limitation: the "beauty from devastation" theme, while well-executed, remains within a familiar emotional territory; the piece does not fully escape the template's moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Margaret (capsize survivor) drives every beat: selects specimens, strikes tuning forks, interprets thermal data, transcribes notation, and chooses at closure to continue writing despite discovering her music will never match memory. Her survivor status primes all choices (silence as trauma response, the conservatory as refuge, heat-mapping as substitute for lost hearing). Early setup, middle development across specimen work, and payoff in the final decision to "keep writing" and accept the new language. Causal pressure is strong; her choices narrow options (no recovery of hearing) and the final stance is earned. Cost is visible: permanent silence, renunciation of auditory music.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tuning fork case appears in beat one (workbench description), beat three (removal of fork to strike orchid), beat four (striking fern), and closure beat ("tuning fork case sat empty"). Early setup, mid-scene use to generate thermal data, and final image of emptiness that signals completion of the survey. The case's "seven forks, each calibrated to a different frequency, each now useless to ears that refused to hear" establishes irony and cost. However, the case itself is somewhat replaceable—any frequency-generation tool could serve; the grandmother lineage adds texture but does not constrain a unique choice. Two-gate participation with moderate causal role and lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unshaken marvels" labels the frozen specimens and Margaret's own endurance. The phrase appears explicitly once (penultimate paragraph: "unshaken marvels composing themselves") but the concept—surviving freezing, refusing to die—structures the entire piece and Margaret's self-recognition. Early setup (frozen flowers in perpetual bloom), middle development (specimens respond to tuning fork vibrations despite being frozen), and payoff (Margaret herself as an unshaken marvel who continues creating despite trauma). The concept shapes tactics: Margaret's method depends on finding specimens that survived impossible conditions. Moderate causal role; the link between "unshaken" plants and Margaret's own resilience is thematic rather than mechanical, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Silently expressive" describes both specimens and Margaret. Early setup: "Plants...expressed themselves silently," "winterglass conservatory held the most silently expressive specimens." Middle constraint: the orchid and fern communicate via thermal signature, enabling Margaret's translation method—without silent expression, her heat-mapping would yield no data. Payoff: "Margaret smiled, silently expressive as the flowers around her." The attribute enables the core method (thermal translation depends on plants expressing via temperature) and charges the final parallel between Margaret and specimens. Visible cost: Margaret accepts her own silent expressiveness as permanent. Strong causal role across three beats with specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Rectify" (to fix, correct) motivates Margaret's arrival: "She had come here to rectify what the ocean had broken." Early setup in paragraph three. Middle development: her repeated attempts to translate thermal patterns into musical notation are acts of rectification. Closure pivot: she discovers she cannot rectify (restore) her hearing, but instead learns "a new language entirely"—a shift from repair to transformation. The action shapes the arc but becomes inverted at closure, which demonstrates purposeful subversion. However, "rectify" itself could be swapped for "repair," "restore," or "reclaim" with minimal structural impact; the concept matters more than the exact verb. Two-gate participation with moderate but replaceable causal role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Heat-mapping is signaled early ("thermal sensors," "tracking thermal fluctuations"), developed in detail across the orchid and fern beats (strike fork, press to stem, watch thermal color shift, translate to notation), and shapes closure (Margaret's own thermal signature painted in gold, realization that she's learned "to listen with her eyes, her skin, her heart"). The method is mechanically specific (sensors, algorithms, translation matrix) and irreplaceable—no other technique could bridge silence and music in this story's logic. The method enables every mid-scene beat and underwrites the final acceptance. Early setup, sustained middle use with visible mechanics, and payoff in self-recognition. Strong causal pressure, specificity, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory anchors the entire piece: crystalline walls refracting light, frozen specimens, the central workbench. Early setup (title, paragraph one). Middle: the conservatory supplies the specimens Margaret needs, and its "silence lived here naturally, without violence" contrasts with her traumatic silence, offering sanctuary. Closure: "crystalline cathedral of frozen life" charges the final image, mirroring Margaret's transformation into someone who creates within suspension rather than escape. The setting's specific properties (frozen-but-alive specimens, natural silence) are irreplaceable—no other venue could provide the exact confluence. Spatial choreography clear across workbench and specimen stations. Strong three-gate integration with causal constraint and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"After noise becomes impossible" = "Three months since the capsize" and Margaret's permanent psychological silence. Early setup anchors the timeframe. Middle: the permanent condition shapes every choice—she cannot recover hearing, only adapt. Closure: her acceptance that "music, when it finally came, would be worth every moment of silence that preceded it" crystallizes the irrevocable nature of "after noise." The timeframe functions as a constraint (no recovery plot is possible) and charges the stakes (she must create within permanent loss). Visible cost: she forecloses the hope of restored hearing. The frame is less a ticking clock than a fixed post-trauma condition, which fits the Accumulative lens but provides steady rather than escalating pressure. Three-gate integration with moderate causal force.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margaret's motivation—"to translate silence into music"—is stated early (paragraph three), dramatized through specimen work (striking forks, transcribing thermal notation across multiple beats), and tested at closure when she discovers the translation will not restore auditory music but instead creates "a new language entirely." Friction between want (recover music as it was) and cost (accept it will never sound the same) is legible on the page. The motivation drives her choice to continue writing despite the gap between expectation and reality. Strong three-gate integration with visible tradeoff: she gains a method but loses the original goal. Causal pressure across beats and closure linkage with felt cost.</comment>
