<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is explicitly labeled as "steadily unpredictable" but this trait is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The grandmother resurrection desire appears once without constraining subsequent choices. Interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical musing ("joy without sorrow was amputation") rather than embodied emotion under pressure. The final choice to carry forbidden knowledge lacks visible cost that forecloses a path—she simply walks away having succeeded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with atmospheric deepening across the archive discovery. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive adequately by the opening beats. The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing through the "understanding that some knowledge is forbidden not because it destroys, but because it transforms" realization, but this lands as abstract theme statement rather than a final image with legible cost. The purification ritual occupies the climax but its mechanics remain vague ("words in random sequences"), weakening causal grounding at the pivotal turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The archive's "chambers that defied geometry" and "shelves spiraling through dimensions" create vivid, purposeful disorientation that matches the forbidden-knowledge stakes. The bronze prism pagoda returns with functional reweighting (beacon, eight-sided chambers). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The crystalline sphere constrains the final ritual choice, qualifying as micro-setting that charges closure, lifting the score toward the 9+ gate threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forbidden knowledge pursuit) is signaled early and persists. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira discovers the Netharans' failure and must choose whether to attempt the ritual herself. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off—she succeeds without dramatized cost, and "anguished joy" arrives as delivered emotion rather than earned through a choice that forecloses options. The ritual's random-word method avoids showing tactical adaptation under constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge-as-transformation emerges clearly but the final paragraph delivers overt thesis: "some knowledge is forbidden not because it destroys, but because it transforms so completely that the seeker can never return." This explicit moralizing (−0.6 in final-paragraph positioning) replaces scene pressure. The "anguished joy" concept is stated twice without accruing pressure through particulars. The saffron veil recurs but functions as symbolic token rather than constraining choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mira throughout. Perceptual signature shows consistent filtering through her scholarly lens ("old sciences," "equations that could unmake matter"). Diction occasionally elevates beyond immediate pressure needs ("amputation" as metaphor, "atoms of nostalgia" repeated as concept-label). Free indirect style is clean. The prose maintains distinct texture but does not modulate rhythm under the ritual's peak stress, missing an opportunity to tighten at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies adequately and information density is moderate. However, three distinct artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loops ("true purification required chaos, required letting go"), template-cadence runs in the archive-description passage, and stock metaphor reliance ("breathed against her face like a lover's confession"). The phrase "atoms of nostalgia" recurs as conceptual label without evolving specificity (−0.6 cumulative). Figurative density in the opening beats (saffron-veil, bronze prism, fractured light, colors that no longer existed) approaches overwriting without pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core premise—civilization destroyed by memory purification—offers a fresh angle on forbidden-knowledge tropes. However, "atoms of nostalgia" as both scientific and metaphysical device reads as clever surface rather than integrated logic. The "by avoiding patterns" method is stated but not dramatized through specific ritual mechanics, remaining abstract. The Netharans' cautionary tale and Mira's parallel attempt feel templated (scholar discovers lost civilization's fatal hubris) without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and makes the final choice to perform the ritual and carry knowledge away. However, her key decision (to attempt purification despite the Netharans' failure) lacks on-page dramatization of doubt or tactical adaptation. She succeeds without visible cost altering subsequent options, reducing causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The bronze prism pagoda appears in the opening image, returns functionally as beacon/chamber structure at midpoint, and is present in the final paragraph as Mira walks toward it. Three beats, with the middle revelation (eight-sided chambers, twilight mechanism) adding causal texture. However, it does not constrain the ritual choice itself—Mira performs the purification inside the archive, not the pagoda—limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Atoms of nostalgia" is seeded early (grandmother's veil), shapes the archive's contents, and defines the purification target. Present in three beats across the arc. However, it functions more as thematic concept-label than mechanic that alters tactics—Mira does not handle or measure these atoms in ways that narrow her options. The final "pure nostalgia in her palms" moment is abstract rather than a choice-forcing constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Steadily unpredictable" is explicitly named once ("Her motivation had always been steadily unpredictable") but never demonstrated through on-page contradictory actions. The trait is told as internal summary without constraining a choice or enabling a visible tradeoff. Swappable with "conflicted" or "ambivalent" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Purify" drives the Netharans' downfall backstory, frames Mira's discovery of their method, and becomes the climactic ritual action. Three distinct beats, with the final purification attempt redefining her relationship to forbidden knowledge. The action is causally central and not easily swappable. However, the mechanics remain vague (random words, spirals), slightly reducing irreplaceability of this exact verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"By avoiding patterns" is seeded in the Netharans' failure analysis and explicitly enacted in Mira's ritual ("speaking words in random sequences, moving through the chamber in spirals that contradicted themselves"). Two beats, with the method shaping the climactic attempt. However, the mechanics are told in summary rather than dramatized through specific tactical choices that Mira adjusts under pressure, and the method could be replaced with another paradoxical instruction without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive provides the spatial container for all key beats: discovery, revelation of Netharans' method, and the purification ritual. Its "chambers that defied geometry" and preservation fields supply the resources Mira needs. The collapsing archive in the final beat adds cost. Present across setup, middle constraint (scrolls, central chamber), and closure (collapse), with the environment actively shaping Mira's access and the ritual's possibility.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Across the end of innocence" is signaled (grandmother's "last peaceful summer before the Purging Wars," Netharans' golden age collapse) but functions as backstory frame rather than a present timeframe that tightens decisions. Mira's seventeen-year search is mentioned but does not create tactical pressure in the present scene. The phrase recurs thematically in the final third but does not constrain the ritual's timing or choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To pursue forbidden knowledge" is dramatized through Mira's archive infiltration, her recognition of suppressed equations, and her choice to perform the ritual despite understanding the risk. Present in three beats with friction (her order executed thousands to suppress this knowledge). However, the desire is undercut by convenience—she succeeds without dramatized cost—and the grandmother-resurrection motive is introduced but not integrated into the final choice, reducing coherence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Anguished joy" is named twice (Netharans sought it, Mira achieves it) and the tone attempts bittersweet registers (nostalgia, loss, transformation). However, the tone is asserted rather than modulated through rhythm and image—grief and wonder are told as concepts ("Pain and wonder were never meant to be separated") without embodied contradictions that charge the final image. The ending shifts to declarative calm, flattening the anguish.</comment>
