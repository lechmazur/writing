<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kira's perceptual gift ("slice through pretense") is asserted but never embodied in a micro-choice under pressure; her diagnosis of Vex and Sera reads as therapeutic exposition rather than earned insight from prior dramatized beats. The two clones show contradictory impulses ("I am the original" vs. "I am the continuation") but their internal conflict flattens into parallel monologues rather than simultaneous action. The handshake at the end follows logically but arrives without visible cost—neither woman forfeits a concrete path or resource on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Situational (pressure forces stance crystallization). Orientation anchors arrive late—Kira's backstory and the dojo's purpose surface after ~150 words, creating mild fog. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the handshake and training pact), but the cost is entirely prospective ("might take years or might take forever") rather than paid on the page; no option is visibly foreclosed, no resource spent. The inferred lens holds, but the ending reweights potential rather than present stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The floating dojo and churning void are vivid but remain postcard backdrops—history rewriting beneath them never constrains a choice or supplies a resource. The glass jar is handled twice (placed between them, then in the meditation circle) but does not alter tactics. Spatial choreography is clean (two figures, one jar, one platform), yet the environment pressures theme more than action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (custody of the brain) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kira reframes the conflict ("stop fighting over custody of your future selves"), but this is a restatement rather than a reversal that narrows options. The resolution (leave the brain in sanctuary, train together) is imposed by Kira rather than earned by the clones' agency. Cost is prospective (years of training) rather than paid in the scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme (fractured identity, complementary opposites healing numbness) emerges from particulars—Vex's mask cracking, Sera's glistening eyes, Kira's own ego-death backstory. The final image (two broken halves learning they were never meant to be whole alone) offers a resonant answer without a stated moral. However, Kira's thematic diagnosis ("You are both trying to defeat emotional numbness") veers into explicit summary rather than trusting the dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single POV (Kira) is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (she "had learned to see beyond surfaces") but diction occasionally drifts into therapeutic abstraction ("emotional depth," "analytical distance"). Dialogue pursues goals and carries subtext ("Because she'll destroy it" / "Because she'll activate it"), though the exchange tilts toward debate rather than embodied evasion. Filter verbs ("watching," "glimpsed") cluster in reflective beats without harming immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clarity is high; no loops or pronoun fog. Information density is uneven—opening paragraphs layer vivid images (floating dojo, churning void, brain jar) but midpoint beats paraphrase theme ("You are both trying to defeat emotional numbness" restates what prior dialogue dramatized). Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("She had survived that death, emerged from it like a snake shedding skin, and now she could slice through pretense with a single glance") without pattern-teaching. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis (clone custody battle + floating dojo + ego-death master) feels purposeful but not inevitable—swap the dojo for a neutral monastery and the arc holds. Kira's backstory (civil war, meditation-cushion death) is specific yet arrives as inserted credential rather than a constraint shaping her present tactics. The handshake turn is earned in hindsight but lacks a non-obvious inflection that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kira (ego death survivor) frames the conflict and delivers the resolution, appearing in setup, middle diagnosis, and closure. Her past dissolution ("sense of self dissolving into nothing") primes her authority but does not constrain a present choice—she never hesitates, doubts, or pays a cost. Her decision to leave the brain in sanctuary is uncontested. Two beats (introduction, final ruling) plus closure participation, but causal pressure is light.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The brain jar appears in setup (labeled "DUPLICATE - BATCH 7"), is contested in the middle, and is placed in the meditation circle at closure. Two distinct beats (initial claim, final repositioning) with closure linkage. However, the jar's properties (preserved tissue, nutrient solution) do not constrain tactics—it could be any disputed object. Specificity is atmospheric rather than irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clone custody battle shapes stakes from the first exchange ("I am the original" / "I am the continuation") through the midpoint diagnosis (multiplication vs. elimination) to the closure ruling (sanctuary until the brain can choose). Three beats with clear causal pressure. The concept drives Vex and Sera's opposed tactics and Kira's resolution. Swapping it for generic sibling rivalry would require substantial rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kira "slices through pretense with a single glance" but this is asserted in exposition rather than demonstrated through a choice under pressure. She diagnoses Vex's "mask of confidence" cracking and Sera's "pretense finally shattered," yet these moments follow her summary rather than forcing her to a costly inference. Label-only; no visible tradeoff tied to the trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Vivify appears in Vex's accusation ("She wants to end our line entirely" implies the alternative) and in Kira's diagnosis ("spark something in yourself by watching fresh versions experience the world"), but the brain remains unactivated. The action is debated, not executed. Mid-scene involvement without closure participation. Removing "vivify" and substituting "clone" or "awaken" would not alter structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Complementary opposites (Vex's analytical distance, Sera's emotional depth) are named in setup, drive Kira's middle diagnosis, and form the closure solution ("Through your complementary opposites… you will teach each other what you've lost"). Three beats. The method shapes the resolution's mechanics. However, the training itself is prospective; no on-page scene demonstrates the method under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo is present in setup and closure (the dojo "drifted on through the reshaping cosmos"), with vivid description (meditation circle carved into stone, timelines churning below). However, the setting never constrains a choice—Kira could deliver the same ruling in a neutral chamber. The void's history rewrites are thematic backdrop, not tactical resource. Early signal and closure reprise, but causal work is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>History rewriting appears in setup ("where empires rose and fell in the span of a breath") and recurs sporadically ("a particularly violent historical revision swept through the void—Kira glimpsed pyramids rising, falling, rising again"). The timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline. Clock is ornamental; removing it would not alter the negotiation's pacing or outcome.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Defeating emotional numbness drives both clones' opposed tactics (Vex seeks copies to "spark something," Sera wants to destroy the brain to prevent suffering) and Kira's diagnosis frames the middle beat. The motivation appears in setup, shapes the midpoint turn, and is restated at closure ("two broken halves learning they were never meant to be whole alone"). Three beats with clear causal linkage, though the resolution is imposed rather than chosen by the clones under friction.</comment>
