<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior contradiction—methodical scavenger versus existential negotiator—registers clearly, and her micro-choice to photograph the ghost with accumulated fragments shows embodied agency. However, the moment lacks visceral cost: the ghost "watches" without pressure, and Mira's climactic speech reads as articulate philosophical summary rather than a decision forged under duress. The closing "exhaustion…is a kind of peace" articulates theme but does not dramatize a foreclosed path with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first 120 words. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Mira accepts exhaustion as terminus), but the cost remains abstract—no concrete forfeiture or choice that alters her situation on the page. The carousel's silence "answers" her, yet that answer is asserted rather than shown through image or action that reweights prior fragments.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon—water defying physics, light without sun—constrains Mira's scavenging and charges the final image with fractured stillness. The camera wheel's plastic teeth catching sourceless light recurs purposefully. Spatial choreography (lagoon center, edge) remains clear, and the setting's paradoxes (motion without current, chronological confusion) mirror the thematic stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: negotiate terms with her ghost. The camera wheel collecting fragments constitutes a tightening method, but the escalation arc is thin—Mira gathers stories, confronts the ghost, speaks, then accepts silence. No reversal narrows options; the ghost never complicates her stance. The closure speech articulates rather than dramatizes a choice, and the "exhaustion" endpoint feels declared rather than earned by pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—failure as ordinary, ghosts-to-ourselves, unlived possibility—emerges from concrete particulars (carousel, collected confessions, eroded ambitions). The camera wheel accumulating "unlived possibility" avoids overt moralizing. Mira's final question to the ghost resists tidy resolution and the closing image (camera wheel still, exhaustion as peace) offers a resonant non-literal answer. Minor penalty: "exhaustion, too, is a kind of peace" edges toward thematic echo, but the prior image work earns it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization remains stable; perceptual signature (scavenger's "methodical desperation," collection logic) is distinct and voice-motivated. Diction ("fractured stillness," "granular goal," "smoke pretending to be something finer") maintains elevated lyric consistency without register breaks. The speech to the ghost shifts into philosophical articulation—plausible for a character framing a negotiation, but it tilts toward written eloquence rather than pressure-compressed thought. Minor filter-verb density ("she understood," "she felt") in several beats slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("ribbons of melody," "erosion of days," "salvage from wreckage"). Template-cadence penalty: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or "She [verb]" structures, creating rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loop at "exhaustion…is a kind of peace"—the prior clause already implies acceptance. Information density is strong in places ("collected fragments…with methodical desperation") but the final paragraph's triple iteration of "exhaustion" and "negotiation" dilutes propulsion. No critical artifacts touch closure directly, but cumulative minor issues prevent high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—scavenger collecting others' abandoned ambitions to negotiate with her own ghost in a physics-defying lagoon—feels specific and earned. The kinetic-lagoon premise and disposable-camera-wheel method avoid stock fantasy templates. Risk: lyric accumulation over causal plot. The transformation test passes: swapping names/setting would lose the scavenger's particular methodology. Minor derivative note: "negotiating with one's ghost" is a common metaphor, but the story's operational specificity (collecting overheard stories as evidence) distinguishes it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mira's scavenger role shapes her method (collection, cataloging) and her final choice to photograph the ghost with accumulated fragments. Present early, drives the middle gathering sequence, and participates in closure. However, the "resolute" attribute does not constrain a visible tradeoff; her determination is told more than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Camera wheel appears in the opening paragraph, gathers confessions across middle beats, grows "heavier with each fragment," and figures in the climactic photographing attempt. Its plastic teeth catching sourceless light recur purposefully at closure. The wheel's accumulation mechanic directly enables Mira's evidence-gathering tactic and charges the final image. Strong causal and closure linkage; would score higher if a visible cost tied specifically to the wheel (e.g., capacity limit forcing a choice) appeared on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Eroded ambitions" frame Mira's stakes from the opening ("ambitions had eroded to a single, granular goal"), structure the middle (collected confessions of cartographers and lovers who failed), and are directly named in the climactic photograph that captures "every dream that had eroded." The concept shapes her method and the ghost confrontation's terms. High integration; would reach 8+ if erosion imposed a tactical constraint (e.g., time pressure, resource depletion) rather than serving primarily as thematic frame.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Chronological confusion came and went like weather"—a single-sentence mention mid-story. The attribute does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it flavors the setting's surreal tone but remains ornamental. No setup signal, no development beat, no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Regret pervades Mira's interiority and drives her journey to the lagoon ("not to beg forgiveness…but establish"). It motivates the collection method (gathering proof that failure is ordinary) and the ghost negotiation. Present early and shapes closure. However, regret operates as continuous backdrop rather than a discrete action with escalating cost. The story hinges on regret but does not dramatize a single on-page moment where regret forecloses an option or forces a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Collecting fragments is signaled early ("She collected fragments…with methodical desperation"), demonstrated across multiple beats (cartographer's want, man's confession, accumulated weight in camera wheel), and the method produces the climactic photograph. It directly shapes Mira's tactic (surround herself with evidence of universal failure). Strong development and closure linkage. Would score 8+ if the mechanics imposed a visible constraint (e.g., limited film, choice between fragments) that altered a beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon—water defying physics, above clouds, carousel's halt—anchors the setting early, supplies the surreal constraint (solid ground where water should be), and recurs in the final "fractured stillness." The lagoon's center is the site of Mira's past carousel rides and her present confrontation. The setting pressures perception and charges the ending image. Minor limiter: while evocative, the lagoon does not force a tactical pivot or resource choice on the page.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"The carousel had halted three days ago" anchors the timeframe early, and "after the carousel halts" defines the window. However, elapsed time does not constrain Mira's actions—no urgency, no deadline that narrows options. The halt is a condition rather than a ticking clock. Setup present, thematic resonance at closure (carousel's silence answers her), but no middle development where time pressure alters a tactic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's desire to negotiate (not beg forgiveness, but "establish whether the dead version…still held claims") is announced early, drives the collection method, and culminates in her speech to the ghost. The motivation shows friction: she seeks terms, not restoration; the ghost offers only silence. Cost is conceptual (acceptance that negotiation ends in exhaustion) rather than a visible forfeiture. Strong setup, development, and closure participation; would reach 8.5+ if the negotiation forced a concrete on-page trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Fractured stillness" is embodied early (kinetic lagoon's motion-without-current, carousel's halted music) and modulates with pressure: methodical collection, then the ghost's translucent waiting, then the camera wheel going still. Tone charges the final image ("fractured stillness…held") and coheres across turns without flattening into static melancholy. The ending line ("exhaustion…is a kind of peace") lands within the established tone. Strong coherence and closure linkage.</comment>
