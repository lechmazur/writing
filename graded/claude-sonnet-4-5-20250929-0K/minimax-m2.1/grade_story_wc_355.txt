<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is consistent and profession-specific (listening, cataloging frequencies), but her decisions feel too smooth—no contradictory impulses appear in the workshop scene. The clasp-opening moment arrives without visible internal conflict or cost beyond patience; we never see her wrestle with doubt or frustration that would test her pacifist philosophy under pressure. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feeling is labeled ("anticipation," "desperately") rather than enacted through gesture or perception shift. The final epiphany about "losing" sounds to understand empathy reads as assertion rather than earned revelation from struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (who, where, when by the first paragraph). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the locked clasp provides a frame, reflection on silence varieties deepens the thematic texture, and the fireworks supply a timed pressure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the clasp opens and Mira writes a final catalog entry that reweights her life's work—but the cost is conceptual and oblique; we do not see what she forfeits or risks by this breakthrough. The "nearly losing it" insight is told rather than enacted, weakening the on-page cost proof.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The workshop under stars is anchored early and returns with sensory detail (frosted glass, red firework light on walls). The brass dial and frequency resonator function as micro-setting tools that Mira manipulates across multiple beats, constraining her method and charging the final moment when she tunes to the clasp's note. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional bias (auditory focus dominates), and spatial choreography is clear. The setting does not evolve causally—no object state changes or environmental shifts alter tactics—but the recurring tool (resonator) and the fireworks' temporal pressure meet the 7.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: recover the locked diary's catalog of silences. Pressure is accumulative (the fireworks approach, neighbors suggest force, Mira commits to patience) rather than causal escalation with reversals. The single tightening is the firework explosion that provides the breakthrough note, but Mira's choice to listen rather than pry is static—she never wavers or faces a trade-off on the page. No visible cost accompanies the clasp opening; she simply succeeds. The reflection on empathy as "losing sounds" is thematic commentary, not a dramatized stakes shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (empathy through listening, silence as language) emerges from Mira's profession and the locked-clasp frame. The final diary entry—"silence after celebration is the most honest"—offers a non-literal answer that reweights the catalog conceit, meeting the Q5 quick test baseline. However, the epiphany about "losing" sounds to understand empathy is stated rather than enacted; we do not witness a prior moment where Mira's cataloging impulse caused a concrete failure or relational cost. The recurring silence-frequency motif charges the ending but lacks mid-story complication or counter-evidence. No overt moralizing, but the thematic insight feels gently asserted rather than wrestled from scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature is profession-specific (auditory details, frequency language). Psychic distance is controlled, and diction fits Mira's contemplative stance. Prose rhythm is measured and lyric, appropriate to the accumulative design. However, register drifts into abstractions ("theatrical sincerity," "architecture of honesty," "emotional register") that feel more authorial than character-native, especially under the modest urgency of a stuck clasp. No dialogue present to assess. The voice is distinct but smooths over moments that could show stress-driven compression or sensory narrowing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph rhythm supports the accumulative design. However, several lines loop conceptually: "silence she inhabited now" is elaborated twice in adjacent sentences; "listen/listening/listened" recurs without progression; "exactness" and "specific pitch" are near-synonyms in close proximity. Figurative density is high ("moth's wings," "spent thoughts returning home," "morning light, uncertain but willing") without pattern-teaching, trending ornamental in the reflective beats. The final image (sparks falling) is vivid but does not sharply propel; it ornaments rather than reweights. Information density is moderate; the catalog of silence types (432 hertz, lover's static) adds texture but does not alter present tactics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The locked-clasp frame and frequency-tuning method offer a fresh angle on the empathy-through-listening premise, and the fireworks provide a non-obvious temporal bracket. However, the core emotional arc—patient listening unlocks understanding—is a familiar template, and the story does not transform it through lived complication or moral calculus. Mira's pacifism is label-only; we never see her tempted to force the clasp or pay a social cost for her philosophy. The catalog of silence types is inventive detail but does not drive plot turns. The final epiphany about "losing" sounds feels like a gentle abstraction rather than a risky, specific synthesis earned from prior friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira's pacifist identity is labeled early and frames her choice to tune rather than pry, but the philosophy does not constrain a key turn—no moment dramatizes a temptation to force the clasp or a cost to renouncing violence. Present across beats (setup, middle reflection, ending) but functions as backdrop rather than causal lever. Mid-band: logically consistent but largely replaceable with "patient craftsperson" without altering structure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The diary clasp appears in the opening beat (setup), is handled and described mid-story (neighbor offers force, Mira listens to it), and clicks open at closure, releasing the catalog. Its locked state creates the immediate problem and its opening marks the resolution. Three-beat involvement (early, middle reflection, climax) and closure linkage push it into the 7+ range. Cost is oblique—clasp jamming threatens loss, but opening is frictionless—so cap below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"The path to empathy" is invoked explicitly in paragraph four and restated in paragraph six ("the act of nearly losing it"). It frames Mira's reflective stance but does not shape an on-page tactic or choice with cost—she does not lose the diary, does not fail to listen, does not confront a character who demands empathy. Present in setup and ending reflection, but ornamental to the clasp-recovery action. Functional yet swappable with "the art of patience" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" is used once in paragraph four to characterize the workshop silence, but the trait does not constrain or enable an action. Mira's intuition is not tested or proven wrong; she simply succeeds. Label-only mention without dramatized cost or trade-off. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Recover" drives the dominant stake (retrieve the catalog from the jammed clasp) and frames all beats. Mira's tuning attempts and final success trace directly to this action. Present in setup (clasp jammed three days ago), middle (neighbors suggest force, she chooses patience), and closure (clasp opens). Two beats of involvement and closure linkage meet the 6+ threshold, but the recovery is frictionless—no failed attempt or visible cost—so cap mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Frequency tuning is signaled early (brass dial, resonator) and used in two beats: Mira adjusts the resonator mid-story and tunes to the clasp's note at climax. The method's mechanics (hertz, pitch, emotional register) are explained and shape her approach. Two-beat involvement and closure participation, but the tuning succeeds on first try without complication or cost, limiting irreplaceability. Functional and purposeful, mid-5s to low-6s range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The workshop is anchored early (frosted glass, stars, workbench) and supplies the resonator tool, which Mira uses across beats. Firework light paints the walls at climax, visually marking the breakthrough. The setting does not evolve or constrain a failed attempt, but the tool (resonator) and spatial frame (workshop as listening chamber) support the method and charge the ending. Two gates (setup, closure visual) plus tool-as-micro-setting push it into low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled in the opening line and recurs: neighbors clutch fuses, Mira hears the first explosion, final sparks fall. The approaching fireworks create urgency and provide the auditory breakthrough. Three touches (setup, middle anticipation, climax explosion) and closure linkage. However, the time pressure is passive—Mira does not race the clock or face a deadline cost—so the frame is purposeful but not indispensable. Mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cataloging silence is stated early (life's work, forty years) and motivates the recovery goal. The locked clasp threatens loss of the catalog, which Mira values. However, the motivation is asserted rather than conflicted—no scene shows her struggling with the impulse to catalog versus living in the moment, or a past failure caused by over-analysis. Present in setup and ending reflection, but told-only. Functional, mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Theatrical sincerity" is named once in paragraph four and loosely fits the lyric, reflective register. Tone is stable—contemplative, patient—but does not modulate with rising pressure; the clasp-opening beat matches the workshop-reflection beat in emotional temperature. The phrase itself feels authorial rather than enacted through diction shift or rhythm change. Present as label, minimal on-page demonstration. Low-functional, high-4s.</comment>
