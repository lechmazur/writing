<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is stated clearly but her choices remain largely internal and reflective rather than pressured by competing impulses in scene. The "luminous skepticism" trait is label-heavy; the piece tells us she has "academic rebelliousness" and "skepticism" but rarely dramatizes contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final "transformation" is asserted through summary ("she was no longer the same being") rather than a visible forfeiture or renunciation with on-page cost. Embodied emotion is thin; much interiority reads as philosophical musing rather than character-particular sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The piece lacks a legible closure unit with visible cost. Elena climbs, reflects, descends—no decisive change, earned stasis with foreclosed path, or conceptual repricing that reconfigures prior material occurs on the page. The orientation test is satisfied early (tower, spring morning, Elena), but the drive lens remains ambiguous: neither causal pressure nor accumulative density creates a meaningful tightening or deepening by the end. The final paragraph asserts transformation and understanding but does not dramatize a moment where options narrow or a price is paid. Without closure, Q2 cannot enter the mid-bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower, spring setting, and amber specimen are vividly rendered with sensory detail (shafted light, dust motes, bronze quiet). The tower and amber are present across multiple beats and the piece filters setting through Elena's scientific lens. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that alters tactics or forecloses an option—it remains atmospheric rather than pressuring. The micro-setting test (amber as object-as-setting) is attempted but the amber is handled passively, described rather than used to force a decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding homecoming—is stated but never tested by an on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. Elena's "artificial pilgrimage" involves no visible obstacles, trade-offs, or costs; she walks up, meditates, walks down. No escalation or deepening occurs; the piece is a continuous reflective mood without pressure points. The aliens and her lost academic position are backstory context, not present forces that complicate her choices. Agency is entirely internal observation without a decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme of homecoming and pilgrimage is clearly stated and repeatedly invoked, but it emerges through direct statement and meta-commentary rather than specific dramatized events. The amber fly is a recurring image, yet its symbolic weight is explained ("universal narrative: eternal pilgrimage") rather than allowed to resonate through shifting use. The final paragraph tells us Elena has "discovered" and "understood" rather than showing a non-literal answer earned by prior particulars. Thematic echo penalty: the closing lines articulate the story's thesis in prompt-like language ("alchemy of pilgrimage," "converging toward understanding like stellar masses").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elena throughout, with no head-hopping. The voice carries a consistent elevated, philosophical register and the perceptual filter remains hers (scientific mind, empirical worldview). However, the diction often drifts into generic lyricism ("luminous skepticism," "bronze quiet," "chemistry of homecoming") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Under peak moments the prose remains at the same reflective distance without modulation. Purposeful compression is minimal; the piece reads as steady meditation rather than voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym churn are present: "artificial pilgrimage she designed to process the unprocessable" echoed by "artificial pilgrimage she constructed for herself"; "homecoming" appears in nearly every paragraph with slight rewording but no added pressure. Template cadence: "She lifted… She thought… She carried… She walked…" in the final third. Stock metaphors: "frozen river of stone," "restless spirits," "lantern illuminating mysteries." Filter-verb stacks in reflective beats dull immediacy. Artifact penalty in Q7: baseline −0.8 for loops and cadence, plus −0.3 for stock strings. High-band entry for Q7 is blocked.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—scientist on a pilgrimage after alien contact to understand homecoming—is earnest but reads as a straightforward synthesis of familiar elements (quest for meaning, artifact as key, transformation through journey) without a fresh inflection. The fly-in-amber as metaphor for suspended journey is well-worn. The aliens' cosmic migration and Elena's climb run in parallel summary rather than intersecting with friction or surprise. The piece commits fully to its reflective mode but does not take structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes. Transformation test: plot and emotional arc could transfer to different names and setting with minimal change.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elena is present throughout and her skepticism is mentioned, but "luminous skeptic" as a specific character trait does not drive on-page turns. Her choices are to climb, observe, reflect, and descend—all passive observation. The trait is label-only; no scene shows her skepticism creating friction or forcing a decision with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fly amber is introduced early (~15% mark), handled in the tower chamber (~midpoint), and returns symbolically in the final paragraph ("in her pocket, the amber fly continued its eternal suspended journey"). It appears in three beats and is thematically charged. However, it is described and philosophized over rather than used to constrain a choice or enable a tactic. The closure reprise is ornamental (cameo in pocket) rather than causally active. Scores in the 5.5–6.3 band for purposeful early-to-final reprise with thematic reweighting but no pressure involvement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Artificial pilgrimage" is named early and explicitly stated multiple times. It shapes the framing (Elena constructs the journey deliberately) but does not constrain on-page choices or alter tactics—she simply walks the path and reflects. The concept is thematic rather than a forcing function. Present and functional but replaceable with "journey" or "quest" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Academically rebellious" is mentioned once in backstory ("her academic rebelliousness had already cost her position") but does not constrain or enable any on-page action. It is label-only, told rather than shown, and no visible tradeoff tied to this trait occurs in scene. Ornamental mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Converge" and "convergence" appear repeatedly as thematic claims ("all journeys inevitably led toward reunion," "artificial and genuine had converged"). The action is asserted rather than dramatized; no on-page moment shows Elena's path and the aliens' path or her skepticism and wonder actually merging in a choice or event. The word is used as a metaphor, not an active verb that redefines options. Swappable with "unite," "merge," "meet" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Dusty footprints on the sculpture path are mentioned early and late ("her footsteps joining the dusty footprints of predecessors"). The method is signaled and the path is walked, but its mechanics do not matter—Elena could have arrived by any route without altering her reflection. The footprints add atmosphere but do not shape attempts or constrain tactics. Functional presence, no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower in spring is established early, vividly described across multiple beats (overgrown path, base chamber, shafted light, spring rain), and present at the ending ("rainwashed tower stood behind her"). It provides coherent spatial anchoring and recurring sensory detail. However, it does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome—Elena's meditation would proceed identically in any contemplative setting. The tower is atmospheric rather than functional; postcard description elevated by consistent reprise but no tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"After making first contact" is mentioned early ("just days prior") and frames the inciting context. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Elena's pilgrimage is unhurried and the aliens' contact remains backstory context rather than a present clock. Time is told, not tracked on the page. Functional framing, no tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To understand the chemistry of homecoming" is stated explicitly and repeated throughout as Elena's goal. The motivation is told and philosophized but not dramatized through conflicted on-page choices. No friction between what Elena wants and the costs of pursuing it appears in scene—she reflects, reaches understanding, and descends without obstacle or trade-off. Desire is label-heavy; told-only trends low.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" is named mid-story and modulates subtly (spring light casting "bronze quiet," "deepened as Elena meditated"). The tone is coherent—contemplative, elevated, unhurried—and the bronze metaphor returns to charge the atmosphere. However, tone remains static across the arc without modulation under pressure; the reflective mood does not shift or break. A single sustained atmosphere with purposeful reprise but no escalation or cadence shift.</comment>
