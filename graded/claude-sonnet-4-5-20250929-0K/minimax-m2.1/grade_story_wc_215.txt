<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is atmospheric but often abstract—"tranquilly perceptive," "astonished recluse"—label-only traits that don't drive on-page choices under pressure. Her decision to dig and accept the covenant feels more like fulfilling a prompt than a motivated choice shaped by contradictory impulses. Embodied emotion is sparse; the ghost interaction and final acceptance lack visceral friction or visible cost that would emerge from genuine internal conflict. The ending grants her a role without dramatizing what she sacrifices or refuses to reach it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation is solid: who, where, and when anchor by the second paragraph. The ghost's appearance and gesture toward the buried box create a linear causal path to the stained glass discovery and covenant transfer, satisfying the Causal lens. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira accepts the keeper role, but the cost—her ongoing solitude, the "crushing weight"—is asserted more than dramatized; the final image tells us she holds "unspoken words" rather than showing a forfeited path or immediate consequence. One meaningful tightening (ghost appearance → excavation → covenant transfer) is sufficient for this length, but the cost legibility at closure is borderline.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The apiary ruins and wasteland are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail—"ribs of some ancient, docile creature," "pools of amber and rose"—that establish mood without catalog listing. The buried stained glass box and its physical properties (lightness/weight paradox) constrain and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate narrowly. Spatial choreography is clear, and the setting evolves causally (collapsed shelter, scorched soil, cracked foundation). Minor deduction: the "weight of unspoken words" pressing against ribs risks metaphorical overreach, but it remains legible within the lyric register.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the covenant of unspoken words—is signaled early but remains abstract; the ghost's need and Mira's acceptance lack concrete opposition or trade-off. The single tightening (ghost gesture → excavation → transfer) is present, but no live option is foreclosed on the page; Mira's recluse life continues without visible alteration. The cost is asserted ("crushing weight") rather than shown through a forfeited path, missed opportunity, or on-page price. Agency is present (she digs, accepts) but the choice feels inevitable rather than pressured by competing goods or unavoidable harms.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—memory, covenant, the eloquence of silence—emerges organically from the apiary setting and ghost interaction without overt thesis statements. The stained glass box recurs with reweighted meaning (buried secret → vessel of unspoken words → living burden), and the final image (box "heavy with the eloquence of silence") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, "unspoken words" and "tangled covenant" are repeated as abstract claims rather than discovered through concrete particulars; the piece tells us they matter more than it shows Mira wrestling with their implications. The ending avoids moralizing but leans on lyric assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct lyric register—"tranquilly perceptive," "astonished recluse"—that matches the contemplative stakes. Diction remains elevated but consistent; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Minor issue: "astonished recluse" and similar constructions risk label-only characterization, and the perceptual signature (light through glass, moth-wing edges) is vivid but not character-specific—another observer might notice the same details. No dialogue present; the ghost's gestures are clean. Psychic distance is controlled, though the ending ("unspoken words had found their keeper at last") drifts toward narratorial commentary rather than staying inside Mira's perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and free of major loops or template cadence. Sentences vary in structure and length, supporting the contemplative mood without stalling momentum. Minor issues: "weight of unspoken words" appears three times in slightly varied forms, risking synonym churn; "tranquilly perceptive" and "astonished recluse" are elevated constructions that border on over-writing for the stakes. The final paragraph's "eloquence of silence" and "unspoken words had found their keeper" lean abstract when a concrete image would land harder. No grammatical errors; information density is good, though some figurative language (moth wings, pools of amber) accumulates without causal pressure in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ghost-visible-after-apocalypse premise and covenant-keeper arc draw on familiar post-apocalyptic and memory-keeper tropes without a sharp fresh angle; the transformation test is borderline (swap names/places and the emotional arc holds unchanged). Specificity in the apiary setting and stained glass box add texture, but the core turn—recluse accepts mystical burden from grateful ghost—follows a well-worn template. The "weight of unspoken words" as central image is evocative but risks abstraction over lived particular. Solid execution within genre conventions; no bold structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes beyond the expected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and labeled "astonished recluse," but her reclusiveness is backstory context; the on-page action (observing, digging, accepting) doesn't hinge on her being a recluse versus any other solitary character. She makes one key choice (to dig and accept the covenant), meeting the functional threshold, but observation dominates and the choice feels more like role-fulfillment than a turn that alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stained glass box appears in three beats: ghost gesture/discovery, excavation, and the final image where Mira cradles it. It is described in vivid detail (gold/amber bees, honey-like glass) and its paradoxical weight (lightness/crushing) is noted twice, reweighting meaning at closure. However, it resolves a problem (the ghost's unfinished business) it did not help create, and its function is more symbolic vessel than causal driver—removing it would require only minor edits to the ghost's need. Solid integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "tangled covenant" is named explicitly and drives the ghost's presence and Mira's final acceptance, shaping the dominant stake. It appears early (beekeeper's covenant), middle (ghost's unfinished business), and closure (Mira accepts the keeper role). However, "covenant" is asserted more than dramatized through on-page choices with visible friction; the tangled quality—implying complexity or conflict—is declared but not enacted. Functional but borderline on causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" is label-only description in paragraph one; Mira's perception is shown through imagery (light through glass, moth-wing edges), but those details aren't uniquely tied to tranquility or constrained by it. No on-page action hinges on this trait—she could be "alert" or "watchful" with identical beats. Present but ornamental; easily swappable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ghost's gaze appears twice: recognition of Mira and turning toward the buried spot. The second moment (gesturing toward earth) creates the excavation beat, a key causal link. However, "gaze" is interchangeable with "gesture" or "motion" in those beats—the eye contact itself doesn't redefine options or carry unique properties. Functional in one major beat but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Through contextual clues" is stated once in paragraph two ("understood through contextual clues how the apiary had functioned") as a summary of Mira's past inference about the site. It doesn't shape on-page attempts or choices—Mira digs because the ghost gestures, not because she decodes clues during the scene. The method is told in retrospect rather than dramatized as a tactic. Present but doesn't constrain or enable action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned apiary and scorched wasteland anchor the story from the opening line and pressure Mira's solitude and the ghost's attachment to place. The setting provides the buried box (cracked foundation), frames the ghost's visibility (post-fire ruin), and charges the final image (sanctuary within wasteland). The specific beekeeping equipment and stained glass imagery are tied to the covenant's origin and closure. Essential across beats and ending; removing the apiary would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after ghosts became visible" is introduced in paragraph two and explains the ghost's on-page presence, shaping the central encounter. However, it functions as static worldbuilding rather than a live pressure—no ticking clock or decision constrained by this temporal shift. The "seven years" since the oasis died is mentioned but doesn't alter Mira's tactics. Functional setup but no escalation or closure linkage tied specifically to the ghost-visibility timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to preserve unspoken words is introduced implicitly (drawn by memory, feels weight pressing against ribs) and becomes explicit when she understands the box's contents and accepts the keeper role. It drives her final choice (cradling the box, settling into the ruins) and is present at closure. However, the desire is told more than dramatized—no on-page friction between this want and a competing cost or fear. Lyric reprise (early feeling → final acceptance) with closure linkage, but minimal causal pressure or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tone—contemplative, elegiac, image-rich without overt emotion—is coherent throughout and charges the final image ("eloquence of silence"). "Mute eloquence" as a specific phrase doesn't appear, but the mood of restrained, unspoken weight is sustained from the opening (docile creature ribs, tranquil perception) through the ghost encounter (moth-wing translucence, warmth like sunlight) to closure (crushing lightness, living silence). The tone modulates subtly (astonished observation → recognition → acceptance) without breaking register. Strong tonal control that supports theme and final image.</comment>
