<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's profession is established, but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("practiced reverence," "quiet purpose"). The young man exists only as patterns in static; no dramatic relationship pressure tests her choices. Her final action—preserving the spark—feels predetermined rather than earned through visible contradiction or cost. The backstory about grandmother and thirty years of work anchors motivation but doesn't create embodied struggle in the present scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (building atmospheric density toward a lyric closure), but the piece lacks a clear before/after. Mira arrives intending to capture the spark and does so without complication; no reversal, deepening, or tightening narrows her options. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but closure lacks visible cost—the emerald simply "holds" the spark as planned. The threshold imagery recurs without reweighting stakes or forcing a choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto under aurora is vivid and specific, with iridescent shadows and cascading lights creating strong atmospheric texture. Sensory detail is purposeful but leans visual; the emerald's warmth and the stone's luminescence are noted. However, the environment does not constrain Mira's choices—she moves freely and completes her task without spatial friction. The setting charges the final image but does not alter tactics, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing the spark before it fades—is signaled early but never pressured. Mira works "with lucidly watchful focus" as the spark "threatened to fade," yet no on-page moment shows her adjusting tactics or paying a price. The young man's backstory (musician, final song) is told rather than tested. No reversal or tightening forecloses an option; the capture succeeds as outlined. Cost is asserted ("weight of her responsibility") but not demonstrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme of beauty/mortality and preserving essence emerges from imagery and the profession's nature. The emerald-as-vessel motif is purposeful, and the "threshold of stillness" recurs with thematic weight. However, the ending offers no non-literal answer or reweighted insight—Mira simply completes her sacred work and descends, affirming rather than complicating the premise. The final paragraph edges toward moralizing ("evidence that even in the face of oblivion, something beautiful could endure") without dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira; focalization is clean with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and ornate ("gossamer veil," "radiant hush," "iridescent shadows"), consistent with a lyric register but occasionally slipping into stock phrasing ("profound privilege," "sacred nature"). Perceptual signature is present (seeing patterns in static, beautician's trained eye) but not character-specific enough to feel irreplaceable. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance is controlled; the voice modulates little under the single sustained tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished but overwritten in places: "threshold of stillness" appears six times, often in similar phrasing ("suspended in the threshold," "the threshold of stillness relaxed"). Sentence openings show variation, but figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction. "Radiant hush" and "luminously preserved" edge toward purple without earning the charge. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work, but scaffolding like "She had learned to see" and "She had never spoken of these visions" could be cut. Template cadence in the middle paragraphs (repeated "The X [verb]" stems) lowers momentum slightly. No severe loops, but the recurrence of "threshold of stillness" and "emerald chip" without variation constitutes mild churn. Apply −0.6 for density and scaffold, −0.3 for mild loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The beautician-mortician who preserves souls is a specific synthesis, and the skyborne grotto setting is fresh. However, the emotional arc—reverent worker completes sacred task—follows a predictable template without risk or surprise. The young musician's backstory and the grandmother's handed-down emerald are stock components. The "patterns in static" motif is evocative but not transformed through character-specific choices. Transformation test: swap names and setting, and the core (dutiful professional honors the dead) remains generic. No bold structural risk; the piece opts for lyric safety over dramatic friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and makes the choice to capture the spark, but the choice is predetermined by her profession and the emerald's function. No visible turn or cost; she arrives with intention and executes it. Score: functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The emerald chip is seeded early (grandmother's relic, verdant light pulsing), used in the middle ("pressed against her palm," "grew warm"), and charged at closure ("now held not just green fire but a living light"). It shapes two beats (infusion and capture) and appears in the final image. However, it does not constrain—Mira never struggles with its use or pays a cost tied to its properties. Strong integration but lacks irreplaceability; a similar vessel could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "threshold of stillness" recurs as a label six times but remains abstract. It describes the space where Mira perceives the young man and where the spark lingers, yet it does not alter her tactics or force a choice. At closure, it "relaxed its grip," but this is passive imagery, not a decision point. Present and thematically coherent but ornamental; removing it would require only minor rephrasing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" appears once in the middle ("Mira worked with lucidly watchful focus") as a descriptor, not a trait that constrains or enables action. No trade-off or cost is shown; it labels her state without demonstrating how this focus differs from ordinary attention or shapes her technique. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Infuse" appears explicitly ("infused the stone with intention") and drives the capture beat. Mira's beautician training "infused" her movements earlier. The action is signaled and shapes the middle turn, but the mechanics are vague ("drawing from it the subtle power") and the outcome is assured. One key beat involvement; lyric reprise at closure where the stone holds "living light." Functional but not indispensable—"channel" or "imbue" could substitute with minimal rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Finding patterns in static" is seeded early ("learned to find patterns in static"), demonstrated in the middle ("In the static of its dancing brilliance, Mira read the patterns of a life"), and implied at closure (tracking "subtle shifts"). It shapes two beats (perceiving the young man, reading his life story) and defines her method. However, the mechanics are told, not shown, and do not constrain—she reads patterns without error or friction. Functional across beats but lacks specificity or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto under aurora is established early, vivid throughout (cascading lights, ancient walls, iridescent shadows), and present at closure. It provides atmosphere and charges the final image ("the aurora's radiant hush accompanying her back"). However, it does not constrain Mira's actions or alter her tactics—she moves freely and completes her work. Strong sensory presence but not mechanically essential; the capture could occur in a different setting with similar tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation—"to capture one last spark before oblivion"—is explicit early ("she would capture it before oblivion consumed it entirely") and sustained throughout. It drives Mira's actions (pressing the emerald, tracking the spark's fade) and is realized at closure (the spark "luminously preserved"). However, the motivation is never conflicted or tested; no competing want or cost creates friction. Desire is clear and shapes the arc, but lacks the dramatized trade-off that would elevate it above functional.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Radiant hush" is named twice (opening, closing) and sustained through diction (luminescence, gossamer, iridescent, serene). Tone is coherent and modulates slightly as the capture crescendos, then settles. The phrase charges the final image ("the aurora's radiant hush accompanying her back"). Tone is essential to the piece's lyric design and would be difficult to replace without altering the closure's feel. Strong integration; near-indispensable for this exact story.</comment>
