<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is richly embodied through her perceptual signature—petrichor collection, psychometry—and the piece shows micro-choices (uncorking vials, touching the compass, descending) that reveal her hierarchy of values. The final renunciation ("she would not return") carries visible cost tied to her entire professional identity. However, the decision feels somewhat foregone; internal contradiction could have been sharper—she never resists the pull, so the choice to stay reads inevitable rather than torn. No therapy-speak, strong sensory grounding throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara's arrival at the lagoon forecloses all prior collection work with the cost explicitly named ("she would not return"). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases via petrichor → compass → psychometry → descent → lagoon, each beat reweighting her central stake. Orientation is anchored early (factory, ridge, her profession). The piece teaches its pattern by the compass arrival and maintains coherence through to the final image of stillness and irreversible presence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The factory floorboards, limestone fissure, and subterranean lagoon constrain Elara's descent physically and charge the closure image with phosphorescent stillness. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "ghost of rain on concrete, on wool" reflects her professional lens; the lagoon's "impossible blue" and lack of scent anchor her final realization. The micro-setting (vial, compass casing warmth) functions as tactile pressure. Spatial choreography is clean across all beats, and the environment's post-industrial silence enables the discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara's search for the threshold where meaning dissolves—is signaled early and tightens once meaningfully: the compass reading redirects her from surface collection to subterranean delving. The lagoon confrontation crystallizes the cost: "there was nothing to capture here" forecloses her entire practice. Under the Accumulative lens, this is sufficient escalation with legible price. A second reversal or complication in the descent could have raised pressure further, but the single deepening is coherent and earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—petrichor as the residue of thresholds, the geography of silence—emerges from concrete particulars (factory closure, compass psychometry, lagoon's sourceless light) without meta-commentary. The final image answers the central question non-literally: arrival replaces capture, presence replaces naming. "Some journeys ended not with answers but with arrival" risks overt statement but is mitigated by the prior sensory work and the irreversible cost. The piece resists binary resolution and earns quiet resonance through specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "sensibly eccentric," her professional idiom colors every observation. Diction remains consistent and controlled, with purposeful elevation ("cathedral's echo," "patient thinking") that fits the contemplative register. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. The narrative certainty matches Elara's expertise without overreach. One minor slip: "knowing she would never sell this one" in paragraph one reads slightly over-articulated for the moment, but the voice coheres under pressure and through the ending.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with high information density and varied rhythm. The opening and closing images are strong. However, minor scaffold appears: "simple and sufficient fact," "exactly where one was meant to be" in the final beat risk abstraction that slightly dulls immediacy. "The factory had closed, and in its silence, this place had opened" is a tidy closure couplet but borders on over-explained thematic bookend. No loops or paraphrase chains; figurative language is coherent. The deductions are small and do not touch causality, capping penalty at −0.4 within band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of petrichor collection, psychometry, and subterranean discovery is specific and non-obvious; the premise transforms the "lost expedition" trope through the protagonist's sensory-memory profession. The lagoon as "the place where explanations fail" is conceptually ambitious and earned through prior particulars (factory silence, compass warmth, "hinged awakenings"). Elara's renunciation—choosing presence over capture—offers a credible risk with stakes that matter. The piece commits fully to its contemplative register without hedging or false balance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's profession frames her perceptual lens throughout, shapes her decision to visit the factory (beat one), triggers psychometry on the compass (beat two), and drives her descent (beat three). The final choice to stay and cease collection is causally rooted in her identity. Her trait is not merely ornamental; it enables all major beats and the closure forecloses her livelihood with visible cost. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with irreplaceability and cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The compass appears in beat two, its warmth and psychometric reading redirect Elara's goal, and its directional anomaly ("pointing not north but down") guides the descent. It is handled physically ("fingers brushed the worn bronze casing") and returns conceptually in the closure as the expedition's message validated. Three beats, clear causal pressure, closure linkage. The specificity (cracked glass, bronze casing, warmth) makes it irreplaceable. Strong integration with cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Hinged awakenings appear explicitly in the compass psychometry ("the first hinge of awakening") and shape Elara's recognition of the factory and lagoon as thresholds. The concept influences her interpretation and drives her willingness to descend. It does not constrain a choice with visible tradeoff—Elara never wrestles with competing options—so it functions more as thematic scaffolding than tactical pressure. Present in setup and payoff, but development is thin. Lyric reprise with moderate reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Sensibly eccentric" is named in paragraph two and colors her professional choice and solitary descent, but it does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost—she never faces social friction or a choice between eccentricity and convention. The trait justifies her behavior retroactively rather than testing it under pressure. Functional but largely label-only; swappable with "dedicated loner" or similar. Modest integration, no cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The delve (descent through the limestone fissure) is the central physical action that enables discovery of the lagoon and forces the final reconfiguration. It is causally motivated by the compass reading, described across multiple beats with spatial specificity, and delivers the closure stakes. Removing "delve" would collapse the story's second half. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability. The action redefines options and forecloses return.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Psychometry is introduced early ("practiced it rarely"), demonstrated in beat two (compass reading with vivid impressions of the bearded man), and its mechanics—object memory—matter by shaping Elara's knowledge of the lagoon's location. The method does not recur at closure, so payoff is indirect. Two beats with clear causal work and setup, but no final reprise. Solid integration with cost connection (the psychometric vision compels the irreversible descent).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The subterranean lagoon is the story's fulcrum: it supplies the closure image, embodies the thematic question (sourceless phosphorescence, olfactory void), and forces Elara's final choice. The setting appears in beat four and charges every line of the ending—"nothing to capture," "beyond the reach of scent," "simple and sufficient fact of being exactly where one was meant to be." The lagoon's properties (impossible stillness, luminous water, silence) are irreplaceable and constrain her professional practice with absolute cost. Indispensable to closure logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The factory shutdown frames the opening, enables the water-table rise that reveals the fissure, and provides thematic silence that the lagoon completes. Timeframe shapes tactics (Elara's timing, the absence of industrial noise) and appears in the closing couplet. It does not impose a live clock or countdown, so pressure is atmospheric rather than urgent. Strong thematic resonance and causal setup, moderate closure linkage. Three beats, clear enabler role, specific cost tied to industrial cessation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to find the place where explanations fail"—is dramatized through her collection of thresholds (factory, compass, lagoon) and tested by the lagoon's resistance to capture. The desire is signaled early (paragraph two: "thresholds, moments when one kind of place became another") and drives every major choice. The friction between her professional need to capture scent and the lagoon's ineffability creates the closure cost: she must renounce her practice. Strong causal integration, visible tradeoff, closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Resonant hush is established in the factory beat ("particular hush that lingers"), sustained through the descent ("cathedral's echo"), and charges the lagoon closure ("geography of silence itself," "resonant hush of the cavern embraced her"). Tone modulates with spatial descent—industrial quiet to subterranean stillness—and the final image depends on tonal coherence. The phrase appears explicitly twice and implicitly shapes every beat. Strong setup, development across pressure points, and indispensable to the ending's effect.</comment>
