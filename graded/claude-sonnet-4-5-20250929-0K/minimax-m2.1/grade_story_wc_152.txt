<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority leans heavily on stock phrasing ("whispered secrets," "let them think her foolish") and label-only wisdom rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her choices—threading filament, pressing palm against fabric—feel observational rather than high-stakes micro-decisions with visible cost. The "disguises wisdom as foolishness" attribute remains a told trait without on-page friction where it forecloses a path. Emotional embodiment is thin; most affect is asserted ("allowed herself a small smile") rather than dramatized through perception or gesture under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural (pattern-building through embroidered conspiracy records; the "eternal candle" and galaxy charts recur). The story lacks a decisive on-page change; Elara begins listening and ends listening with no reversal, renunciation, or reweighted stance. Closure reads as Charged Poise attempt—she sees the coup's shape and "threads that could unravel it"—but cost remains abstract; no visible forfeiture, no tactical narrowing on the page. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). Escalation is accumulative (adding detail to the conspiracy map) but the final image does not crystallize a new limit or price that the prior beats imposed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory, copper-stained windows, and autumn frost provide vivid sensory anchoring. The eternal candle constrains perception ("synchronize her perception with that flame") and the galaxy charts function as micro-setting that alters her tactics (encoding records via stitching). However, the environment does not pressure a choice at closure; the final beat ("the flame burned on, patient and eternal, and Elara listened") reprises the setting without demonstrating how it narrows options or charges cost. Spatial choreography is coherent; no float or impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: expose the conspiracy before the coup. No on-page tightening or deepening occurs; Elara adds another thread to her chart but faces no reversal, no narrowed option, no visible trade-off. The conspirators finalize plans off-stage; coincidence delivers information (servants overhear) without protagonist agency driving escalation. The ending asserts that her work will outlast the conspirators but provides no scene where a choice forecloses a live alternative with felt cost. Pressure remains static rather than cohering toward a turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of suppressed voices and truth-in-silence emerges through the galaxy charts and eternal flame, but the final paragraph moralizes with prompt-like language: "carry their stories forward, weaving them into the light where they could finally be heard" (−0.5 for explicit thematic statement replacing scene pressure). The candle recurs with shifted meaning (reveal → guide → patience) but does not constrain the ending choice. Subtext operates in "disguise as foolishness" but remains asserted rather than dramatized through implication. No resonant, non-literal answer to the central question; the ending declares rather than enacts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited distance. Voice carries a distinct literary texture ("whispered secrets finally given breath," "slipping through the cracks of suspicion like water through stone") but leans on stock elevated diction in peak beats ("festered until they demanded release"). Perceptual signature is present (stitching as encoding) though filter verbs cluster in high-pressure moments ("saw the shape," "heard it in the nervous whispers") without dramatizing the perception. No dialogue; interiority reads as one consistent mind. Tense and focalization remain clean with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative language appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching (−0.5): "constellations blooming beneath her needle," "electric tension," "labyrinth of adjacent possibilities." Paraphrase loop in paragraph 4: "The galaxy charts weren't merely decorations; they were encoded records" immediately restates what prior paragraphs showed (−0.2). Template cadence in paragraph 9: "The servants who heard... The scribes who copied... The mothers whose sons..." creates list rhythm without pressure variation (−0.4). Information density is moderate; several scaffold sentences ("Let them think her foolish. Wisdom... was safest when disguised") restate prior material. No loops touch the closure beat directly; apply Non-closure Accumulation Cap at −0.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Core premise—embroiderer as spy encoding conspiracies in stitched star maps—offers a fresh metaphorical synthesis. Execution leans on familiar wisdom-disguised-as-foolishness and truth-versus-power tropes without transforming them through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The eternal candle and "adjacent possibilities" arrive as convenience tools rather than constraints with visible cost. Emotional specificity is thin; the piece reads as median mythic rather than grounded particular. Proximity to template "hidden cartographer" plots without a distinctive stance or risk reduces freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara threads filament, presses palm to fabric, begins a new stitch. These are observational gestures; no choice alters tactics or forecloses a path. Setup present early; middle beat (synchronize perception) functional but passive; closure beat (lifts needle, begins new thread) restates prior action without cost. Swappable with "archivist" or "chronicler" with minor edits. Score capped at 4.6 by missing middle development of a causal choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eternal candle appears in three beats: introduction (paragraph 3), synchronization (paragraph 4), and closure reprise (paragraph 10). It enables Elara's perception method ("refract through the patterns," "flame flickered, casting shadows") and charges the final image ("flame burned on, patient and eternal"). However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost; its mechanics remain abstract ("reveal what normal eyes could not see"). Setup +0.6, beat involvement (three) +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, but no causal pressure or felt trade-off; swappability moderate (any perception-enhancing tool could serve). Band guidance suggests ~6.0; score reduced for lack of cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Unraveling conspiracies shapes the dominant stake (expose the coup alliance) and middle tactics (encoding overheard whispers, tracing contradictions). Setup clear early; middle beat (map alliance between generals and guilds) functional; closure asserts exposure ("embroidered into fabric that would outlast them all") but does not dramatize the unraveling on the page. No on-page moment where the conspiracy's contradictions are leveraged to alter protagonist options. Score eligible for ~6.0 under two-gate model; reduced for summary-only resolution (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Attribute mentioned twice: paragraph 6 ("Let them think her foolish. Wisdom... was safest when disguised") and implied in paragraph 2 ("They laughed when she muttered"). No on-page action where the disguise enables a specific tactic or forecloses a path with cost. Told-only trait without dramatized trade-off. Setup present; middle and closure absent. Capped at 3.8 for swappability and lack of development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Synchronize her perception with that flame" appears once (paragraph 4) and enables the middle beat (seeing conspiracy shape in shadows). No turn traces to this action; it serves as a method descriptor rather than a decisive move. Setup delayed to second third (−0.3); no closure participation; swappable with "focused her attention" or "read the charts by candlelight." Two-gate model (setup + middle) caps eligibility ~6.0; score reduced for late appearance and swappability (−1.1).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Adjacent possibilities" appears once (paragraph 6) as a metaphor for her investigative lens ("listen... through the labyrinth of adjacent possibilities that led to truth"). No mechanics shown on the page; the term could be deleted without altering any beat. Ornamental mention without causal work (−0.8). Setup delayed to second third (−0.3); no middle or closure use. Capped at 2.8 by missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cobalt observatory anchors every beat: perpetual twilight enables her secret work, copper windows filter autumn light, observatory windows rattle with tension, frost crystallizes on glass at closure. Setting supplies resources (isolation, twilight disguise) and charges the final image. Setup early +0.7, beat involvement (four) +1.4, closure linkage (frost image) +1.2, causal pressure (enables secrecy) +0.9. Specificity high (cobalt, copper-stained); irreplaceable. Score eligible for ≥7.0 under three-gate model.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Before the coup" frames urgency (paragraph 5: "The coup was coming") but no live clock tightens decisions on the page. Time remains vague; no deadline forces a choice or alters tactics. Setup present; middle beat acknowledges timeline ("months"); closure does not leverage temporal pressure ("somewhere... the conspirators finalized their plans"). Two-gate model caps ~6.0; score reduced for vague tracking (−0.7) and lack of closure participation (−0.7).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Motivation stated in paragraphs 8–9 ("listen for the unheard stories," "carry their stories forward") and drives her encoding work. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. No on-page friction where listening competes with another desire. Setup delayed to second half (−0.4); middle beat (tracing testimonies) functional; closure reprises ("Elara listened") without cost. Two-gate model; score reduced for told-only execution and late setup.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Tone of "echoed silence" sustained through "perpetual twilight," "whispered secrets," "suppressed voices," and final line "Elara listened." Coherent across beats; modulates slightly (autumn tension → frost crystallization) to support accumulative pressure. Setup early +0.6, beat involvement (recurring silence imagery) +0.9, closure linkage ("echoed silence... seemed to swell") +1.0. However, tone remains static mood rather than charging the final image with undeniable pressure; no single tonal shift that reweights cost. Band guidance ~6.0; score reflects coherence without transformation.</comment>
