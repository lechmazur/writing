<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior is established through her role and seventeen-year trajectory, but her choices in the present frame remain observational rather than dramatized as contradictory impulses under pressure. The backstory load (mother's death, exhumation, coffee-ground divination, seventeen years of service) floods the text without anchoring in micro-choices that alter present tactics. Emotional states are labeled ("her mind elsewhere," "driven for seventeen years") rather than embodied through contradictory physical action. The final touch of the crystal feels inevitable by setup but is not earned by on-page conflict between competing wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Mira is beyond "lantern lighter," why she is at the chamber this morning, and what specific choice she faces remain vague past the first third. The closure unit—touching the crystal to recover her mother's memory—lands on the page but carries no visible cost; the "time to let the light in" reads as thematic assertion rather than a decision that forecloses a path. Causality is weak: the whale's death "cracked something open" without showing how that event compels Mira's descent today rather than yesterday. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (salt crystals accumulate memories, coffee grounds map the route, the final image recharges "lantern lighter of forgotten things"), but the piece does not teach this pattern early or tighten it through a cadence shift at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber is vivid and specifically detailed (jagged formations, fluctuating gravity, "gleaming silence"). Spatial choreography is coherent through the descent and movement between gravity pockets. The setting constrains Mira's route (she must read coffee grounds to navigate) and the densest pocket pulls her toward the final crystal, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, the whale on the beach, the flooded cemetery, and the dockside lanterns remain ornamental backdrops that do not pressure the present choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding her mother's deleted memory—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page obstacle tests Mira's commitment or forces a trade-off. The gravity fluctuations and coffee-ground navigation are described as solved problems rather than live difficulties. No reversal or tightening narrows options; Mira's descent proceeds without friction, and the final touch occurs without visible cost (no renunciation, no foreclosed alternative, no price paid). Agency is minimal: the story moves her rather than her choices driving escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The core question—"where do deleted memories go when we force ourselves to forget?"—is posed explicitly and answered on the page (salt crystals beneath the sea). The lantern/light motif recurs but does not shift meaning; "lantern lighter of forgotten things" in the final line restates rather than reweights. Subtext operates weakly; most thematic content is directly stated ("the gravity that fluctuated with the weight of unspoken truths"). The flowers-as-map conceit and the whale as world-cracker are symbolically coherent but lack earned ambiguity or counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent, though the register ("liminal spaces between sea and shore," "memories that gravity itself could not reach") occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism that flattens urgency. Perceptual signature is present (Mira notices salt, coffee patterns, the gleam of crystals) but not character-specific; another character might perceive identically. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance remains constant, appropriate for the reflective accumulative mode, but does not modulate with pressure because pressure is not dramatized.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is high; sentences are grammatically clean and comprehensible. However, multiple beats loop conceptually: "memories spilled," "memories drifted," "memories… waiting" all restate the same idea without advancing pressure. Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "photograph made of light and loss," "roads on a map of the soul," "silence became something almost physical." Template cadence appears in the backstory exposition: "She had been… she had never… Now she understood… The whale's death had…" stacks past-perfect constructions. Propulsion stalls in the middle third during coffee-ground and gravity exposition. The final image "let the light in" is abstract rather than concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—deleted memories crystallize in salt chambers beneath a lighthouse, navigable by coffee-ground divination—is inventive in combination but leans on speculative-mystical templates (psychopomp guide, liminal threshold, buried secret). The whale as inciting event and the flooded cemetery exhumation are vivid particulars, but neither is causally necessary; the story could function identically if Mira had found the flowers in an attic. Emotional specificity is low: Mira's seventeen-year grief and her mother's secret are told rather than made specific through contradictory wants. The transformation test fails: swap names and the emotional arc remains generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her occupation ("dock-side lantern lighter") is mentioned in the opening line and reprised metaphorically at closure ("lantern lighter of forgotten things"). However, her role as lantern lighter does not constrain or enable any on-page choice; she carries no flame this morning and performs no lighting action. The character is signaled early (setup gate met) but does not drive a middle beat (development gate missed) and her final action (touching the crystal) is not occupation-specific (closure participation weak). The metaphorical reprise at the end reweights thematically but not causally.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pressed wildflowers are introduced early ("pressed against her chest"), explained via backstory (exhumed from mother's grave), reappear at the climax ("clutched in her palm"), and "pulse with warmth" in the final beat. They function as a map and a talisman, meeting setup and closure gates. However, their mechanics are vague (how do they guide navigation? why do they pulse?), and they do not constrain a choice or alter tactics in the middle. They recur with reweighted emotional meaning but not with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Pockets of gravity" are described in detail (fluctuating pull, different densities, guiding Mira's route) and appear in multiple beats, meeting setup and development gates. However, the gravity does not constrain a choice with cost; Mira navigates successfully by following coffee grounds, and no gravitational obstacle forces a trade-off. The concept shapes the setting's texture but not the protagonist's options. Closure participation is weak; the gravity is present in the final scene but does not visibly alter the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Fluctuates mysteriously" describes the gravity's behavior and is mentioned repeatedly ("pulled her slightly one direction, then another," "fluctuated and pulled her forward"). The attribute is signaled early and recurs, meeting setup and development gates. However, it does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost; the fluctuation is scenery rather than obstacle. Mira is pulled but not forced to choose between competing pulls or to sacrifice something to proceed.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Exhume" appears twice: Mira exhumed her mother's body three winters past to retrieve the flowers, and the narrative states "Now she would exhume the memory itself." The physical exhumation is backstory but provides the flowers that enable the present attempt. The metaphorical exhumation (touching the crystal to recover the memory) is the story's climactic action, meeting closure participation. However, the action is easily swappable with "retrieve," "uncover," or "recover" without altering structure. It shapes two beats (past and present) but lacks unique properties that make it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Patterns in coffee grounds" are introduced at the midpoint ("She had learned to read the coffee grounds for guidance") and demonstrated immediately ("scattered fresh grounds into a bowl… watched them spiral… revealed the path"). The method enables Mira's navigation through the chamber, meeting development and closure participation (she uses the grounds to reach the final crystal). However, it is introduced late (past the first third, missing setup gate) and functions as a convenient tool rather than a method with meaningful cost or tradeoff. The mechanics are told rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "salt crystal growing chamber" is the primary location for the second half of the story, introduced at the structural midpoint when Mira descends. It supplies specific resources (crystals that hold memories, gravity pockets that guide movement) and constrains Mira's route (she must navigate between formations). The chamber is described with vivid particulars (jagged formations, gleaming silence, fluctuating pull) and houses the climactic action (touching the central crystal). It meets development and closure gates strongly but misses early setup (the first third focuses on beach and backstory). Micro-setting (the body, tools) does not compensate; the chamber itself is the active spatial agent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"After the whale beaches" anchors the temporal frame in the opening line and recurs as causal setup ("The whale's death had cracked something open"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions; no clock pressures Mira, and the story could occur days or weeks after the beaching without structural change. The morning setting is mentioned ("moved through the morning") but does not alter tactics. The element signals setup but provides no development constraint or closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To find where deleted memories go" is stated explicitly ("the question that had driven Mira for seventeen years") and answered on the page (the salt chamber). The motivation is present throughout, meeting setup, development (drives her descent), and closure (she reaches the answer). However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; no on-page friction tests whether Mira would sacrifice something else to pursue this goal. The desire is singular and uncontested, reducing causal pressure. The final line ("time to let the light in") suggests resolve but not a choice that forecloses an alternative.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Gleaming silence" appears as a repeated phrase marking key beats: "gleaming silence" of the chamber (twice), the beach's "unnatural sheen," and crystals that "gleam." The tone is consistent—hushed, luminous, liminal—and modulates subtly (the silence "became something almost physical" under pressure). It charges the final image ("In the gleaming silence of the chamber… Mira finally understood"). The tone meets all three gates and elevates the ending's resonance. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>
