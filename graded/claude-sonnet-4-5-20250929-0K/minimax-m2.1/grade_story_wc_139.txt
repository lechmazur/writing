<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's interior is specific and grounded in concrete choices (death certificates, precision work), and her father's legacy creates authentic internal friction. The decision to help Darius feels somewhat abrupt—her analytical process is summarized rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Darius remains functional but flat, present primarily to receive Elena's help rather than applying pressure that forces her internal contradictions into collision. The ending renunciation ("how to give fairly") lands with conceptual weight but lacks visible cost that forecloses a prior path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the ink pot, flowers, and honest-daughter frame recur and deepen toward the final image. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elena finds her equation, placing flowers by the ink pot with "something like peace"—reweighting her father's legacy without a decisive external change. Cost is felt (she accepts her role, differentiated from her father) but the final image would strengthen if a specific choice or forfeiture were dramatized rather than summarized. Orientation is clean; the prep-room setting anchors early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prep room is vivid and specific—"humming lights," "strange deathly vitality"—and directly pressures Elena's stance by framing honesty as ceremony for the dead. The unclaimed woman's body serves as a concrete prop that Elena handles, making the waiting active and lending physical grounding to the ethical calculus. Darius sitting in the corner while she works gives spatial choreography that integrates setting into character choice. The final image (flowers by the ink pot, resuming work) charges the closure with the room's particulars.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Elena's search for the "mathematics of a fair trade" between exploitation and help. The tightening occurs when Darius arrives and she sees the asylum application, but the escalation is more conceptual than causal—her decision to write the application is recounted rather than shown through on-page attempts, friction, or tactical adjustments. The approval arrives off-page in summary ("Three weeks later"), eliding the cost of waiting or the risk of failure. The ink pot's role in "revealing truth" feels asserted rather than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges clearly from particulars: honest daughter of a con artist finding fair exchange without deception. The ink pot and chrysanthemums recur with shifting weight, and the final image (flowers, resuming work, "lives fully accounted") reweights the opening's father/daughter dichotomy without stating a moral. The "rigid thinking could liquefy" metaphor risks on-the-nose articulation but stays tied to Elena's work and the ink's properties. Minor slip: "the mathematics of a fair trade" is invoked repeatedly without sufficient scene friction to fully earn the proof metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elena; perceptual signature is distinct (reading people "like ledgers," precision, analytical). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction—"deathly vitality," "liquefies rigid thinking"—that feels authorial rather than Elena's voice under pressure, though it stays broadly consistent. Darius has no dialogue, so voice distinction is not tested. The prose modulates well across reflection and scene, and free indirect access to Elena's calculating mind is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are generally strong, but several beats summarize rather than dramatize: "she asked Darius to wait while she worked" compresses what could be active waiting; "Three weeks later, when approval came" elides the story's central test. Minor template cadence: "The ink pot sat... Elena understood... The application she produced..." in adjacent paragraphs. "Deathly vitality" and "liquefies rigid thinking" are metaphorically strained—life/death opposition is clear, but "liquefy" applied to thought process risks purple abstraction. No major loops, but density could tighten in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The honest con-artist's daughter is a solid inversion, and the prep-room setting offers fresh ethical ground. However, the asylum-application plot follows a familiar humanitarian-aid template: sympathetic refugee, rejected papers, insider helps, approval arrives. The ink pot's "never runs dry" property and the claim that it reveals truth rather than forges feel like magical shortcuts that bypass earned struggle. The ending's equation metaphor is conceptually tidy but not transformed through scene friction into something unmistakable and new.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elena, the con artist's honest child, drives the central choice to help Darius and shapes the thematic resolution. Her父亲's legacy is invoked early and reweighted at closure. However, much of her decision-making is summarized—"she began to see something take shape," "she understood finally"—rather than shown through micro-choices that alter tactics. Present across all three gates (setup, middle choice, payoff) but the middle beat is more reflective than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ink pot appears early, is used for death certificates, and returns at closure when Elena places flowers beside it. Its properties—never runs dry, makes thought "more fluid"—are described but not tested under pressure; we don't see Elena struggle with it or choose it over another tool. The shift from "forging documents" to "revealing truth" is asserted rather than dramatized. Two touches (workstation description, final image) but swappable with any symbolic heirloom without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Political asylum is the story's engine: Darius's rejected application creates the problem, Elena writes a new one, approval arrives. It shapes stakes and tactics on the page (the application is "not a con; it was an argument, a mathematical proof"). The asylum system's rigidity ("designed to say no") pressures Elena's method. Present in setup (Darius arrives with crumpled application), development (Elena writes), and payoff (approval, Darius thanks her). Causal and closure-linked, though the approval itself is summarized off-page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Liquefies rigid thinking" is mentioned twice—once about the ink, once about Elena's realization—but never enacted through on-page choice where fluidity versus rigidity alters an outcome. The application Elena writes is described as flowing differently, but we don't see her reject a rigid draft or adjust tactics when fluidity fails. Label-only trait without visible tradeoff; ornamental metaphor that describes rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The breach (Darius opening the back door) is the inciting incident that violates protocol and brings the asylum problem into Elena's workspace. It triggers her central choice and reframes the prep room from solitary ritual to ethical test. Present at setup, drives the turn, and the final image (resuming work after helping) completes the arc. Specific and irreplaceable—email or a daytime visit would not carry the transgressive weight of invading the death-preparation space at night.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"By waiting actively" is signaled in the middle: "The waiting was active, not passive; Elena was thinking, calculating." The method is named and briefly shown (Darius watches her work while she thinks), but the mechanics are thin—we don't see what specific waiting behaviors (observation, calculation steps) shape her solution. It appears in development and implicitly at closure (she resumes her patient work), but the active-waiting itself could be replaced with direct problem-solving without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room is established early with sensory detail ("humming lights," "quiet industry of preservation") and directly pressures Elena's stance by framing honesty as ceremony. The unclaimed woman's body is a concrete prop Elena handles, making the waiting dramatized rather than idle. The room's "deathly vitality" charges the thematic contrast (death/life, honesty/deception). Present in setup, used tactically in the middle (Darius waits there, watching), and returns at closure (resuming work). Micro-setting that alters the ethical register of the encounter.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elena's desire "to find the mathematics of a fair trade" is stated early and drives her decision to help Darius. The motivation is conceptual and somewhat abstract—friction between exploitation and help is told rather than shown through competing temptations. Her father's legacy creates background pressure, but we don't see Elena tempted to use his methods or struggle with conflicting impulses in scene. The equation metaphor recurs at closure ("she had found her equation"), reweighting the setup, but the dramatized cost of the search is thin.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Deathly vitality" is taught early—"humming lights and the quiet industry of preservation"—and sustained through the juxtaposition of Elena's precision with death and Darius's flight toward life. The tone modulates appropriately (solemn opening, active middle, peaceful close) and charges the final image (flowers, resumed work, "lives fully accounted"). Coherent and purposeful, though the phrase itself risks being an authorial label rather than emerging from Elena's perceptual signature. The tonal contrast supports closure without overshadowing pressure.</comment>
