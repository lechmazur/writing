<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's role as "dreamless freight guard" and her stance crystallization ("I cultivate the sparks") demonstrates character-specific worldview under pressure. The exchange with the merchant reveals contradictory impulses—protection versus understanding—that inform her final refusal. However, her interior life remains somewhat abstract; the chess clock and archive matter more as symbols than as objects that test her personally. The final choice to continue walking feels more thematic than viscerally costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story builds through layered images (glowing moss, divergent archive, frozen clock) that converge at the merchant encounter, where Mira's declaration reweights the opening premise. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): her refusal and reply crystallize her stance with conceptual cost ("Hope looks like a pause"). Orientation anchors arrive early (who, where, what). The merchant's appearance and disappearance feel slightly convenient but serve the pattern. Cost is felt rather than physical, which fits the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "glowing dune in bloom" supplies vivid, purposeful sensory grounding and recurs with shifting meaning (opening landscape, closing mending lullaby). The bioluminescent moss functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (cart, staff, merchant's fold-entrance). The post-forest world is rendered through selective detail (glass plains, iron ruins, fungal forests) that filters through Mira's practiced route rather than encyclopedic catalog. The chess clock and archive as objects-in-motion add tactile weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: protecting the cargo against those who would claim it. The merchant's offer supplies one meaningful pressure point that forces Mira to articulate her purpose. Her refusal and explanation constitute agency with conceptual cost (she accepts the loneliness of her mission). Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening occurs when the merchant quotes the old phrase and Mira must respond with her own answer, narrowing ambiguity. The stakes remain somewhat abstract; a second on-page complication or a visible tactical trade-off would have sharpened pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and choices without meta-commentary: hope as suspended possibility, light growing in darkness, the archive of "might-have-been" as burden and treasure. The chess clock's midnight freeze—world tipping from "might-be to was"—supplies a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Mira's final line ("a broken lullaby finally learning to mend itself") reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. No thematic echo or sermonizing mars the ending. The piece resists tidy resolution while remaining legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries distinct texture ("charm worked through wave functions," "burned paper" eyes, "wind through the remains of flute") that is lyric without obscuring clarity. Dialogue feels purposeful and distinct (merchant's grief-tinged smile, Mira's clipped refusal). The prose modulates appropriately under pressure. Minor register drift: "smile at uncertainty until it relaxed" feels slightly over-articulated for the urgency, but the perceptual signature (Mira's route-honed attention) remains consistent. Psychic distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Information density is high (most lines do multiple jobs). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and voice-motivated ("phosphorescent note," "possibilities that had never collapsed"). One mixed metaphor: "fold in the landscape where the light bent wrong" followed by "fold of light"—the vehicle shifts from topography to illumination without clear linkage. The phrase "祈愿" (appears untranslated, likely a generation artifact or intentional code-switch) disrupts flow without payoff. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Propulsion is steady; the piece breathes appropriately.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic guardian-on-route is familiar, but the combination of bioluminescent moss, divergent archive, chess clock frozen at midnight, and wave-function charm creates a specific, non-generic synthesis. The merchant encounter avoids cliché through the grief-tinged exchange rather than combat. Emotional specificity (hope as pause, sparks in unlit corners) lifts the premise above template. The final image—lullaby mending note by note—feels earned rather than ornamental. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens coherence without obscuring stakes. Transformation test: the arc depends on these exact elements.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and makes one key choice (refusal at merchant encounter) that shapes the ending. Her role as "dreamless freight guard" is established early but functions more as atmospheric label than constraint that alters tactics. Her occupation enables the cargo escort but does not force a visible trade-off or tactical decision beyond the refusal. The final act of continuing forward is consistent but not dramatically costly. Functional across beats; causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The chess clock is introduced early (beat 1), checked after the jolt (beat 2), and discussed with the merchant (beat 3), satisfying the ≥2 beats requirement. Its frozen midnight state supplies thematic charge (hope as pause, the world's tipping point). However, Mira never handles or uses it beyond checking; it remains cargo rather than tool. The merchant's question reweights its meaning at closure. Strong lyric reprise but limited causal pressure. Setup + Development + Payoff gates met; scored in 5.0–6.9 band for one-key-turn role.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The divergent archive appears early (behind her in the cart), is described as containing "everything that had been and everything that might have been," and informs Mira's knowledge of the clock's moment. It supplies thematic weight ("heavy in ways scales couldn't measure") but does not constrain her tactics or force a choice. The archive shows her the clock's meaning, enabling her reply to the merchant, which constitutes one key turn. Setup + Payoff gates met (Development weak). Functional but replaceable with another knowledge source.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Occasionally everywhere" is mentioned once as route descriptor ("She had been occasionally everywhere"). The phrase is evocative but ornamental; it does not constrain or enable any on-page action. No cost tied to this attribute. Present but does not shape a turn. Missing Development and Payoff gates; swappable with "extensively traveled" or similar. Cap 3.8 per swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The charm is described in one beat ("This charm worked through wave functions. You couldn't make something happen by asking..."). It supplies world-building texture but does not drive a major turn. Mira never performs the charm on the page; the concept remains exposition. No second beat involvement; no closure linkage. Present after the first third. Missing Development and Payoff gates. Ornamental mention −0.3; late appearance −0.2; summary-only −0.3. Cap 4.6 for missing setup; deductions place score at 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Through wave functions" is mentioned once in the charm description ("This charm worked through wave functions"). The mechanics are sketched ("suggest probability, smile at uncertainty") but never demonstrated. No second beat; no closure use. Exposition-only. Missing all three gates. Late appearance (after first third) −0.2; ornamental −0.3; summary-only −0.3. Cap 4.6 for missing setup; deductions bring score to 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "glowing dune in bloom" is introduced early, Mira walks across it, and it returns in the final image ("spread around her like a broken lullaby finally learning to mend itself"). The bioluminescent moss functions as both setting and thematic anchor (light after forests). It does not constrain Mira's route choices but charges the closure image decisively. Setup + Payoff gates met; Development weak (no tactical constraint). Strong lyric reprise that reweights the stake. Closure linkage +1.0; early signal +0.5; specificity +0.4; one causal beat (opening anchor) +0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.3 = 5.3, lifted to 7.2 for closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the last forest burns" appears in the opening line, the merchant quotes it, and the clock marks the moment "the final forest caught fire." The timeframe is thematic frame rather than live ticking clock. It does not tighten decisions (no urgency within the scene's elapsed time). The phrase recurs with reweighted meaning at the merchant encounter, shaping Mira's reply. Setup + Payoff gates met; Development weak. One key thematic turn. Lyric reprise +0.8; early signal +0.5; one beat involvement +0.4; no tactical constraint. Base 3.0 + 1.7 = 4.7, lifted to 5.9 for thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To cultivate the sparks" is Mira's answer to the merchant's question, crystallizing her motivation in the key dialogue beat. It is dramatized through her refusal to sell the cargo and her choice to continue. The desire is conflicted (protection vs. understanding) but resolved cleanly. Setup implicit (her role); Development weak (told rather than shown in prior action); Payoff strong (the declaration). Two gates met. One key turn +0.4; closure linkage +0.8; early implicit signal +0.3; told-only friction −0.4. Base 3.0 + 1.1 = 4.1, lifted to 6.1 for closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "fractured lullaby" appears in the final image ("a broken lullaby finally learning to mend itself"). Tone throughout is elegiac, lyric, and post-catastrophic—coherent with the phrase. The prose modulates with pressure (calm route description, tightened merchant exchange, expansive closing image). The final line charges the tone with undeniable poignancy. Setup implicit (opening mood); Development (sustained coherence); Payoff (explicit in final image). All three gates met. Closure linkage +1.2; coherence across turns +0.6; specificity +0.4; one explicit beat (closing line) +0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.6 = 5.6, lifted to 7.4 for tonal charge at closure.</comment>
