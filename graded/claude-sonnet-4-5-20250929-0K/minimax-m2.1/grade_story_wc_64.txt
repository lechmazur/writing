<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The gardener's blithe baseline is established but never pressured; his descent and reading lack interior contradiction or embodied cost. The "tender care he applied to all things connected to the dead" and "learning to hear what the dead had tried to say" read as summary labels rather than character-particular impulses tested under stress. The final understanding arrives as declared insight without a visible trade-off or foreclosed path; no decision alters his stance on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece assembles atmospheric fragments (cemetery opening → cobalt silo → tapestry decoding → breadcrumb realization) toward a closure that reweights the gardener's role as listener. The final image—"uncharted echoes...found their listener at last"—offers Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains abstract; no visible price is paid, no option is foreclosed. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs (the sovereign's question revealed in the threads), but the closure effect lacks the felt weight required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and starlight opening provide vivid spatial grounding; "velveteen gloom" and "shadows that had the texture of deep velvet, absorbing sound and time alike" charge the atmosphere. The setting constrains the gardener's physical descent and frames the discovery, and the starlight functions as "an audience of distant witnesses" that subtly pressures the final act of interpretation. The tapestry and sovereign case anchor micro-setting choices. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the tapestry to understand the sovereign's intentions—is signaled midway but never tightens meaningfully. No reversal or escalation forces a trade-off; the gardener settles and decodes without friction, obstacle, or cost. The "unraveling threads" suggest urgency, yet the resolution ("he had received it") arrives as summary rather than a choice under pressure. Accumulative deepening is present but does not narrow options or impose a felt price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the sovereign's encrypted question and the gardener's role as interpreter of the silent dead. The final image—"uncharted echoes...found their listener"—resonates without stating a moral, and the motif of listening recurs purposefully. However, the closure image remains abstract; "breadcrumbs of meaning" and "shape of intentions" are conceptual rather than grounded in embodied particulars. The piece invites reflection but stops short of a non-literal answer charged by prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; third-person limited tracks the gardener's perceptions without head-hopping. Diction is controlled—"velveteen gloom," "tired watchers," "patient and waiting"—and rhythmically consistent. Brief register drift: "office and authority," "culmination of a long struggle," and "initiates" elevate beyond the gardener's established voice without clear motivation. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present but not stress-tested; the gardener's noticing remains calm throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no sustained template cadence. Clarity is high, and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. Minor scaffold: "He had discovered the shape of intentions: not grand or political, but human and humble" restates the prior beat's content without adding pressure. "Tenderly organized in his understanding" is abstract and stock; "uncharted echoes of a long-dead ruler's compassion" leans purple in the final beat. No loops or filter-verb stacks. Information density is moderate; the closure paragraph summarizes rather than advancing through image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core premise—cemetery gardener discovers hidden sovereign message encoded in tapestry—combines familiar tropes (secret chamber, encrypted artifact, humble interpreter) without a transformative angle. The gardener's role as listener is thematically apt but predictable; the sovereign's question ("whether the mercy they had shown...had reached the right hands") reads generic rather than specific to this ruler's lived calculus. Emotional specificity is limited; the resolution arrives without surprise or risk. The piece executes competently but does not offer a non-obvious synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The blithe gardener is present in all three segments (cemetery, descent, interpretation) and his choice to descend initiates the sequence. However, his decisions do not create reversals; he notices, gathers tools, climbs down, and decodes without friction. "Blithe spirit unshaken" establishes baseline but is never tested. The final act—understanding and carrying the case up—reads as reception rather than a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Functional but replaceable with a similarly curious discoverer.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The antique sovereign case appears in two beats: discovery on the silo floor and the gardener carrying it up at closure. It is handled "with the tender care he applied to all things connected to the dead" and contains the tapestry that drives the central action. The case's "symbols of office and authority" and "worn leather and tarnished brass clasps" charge its presence, and its reappearance "tucked beneath his arm" at closure signals completion. However, the case itself does not constrain a choice or evolve in meaning; it serves as a container rather than an active element. Present across setup, middle, and payoff, but mechanically rather than causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Uncharted echoes" appears only in the final paragraph as a thematic label for the sovereign's message. It does not shape stakes or tactics on the page; the gardener's task is decoding threads, not navigating echoes. The concept is ornamental—a late metaphor that summarizes rather than driving choices. No prior beat establishes "echoes" as a pressure or resource. Present at closure as theme claim, but replaceable with "lost voice" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" appears once in the final paragraph: "the tapestry's secrets now tenderly organized in his understanding." It labels the gardener's mental state rather than constraining an on-page action. The adverb "tenderly" echoes his earlier "tender care" when handling the case, establishing consistency, but does not enable or prevent a choice with visible cost. The attribute is thematically coherent but does not alter tactics or options. Lyric reprise without causal work; functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Untangle" is signaled midway: "he realized this was what he had been called to do. He needed to untangle what time had obscured." The gardener then "began his work by decoding frayed threads," and the final beat confirms completion ("tenderly organized"). The action drives the middle and closure beats and is irreplaceable—removing "untangle" would require restructuring the tapestry discovery. However, the untangling itself occurs off-page as summary; no specific difficulty or choice is dramatized. Present across all three gates with purpose-driven use, but lacks on-page friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"By decoding frayed threads in the tapestry's border" appears in the middle beat and shapes the gardener's method. The mechanism is specific: "a sequence of colors and knots that told not a story but a question." The method is signaled ("he began his work by decoding frayed threads") and its result drives closure ("the tapestry's secrets now tenderly organized"). However, the decoding itself is summarized rather than shown; no step-by-step difficulty or tactical choice is dramatized. The method matters but its mechanics do not pressure the gardener on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt silo is introduced early ("a cobalt silo, a cylindrical chamber of blue-tinged stone that held the light of the stars through an opening far above") and recurs across all three beats: entry, discovery, and interpretation. The setting constrains the gardener's descent (rusted ladder) and supplies the starlight that frames his work ("the starlight above him like an audience of distant witnesses"). The silo's precise circular layout positions the sovereign case "at the center of the circular space as though awaiting discovery." The setting actively shapes the gardener's spatial choices and charges the final image of climbing back "into the morning light." Essential to mood and movement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>0.8</grade><comment>"After the chess clock runs down" does not appear on the page. The tapestry depicts "a chess game in mid-move," but no clock is mentioned, and time does not tighten decisions. The gardener's work is untimed; he "settled against the cool cobalt wall" and decoded "gradually" without urgency. The chess image is static decoration. Timeframe element is absent; the story operates in open, untracked time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To discover the shape of intentions" is stated once in the final third: "He had discovered the shape of intentions: not grand or political, but human and humble." The motivation is told rather than dramatized; the gardener's earlier actions (noticing the gap, descending, examining the case) read as curiosity without friction between competing desires or costs. No on-page choice tests this want against an obstacle or price. The phrase arrives as summary at closure without prior conflict. Functional but not pressured.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" is introduced early ("The gardener stood in velveteen gloom, surrounded by shadows that had the texture of deep velvet, absorbing sound and time alike") and recurs through "cool cobalt wall" and "starlight above him like an audience of distant witnesses." The tone modulates subtly: the opening hums with the gardener's "blithe spirit," the silo deepens into "patient and waiting" darkness, and the closure shifts to "morning light." Coherent, purposeful, and charged at the final image without becoming static or ornamental.</comment>
