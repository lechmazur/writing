<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The prophet remains an observer throughout, with no on-page choice that forecloses a path or reveals contradictory impulses. Interiority is largely absent; we get exposition about her gift ("the title felt more like description than designation") but no embodied tension or micro-choice under pressure. The final smile reads as serene accomplishment rather than earned cost. No character arc or renunciation dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No closure unit is present. The piece describes a repeated ritual (striking water, reading clouds) without a before/after change, decision, or reweighted cost. The Orientation Test is satisfied (who/where/when clear early), but the dominant lens remains ambiguous—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pressure builds to a turn. The ending ("smiled in the gathering darkness") restates the opening's serene mastery without cost or reconfiguration. Applying −0.5 for lens ambiguity and −0.8 for absent closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The driftwood orchard is vivid and specific ("irregular ring floating on the open sea," logs "chosen specifically for their acoustic properties"), and the blue-hour timeframe anchors atmosphere. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or shape the ending's charge; it functions as a backdrop for demonstration rather than a crucible. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered, but the final image does not reprise or reweight the environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>No dominant stake is signaled—there is no problem to solve, no opposition, no cost at risk. The prophet performs her established skill without friction, error, or escalation. "To turn obstacles into instruments" is stated as a completed philosophy, not tested on the page. The "larger wave" at the end is incorporated smoothly, not as a reversal that narrows options. No agency, no tightening, no felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of transformation ("obstacles not as impediments but as instruments") is articulated directly multiple times, undercutting subtext. "Restless euphony" and "fractal generating" are asserted rather than demonstrated through tension or earned insight. The final image offers no non-literal answer or conceptual repricing; it restates the premise without complication. However, the extended metaphor of ocean-as-composition is sustained and coherent, and the cloud-reading motif adds texture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited is clean and stable, with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent, anchored in the prophet's perception. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("atmospheric script written in vapor and light," "great composition that surrounded all living things") that reads writerly rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present (acoustic geography, resonance patterns) but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure since no pressure appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and grammatical. However, paraphrase loops are pervasive: "not simply a splash but a bass note," "not because of any connection… but because the word meant to double," "not as impediments but as instruments." Template cadence runs appear ("She had been called… She didn't simply forecast… She had learned… She smiled"). Figurative density is high without escalation payoff ("endless symphony," "restless euphony," "great composition"). Applying −0.8 for loops and template stems, −0.4 for figurative muddle across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The driftwood-xylophone orchard and cloud-reading prophet offer surface novelty, but the execution is a static demonstration of mastery without complication or fresh turn. The "dub" etymology and "fractal generating" are explained rather than dramatized. The piece reads as a lyric tableau rather than a story with stakes, and the final image does not reweight or surprise. Transformation test fails: the arc (demonstration of skill) could transfer to any mystical-craft frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The leeward tide prophet is present throughout and performs her ritual, but makes no choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She observes, interprets, and strikes water without friction or cost. Setup and development gates met (present early, active in middle), but no closure participation—the ending restates her ongoing practice. Ornamental use with no causal pressure. Late integration friction for lack of decision: −0.8. Swappability: −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The xylophone mallet is handled in multiple beats (first strike, second strike, larger wave strike) and is materially present. Setup gate met (introduced early as "raised the xylophone mallet above her head"). Development and closure gates met (used in middle and final beats). However, it does not constrain choice or carry reweighted meaning—it is a tool for demonstration, not a source of cost or tension. Beat involvement +0.9, early signal +0.5, but ornamental use −0.8, swappability (any striker would serve) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Sketched resonance is mentioned as a thematic label ("The sketched resonance she created was invisible but tangible") but does not shape stakes or tactics. It appears in the second half as exposition rather than method. Missing setup and development gates; closure participation is label-only. Ornamental use −0.8, late appearance −0.5, swappability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Cloud interpretation is described early ("clouds above were gathering in formations she had learned to read since childhood") and returns ("she adjusted her rhythm to match their pace"), but it does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. She reads them and adjusts rhythm, but no choice or tradeoff results. Setup gate met, development and closure gates weak. Ornamental use −0.7, no visible cost −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Dub" is explained as a naming rationale ("she called it dub not because of any connection… but because the word meant to double") rather than dramatized as an action that creates a turn. It appears mid-story as exposition. No major turn traces to this action; easily swappable with "resonate" or "echo." Missing all three gates (late setup, no middle choice, no closure participation). Late appearance −0.6, ornamental −0.8, swappability −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Fractal generating is explained ("a kind of fractal generating technique where each sound spawned smaller sounds") but the mechanics do not shape attempts or choices. It functions as a thematic label rather than a method under pressure. Setup gate weak (second paragraph, expository), development and closure gates absent. Ornamental use −0.8, summary-only −0.6, swappability −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The orchard of driftwood is vividly rendered early and returns in multiple beats ("floating trees," "driftwood stems," "outer edge of the driftwood circle"). Setup and development gates met, and it is present in the final beat. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it is the stage, not a pressure. Beat involvement +0.9, early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.4, but ornamental use (backdrop) −0.9, no causal pressure −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Blue hour is signaled early ("At the blue hour, when the sun had surrendered") and the gathering darkness bookends the piece. Setup and closure gates met, development gate weak (time does not tighten a decision in the middle). It sets atmosphere but does not constrain tactics or impose a live clock. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.4, but ornamental use (mood-setting) −0.7, no causal pressure −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to turn obstacles into instruments" is stated explicitly ("she was only beginning to decipher," "her gift and her burden") but never dramatized through conflicted choice or visible cost. Setup gate met (stated early), development and closure gates weak (no friction between wants and costs). Told-only −0.8, no visible cost −0.6, swappability (any craft-mastery motive would fit) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Restless euphony is signaled in the final line ("feeling the restless euphony of the ocean pulse through her arm") and tone is cohesive—lyric, meditative, celebratory. However, tone does not modulate with pressure (no pressure exists) and the final image does not charge or reweight it. Setup gate weak (appears late), closure gate met, development gate absent. Closure linkage +0.7, coherence +0.4, but late appearance −0.5, static mood (no modulation) −0.6.</comment>
