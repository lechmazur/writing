<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marek's interiority is consistently filtered through his inherited quest and the feather's significance, showing embodied engagement with the facility. However, his change at the end—understanding that belonging is "a breath to be shared"—arrives as an epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The grandmother's backstory and researcher notes provide texture but the protagonist's own stakes remain abstract; he never faces a concrete trade-off or renunciation on the page. Internal contradiction is minimal; he moves through discovery to realization without friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered images (feather, fireflies, bioluminescence, amber specimen) that converge at the ending to reweight the belonging question. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid)—the final firefly ascent and Marek's kinship realization reframe the archive's loneliness into shared wonder. Orientation anchors early (Marek, underwater facility, burnt feather). The cost, however, is conceptual rather than felt: the facility will flood by morning, but Marek's own sacrifice or forfeiture is not dramatized. One meaningful deepening occurs when he places the feather beside the amber and the objects pulse in resonance, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater facility is vividly realized with specific details (crystalline towers, bioluminescent corridors, glass-domed observatory, pressure lock's groan) that constrain Marek's movement and frame his discovery. The amber specimen and archive cabinet anchor micro-setting choices. The ticking clock (sunrise flood deadline) and the spatial choreography (moving through corridors to the heart-chamber observatory) remain coherent. The fireflies' impossible ascension through water charges the final image. Sensory selection favors the visual and tactile (copper-touched air, cold floor), though urgency-driven narrowing is minimal since Marek moves with "careful patience" throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning the rhythm of belonging—is signaled early through the grandmother's question. Pressure accumulates through the archive discovery and the note's revelation, leading to the firefly emergence that reweights Marek's understanding. However, escalation is driven by observation and patience rather than protagonist agency forcing a trade-off; Marek waits and the fireflies come "as they always had." The tightening is a deepening of perception, not a narrowing of options or a cost-bearing choice. No reversal or renunciation forecloses a path; the ending grants understanding without dramatized sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme—belonging as shared breath rather than calculated pattern—emerges organically from the researchers' archived loneliness and Marek's kinship realization. The burnt feather, bioluminescence, and firefly constellations function as recurring motifs that shift meaning: from inheritance to recognition, from isolation to communion. The final image offers a non-literal answer ("a breath to be shared, a moment of wonder witnessed together") without overt moralizing. However, "he understood, finally" edges toward direct statement rather than pure embodiment. The piece resists tidy resolution while maintaining conceptual clarity; the fireflies' impossible ascent charges the wonder without explaining it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable with Marek's focalization throughout. The prose carries a lyric, slightly elevated register ("fever dream dreamed in reverse," "cathedral breath," "mathematicians of wonder") that suits the contemplative tone and underwater setting. Perceptual signature is consistent: Marek notices inherited objects, bioluminescent strands, archival traces—filtered through his quest. However, some diction drifts toward abstract poeticism ("softly ingenious beacon," "luminous respite") that borders on generic lyricism rather than character-specific idiom. Psychic distance remains close; no dialogue appears. The feather "recognizing something" personifies slightly but remains voice-coherent. Rhythm modulates appropriately between movement and reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and vivid images. However, several patterns accumulate: "廊 glowed" is a visible encoding artifact (Chinese character mid-sentence); abstract modifiers stack without concrete grounding ("softly ingenious," "patient attention," "trembling lift"); and some phrases loop conceptually—"the rhythm of belonging" recurs without evolving pressure. The opening sentence's nested construction ("dreamed in reverse") and "forgetting" as a noun read as ornamental. The firefly description is strong, but figurative density in reflective beats ("conversations with the void," "blur into something like kinship") trends toward stock lyricism. Information density is moderate; some lines describe rather than advance. No major clarity breaks, but momentum sags in the middle third's archive browsing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The underwater research facility studying firefly emergence patterns offers a fresh synthesis of setting and concept. The burnt feather as inherited navigational tool and the amber-preserved firefly create specific, memorable images. However, the emotional arc—lonely researchers seeking belonging through data, protagonist inheriting their question and finding the answer in shared observation—follows a recognizable template of solitary-seeker-finds-connection. The fireflies rising through water to mirror stars is a striking image but functions more as a beautiful set-piece than a transformation driven by Marek's specific choices or flaws. The premise transforms the belonging question through the underwater/celestial axis, but the resolution into "shared breath" and "kinship" arrives without much resistance or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marek is identified as having inherited the feather from his grandmother, a landscape astrologer, but he himself is not clearly identified as practicing that role on the page. His choices are primarily observational (activating the pressure lock, locating the archive, placing the feather beside the specimen, waiting for fireflies); none of these turns the plot through astrology-specific expertise or create a trade-off unique to that profession. Present but not causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The burnt feather appears in multiple beats: pressed against glass in the opening, warming against Marek's chest as he moves through corridors, placed beside the amber specimen where both pulse in resonance, held in his hand during the final firefly observation. Its burned state is mentioned but never explained or leveraged as a constraint. The object recurs with mounting symbolic charge and shapes the final image ("the feather in his hand") but does not enable or block a specific tactic. Strong thematic reprise, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Luminous respite" is explicitly named once ("creating a luminous respite from the crushing dark") and embodied through the bioluminescent corridors and the observatory's glow that "held him." The concept charges the final image where Marek finds kinship in shared light. However, it does not constrain a choice or create tactical friction—Marek does not have to choose between respite and exposure, or ration light, or navigate darkness. Present thematically and atmospherically; minimal causal role.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Softly ingenious" appears once as a descriptor for the beacon that drew astrologers. The trait is not demonstrated through Marek's on-page actions or choices; no puzzle-solving, cleverness under constraint, or inventive tactic appears. Label-only mention without behavioral embodiment or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Captivate" is implicit in Marek's waiting and the fireflies' pull, and the archive note states wonder must be shared. However, no beat shows Marek actively captivating another or being captivated in a way that alters his choices. The fireflies captivate him in the ending, but this is reception rather than a decision-driving action. Thematically present; causally weak.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method—shared observation of fireflies' first emergence—structures the entire final movement. Marek waits for the fireflies, they rise "as they always had," and the shared moment (with the researchers' ghosts, conceptually) delivers his realization of kinship. The mechanics (waiting until they emerge, witnessing together across time) shape the ending's meaning. However, "a shared exhale" is more metaphor than literal method; Marek exhales alone. The fireflies' emergence is seasonal/environmental, not a technique Marek employs. Present at closure with thematic charge; moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The underwater facility is established early and remains central: pressure lock, bioluminescent corridors, glass-domed observatory, crystalline archive cabinet, and the flooding deadline all constrain Marek's movement and frame his discovery. The setting's history (abandoned for three decades, researchers' loneliness) feeds the theme. The facility's imminent destruction by sunrise provides a ticking clock. The glass dome allows the firefly observation that delivers closure. Essential across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The sunrise deadline is stated ("By morning, the facility would flood completely") and frames the ending ("until sunrise to complete his work"). However, no beat shows time pressure altering Marek's choices or tactics; he moves with "careful patience" and the clock never tightens decision-making. The timeframe provides atmosphere and a conceptual cost (facility loss) but does not drive on-page urgency. Present in setup and closure mention; minimal tactical impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation—learning the rhythm of belonging—is seeded through the grandmother's question, embodied in Marek's inherited search, and directly addressed in the archive note and final realization. It drives his journey to the facility and frames the ending's insight. However, the motivation is never dramatized in friction or conflicting wants; Marek does not face a choice between belonging and another value, or sacrifice something to achieve understanding. Thematically central; causally smooth without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Shadowseam wonder" (wonder threaded with darkness/mystery) is sustained throughout: the facility rising "like a fever dream," the "crushing dark" offset by bioluminescence, the researchers' "immeasurable loneliness" paired with their wonder-cataloging, the fireflies' "impossible and therefore inevitable" ascent. Tone modulates from Marek's careful exploration to the charged final convergence, darkened by the facility's imminent flood yet elevated by the shared glow. Coherent and purposeful, charging the ending without static uniformity.</comment>
