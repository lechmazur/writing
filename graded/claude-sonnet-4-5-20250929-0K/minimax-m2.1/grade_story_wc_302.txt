<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist remains passive throughout, observing and following rather than making choices that narrow options. Interiority relies heavily on abstract mystical declarations ("cautious exuberant," "veiled dreamer") rather than embodied contradiction. The grandfather's backstory occupies substantial space but never tilts a present choice—his whispered promises and explanations are told, not dramatized through micro-decisions. The final "opening" forecloses nothing; no visible cost appears on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague past 120 words: "the library where she now stood" (paragraph 3) introduces a second library without clear transition from the marble-step library in paragraph 1, violating spatial coherence (−0.4). The cipher "unfolds" only as atmospheric claim; no on-page mechanism changes her options or knowledge. Closure offers no decisive change—she finds the door and receives the second letter, but no choice, renunciation, or reweighting with visible cost occurs. The ending asserts "the answer revealed through the journey itself" without showing what changed or what it cost her.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The glowing library supplies vivid sensory detail (mist, luminescence, humming volumes) and the watch's backward-spinning hands anchor one tactile beat. However, spatial choreography falters: the opening "library's marble steps" versus "the library where she now stood" (paragraph 3) creates unclear geography. The untitled books and door visible only through the watch constrain the final approach, lifting the score slightly, but the setting never forces a trade-off or alters her tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the library of unspoken words—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or cost. She follows the watch without obstruction; the door appears "at exactly the stroke of twelve" by coincidence, not protagonist agency. No reversal or tightening narrows her options; the watch simply leads and she documents. The "infinite" final claim asserts continuation without demonstrating what she forfeited to enter.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken truths recurs through the library's untitled books and "words too dangerous to speak," but the final image defaults to meta-commentary: "endings were merely beginnings spoken backward." No concrete particular reweights the premise; the protagonist never faces a choice between speaking and silence. The watch and cipher function as symbolic conveniences introduced to harvest thematic points rather than constrain action, and the closing assertion of "infinite" replaces earned resonance with abstract claim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Narrative voice attempts a lyric register with phrases like "mist pooled against the library's marble steps like spilled memories" and "cautious exuberant," but these abstract elevations ("ancient recognition," "Möbius strip of discovery") clash with the protagonist's on-page passivity and lack of perceptual signature. POV remains stable third-limited with no head-hopping. Register drift into philosophical abstraction ("propagation delays between understanding and revelation") occurs during peak moments without voice-motivated grounding. No dialogue appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster in paragraphs 4–5: "time...did not flow—it folded" is immediately restated as "propagation delays...were part of the cipher itself" without added pressure. Template cadence runs through paragraph 6: "She understood now...The watch was not merely...but a key" stacks filter constructions. Abstract nominalizations ("cautious optimism and wild hope," "cyclically reversed nature") replace concrete action verbs in high beats. Overwriting pervades: "flower made of pure language" and "every word that had died on desperate tongues" pile figurative language without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.7). The closure beat suffers from this density, triggering the artifact-touching-closure escalation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The core premise—magical library accessed via time-bending pocket watch and cryptic letters from a dead relative—closely matches widely used portal-fantasy and inherited-quest templates without fresh transformation. The "cipher unfolds between letters" and "library of unspoken words" remain abstract MacGuffins never dramatized through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Endings were merely beginnings spoken backward" echoes familiar meta-literary tropes. No bold structural risk heightens stakes; the protagonist's passivity and the coincidental door-opening at midnight undercut any claim to ingenuity (derivative premise guardrail: −1.2).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer is present throughout but makes no choice that creates a turn. She receives, documents, follows, and finds—all passive verbs. The final hand-on-door gesture is observation, not decision. Missing middle development and closure participation as an agent; introduced early but never shapes outcome.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The confidence man's watch appears in paragraphs 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 across distinct beats: pressed to chest (embodied anchor), hands spinning backward (constraint), guiding through aisles, growing warm, and serving as reflective surface for the door. It enables the final approach and carries reweighted meaning (timepiece → key). However, it solves a problem it did not help create (the door's invisibility), capping at mid-6s despite strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The unfolding cipher is declared in the first letter and echoed thematically ("propagation delays," "cyclically reversed nature") but never dramatizes mechanics that change her options on the page. She does not decode, test, or struggle with it; the cipher "unfolds" offstage. Present across paragraphs but ornamental—swappable with "mystery" or "secret" without structural loss. Missing middle development and closure participation as active stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Cyclically reversed" appears as label in paragraph 5 ("the cyclically reversed nature of the unfolding cipher") and implied by the watch's backward-spinning hands in paragraph 4. No on-page action is constrained or enabled by this trait; it remains atmospheric description. Missing middle development and closure participation; introduced mid-story and purely decorative.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Document" appears in paragraphs 3, 4, 5, and 8: she documents in her journal, notes the watch's reversal "with scientific precision," documents phenomena, and the final line mentions "document the infinite." However, the act of documentation never alters her tactics or stakes—she finds the library regardless of what she writes. Present across beats but functionally inert; easily swappable with "observe" or "record" without changing outcome.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Through propagation delays" is mentioned once in paragraph 4 as abstract explanation ("propagation delays between understanding and revelation were part of the cipher itself") without mechanics. It does not shape her attempts or choices; she simply follows the watch. Missing setup, middle development, and closure participation. Ornamental thematic claim only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The glowing library in mist anchors paragraphs 3–7 with vivid detail: luminescence responding to presence, mist between shelves, humming volumes. The untitled books and door visible only through the watch constrain her final approach (closure linkage). However, the setting never forces a trade-off or alters her tactics under pressure—it accommodates rather than resists. Early signal, middle presence, and closure participation present, earning mid-5s despite passivity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The timeframe between two letters brackets the story (first letter at dawn, second at midnight) and the watch's backward spin marks passage. However, time never tightens her decisions—she has until midnight and arrives exactly on cue with no urgency forcing trade-offs. The deadline is met by coincidence, not tactical adjustment. Present in setup and closure but does not constrain middle choices, capping below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation to find the library of unspoken words is declared early (paragraph 2: "she had spent her whole life searching for it") and shapes the quest structure through paragraphs 3–7, culminating in the discovered door. However, the desire is told via backstory rather than dramatized through on-page friction—no competing want or cost tests her commitment. Present across all three gates but friction-free, landing mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" (and variant "cautious exuberant") appears as label in paragraphs 3 and 8 but does not modulate with pressure—the tone remains uniformly mystical and abstract throughout. No shift between caution and exuberance charges the final image; the phrasing reads as forced authorial claim rather than emergent from the character's state. Label-only trait with no on-page embodiment or tonal arc.</comment>
