<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is established through her tuning work and silent communication, but internal contradiction is minimal—she moves through satisfaction without meaningful friction between wants. The final moment with Juniper offers wordless approval that settles rather than complicates her stance. Motivation is present but not tested by competing desires; the piece favors accumulative mood over character pressure. Embodied emotion appears in "felt the wordless approval settle into her shoulders," though most emotional content remains abstract or labeled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece opens with clear anchors (who, where, when by the second paragraph) and coheres around the sculpture's completion. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (satisfaction crystallized; "The fragment held its color") with conceptual cost implied through the years of labor and seasonal constraint, though the cost is more告知 than felt on this final page. The accumulative method—layering description, backstory, and thematic reflection—builds density, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the sculpture moves, Juniper approves, Elara is satisfied. One modest micro turn (Juniper's arrival shifts the scene's emotional register slightly) does not alter options or stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Whispering Bluff is vividly anchored with sensory specificity: "wind pressed against the rocks and returned transformed," "clouds drifted past like thoughts," iceberg fragment "blue as preserved midnight." The fragment itself functions as micro-setting, constraining the sculpture's design and charging the final image with its preserved color. Spatial choreography is clean; the bluff, the sculpture, and Juniper's arrival are legibly staged. Sensory detail is consistent and filtered through Elara's priorities as a tuner, though the piece leans heavily on visual metaphor and occasionally drifts into abstraction ("quality of attention in their gaze").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the fragment's color and completing the sculpture—is signaled early but never meaningfully tested. No reversal or complication appears; Elara finishes the work, Juniper approves, satisfaction follows. The piece accumulates atmosphere but offers no escalation, no tightening of options, no cost legible on this page beyond the abstract "decades of listening." Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening or cadence shift is expected; here the final paragraph restates the opening's mood without reweighting it. Agency is present in the act of tuning, but no path is foreclosed with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—truth as convergence, silence as fullness—emerges organically from the sculpture's design and the post-language world. The iceberg fragment's preserved color anchors the thematic concern with wonder and impermanence. Subtext operates in the wordless exchange with Juniper and the sculptures as "gathering places where silent languages could become audible." However, the final paragraph over-articulates the theme ("truth could be heard directly, through the bell of the heart") rather than trusting the prior images, and "everything that mattered was already being said" edges toward a stated moral. The piece resists full didacticism but does not trust its own silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-limited throughout; no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a distinct, lyric-leaning texture with elevated diction ("blue as preserved midnight," "silence not a lack but a fullness") that fits the reflective, post-verbal world. Psychic distance is consistent, and perceptual filtering reflects Elara's tuner background. However, the prose occasionally drifts into expository interiority ("she understood that her motivation had been fulfilled") and the final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the thematic payoff. Free indirect style is clean when used; filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is consistent with the lyric mode, though density of metaphor in every paragraph ("captive star," "thoughts that had forgotten their owners," "bell of the heart") risks overwriting without clear payoff. Minor paraphrase loops: "words had long since become unnecessary" / "words were for winter" / "words had become unnecessary" restates the premise three times. Sentence openings vary, and no egregious template cadence appears. The final paragraph's summary mode ("For now, she was satisfied") lowers propulsion and restates rather than advances. No line-level opacity, but information density could be higher; some sentences do one job when two are needed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—post-verbal world, kinetic sculpture, seasonally mute tuner—offers fresh synthesis and the iceberg fragment is a memorable anchor. However, the execution leans on familiar lyric-fantasy tropes: mountaintop hermit, mystical silence, art-as-truth metaphor. The emotional arc (satisfaction achieved without complication) is generic; removing Elara's name and the bluff's location would not fundamentally alter the structure or feeling. The "Great Quieting" and winter-speech constraint are intriguing but underused; no on-page friction tests them. Specificity in the fragment and sculpture design elevates, but the transformation test suggests the core is replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her past as a bell tuner frames her method, but she makes no key choice on this page—she finishes a sculpture already in progress and receives approval. Her observation and tuning work are described, yet no decision alters tactics or options. Mentioned early, functionally present in two beats (tuning the sculpture, receiving Juniper's nod), but passive within the scene. Falls short of causal necessity; the character serves the atmosphere more than driving turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The iceberg fragment appears in three distinct beats: carried up the mountain (backstory anchor), sits at the sculpture's heart (present construction), and "glistened with a light" in the final image. It provides depth against which "every other tone could find its place" and Elara's motivation centers on preserving its color. The fragment's specific property—compressed years, blue hue—shapes the sculpture's design and charges the closure. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff; irreplaceable within the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" is articulated as "truth was not a single note but a convergence" and echoed in the final paragraph's "symphony of truth...an agreement." The concept frames the thematic layer and explains the sculpture's design principle, but it does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics. Elara's work already embodies the concept before the scene opens; no friction tests it. Functional but ornamental—mentioned, explained, restated, yet swappable with another artistic philosophy without breaking the plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Seasonally mute is established early ("spoke only in winter...nine months of the year...seasonally mute") and constrains the present interaction: "They did not speak—words were for winter." The trait enables the wordless approval scene with Juniper and shapes the piece's post-verbal world. It costs Elara immediate verbal exchange but is not tested under pressure or traded off within this window. Present in setup and visibly operative in the middle beat; no closure participation. Solid mid-range integration with one clear constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Glisten" appears twice: the fragment "would glisten and turn" when wind enters the chambers, and in the final image it "glistened with a light that seemed to come from somewhere deeper than the sun." The action signals the sculpture's responsiveness and charges the ending, but it is passive (the fragment glistens when acted upon by wind/light) rather than a protagonist-driven turn. Lyric reprise reweights the image, yet the action itself could be replaced with "shimmer" or "glow" with minimal edits. Mid-high for resonance, capped by swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kinetic sculpture is signaled in the second paragraph ("Her method was kinetic sculpture, living mechanisms") and its mechanics matter: "moved in response to the smallest pressures of air and light," bronze arms rotating, glass catching sunset. The method shapes multiple beats—construction, the sculpture's movement, and the final image. However, the sculpture could be static with minor rewrites (a painted image, a carved form); the kinetic property adds texture but does not drive a turn or constrain a choice under pressure. Strong thematic fit, moderate causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Whispering Bluff is established in the opening sentence, named for "the way the wind pressed against the rocks and returned transformed." The wind's pressure directly enables the sculpture's movement in two beats and the bluff's edge positions the mobile "where the clouds drifted past." The setting is not mere backdrop; it supplies the kinetic input and atmospheric condition that make the sculpture function. Setup, development (wind activates the sculpture), and payoff (final image on the bluff) all present. Strong integration with causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" is established in the opening and restated throughout ("that was before the Great Quieting," "words were for winter," "valleys...where words had become unnecessary"). The timeframe provides thematic context and explains the silence, but it does not tighten a decision or alter tactics within this single scene. No live clock; no pressure that this moment occurs post-language rather than during. Setup clear, but no development or payoff beyond atmospheric color. Introduced early yet functionally replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Preserving the color of wonder is articulated explicitly: "her motivation had been fulfilled again: to preserve that particular shade of blue...the hue that made people remember they were small and temporary and therefore precious." The motivation frames Elara's satisfaction and is tied to the fragment's color in the final image. However, it is told rather than dramatized through a choice with friction; no competing want tests it. Setup and payoff present, modest development (tuning to preserve the color), but the desire is stated rather than enacted under pressure. Mid-range for thematic fit, capped by lack of dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Muted vigor is legible in the prose's elevated, restrained lyricism and the quiet, purposeful action (tuning, observing, wordless approval). Tone is consistent across beats and modulates slightly when Juniper arrives, adding warmth without breaking the contemplative register. The final image maintains the muted quality while asserting satisfaction and ongoing conversation with the sky. Coherent throughout, though the tone never intensifies or shifts under pressure since no pressure appears. Solid tonal control with no closure charge.</comment>
