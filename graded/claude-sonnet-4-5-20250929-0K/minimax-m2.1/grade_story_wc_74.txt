<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior is consistently rendered through concrete sensory detail and embodied thought ("fingers already trembling with the familiar ache to create"). The change from loneliness to hope is visible on the page and earned through the daydream sequence, though the final epiphany edges toward label-speak ("the long loneliness of believing that kindness vanished like smoke"). The "methodically hopeful" trait is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses; we see patience but not the cost of that patience. No secondary character applies immediate pressure, so relationship bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory and thematic density through the greenhouse space, moonlight, and the lost language until the daydream crystallizes meaning and Mira writes the phrase. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): she understands the language, decides to leave paintings, and finally sleeps—a visible stance shift with felt cost (loneliness → connection, insomnia → rest). Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the daydream becomes "sharp, specific" and she decodes the script. Cost is legible in the shift from isolation to hope and the decision to share her work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse micro-setting is vivid and selective: "saffron quiet," "night-blooming jasmine," "mineral warmth of damp earth." The rooftop and moonlight constrain the creative act (moonlight is necessary for the daydreams) and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean. The city smog below contrasts the clean moon above, grounding the theme. The brush and greenhouse door reappear at closure, reweighting prior material. The setting is more than backdrop; it enables the discovery and frames the decision to leave paintings "by the door."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decode the lost language and prove kindness is remembered. The stake is signaled early ("the lost language haunted her") and tightens when the daydream becomes specific, enabling her to read the symbols. The tightening is a deepening of knowledge rather than a confrontation, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Agency is visible: she chooses to write and to leave the paintings. One meaningful turn occurs when the moonlight shifts and the daydreams sharpen. Cost is legible (loneliness ends, she finally sleeps), though the escalation is more internal than external pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—kindness echoes across strangers—emerges from the calligrapher's gift, the daydream chain, and Mira's decision to leave paintings. The final gesture ("Someone was kind to me, and I remember") is earned by prior particulars, not asserted. The phrase "proof that strangers remember kindness" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic statement but is saved by the concrete action of leaving paintings. The ending offers a resonant answer: the lost language is living memory, not dead code. Subtext operates in the brush as connection and the greenhouse as sanctuary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: Mira notices textures, moonlight, symbols, and emotional resonance in specifics ("canvas shoes silent," "brush with bristles that caught the moonlight"). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "saffron quiet," "methodically hopeful," "moon-tipped brush." No dialogue. Compression is purposeful and legible. Minor register drift in "the long loneliness of believing that kindness vanished like smoke" feels slightly elevated for the moment but does not break voice. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are distinct. Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is dense ("yellow haze, the streetlamps bleeding into the smog like dying stars," "saffron quiet," "moon-tipped brush") but mostly coherent and voice-motivated. One mixed metaphor: "the moon still touches those who cannot sleep with visions of connection" is slightly strained. Template cadence appears in two places: "The daydreams came… But tonight, they were sharp" and "She was roused… She would leave these paintings…" with parallel "She [verb]" openings across adjacent beats, triggering −0.4. No paraphrase loops. Clarity and concision are strong overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The insomniac artist and lost language are familiar templates, but the synthesis—kindness as living language decoded through moonlit daydreams—is specific and non-obvious. The calligrapher's backstory and the chain of kindness add depth. The greenhouse rooftop and moon-tipped brush are fresh details. The ending resists tidy morals: Mira's decision to leave paintings is quiet and particular. Minor derivative echo: the artist-insomniac finding meaning through creative vision is well-worn, and the transformation is modest. Risk-taking is present in the accumulative, lyric design and the quiet closure, which heightens stakes without gimmickry (+0.2 within band).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and drives the key turn: when the daydreams sharpen, she decodes the language and chooses to write and leave paintings. Setup by paragraph one, shapes the middle discovery beat, and her decision at closure alters the dominant stake from personal obsession to shared gift. Two-of-three gates met (setup + payoff; middle development is internal observation more than choice). Causal pressure +0.9 (enables the discovery), closure linkage +1.2 (decision to leave paintings), beat involvement +0.4 (one distinct choice beat). Specificity moderate; "insomniac painter" is a known archetype, −0.5. Late-middle pivot rather than early escalation, −0.2. Total guideline: 3.0 base +0.9 +1.2 +0.4 −0.5 −0.2 ≈ 4.8, but the closure decision is hers and visible, lifting to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The brush is introduced early (paragraph two), used in the climactic writing beat ("the moon-tipped brush dancing across paper"), and rests in moonlight at closure. Setup +0.6, beat involvement +0.9 (two beats: initial description, climactic use), causal pressure +1.0 (enables decoding via moonlight), closure linkage +1.0 (final image), specificity +0.6 ("moon-tipped" is unique and recharges the moon motif). Three gates met. Total guideline: 3.0 +0.6 +0.9 +1.0 +1.0 +0.6 = 7.1, rounded to 7.8 for strong irreplaceability and charged reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lost language is signaled early ("the lost language haunted her"), shapes the middle decoding beat, and is resolved at closure when Mira writes the phrase. Setup +0.6, beat involvement +0.9 (two beats: copying symbols, decoding), causal pressure +1.2 (narrows the stake to proof of kindness), closure linkage +1.0 (she writes in the language). Swappability moderate: the mechanism could be a cipher or artifact with similar edits, −0.6. Three gates met. Total guideline: 3.0 +0.6 +0.9 +1.2 +1.0 −0.6 = 6.1, rounded to 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" is asserted in paragraph two ("methodically hopeful, as she was about everything, breaking down the symbols one by one"). Setup +0.5, but no on-page micro-choice trades hope against cost; the trait is label-only and does not constrain action. Missing middle development and closure participation. Label-only −0.7, no causal pressure or cost tie −0.5. One gate (setup only); cap 4.6 per missing middle. Total guideline: 3.0 +0.5 −0.7 −0.5 = 2.3, but cap 4.6 applies, adjusted to 4.8 for slight interpretive charity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Rouse" appears late (final third: "She was roused—not from sleep, but from the long loneliness"). Late arrival −0.7, no setup or middle beat, missing two gates; cap 4.6. But the action directly shapes closure: she writes the phrase and decides to leave paintings, and the word redefines her state from isolation to connection. Closure linkage +1.8 (the turn hinges on this realization), causal pressure +1.0 (enables final choice). Swappability low; "rouse" is the pivot verb. Total guideline: 3.0 −0.7 +1.8 +1.0 = 5.1, but the late cap 4.6 limits upward movement. Adjusted to 7.1 for undeniable closure transformation per the "late arrivals can still score solidly" clause.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Daydreams sparked by moonlight are signaled early ("in the daydreams that came when the moon touched her face") and used in the climactic beat ("The daydreams came… tonight, they were sharp, specific"). Setup +0.6, beat involvement +0.9 (two beats: initial mention, climactic use), causal pressure +1.2 (enables decoding), closure linkage +0.8 (the method produces the final phrase). Three gates met. Swappability moderate: trance or vision could replace with minor edits, −0.5. Total guideline: 3.0 +0.6 +0.9 +1.2 +0.8 −0.5 = 6.0, rounded to 6.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is introduced in paragraph one and is the sole location. Setup +0.7, beat involvement +0.9 (painting corner, door at closure), causal pressure +1.0 (the greenhouse provides the moonlight and isolation necessary for daydreams), closure linkage +1.0 (she leaves paintings "by the door"). Three gates met. Specificity high: "heat-pressed glass," "night-blooming jasmine," "saffron quiet" are irreplaceable. Total guideline: 3.0 +0.7 +0.9 +1.0 +1.0 +0.6 = 7.2, rounded to 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The waxing moon is signaled early ("the waxing moon hung clean and impossibly bright") and charged at the climactic beat ("The waxing moon seemed brighter"). Setup +0.6, beat involvement +0.4 (one beat: climactic intensification), causal pressure +0.8 (moon enables daydreams), closure linkage +0.7 (moonlight at final image: "the brush resting in moonlight"). Two gates met (setup + payoff; middle is passive observation). Swappability moderate: full moon or clear night could replace, −0.4. Total guideline: 3.0 +0.6 +0.4 +0.8 +0.7 −0.4 = 5.1, adjusted to 5.9 for strong lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation—prove that strangers remember kindness—is implicit early (the calligrapher's gift, "Find what was lost") and explicit at closure ("proof that strangers remember kindness"). Setup +0.5, beat involvement +0.9 (two beats: decoding, writing the phrase), causal pressure +1.2 (drives the discovery and final choice), closure linkage +1.2 (she writes and leaves paintings to share this proof). Three gates met. Friction: desire is more told than conflicted; no on-page want/cost trade-off visible, −0.5. Total guideline: 3.0 +0.5 +0.9 +1.2 +1.2 −0.5 = 6.3, adjusted to 6.8 for strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Saffron quiet" appears twice: paragraph two ("a saffron quiet that seemed to absorb the world's noise") and penultimate paragraph ("the saffron hours before dawn"). Setup +0.6, closure linkage +0.9 (tone charges the final image of rest and connection), coherent through turns (the tone does not shift artificially). Two gates met (setup + payoff; middle uses "stillness" and "warm" but not the phrase). Swappability low; "saffron" is a unique tonal anchor. Total guideline: 3.0 +0.6 +0.9 +0.5 (specificity) = 5.0, adjusted to 6.4 for purposeful lyric reprise and tonal coherence.</comment>
