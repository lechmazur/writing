<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and her skills are established, but her interior life remains flat—choices feel procedural rather than agonized. The "cautiously hopeful" label appears as assertion rather than embodied contradiction. Her technical competence never faces genuine struggle; she calculates counter-frequencies without error or cost, undermining the premise that she's improvising against ancient beings. The final stance ("cautious hope transformed into something steadier") tells rather than shows stakes internalized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with moderate linkage: tricksters broadcast subsonic waves → Maya decodes the pattern → she engineers counter-frequencies → tensions ease. Closure arrives on-page (she disrupts the manipulation and "had won this round"), but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture, relationship sacrifice, or tactical price paid in the ending image. The orientation is prompt (university radio station, protests bleeding through walls) and causality holds, but the decisive change lacks felt weight because Maya's victory is narrated as complete rather than charged with lingering threat or personal toll.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The radio station is anchored early (soundproofed booth, ancient equipment, transmission array) and the astronomical charts return at key beats, qualifying as micro-setting. The charts constrain her method (she spreads them, calculates in their margins) and charge the final sequence ("trembled slightly on their hooks"). However, spatial choreography is thin—no tactile handling of dials, no sweat on the console, no embodied interaction with the equipment during the climactic counter-broadcast. The setting pressures her intellectually but not physically.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stop the tricksters' manipulation) is signaled early and pressure tightens once when Maya realizes the interference pattern and decides to act. The counter-broadcast is a meaningful escalation, but coincidence plays a role—she happens to possess the exact charts and training needed, and her solution works on the first attempt without tactical adaptation or visible cost. The protests softening is shown on-page, but Maya herself pays no price; no friendship lost, no equipment damaged, no personal vulnerability exposed. Agency exists but the tradeoff is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (entities manipulate through amplification; individuals can resist by speaking their language back) emerges from the premise but remains overstated. The final paragraph moralizes: "The cosmos was full of entities who wished to play games with mortal minds, but it was also full of those willing to stand in their way." This thesis statement replaces earned resonance. The astronomical charts and subsonic frequencies offer potential motifs, but they don't shift meaning between opening and close—they remain tools, not images reweighted by cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maya, and the narrative distance is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("liminal space between perception and emotion," "ethereal grit of her situation settled into her bones like a second skeleton") that reads more authorial than character-specific. No dialogue is present to test voice distinction. Perceptual signature is weak—Maya notices in generic technical terms rather than with a celestial interpreter's particular bias. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she realized") appear frequently but don't obscure immediacy enough to penalize heavily.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clarity is adequate and no major loops appear, but several lines restate without adding pressure: "The community divide spreading across campus was not organic—it was engineered, harvested, a crop of chaos being cultivated" cycles through three synonyms for the same idea. Template cadence surfaces in paragraph four: "She understood now... The protests, the polarized student councils, the fractured friendships: all of it could be traced back..." Figurative language clusters in paragraph five ("ethereal grit... settled into her bones like a second skeleton," "margins of charts that had never been designed for this purpose") without clear payoff. Sentence rhythm varies adequately but information density sags in expository middle paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Premise (celestial signal interpreter detects subsonic manipulation by cosmic tricksters, counters it via harmonic resonance) is high-concept but closely echoes familiar templates: lone expert with specialized training defeats ancient threat through technical mastery. The execution offers no fresh inflection—Maya's counter-broadcast works perfectly on the first try, and the tricksters never adapt or surprise. The astronomical charts and subsonic frequencies are functionally interchangeable with other mystical/technical MacGuffins. No bold risk or transformation of the core materials is evident.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout and makes the key decision to initiate the counter-broadcast, which drives the climax. However, her choices feel procedural rather than agonized—she calculates, adjusts, and transmits without genuine error or tactical pivot. She is signaled early (opening line), involved in all major beats (decoding, calculating, broadcasting), and shapes the ending, but her agency lacks visible cost or contradiction that would elevate integration beyond functional necessity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The astronomical charts appear in three distinct beats: pulled down and spread (paragraph 2), used for margin calculations (paragraph 5), and trembling during the counter-broadcast (paragraph 6). They enable her tactic (mapping harmonic resonances) and charge the final sequence with physical presence. Their specificity (not generic notes but charts mapping "harmonic resonances that connected terrestrial broadcasts to the deeper rhythms of the cosmos") makes them less swappable. Strong closure linkage and multi-beat involvement push this above functional into essential territory, though the charts' mechanics remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Power plays" as a concept is present implicitly (tricksters manipulate, Maya outwits them by turning their method against them), but it never shapes on-page tactics or creates a visible tradeoff. The story treats the power dynamic as intellectual rather than forcing Maya to sacrifice or risk something to gain leverage. The concept echoes thematically in the climax ("outwitting beings who had manipulated civilizations for millennia") but doesn't constrain her choices—she simply succeeds. Mid-band: functional but replaceable with "hidden threat" or "ancient manipulation" without altering structure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" is mentioned twice as a label (paragraph 3: "She felt cautiously hopeful despite the magnitude"; paragraph 8: "her cautious hope transformed into something steadier") but never constrains a choice or creates visible cost. It does not prevent Maya from taking bold action, nor does it force her to hedge or compromise. The attribute is told rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. Present but ornamental; no causal pressure or tradeoff tied to this trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Interfere" structures the entire climax: Maya interferes with the tricksters' interference by broadcasting counter-frequencies. The action is signaled early (title hint, paragraph 4: "someone was interfering with the station's signal"), drives the middle turn (she decides to reverse the pattern), and defines the ending (counter-broadcast initiated, tensions ease). Removing this action would collapse the resolution. The specificity (interference via frequency manipulation rather than physical confrontation) is integral. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, with one beat of tactical application (calculating the counter-pattern).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies are signaled early (paragraph 1: "subsonic waves riding beneath the normal broadcast"), explained mechanically in paragraph 3 (they "bypass conscious thought entirely, seeping into the liminal space between perception and emotion"), and used as Maya's method in the climax (paragraph 6: counter-frequencies "designed to resonate with the harmonic signatures the tricksters themselves used"). The means shapes her approach (she can't confront the tricksters directly; she must speak their language) and charges the ending. However, the mechanics remain abstract—no tactile adjustment of dials or failed attempts that would demonstrate cost. Essential across beats but lacking embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The university radio station is established in the opening line and provides resources (equipment, transmission array) that enable Maya's solution. It pressures her indirectly (protests bleed through the walls, creating urgency) and the soundproofed booth offers tactical advantage. However, the station itself is generic—no specific quirk of the ancient equipment matters, no spatial constraint forces a tradeoff. It could be swapped for "observatory" or "signal monitoring lab" with minor edits. Functional but mid-swappable; one causal beat (she uses the station's array to broadcast) and minimal closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"As the community divides" frames the urgency (protests intensify, student body fractures) but the timeframe itself is loose—no ticking clock, no specific deadline that forces Maya to act hastily or sacrifice precision. She "worked through the night" and by "afternoon" tensions ease, but these markers are scenic rather than pressuring. The dividing community is backdrop motivation, not a temporal constraint that alters her tactics. Introduced early but does not tighten decisions; mid-low functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The desire to outwit the cosmic tricksters is stated explicitly (paragraph 6: "outwitting beings who had manipulated civilizations for millennia") and drives the counter-broadcast tactic. Maya's motivation is clear and shapes her method (she must use their own language of manipulation), but it is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—she never weighs personal safety against success, never sacrifices a relationship to pursue the goal. The motivation is functional and causal but lacks embodied friction or tradeoff. Involved in the ending but told more than shown.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" as tone appears once as a label in paragraph 5 ("The ethereal grit of her situation settled into her bones") but is not sustained through diction, rhythm, or image. The prose alternates between technical exposition and elevated metaphor without a coherent tonal signature that marries the mystical (cosmic tricksters, harmonic resonances) with the gritty (struggle, cost, embodied stakes). The ending softens into hopeful reflection rather than charging the image with both elements. Mentioned but not enacted; mid-low functional.</comment>
