<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kalia's internal arc from ambition to serenity is tracked through concrete actions (tending the flower, journaling, breathing through aversion), and her final harvest demonstrates earned transformation. However, the interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("particular hush that wildflowers keep," "undercurrent of wisdom") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The climactic realization—"transforming, breaking itself down"—arrives as epiphany rather than through dramatized micro-choices that force competing values into collision. The cost of her shift feels conceptual but not viscerally tested on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece holds a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: Kalia's three-month tending accumulates pressure through repeated exposure to the flower's developing scent, and the bloom provides a Resonant Reconfiguration (her ambition reorganizes into "something truer") with conceptual cost legible in the final image. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (treetop village, healing house, Elder Sholomi). The escalation is primarily durational rather than causal—weeks pass with incremental discoveries—but the closure image (wildflower from spiral) reweights the opening "hush before bloom" motif with felt pressure. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length, though the middle months compress into summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mosshaven's treetop setting constrains Kalia's work (hanging gardens, greenhouse for the corpse flower) and the olfactory environment pressures her sensitive nose throughout. The corpse flower itself functions as micro-setting, its evolving scent forcing her to "breathe through aversion" in concrete ways. Sensory hierarchy is strong: smell dominates perception, filtered through her herbalist training. Spatial choreography remains clear across locations (platform, healing house, greenhouse). The setting charges the closure by providing the physical greenhouse space where transformation occurs, though the "mysterious" village remains somewhat generic beyond its verticality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—is signaled early and tightens once through the corpse flower's bloom, which forces Kalia to endure rather than flee. Her agency appears in the decision to "breathe through aversion rather than fight it," and the harvest at closure demonstrates earned capacity. However, the escalation is durational (three months) rather than beat-driven with reversals; the flower simply grows while Kalia journals. The cost is conceptual (ambition reorganized) but not a visible forfeiture of a live option on the page. One meaningful deepening satisfies this length under the Accumulative lens, but the middle lacks tactical shifts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the corpse flower's dual nature (decay/transformation) and the spiral-doodle motif that recurs from mother's gift to Kalia's final journal entry, reweighting "patience blooms in strange soil" without explicit moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the wildflower-from-spiral image answers the opening "hush before bloom" with earned stillness. Subtext operates in Elder Sholomi's cryptic instruction and the flower's teaching beneath its stench. However, the line "Some wisdom must first be endured to be understood" borders on thematic echo, articulating what the image already conveys. The piece resists easy moral but could trust its particulars more fully.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Kalia; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during sensory overwhelm, slightly elevated during reflection). Perceptual signature is herbalist-olfactory: "elderflower sap," "undercurrent of wisdom," "purple-black like a bruise healing." Dialogue with Sholomi carries subtext ("turning of the tide's thought") without over-explaining. The prose texture is lyric-leaning with purposeful compression ("serenity within motion"), though some diction stretches plausibility for a young herbalist under pressure ("olfactorily sensitive nature transformed from burden to gift" reads slightly elevated). Elder Sholomi's speech is distinct but brief. Internal voice remains coherent across emotional shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but overwriting appears in clusters: "the particular hush that wildflowers keep before their first bloom" and "undercurrent of wisdom so profound" layer metaphor without added clarity. The phrase "olfactorily sensitive" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment. The doodle-wrapping custom is introduced with exposition that stalls momentum ("her mother had explained that these spontaneous drawings were a family custom…"). Paraphrase loops: "her ambition reorganize itself into something truer" echoes earlier "ambition had always pushed her forward" without new pressure. Template cadence appears in the gift-unwrapping passage. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull several mid-story beats. No loops touch the closure harvest moment directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The corpse-flower-as-mentor setup is familiar from cultivation/apprenticeship templates, and the story does not transform it through unexpected moral calculus or world logic—the arc proceeds predictably from assignment to bloom to insight. The doodle-wrapping custom offers a specific family ritual, but its mechanics (spirals as emotional map) remain ornamental rather than driving a key turn. The treetop village and "tide's thought" idiom provide texture but don't alter expected stakes. Emotional specificity is present (breathing through aversion) but the journey from ambition to serenity follows a well-worn path. The synthesis feels competent rather than fresh; swapping herbalist for another craft would leave the arc intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kalia makes the choice to tend the flower (accepting the assignment) and to harvest it carefully at closure, but the middle months involve observation and journaling rather than on-page decisions that narrow options. Her herbalist training shapes her perception (olfactory sensitivity) but does not create tactical friction. The character is functional across beats but her choices do not generate reversals; the flower's bloom is temporally inevitable. Present in setup, middle, and ending; one clear decision at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The corpse flower seed is handled in three beats: receipt from Sholomi (velvet pouch, "purple-black like a bruise"), tending across weeks (developing scent), and bloom/harvest at closure. Its unique property (overwhelming odor that teaches beneath decay) constrains Kalia's approach and enables the final insight. The seed's transformation mirrors the thematic arc and charges the ending image. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage present; irreplaceable due to its scent-teaching role. Not quite indispensable—another rare/challenging plant could substitute with edits—but deeply integrated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "undercurrent of wisdom" appears as a recurring phrase (air carries it, flower offers it) but functions more as thematic echo than stake-shaping constraint. It does not change Kalia's tactics on the page; she tends the flower regardless. The concept frames her realization at closure ("wisdom must first be endured") but this arrives as summary rather than altering a live choice. Present throughout but ornamental; swappable with "hidden truth" or "deeper knowledge." Lacks middle development that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Kalia's olfactory sensitivity is signaled early (catches scent-change immediately, "olfactorily sensitive nose") and constrains her middle struggle (developing scent "nearly drove her from the greenhouse"). At closure it enables the insight beneath the stench, transforming "burden to gift." The trait shapes two beats (arrival, bloom) with visible cost (near-flight) and participates in closure. However, it could be replaced by another sensory gift (tactile sensitivity, visual acuity) without breaking logic. Present in setup, middle, and ending; one clear cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Journaling appears in two beats: Kalia journals "her progress" during quiet hours and writes the final line after harvest. The doodles on wrapping paper map her emotional arc (circles, jagged lines, flowers) but do not alter her tactics—they document rather than drive. At closure journaling frames the final image but the act itself is static. The action is present and thematically coherent but swappable with another reflective practice (sketching, meditation log). Setup and closure participation; weak middle development.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The doodling custom is introduced via exposition in the gift-unwrapping scene (mother's spiral with "patience blooms in strange soil") and returns at closure when Kalia adds her own wildflower-spiral. It does not shape her tending process; the middle journals mention doodles but their mechanics (circles for imperceptible days, jagged lines for overwhelm) are told rather than shown constraining a choice. Present in setup and ending with thematic resonance, but no middle beat where the custom enables or restricts action. Lyric reprise without causal work; mid-band ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Mosshaven's treetop location is established early (rope ladder, landing platform, hanging gardens) and provides the greenhouse where Kalia tends the flower. The village's "mysterious" quality and Elder Sholomi's presence frame the assignment but do not pressure Kalia's choices—she could tend the flower in any isolated location. The setting supplies resources (greenhouse, rare specimens) without altering tactics. Present in setup and implicit throughout, but replaceable with another remote training site. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"At the turning of the tide's thought" appears twice: Elder Sholomi's greeting and the bloom moment three months later. The phrase is atmospheric but does not tighten decisions or impose a clock; Kalia waits for the flower's natural cycle without deadline pressure. Time passes in summary ("weeks," "three months") rather than tracking beats. The timeframe is present but ornamental, functioning as poetic idiom rather than constraint. Setup and closure mention; no middle development where time narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kalia's motivation to "cultivate serenity within motion" is signaled by Sholomi's assignment and dramatized through her struggle to breathe through aversion rather than flee. The desire conflicts with her prior ambition (always reaching forward) and the flower's stench creates friction. At closure her ambition "reorganizes" into stillness. The motivation shapes two beats (assignment, bloom) with visible cost (enduring repulsion) and participates in the ending. However, the friction is durational rather than forcing a sharp choice between competing goods. Setup, middle struggle, closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "wildflower hush" tone is established in the opening ("particular hush that wildflowers keep before their first bloom") and sustained through lyric diction, quiet progression, and the final wildflower-from-spiral image. The tone modulates slightly during the flower's bloom (overwhelm) but returns to stillness at harvest. It charges the closure by framing Kalia's earned serenity. However, the tone remains somewhat static—a single contemplative register—rather than tensioning with urgency. Coherent through turns; purposeful reprise at ending; lyric mode fits the accumulative design.</comment>
