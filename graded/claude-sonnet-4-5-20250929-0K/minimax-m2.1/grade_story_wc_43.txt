<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's serene acceptance of her diagnosis and decisive kindness read clearly, but her interior world relies heavily on elevated abstraction ("strange clarity," "architecture of grace") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The relationship with Margery shows gentle care but lacks friction that would force a costly micro-choice on the page. Margery's tea-colored eyes and acceptance are sketched but not tested; her grip and final line hint at depth without dramatizing conflicting impulses. The final mutual recognition feels tender but tidy, missing the messy ambivalence that would lift characterization into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly within the first third (Elara, hospice, post-diagnosis). The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara's work with Margery deepens through sensory ritual and the vinyl shard accrues meaning across beats, culminating in Margery's recognition and grip—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where both women acknowledge their shared trajectory. Cost is felt in Elara's sharpened mortality and Margery's isolation, though the cost remains more atmospheric than decisively forecloses a path. The closure lands on the page with coherence, but the final "finding their way home" phrase edges toward theme summary rather than pure image, and the cost could be more visibly tied to a specific forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The hospice's floor-to-ceiling windows, amber light, and "height above the city" establish a distinct radiant setting that mirrors the story's tone. The vinyl shard, coffee mug, and spoon function as micro-setting tools that constrain Elara's method and charge the final image when the shard catches light "like a small golden moon." Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's calm professionalism. However, the "radiant haven above the clouds" phrase reads slightly stock, and spatial choreography within Room 412 remains general—no specifics about bed placement, window proximity, or Margery's reach that would further ground the final grip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara executing a flawless goodbye for Margery while reckoning with her own mortality—is signaled early and deepens through the ritual beats. Pressure accumulates via Elara's method and Margery's gradual response, culminating in the wrist grip and mutual acknowledgment: a meaningful tightening where both women's isolation is reconfigured. Agency lies in Elara's choice to continue her work with heightened intentionality. The cost is felt but oblique: Elara's finite weeks lend urgency, yet no on-page tactical choice visibly forecloses an alternate path (e.g., stopping work, seeking treatment, addressing her own grief). The closure reweights the stake through shared recognition rather than a hard trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the vinyl shard's transformation, the "sacred ordinary" motif, and the parallel journeys of caregiver and patient. The piece resists moralizing; "broken but still luminous, still singing if you held it just right" offers a resonant image that reweights the premise without stating a thesis. Subtext operates in Margery's "You're not just humming" and Elara's knowing smile. However, "architecture of grace," "reunify," and "pulsing stillness" edge toward prompt-label language that slightly dilutes organic emergence. The final "finding their way home through the architecture of ordinary sounds" tilts close to thematic summarization rather than letting the image alone carry weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization through Elara is stable and clean, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: Elara notices light, objects, and breath rhythms through her professional lens. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful; Margery's "You brought your junk drawer again" and "You're not just humming" carry subtext and advance the relational beat. Diction elevates at times ("hymning the mundane," "pulsing stillness") in ways that feel slightly imposed rather than fully character-particular under stress, though the elevated register remains legible and consistent. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates gently with the ritual's intensification.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmic, with strong images like the vinyl shard "catching the light" and Margery's "tea-colored eyes." However, several template cadences and scaffold phrases recur: "a small, sacred relic," "strange clarity," "architecture of grace," "pulsing stillness"—elevated abstractions that lean on stock metaphor strings rather than concrete, idiosyncratic detail. "The scent of hope hung in the room—not the aggressive hope that demanded 奇迹, but a softer kind" introduces a non-English character (奇迹 = miracle) that disrupts flow and reads as a generation artifact. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") cluster without always serving voice. Paraphrase loops appear: "broken but still be useful, still sing" and "broken but still luminous, still singing" restate within close proximity. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and artifact spread, and −0.3 for filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats (total −0.9 within Q7).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hospice music therapist premise and "hymning the mundane" method offer a warm, specific angle on end-of-life care. The vinyl shard as both broken instrument and metaphor is purposeful and particular. However, the core emotional arc—caregiver with terminal diagnosis tends dying patient, both find mutual recognition—follows a well-worn template without a non-obvious synthesis or transformation. The "radiant haven above the clouds" setting and "pulsing stillness" tone feel slightly generic, and the final "finding their way home" phrase echoes familiar language from hospice and palliative-care narratives. Fresh inflection is present in the object work and method specificity, but the overall frame does not transcend its template origins.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout, makes the decision to continue her work post-diagnosis, and her method shapes all three ritual beats. Her choice to call Margery's daughter (mentioned but off-page) and her on-page humming/object work drive the middle and ending. However, her agency lacks a costly on-page decision that visibly forecloses an alternate path—she continues her established role without dramatized friction. Setup early, involved in multiple beats, closure participation via the final exchange, but cost connection is atmospheric rather than tied to a specific forfeiture. Score: two gates + beat involvement + closure linkage, but swappability moderate (another caregiver archetype could slot in with edits) and cost indirect.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vinyl shard appears in at least three beats: Elara adjusts her pendant early, uses it as a tool mid-scene ("struck the spoon lightly"), and it catches light twice with reweighted meaning ("small golden moon, broken but still luminous"). The object's broken state mirrors theme and charges the final image. Setup early, beat involvement across beginning/middle/end, closure linkage strong, specificity high (crescent shape from grief, unique tool). Cost connection present (symbol of prior patient's death, reminder of usefulness after breaking). Slight swappability: another broken object could serve similar thematic work with some edits, keeping it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"The scent of hope" appears once as a described atmosphere mid-scene: "The scent of hope hung in the room—not the aggressive hope that demanded 奇迹, but a softer kind." It does not shape tactics, constrain choices, or return at closure. Ornamental use, no beat involvement beyond a single descriptive sentence, no closure participation. Setup signal weak (mid-scene), no causal pressure, no cost connection. Score: present but ornamental, functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Decisively kind" is labeled in the opening: "She was decisively kind by nature, but now that kindness felt like a choice she made with every breath." The trait informs Elara's gentle method and her decision to make the call to Margery's daughter, but it does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost—her kindness is consistent throughout without friction or tradeoff. Setup early, mentioned/implied across beats, but no specific on-page moment where kindness forces a costly choice. Lyric reprise weak; the trait remains static. Score: functional, one beat involvement, but swappable with "compassionate" or "caring" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reunify" is stated as Elara's purpose mid-scene: "to reunify. Not just Margery with her estranged daughter...to reunify Margery with the sacred ordinary." The off-page call to the daughter and the on-page ritual both trace to this action. However, the reunion is asserted rather than dramatized—we never see the daughter arrive or the reconciliation unfold. Setup mid-scene (not early), beat involvement in the ritual work and implied off-page call, closure participation indirect (the final mutual acknowledgment is a form of reunion). Causal pressure moderate, specificity moderate (could be "reconnect" or "reconcile"), cost connection indirect. Score: shapes two beats, closure linkage present but oblique.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Hymning the mundane" is signaled mid-scene when Elara opens her case of ordinary objects and the narration labels her "finding the sacred frequencies hidden in everyday things." The method is enacted across three beats: opening the case, striking spoon against mug, humming with the vinyl shard. It shapes Elara's attempts and the ritual's structure, and the final image recharges the mundane objects with meaning. Setup clear by ~35%, beat involvement strong, closure linkage via the vinyl shard's final appearance, specificity high (unique method, not easily swapped). Cost connection indirect (method itself does not carry felt cost). Score: all three gates, strong beat involvement, closure linkage, but cost tied to context rather than method itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Radiant haven above the clouds" is established early via "floor-to-ceiling windows," "amber and gold" light, and "from this height, the city below seemed distant." The setting provides a serene, elevated atmosphere that supports tone, but it does not constrain choices or supply resources that alter outcome. Elara could perform the same ritual in any quiet hospice room. Setup early, tone contribution strong, but no causal pressure or tactical impact. Postcard description without micro-setting function. Score: functional, one gate (setup), but replaceable and ornamental for stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the blood work comes back" frames Elara's mortality and sharpens her purpose ("weeks, perhaps months"), establishing urgency. The timeframe is stated at the opening and informs her "strange clarity" and "sharpened purpose," which then shapes her decision to continue working. However, no live on-page clock tightens decisions within the scene—the ritual unfolds at its own pace without time pressure. Setup early, beat involvement via Elara's heightened intentionality, closure linkage indirect (her mortality lends weight to the final mutual recognition). Causal pressure moderate, specificity moderate (recent diagnosis is common in hospice narratives). Score: two gates, functional but somewhat generic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To execute a flawless goodbye" is stated mid-scene: "this knowledge had sharpened her purpose to a single point." The desire informs Elara's ritual method and her off-page call to Margery's daughter, and the final mutual acknowledgment serves as a form of flawless goodbye. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—Elara's actions are gentle and professional throughout without visible friction between want and cost or conflicting impulses. Setup mid-scene (not early), beat involvement across ritual moves, closure participation via the final exchange. Causal pressure moderate, cost connection indirect (the "flawless" quality is asserted rather than tested). Score: two gates + beat involvement + closure linkage, but friction low.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Pulsing stillness" is named once in the final line and enacted throughout via rhythm, breath imagery, and Elara's controlled ritual. The tone is coherent across beats: "strange clarity," "gentle work," "warm water" humming, and Margery's "frantic flutter...settling into something almost peaceful." The tone modulates with Margery's response and charges the final image where "pulsing stillness...embraced them both." Setup early (enacted if not named), tone coherence strong, closure linkage direct. Specificity high (oxymoronic pairing, not easily replaced), cost connection indirect. Score: all three gates, strong coherence and closure charge, but cost tied to context rather than tone itself.</comment>
