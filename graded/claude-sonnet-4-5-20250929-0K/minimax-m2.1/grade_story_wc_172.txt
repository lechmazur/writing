<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clearly established through backstory—the memory of the dying bird—but her choices on the page remain limited to following a pre-determined plan (walking, kneeling, placing the egg). Interior life leans heavily on summary ("She had given up everything") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "amoral philanthropist" framing is told rather than tested through on-page choices with visible trade-offs. The final act of walking away without looking back reads as a prepared ritual rather than a decision that forecloses a path with felt cost in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece operates as a single sustained beat of ritual execution rather than a causally linked sequence; the protagonist arrives with a completed plan and enacts it. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the egg left alone on the salt flat crystallizes the central question of preservation versus futility—but the cost remains abstract (years of sacrifice summarized) rather than dramatized in the final image. Orientation is clean by paragraph two. The lens holds, but the lack of on-page tightening or reversal that changes her options keeps this from higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The salt flat is vividly rendered with purpose-driven detail (cracks as a map, synthetic warmth of the container, translucent veins in the egg). Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's professional focus on environmental engineering. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the salt flat enables the action but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page. The egg's placement "where the afternoon sun would warm its shell" shows environmental use, lifting this above pure description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the echo of an extinct species—is clear and signaled early, but all pressure is retrospective (manufactured drought, diverted rivers, years of work). On the page, the protagonist executes a rehearsed plan with no reversal, complication, or tightening that forces a trade-off. Thunder returns as a time cue but does not alter her action. The "fractured grace" of her undertaking is asserted rather than tested. Agency reads as completion of a prior design, not a choice under fire that narrows options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—preservation, playing god, the cost of obsession—emerges from concrete particulars (the egg's translucent shell, the dried riverbeds, the silent bird). The final image of the egg alone on the salt flat offers resonance without moralizing. However, lines like "fractured grace of her undertaking" and "simply driven" veer toward thematic self-annotation. The piece invites reflection on the ethics of resurrection, but the lack of on-page conflict between her values weakens the thematic charge at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with controlled distance. The voice carries a clinical, mission-driven texture that fits the protagonist's engineer mindset ("precise coordinate," "synthetic warmth," "calculus in her eyes"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("pregnant quiet," "fractured grace") that feels imposed rather than filtered through her practical focus. Filter verbs ("feeling the last warmth fade") are sparse and voice-motivated. The perceptual signature—emphasis on measurement, timing, environmental systems—remains consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and strong verbs. However, several lines carry overwriting: "the salt flat stretched toward every horizon, a vast expanse of white that hurt her eyes and silenced her thoughts" stacks description, and "fractured grace" reads as ornamental. Template cadence in the backstory block ("She had chosen... She had given up... She had been there") flattens rhythm. The final beat avoids loops and closes with a clear image. Information density is moderate; some sentences ("They were both right") add flavor without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—amoral philanthropist engineering drought to create sanctuary for resurrection—offers a fresh synthesis of eco-thriller and obsession narrative. However, the execution leans on familiar beats: the lone scientist, the last egg, the sacrificial walk away. "Amoral philanthropist" and "secretly sentimental" read as crafted contradictions rather than lived complexity. The manufactured drought remains asserted backstory rather than a choice tested on the page. Transformation test: the emotional arc (obsessive scientist releases fragile hope) works unchanged with different names and objects.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "amoral philanthropist" appears in setup (paragraph two) and is present at closure, but her amorality—diverting water, engineering drought—is summarized backstory rather than a choice enacted on the page. The walking away without looking back is framed as trust rather than moral calculation. Two-gate presence (setup, closure cameo) with no middle development caps at ~4.6; swappability (she could be any obsessive scientist) and summary-only integration lower to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The egg is present in setup (paragraph three), handled across multiple beats (lifted with trembling hands, placed on salt-crusted ground, described with translucent veins), and appears in the final image where it sits alone. Specificity is high (synthetic warmth, precise positioning for sun exposure). Causal pressure: the egg shapes her ritual movements and charges the closure image as the "last echo of a lost song." Irreplaceability is strong; the story logic depends on this exact fragile object. Three gates plus closure linkage and beat involvement push this into the 7–8 range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Manufactured drought is introduced in paragraph two and mentioned again in paragraph five as creating "a sterile sanctuary," but it remains summary backstory rather than a tactic dramatized on the page. It shapes stakes conceptually (eliminating predators) but does not alter her on-page choices or narrow options. Setup presence and thematic linkage qualify as functional, but the absence of middle development and closure participation caps at ~4.6; swappability (any environmental manipulation could serve the same purpose) lowers further.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Secretly sentimental" is signaled in paragraph four ("no one would guess it") and illustrated with the memory of holding the dying bird. It informs her motivation but does not constrain an on-page action or create a visible trade-off in the ritual. The trait is present in setup and closure framing ("trusting the environment she had so carefully crafted") but operates as characterization rather than a choice under pressure. Two-gate presence with label-only middle keeps this in the mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The release—placing the egg and walking away—is the story's final action and defines the closure beat. It is prepared throughout (timing, positioning, environmental crafting) and executes the dominant stake. However, it is not a reversal or tightening; it completes a rehearsed plan without altering her options in the moment. Closure linkage and beat involvement are strong, but the lack of causal pressure (no choice under fire) and swappability (any final act of trust would serve) keep this in the upper-6s rather than higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The map "drawn by cracks in dried riverbeds" appears in paragraph one as a navigational method ("she followed the pattern with practiced steps") and guides her to the coordinate. It is present in setup and enables one beat (the approach), but its mechanics do not constrain a choice or complicate tactics. The image is specific and atmospheric, but functionally swappable (satellite coordinates alone would suffice). Two-gate presence with one beat involvement places this at ~5.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The salt flat is established early (paragraph one), pressures choices through environmental conditions (afternoon sun for warmth, night cold for incubation cycles), and appears in the final image where the egg sits "alone on the salt flat." The setting enables her plan and charges the closure through its emptiness and sterility. Causal pressure is moderate (she chose it for its lack of predators), and closure linkage is clear. Three gates plus closure participation and specificity push this into the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "during the lull of distant thunder" is introduced in paragraph five ("timed her release for the lull between storm cells") and mentioned in the final paragraph ("thunder returning in the distance"). It cues urgency and timing but does not tighten her decision or alter tactics; she completes the action as planned. Two-gate presence (middle, closure) with thematic flavor but no causal pressure caps at ~4.6; decorative use and lack of specificity (the lull is vague) lower to upper-3s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation to "preserve the echo of extinct birds" is signaled early (paragraph one: "last egg of an extinct bird species"), dramatized through the memory of the dying bird (paragraph four), and animates the closure image ("the last echo of a lost song waiting to begin again"). It drives the entire action and shapes stakes, but on-page conflict between wants and costs is minimal—she follows a completed plan without hesitation. Three gates plus strong closure linkage and specificity place this in the upper-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Tone is signaled explicitly ("fractured grace of her undertaking") and reflected in the prose's balance of clinical precision ("precise coordinate," "synthetic warmth") and lyrical imagery ("light move across its surface like a promise"). The tone modulates slightly from detached ritual to charged closure, but the explicit naming ("fractured grace") is self-annotation rather than emergence. Coherence is solid, closure linkage present, but the reliance on direct statement and static mood through most beats keeps this in mid-5s.</comment>
