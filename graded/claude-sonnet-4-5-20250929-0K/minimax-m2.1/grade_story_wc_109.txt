<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The oracle's motivation is clearly established—drawing a map of endless night—but her interior life defaults to summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final peace "her mildly obsessed heart... finally found peace" reads as label-only emotional closure without embodied cost. Micro-choices are absent; she executes her task without visible friction or trade-off. The grandmother's teaching and pebble-shore backstory occupy substantial space but never tilt a present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (pebbles, gold leaves, silence, darkness) toward a final cadence shift. Orientation anchors arrive by the opening sentence (who, where, when). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis—the oracle completes her task and finds peace—but the cost is asserted ("her work began") rather than dramatized with a visible forfeiture or choice that forecloses a path. The final line gestures at continuation without showing what changes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ridge fort, storm, pebble shore, and gold booklet are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (flaking gold, gray fury, marbled hush). The booklet is handled across beats and its physical decay matters to mood. However, setting does not constrain a tactical choice—the oracle's action proceeds without spatial friction. The storm pauses conveniently for her work, reducing environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—completing the map before darkness claims the world—is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens would require density increase or cadence shift that reweights cost; instead the oracle moves smoothly from vigil to drawing without opposition or trade-off. The storm's pause removes external pressure at the key beat. No on-page reversal, tightening, or visible price paid (time, stamina, social credit) alters her tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—understanding silence, mapping darkness, trusting patient language over speech—emerges from particulars (pebbles, booklet diagrams, grandmother's lessons). The final image attempts non-literal resonance: "her work began" suggests the map's life beyond her, but this is told rather than shown through a charged visual or action. The piece resists moralizing but also defaults to thematic echo ("by allowing the silence to speak for her") in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent elevated register ("ambered hush," "marbled hush," "topology of shadow") that coheres as voice but approaches uniformity—nearly every sentence deploys figurative language without variation in pressure. Psychic distance is controlled. The oracle's perceptual signature (obsession with horizon, reading stones) is established but does not modulate under stress; her interior texture remains smooth throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high across most sentences without pattern-teaching or clear payoff at closure: "ambered hush," "marbled hush," "topology of shadow," "patient language of stones." This creates textural richness but also mild overwriting that dilutes momentum. Paraphrase loop detected: paragraph three's "not through narration but through absence, through the spaces between marks, through the careful study of what remained unsaid" cycles synonyms without added pressure. Sentence openings vary; no hard clarity breaks. Template cadence in paragraph two: repeated "the way they..." and "the messages..." structures.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The oracle-mapping-darkness premise offers a fresh angle, and the pebble-shore backstory adds texture. However, the core arc—solitary mystic completes prophetic task and finds peace—follows a familiar template without transformation through specific conflict or non-obvious cost. The final turn ("her work began") gestures at continuation but remains abstract. Emotional specificity is present in the grandmother's teaching, yet the ending retreats to safe closure without bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The pebble-shore oracle is present throughout and frames the narrative. She makes one key decision (to draw the map on the final page), but this choice is enacted without friction or alternatives—she simply does what she came to do. No reversal or tactical cost alters her approach. Setup clear, middle use functional, closure linkage present but passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The flaking gold leaf booklet appears in the opening, is physically handled (pages turned, charcoal applied), and its decay matters to mood. It participates in the closure beat (the map is drawn in it). However, it does not narrow options or impose a visible cost—its fragility is described but never complicates her task. Setup strong, beat involvement moderate, closure linkage functional but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Ambered hush" appears twice as atmospheric description but never shapes stakes or alters tactics. It functions as tonal repetition without causal pressure. The oracle's work involves silence and stillness, but the specific phrase does not drive a turn or constrain a choice. Ornamental use only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Mildly obsessed" is mentioned once in paragraph one ("the locals whispered that she was mildly obsessed") as a label. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The obsession is told rather than dramatized through a choice that incurs a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Retell" appears in the climax: "Her hand moved with the certainty of someone who had retold the same story a thousand times in her mind." The action is present and tied to her final task, but it is framed as prior mental rehearsal rather than an on-page dramatized act. The map-drawing itself does not require retelling; the element is invoked but not mechanically essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"By summarizing silence" is stated in paragraph one and echoed in the final third ("by allowing the silence to speak for her"). The method is thematic rather than procedural—no mechanics are shown on the page that differentiate this approach from ordinary map-drawing. It does not shape her attempts or impose a tactical constraint. Thematic mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort is established early and provides vivid setting detail (highest parapet, gray fury below, giant stones). The storm pauses to allow her work, which reduces rather than increases pressure. The fort holds at the end, but this is passive—setting does not supply a resource or constraint that alters her tactics. Setup strong, beat involvement minimal, closure participation descriptive only.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"When only one star remains in a dimming sky" anchors the timeframe in the opening and closing. The last star flickers and fades during her task, creating a ticking-clock backdrop. However, the oracle completes her work without visible time pressure altering her choices—she succeeds as the darkness arrives, on schedule. The timeframe charges mood but does not tighten tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To draw a map of an endless night" is the oracle's stated motivation, present from the opening and driving her journey and final action. The desire is clear and shapes the plot. However, it is not dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between wants and costs—she simply does what she set out to do without on-page struggle. Setup strong, beat involvement functional, closure linkage direct but frictionless.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Marbled hush" appears twice (paragraphs three and five) as atmospheric description. Tone remains consistently quiet and elegiac throughout, supporting the theme but not modulating with pressure—the oracle's emotional arc is smooth. The phrase does not charge the final image with new meaning; it repeats rather than reweights.</comment>
