<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and her apology speech carries embodied weight ("words felt like stones dropping into still water"), but her occupation as "gossip-column exorcist" remains decorative—it never constrains a choice or creates friction in this reconnection scene. Margot's accusation about speaking in riddles when truth is heavy lands well, showing prior patterns through conflict. The six-year silence and Eleanor's fear-based withdrawal are dramatized adequately, though the final beat leans toward summary rather than a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when promptly; the induced-current window creates a ticking clock that tightens pressure. The apology delivered and the current fading constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the connection flickers out "too late to matter and just in time to begin again," reweighting the prior estrangement with felt cost. Causal lens holds: Eleanor's arrival, the archive setup, and the miracle's time limit link cleanly, though Margot's response remains somewhat passive, reducing the final turn's sharpness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The orchard and archive are well-anchored early and create atmospheric pressure via the chainsaw threat. The sheet music manuscript returns as a tangible link to their mother, and the perfume bottle recurs with sensory memory. However, the archive itself remains largely backdrop; no tool, spatial constraint, or environmental feature meaningfully alters Eleanor's tactics or charges the final image, capping the score below 7.0 per the quick test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—delivering an overdue apology before the induced current fails—is signaled early and tightens as the chainsaws start and the connection fades. Eleanor's speech constitutes agency (renunciation of her prior silence) with visible cost: the miracle is "imperfect" and "delivered too late to matter." The pressure accumulates and narrows options under a causal lens, though the escalation relies on time running out rather than a protagonist decision that raises the stakes mid-scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of bridging irreparable damage through imperfect connection emerges organically from the induced currents, the orchard's fall, and the unfinished symphony. The perfume bottle's shift from memory vessel to symbol of belonging reweights meaning without moralizing. The final image—"the sharp, clean break that came before growth could start anew"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the estrangement question. Minor slip: "imperfect miracles" as a phrase is stated too directly in exposition, reducing subtext slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Eleanor's perceptual signature is consistent: she filters through metaphor and avoids direct confrontation until the apology forces simplicity. The shift from her habitual riddles to "words felt like stones" demonstrates voice modulation under pressure. Margot's dialogue ("You always spoke in riddles when the truth was too heavy") feels natural and advances conflict. Free indirect style is clean throughout, and psychic distance narrows appropriately as the currents fade, though Margot's interiority remains shadowed by her ghostly state rather than fully voiced.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose carries strong specificity ("curvy vessel of violet glass with a faded gold label"). Two paraphrase slips: "the words had tangled in her throat like loosened strings" closely echoes the earlier "words felt like stones dropping into still water," creating minor redundancy in the apology beat. The final paragraph's "the particular ache of an apology delivered too late to matter and just in time to begin again" borders on over-explanation, slightly dulling the closure image's charge. Information density is high otherwise, with minimal scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The combination of ghost-speaker tech ("induced currents"), exorcist-as-columnist, and the orchard's fall creates a fresh frame, though the estranged-sisters-reconcile arc itself follows familiar emotional territory. The "imperfect miracles" concept and the metaphor-versus-truth tension offer specific angles, yet the resolution—apology delivered as connection fades—feels slightly predictable once the setup is established. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids generic settings, landing in solid mid-band originality without a transformative final turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's occupation as gossip-column exorcist is introduced early but remains ornamental. It contextualizes her work with the dead and her comfort with metaphor, yet it does not constrain a single on-page choice or create friction in the reconnection scene. The role could be swapped for "medium" or "grief counselor" with minimal edits, capping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The antique perfume bottle appears early (setup), returns in Margot's dialogue mid-scene ("I kept the perfume bottle because it smelled like the garden"), and is pocketed at closure. It evolves from memory vessel to symbol of belonging across two beats. The final reprise charges the ending image slightly, though the bottle does not constrain a choice or alter tactics, limiting higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Imperfect miracles are signaled early and shape the core stakes: the induced currents create a "temporary channel" that will fail before full reconciliation. The concept constrains Eleanor's window and justifies the closure effect (connection fades before resolution completes). It appears in three beats (setup, middle fade warning, final dissolution) and the ending explicitly calls back to "imperfect...as all miracles are," reweighting the apology's partial success.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Eleanor's habit of advising through metaphors is established early and dramatized in Margot's accusation: "You always spoke in riddles when the truth was too heavy to carry straight." This trait creates visible friction—Eleanor must abandon metaphor to deliver the apology directly ("I'm sorry I wasn't there"). The cost of shifting from her habitual indirection to plain speech is felt in the beat, though the trait does not recur or shape later tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Reconnection is the story's spine: Eleanor descends to find Margot, delivers the apology, and the induced current enables (then terminates) their exchange. The action drives all major turns—arrival, confrontation, apology, and fade—and the closure hinges on the reconnection being "too late to matter and just in time to begin again." Removing this action would collapse the entire narrative structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Induced currents are signaled early ("induced currents would reach wherever Margot's consciousness had drifted") and their mechanics matter: they create a ticking window and explain Margot's flickering presence. The method shapes two beats (Margot's initial flicker, the final fade) and justifies the closure's incomplete reunion. However, Eleanor does not interact with the mechanism or adjust tactics based on its behavior, limiting deeper integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The sheet music archive is introduced early and houses the incomplete symphony manuscript, linking both sisters to their mother. It provides spatial grounding and thematic resonance (dead composers' unfinished work mirrors the family's unfinished business). The setting appears in setup, middle (manuscript), and closure (Eleanor climbs the stairs out). However, no spatial constraint or resource within the archive alters Eleanor's choices; it functions as atmospheric stage rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard's imminent destruction is signaled in the opening line and the chainsaw cough punctuates the middle beat, creating a live clock that tightens Eleanor's window. The timeframe shapes tactics (she has "only minutes") and charges the closure: "the orchard outside falling piece by piece into history" as she climbs away. The hush-to-noise progression tracks cleanly and the final tree-fall echoes the apology's timing, making this element indispensable to urgency and closure resonance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Eleanor's desire to deliver an overdue apology is established early, dramatized in her descent and confrontation with Margot, and tested by Margot's accusation about speaking in riddles. The apology itself is the story's climactic speech, and the cost—arriving "too late to matter and just in time to begin again"—is legible at closure. Friction between Eleanor's habitual avoidance and the forced directness of "I'm sorry" creates visible pressure across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ethereal grit manifests in the pairing of ghostly induced currents and flickering forms with concrete, grounded images: chainsaws, violet glass, chainsaw cough, stones dropping into water. The tone modulates appropriately—lyric in setup, direct during the apology, resonant at closure—and charges the final image where the "sharp, clean break" fuses the ethereal (Margot dissolving) with the physical (tree falling). Coherent across all turns.</comment>
