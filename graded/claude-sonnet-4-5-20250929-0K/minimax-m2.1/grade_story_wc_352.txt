<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Calyx's motivation is consistent—obsessive pursuit of the Acrid Codex—but her interiority trends abstract and label-heavy ("latent blaze of her obsession," "seeds of vigilance"). The climactic moment where she presses the stone and "understood" lacks embodied cost; the transformation is told rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Internal contradiction is minimal; she moves through fear to action, but the arc feels more like obstacle removal than genuine struggle with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds density through recurring imagery (prism, spiral-wave, doodles) and inverts gravity to enable access. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Calyx carries the knowledge as "seeds planted in fertile soil," reweighting her archive work with cost implied (she will be "changed, blazing"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the markings resolve and she grasps the pattern as "a way of thinking." The cost is conceptual—she's transformed but the price (potential conflict with the head archivist, the twenty-year wait for the next inversion) is stated, not viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The inverted grotto is vivid and purposeful: moisture falls upward, markings emerge only under inversion, three mouth-shaped passages create spatial decision points. The setting constrains choice (she must act within one hour, choose a passage) and charges the final image (markings retreat into stone). Sensory selection is strong—silver ribbons, stone warmth, mist forming letter-shapes—and filtered through Calyx's archivist lens. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the serpentine ascent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recover the forgotten combinations to preserve knowledge against time's erosion. The inversion tightens urgency (one-hour window), and Calyx's choice of the left passage narrows options. However, no on-page obstacle opposes her—she swims upward, presses the stone, and succeeds. The escalation is environmental (gravity inversion) rather than protagonist-driven; she encounters no reversal or cost that forces a trade-off. The resolution feels more like discovery than earned victory over resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge as perception, vigilance as constant watching—emerges from the prism metaphor and the doodles that shift when unobserved. The final image of seeds "sprolved into bloom" (a neologism that reads as over-reach) attempts resonance but leans toward abstraction. "Seeds of vigilance" repeats as a label rather than accruing pressure through particulars. The piece invites reflection on preservation and seeing, yet the ending tilts toward thematic summary ("new ways of seeing") instead of a charged image that reweights prior material without stating the lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Calyx; psychic distance and tense remain consistent. Voice carries elevated, archivist-specific diction ("gossamer," "clandestinely luminous," "serpentined"), though some phrases trend purple ("latent blaze," "sprolved into bloom"). Perceptual signature is present: she reads mist as letters, sees knowledge as spectrum. Free indirect style is clean. Register is consistent but occasionally strained by metaphor density in high-pressure moments (the stone-press climax).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and the read-aloud test passes, but figurative density is high in every paragraph without respite: "prism-minded," "breath held too long," "gossamer," "born into air," "seeds of vigilance," "latent blaze," "clandestinely luminous," "sprolved." The metaphors are coherent individually but stack without pattern-teaching, dulling immediacy. Line-level clarity is strong; no loops or scaffold. The neologism "sprolved" at closure jars rather than charges. Grammar and syntax are clean, but information density is uneven—some lines do multiple jobs; others reiterate theme.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The inverted-gravity grotto and archivist's prism-seeing offer a fresh synthesis of fantasy-logic and knowledge-preservation theme. However, the emotional arc—obsessed scholar returns, succeeds, gains insight—follows a familiar template. The twist that markings appear only under inversion is clever, but Calyx's unopposed success and the abstract resolution ("a way of thinking") reduce stakes to conceptual rather than lived. The piece commits fully to its premise but retreats from confrontation or failure that would deepen originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Calyx is present throughout and makes two choices: returning to the grotto (setup) and selecting the left passage (middle). Her final act—pressing the stone—triggers understanding but lacks visible cost or foreclosed path. The decision to return shapes the entire arc, but her unopposed success and abstract transformation ("new eyes") reduce causal pressure. Early signal and closure presence are strong; beat involvement spans all three acts. However, the choices feel low-friction: fear is mentioned as past, not present obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The doodles from the Acrid Codex appear in paragraph four as memory ("spiral intersecting a wave, tower with no base, numbers that rearranged"), recur as comparison in paragraph six ("mist formed shapes most like letters"), and resolve when "the spiral and the wave connected" in paragraph seven. Two touches across beats, with reweighted meaning at closure. However, the doodles are recalled, not handled; they guide perception but do not constrain a physical choice or impose cost. Setup is strong; development and payoff are present but abstract.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Seeds of vigilance" appears as a label in paragraph four ("planted by some ancient librarian") and returns in the final paragraph ("seeds...finally sprolved into bloom"). The concept shapes Calyx's understanding—knowledge requires constant watching—but does not constrain an on-page action or force a tactical choice. It functions as theme rather than active stake. Closure linkage is present but ornamental; removing the phrase would not break the plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Clandestinely luminous" appears twice: Calyx's lantern in paragraph four ("casing painted black, light clandestinely luminous from within") and the stone's glow in paragraph seven ("stone warmth bloomed...clandestinely luminous"). The attribute enables visibility in the inverted grotto but does not impose cost or constrain a choice—any light source would serve. Setup and closure participation are present; specificity is low. The repetition charges the final image modestly, linking tool and discovery.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Reenter" is the inciting action (paragraph two: "come to reenter the grotto") and recurs as future intent in the final paragraph ("when the next inversion came, she would be ready to reenter"). The entire plot hinges on this return: it drives her past the junction where "fear had driven her out before" and enables the markings' discovery. Removing "reenter" and substituting "enter" would flatten the twenty-year obsession and the arc of overcoming past failure. Causal pressure is high; closure linkage is strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Through threshold effects" appears once in paragraph three ("Through threshold effects, the archivist had learned, the universe permitted brief negotiations with its rules"). The method is named but not dramatized; we see gravity invert and Calyx cross the grotto's mouth, but "threshold effects" as a distinct mechanic does not constrain her choices or recur at closure. It reads as explanatory flavor rather than active method. Setup is present; development and payoff are absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto pressures choices throughout: the one-hour inversion window tightens urgency, the three-passage junction forces a decision, and the walls reveal markings only under inverted gravity. Calyx's movements—swimming upward, choosing left, pressing the stone—are shaped by the environment. Closure depends on the grotto's unique properties (markings retreat when gravity resumes). Setup, development, and payoff are all present. The grotto is indispensable to the plot, though Calyx's unopposed success reduces friction.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The one-hour inversion is introduced early ("would last precisely one hour") and recurs at closure ("The inversion would end soon"). However, the clock is not tracked mid-scene; we do not feel time pressure tightening Calyx's choices. She moves at a contemplative pace, and the ending's urgency is asserted, not dramatized. Setup and payoff are present; middle development (tactics altered by the ticking clock) is absent. The timeframe shapes the premise but does not escalate on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Calyx's desire to find "forgotten combinations" drives the return (paragraph two) and is fulfilled when she decodes the markings (paragraph seven: "These were the forgotten combinations...patterns to be perceived"). The motivation is present across all three acts and shapes the ending. However, it is never conflicted—no competing want or fear complicates her pursuit in scene. Her past fear is mentioned but not active. The friction between cost and desire is told (twenty years of thinking, risk of defying the head archivist) rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Latent blaze" appears in paragraph five ("latent blaze of her obsession had tempered her") and returns in the final paragraph ("blazing with a fire that had been latent too long"). The tone modulates from held anticipation (paragraph one's "breath held too long") to ignition at closure. However, the escalation is asserted rather than embodied in syntax or image density—the prose rhythm remains elevated and metaphor-dense throughout. Setup and payoff are present; the tonal shift charges the final image modestly but does not reweight prior material with new pressure.</comment>
