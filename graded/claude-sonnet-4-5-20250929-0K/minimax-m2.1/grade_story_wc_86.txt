<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The negotiator's interiority is present but often abstract—"uncommonly thoughtful" is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to drop the drawer pull carries symbolic weight but feels more thematic than driven by embodied internal conflict. His professional expertise and moon-phase methodology are mentioned but don't constrain the pivotal decision. Emotional embodiment is thin: we're told about sleepless nights and exhaustion but don't see those states degrade perception or complicate the present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the dual release of the brass pulls reweights inherited guilt with felt cost. The orientation anchors (parapet, mist, two characters) arrive cleanly within the opening. Causality is present but soft: the decision to drop the pull feels thematically motivated rather than forced by prior pressure or a reversal that narrows options. The ending supplies visible symbolic action and a mood shift, meeting the RR standard, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The parapet, mist, and storm-worn stone create a vivid stage and the brass pulls function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric—wind, mist curling like breath, silvering moonlight—without catalog bloat. Spatial choreography is clean: two people across from each other, arms extended, objects falling into darkness. The setting constrains symbolically (neutral territory, between-spaces) but doesn't pressure a tactical choice on the page, capping the score below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—releasing inherited enmity—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through reflection and symbolic setup, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options under duress. The exchange itself is cooperative and unopposed; the woman's uncertainty ("I wasn't sure you would come") deflates immediately without friction. The cost is conceptual (letting go of three generations' weight) rather than a visible forfeiture that alters future tactics, keeping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—wisdom from inherited mistakes, the cost of letting go—emerges through the brass pulls' symbolic journey and avoids overt moralizing until the final lines. The closing image (moonlight, untethered, "enough") offers a resonant answer without a stated moral, though "wisdom had come from pain, and that was enough" edges toward summary. The piece resists easy binaries (neither apology nor forgiveness) and the granddaughter's inherited guilt deepens complexity. Minor thematic echo in the final paragraph prevents a higher score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct, meditative register—"a familiar word," "breath held too long," "patient earth." Psychic distance modulates purposefully from exterior action to interior reflection. The prose carries consistent texture (elevated, slightly formal) that fits the negotiator's contemplative stance. Dialogue is minimal but naturalistic. Filter verbs ("thought about," "understood") appear but feel voice-motivated rather than artifactual. No head-hopping or POV leakage mars the execution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and the prose is generally clean, but several passages loop thematically without new pressure: "mistakes could be recycled into wisdom, but only if you actually changed" is paraphrased by "you cannot keep cycling through the same motions hoping for different results." Stock phrases appear—"kind of exhausted recognition," "people long dead who had left their descendants to sort through the wreckage"—and the final paragraph's "the knowledge that wisdom had come from pain, and that was enough" summarizes rather than trusts the image. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty, others scaffold. No major artifacts touch closure, limiting deductions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—enemies meeting on neutral ground to release symbolic objects—reads familiar and approaches a template for reconciliation narratives. The brass drawer pulls and the moon-phase synchronization offer specific inflections, but the emotional arc (inherited guilt → symbolic release → untethering) follows a predictable path without fresh moral calculus. The parapet setting and the mist imagery feel archetypal rather than transformed. Risk-taking is minimal; the piece stays safely within its contemplative register and avoids bold structural or perspectival choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The negotiator character is present throughout and makes the pivotal choice to drop the pull. His professional role (synchronizing exchanges through moon phases, learning from early mistakes) is mentioned but doesn't constrain the present decision—any character could drop a symbolic object. The "uncommonly thoughtful" trait is told rather than shown through on-page tactical friction. He drives the closure action, earning mid-band placement, but the occupation's mechanics don't alter the stakes or tactics in this scene.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The drawer pull appears in the opening paragraph (setup), is held and contemplated mid-scene (development), and is released in the climactic action (payoff). Its twin nature and shared history create causal pressure—both characters must choose to let go. The pull's worn smoothness and origin in the ruined house charge the final release with felt cost. Removing this exact object would collapse the story's symbolic and physical closure. High irreplaceability and closure linkage place it firmly in the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Neutral territory is established in the opening ("not claimed by either side, existing only in the between-spaces") and frames the meeting's possibility. It shapes the dominant stake—enemies can meet here without immediate violence—and the parapet's neutrality enables the symbolic exchange. The concept appears in the setup and supports closure but doesn't constrain tactics mid-scene or force a visible tradeoff. It's essential context rather than a pressure lever, placing it in the 6-7 band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Uncommonly thoughtful" is mentioned once in exposition ("those errors had taught him to be uncommonly thoughtful in his approach") but never dramatized through a choice that trades speed for caution or an on-page cost. The trait is told, not shown, and could be replaced with "careful" or "deliberate" without altering any beat. Label-only attribute with no visible friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Untether" appears as metaphor ("what it meant to untether something you had carried for years") and as the story's climactic physical action—releasing the drawer pulls into darkness. The word seeds expectation early and the closure act literalizes it with visible cost. Removing this exact verb would weaken the thematic and physical closure link. The element drives two beats (reflection and action) and charges the final image, placing it in the 7-8 band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Moon phases are mentioned in exposition ("he synchronized everything through moon phases," "Tonight was the dark moon") but the mechanics don't constrain the present choice or alter tactics on the page. Any meeting could occur; the dark moon functions as atmospheric detail rather than a pressure lever. The method is present in setup but ornamental in development and absent from closure participation, capping it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The parapet, storm-worn stone, and mist are vividly present in setup and frame the meeting spatially. The setting's neutral-territory status enables the exchange, and the mist imagery ("began to thin") modulates with the emotional resolution. The environment doesn't constrain a tactical choice—no wind forces a decision, no stone shifts underfoot—but it charges the final moonlit image. Atmospheric rather than pressure-driven, placing it in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Between apology and forgiveness" appears only in the final paragraph as a thematic label for the achieved state, not as a dramatized timeframe that tightens decisions. No live clock tracks the window or forces urgency. The phrase is poetic but arrives too late to shape tactics and functions as summary rather than constraint. Lyric reprise with thematic weight but minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation to "recycle mistakes into wisdom" is stated mid-scene ("Mistakes could be recycled into wisdom, but only if you actually changed what you were doing") and drives the decision to release the pull as a break from ritual repetition. The desire is told more than shown through conflicted choice—no on-page friction between wanting wisdom and fearing the cost of change. The motivation shapes one key beat (the release) and the ending's thematic charge, earning mid-6s for dramatized participation without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Furrowed" appears once in the granddaughter's description ("same furrow in her brow"), and "hush" arrives late ("the hush that follows a storm"). The tone is meditative and restrained throughout, modulating from tension ("Neither was I") to release ("silvering the parapet"). The elements seed early and return to charge the final image but don't shift dramatically with pressure. Coherent and purposeful tone without peak intensification, placing it in mid-6s.</comment>
