<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's interior arc—precognitive visions that previously showed unchangeable endings now transform into connection rather than capture—is cleanly motivated and embodied through her decade-long ritual and her grandmother's lingering promise. The shift from "catching" to "joining" earns the final stance through accumulated pressure and lived particulars. Minor weakness: the precognitive curse is told rather than shown constraining an earlier choice with visible cost, reducing its integration into her decision-making under pressure. The embodied particulars (bare feet on frictionless stone, hands in water) anchor the climax effectively.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal backbone. The story coheres around Mira's nightly ritual, the Spiral of Catching Hold sequence escalating to a decisive breakthrough where she understands connection versus capture. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the eels rise, transfer "starlight and memory," and the vision transforms from cursed unchangeability to spreading borrowed dawn—the promise shifts from weight to wing with legible conceptual cost (all remaining star dust spent, old paradigm renounced). Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two. One meaningful deepening occurs on-page when the sequence works and Mira steps onto the rocks, altering her stance with felt finality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tidal bluff, frictionless world, and aurora form a coherent micro-setting that charges the final image: Mira's bare feet finding purchase on stone "that no longer posed any threat to her balance" demonstrates lived adaptation, and the painted rocks' placement and the eels' geometry are spatially legible. The frictionless world subtly constrains tools (nets can't grip) and rewards her mathematical approach. The aurora's "borrowed dawn" recurs with reweighted meaning in the vision at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging the final image. Minor gap: occupational detail (eel herding mechanics) remains abstract, though the story's length and conceptual focus justify brevity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—fulfilling the grandmother's promise to learn what the eels truly are—is signaled early and tightens when Mira uses all remaining collapsed star dust in the Spiral of Catching Hold, foreclosing fallback options. The deepening occurs on-page: the sequence works, the eels gather, and Mira's understanding shifts from capture to connection, a protagonist-driven insight with visible cost (dust spent, old herding paradigm abandoned). The precognitive curse complicates but does not directly drive the escalation; the weight lies in the ritual's success and Mira's renunciation of control. One clear turn, consistent with Accumulative lens, coheres pressure to the end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—sacred patterns as connection rather than capture, promise as transformation rather than burden—emerges organically from Mira's decade-long ritual and the eels' response. The final image ("no longer a weight but a wing") reweights the opening without stated moral, and the shift from "harnessed nothing and everything" to understanding that "the eels were not animals to be caught but patterns to be joined" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The borrowed dawn's spread in the vision reprices the frictionless world's cost with conceptual dignity. No heavy-handed thesis; the mathematics-as-sacred motif accumulates naturally and pays off in the geometry of connection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly; Mira's perceptual signature (mathematical progressions, precognitive fragments, inherited knowledge) filters all description. Diction remains controlled and voice-consistent, with purposeful lyricism ("ribbons of liquid mercury," "embers," "wing") that modulates pressure without obscuring clarity. Minor slips: "sacred" and "borrowed dawn" recur as unearned conceptual shorthand in peak beats, and the phrase "something the eels carried in their elusive bodies" at closure hedges specificity when concreteness would sharpen impact. No dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance stable; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual and aural momentum. Information density is high (each paragraph advances understanding, setting, or internal pressure). Minor artifacts: "lingering promise" appears three times with slight synonym churn ("lingered," "lingering," "finally settle"); "sacred" recurs five times across the piece without pattern-teaching payoff, drifting toward thematic placeholder. The phrase "but something else had been waiting beneath it all along" in the penultimate paragraph abstracts when a concrete image would charge harder. No major loops or template cadence, but the figurative density in the final third (starlight, memory, wing, constellation) trends decorative without new causal work. Proofreading clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—frictionless world, eel herding via mathematical sequences, precognitive curse, collapsed star dust—feels specific and non-obvious, anchored in Mira's lived decade of adaptation rather than prompt assembly. The transformation of "catching" to "joining" and promise from weight to wing earns freshness through embodied particulars (painted rocks, bare feet, geometry). Risk-taking in the conceptual frame (sacred patterns holding a post-friction world) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Minor limitation: the precognitive curse and the frictionless world's origin remain abstract, underexploited in the causal chain; tighter integration of these elements' costs would deepen originality. The final vision's spread feels slightly convenient, a turn not fully earned by prior constraint.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's choices drive all key turns: she selects the Spiral of Catching Hold sequence, uses all remaining star dust, climbs the bluff, places the final rock, steps onto the sequence, and reaches into the water. Each decision narrows options and alters tactics. Present from the opening, central to every beat, causally active at closure. The "eel herder" role provides occupational frame and inherited knowledge (grandmother's notes) that enable the climax.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Collapsed star dust introduced early (grandmother's hidden jar), used to paint the rocks across Mira's decade of attempts, and decisively spent ("all of her remaining collapsed star dust, every grain") in the Spiral sequence at the climax. Its depletion forecloses fallback attempts, raising stakes. The dust's origin (crushed collapsed star) and scarcity charge both the ritual's mechanics and Mira's final gamble. Reweighted at closure when the eels transfer "starlight and memory," linking the dust's cosmic source to the revelation. Indispensable to escalation and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lingering promise (learn what the eels are, inherited from grandmother) is signaled early, recurs as emotional weight ("growing heavier with each winter"), and transforms at closure from burden to wing when Mira fulfills it through connection rather than capture. It shapes Mira's decade-long persistence and the stakes of using all remaining dust. The concept appears in the opening, middle reflection, and final sentence, reweighting meaning. Moderate causal pressure: it motivates but does not directly constrain tactical choices until the climax.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Precognitively cursed is introduced in paragraph three, described as showing "what she could not change, only witness" (grandmother's death, eels disappearing, darker borrowed dawn). It provides backstory motivation and thematic irony (tonight's vision transforms from curse to gift). However, the curse does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost; Mira does not struggle against a foreseen outcome or pay a price for the visions during the main action. Swappable with "haunted by loss" or similar traits. Present and functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Harness" appears only in the penultimate paragraph ("She had harnessed nothing and everything"), a meta-commentary on the action rather than the action itself. The actual climax centers on understanding, reaching, and connection; "harness" is not dramatized as a physical or tactical move. The word's late, summary-only use makes it ornamental. Easily swappable with "grasped," "captured," or omitted without structural loss. Does not drive turns or constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Placing painted rocks in mathematical sequences is introduced early (paragraph two), explained as Mira's discovered method (eels respond to sacred sequences), and executed on-page in the climax (the Spiral of Catching Hold, final rock placed, others hum in response, eels gather and mirror the geometry). The method's mechanics matter: sequence type, pattern relationship, and the rocks' visual presence (crushed star dust paint, aurora shimmer) all enable the eels' response. Shapes two beats (nightly ritual, tonight's climax) and is indispensable to closure. Minor gap: the "sacred sequences" concept remains abstract; more specificity in the mathematics would deepen integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tidal bluff under aurora is anchored early, provides spatial coherence (Mira climbs, places rocks, eels weave below in water, she steps onto rocks and reaches down), and the aurora's timing governs the eels' appearance, creating a tactical constraint. The setting's frictionless quality (bare feet finding purchase, things sliding) is embodied and affects Mira's movement. The aurora recurs in the final vision as borrowed dawn spreading. Environment participates in three beats and charges the ending image. Solid integration, though the bluff itself (tidal feature) is underdeveloped compared to the aurora.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After friction disappears" frames the entire world (eleven years of eel herding post-change, things slip toward the sea, nets and barriers fail, Mira's adapted balance). The timeframe provides context and thematic weight (promise growing heavier each winter, darker borrowed dawn each year). However, the loss of friction does not tighten a choice or escalate pressure in the main action; Mira's solution (mathematical sequences) bypasses rather than confronts the frictionless condition. Present across the piece and integrated into setting, but causally passive. Lyric resonance without on-page constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to understand sacred patterns (grandmother's promise, Mira's discovery that eels respond to sequences, the Spiral of Catching Hold as ultimate test) drives the entire arc. Mira's choice to use all remaining dust and attempt the new sequence is a high-cost dramatization of this desire. The motivation is present early, contested by scarcity and prior failure (visions of eels disappearing), and resolved at closure when understanding shifts from capture to connection. Friction between want (learn what eels are) and cost (finite dust, irreversible choice) is on-page and clear.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Borrowed dawn" introduced early as the aurora's light (eels catch it "like ribbons of liquid mercury"), recurs in Mira's vision of it growing darker, and transforms in the climax vision to spreading across the world "like a promise finally kept." Tone remains elegiac and lyric throughout, modulating subtly from weight and scarcity to openness and spread at the end. The phrase charges the final image by reweighting earlier mentions. Solid coherence and purposeful recurrence, though the metaphor's mechanics (why "borrowed"? from what source?) remain opaque, limiting deeper resonance.</comment>
