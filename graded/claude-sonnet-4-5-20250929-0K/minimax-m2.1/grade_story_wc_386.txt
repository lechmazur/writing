<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is present as a skilled investigator, but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("singular method," "patient work") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The story tells us she "weaves truth carefully" and has "crystalline clarity" about her purpose without dramatizing internal conflict or showing her struggle with competing desires. Her final decision to find the living relatives is declared rather than earned through on-page tension between what she wants and what it costs her. No genuine flaws complicate her path; she moves through the investigation with competence but no visible stakes that force her to sacrifice something or face a mistake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation arrives late—who she is and what she's doing in the glacier shrine becomes clear only after multiple paragraphs of abstract mood-setting, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The drive lens wavers between accumulative-textural (collecting dream fragments) and causal (investigating to name the child), never cohering under one dominant frame by midpoint. The closure—deciding to find living relatives—is announced as intention rather than executed on the page, offering no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost; the final paragraph summarizes what she will do rather than showing her doing it or facing a price. The snow globe's "patient melting" recurs but doesn't tighten options or create a meaningful pressure point.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is vividly rendered with candles, ice walls, and "borrowed starlight," and the physical setting (diving through wreck's "cathedral ribs," the snow globe on the plinth) anchors the reader in a specific, textured space. However, the environment remains largely descriptive; it does not constrain her choices or shape her investigation tactics—she could conduct this work anywhere with access to dreamers and the globe. The shrine functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a force that pressures decisions or charges the final image, keeping it mid-band despite strong sensory detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving the nameless child her voice—is signaled early, but the investigation proceeds without meaningful escalation or tightening under pressure. Dream analysis, diving, and shrine work are recounted as completed actions ("had revealed," "had traced") rather than shown as live attempts that narrow options or force trade-offs. No reversal or deepening occurs; each step (collecting dreams, identifying the photograph, learning the girl's name) simply adds information without raising cost or foreclosing a path. The final move—finding the living relatives—is declared as future intention, not dramatized with agency or consequence on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>A coherent theme of memory preservation and naming the forgotten emerges through the child's story and the recurring snow globe, but the piece tilts toward thematic statement ("her motivation had never been simple recovery") rather than letting theme arise from enacted choices. The final paragraph approaches sermon territory with "The child's story would not remain silent" and the explicit declaration of purpose. The snow globe's dissolving recurs but does not shift meaning at closure; it remains a static symbol. The theme is present and legible but told more than earned through specific, pressure-tested particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and elevated, with a distinctive lyric texture ("borrowed starlight," "cathedral ribs," "fallings of gentle snow"), but the diction often drifts into ornamental abstraction disconnected from the POV's embodied experience. Perceptual signature is weak—her way of noticing reads generic rather than character-specific, and elevated phrasing like "weaving truth carefully from fragments strangers carried in their dreams" feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. Backstory dominates (roughly 60% reflection on prior investigation) without interleaving present micro-choices that alter options, flattening momentum. The psychic distance remains static; no modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Prose carries a consistent lyric register but suffers from pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops: "She had come to expose" / "She had pulled it from the wreck herself" / "She had come to give this child back her name" recur with identical syntactic stems across multiple paragraphs. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff—nearly every sentence in the opening paragraphs deploys metaphor ("flickering memories like delicate flames," "vessel for preservation," "borrowed starlight") without advancing pressure. Stock phrasing appears at peak beats: "crystalline clarity," "borrowed light," "patient silence." Information density is low; adjacent sentences restate content (e.g., paragraph four's two descriptions of the child's appearance in dreams). These artifacts touch multiple beats and dull propulsion throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ghost-whisperer-via-dreams premise offers a fresh angle, but the execution relies on familiar beats: the mysterious investigator, the wreck with a tragic child victim, the quest to restore a name. The glacier shrine and dream-cameo method are inventive details, yet they don't generate non-obvious turns—the arc follows a predictable template (gather clues → identify victim → resolve to notify family) without transformation. The emotional territory (rescuing forgotten memory) is earnest but generic; no specific lived detail or moral calculus distinguishes this from other memory-salvage narratives. The snow globe and borrowed-starlight imagery are poetic but not irreplaceable; the story's logic would survive their removal or substitution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The wreck-diver ghost-whisperer is introduced early and her occupation frames the investigation, but her role is largely told in backstory rather than shown making on-page decisions that create turns. Diving is recounted as a past action ("she had pulled it from the wreck herself") without live tactical choices or visible cost. Her decision at the end—to find living relatives—is declared intention, not a dramatized choice that alters present options. Functional but replaceable; the ghost-whisperer label could be swapped for any investigator role without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The melted snow globe appears in multiple beats (shrine plinth, its cloudy suspension, the photograph within, its "patient melting" at dawn) and anchors the investigation's physical focus. However, its use is largely static description; it is not handled or used in ways that constrain her choices or shift her tactics. The globe's dissolving is mentioned but does not drive a turn or reweight meaning at closure—it continues melting as backdrop. Present across beats but without causal pressure or charged reprise, keeping it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Windows of connection" is thematically echoed in the dream-cameo concept but never shapes on-page stakes or tactics. The investigation is recounted as completed analysis rather than shown as a live attempt to open or sustain connections with dreamers. The concept functions as metaphorical dressing rather than a mechanism that alters her options or creates friction. Present as theme claim, absent as structural driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is declared early ("she wove truth carefully, as one weaves silk") and reiterated, but the trait is label-only—no on-page action demonstrates the cost or constraint of careful weaving versus a reckless alternative. Her investigation proceeds without visible trade-offs tied to this method. Ornamental mention without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Expose" appears in the opening ("come to expose what the sea had taken") and the penultimate paragraph ("prepared to expose what she had found"), framing her motivation, but the action itself is not dramatized on the page. The story ends with her intention to expose the truth to living relatives, not the act of exposure or its consequence. Functional setup but no payoff beat where exposure occurs and alters outcome.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams is introduced early and recurs across multiple paragraphs (collecting impressions, tracing dream-cameos through dozens of sleepers, the child's face emerging from visions). The method is signaled and its mechanics—gathering fragments from dreamers—are sketched, but the process is summarized rather than shown in live attempts that shape her tactics or face obstacles. Present and causally relevant but swappable with any clue-gathering mechanism without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice is introduced early and anchors multiple beats (the central plinth, the candles' "borrowed light," dawn bleeding through blue walls). The setting provides vivid atmosphere and houses her work, but it does not constrain her choices or supply resources that alter her investigation tactics—she could perform this analysis in any quiet space with the snow globe. The glacier's "patient silence" is mentioned as teaching her to listen, but this is told rather than shown altering a decision. Purposeful early–final presence with thematic resonance but no causal pressure on outcome, placing it in the solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"To salvage something pure from the wreckage" is declared explicitly ("her motivation had never been simple recovery; she sought to salvage something pure") and frames the emotional driver. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or visible costs—no friction between this want and competing pressures appears on the page. The motivation shapes the thematic layer but does not force a trade-off or complicate her path. Functional but replaceable phrasing; the investigation would proceed identically with a generic "honor the forgotten" motive.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Borrowed starlight" recurs across the story (opening, midpoint, penultimate paragraph) as a tonal anchor, creating a consistent lyric, elegiac mood. The tone is coherent through turns and modulates slightly at dawn ("dawn bled through the glacier's blue walls"), but it remains static rather than charging the final image with new pressure or reweighting prior material. The phrase functions as atmospheric motif without altering the emotional stakes at closure. Purposeful early–final reprise with tonal consistency places it in the mid-band.</comment>
