<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in the lost expedition, but her interior life relies heavily on cartographic observation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The whistle moment offers embodied choice, yet the decision to blow it feels more driven by pattern-solving than by competing wants that create genuine internal friction. Emotional states are more described than viscerally contradictory—"sunwashed dread" operates as atmospheric label rather than embodied degradation under stress. The cost at closure (turtles waking, spiral glowing) gestures toward consequence but doesn't yet foreclose a visible path with felt price on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph and establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered world detail, the watchers' presence, and Mira's pattern-reading until the whistle sequence shifts cadence and ignites the spiral glow. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the turtles stir, options crystallize—but the cost remains more atmospheric promise than legible on-page forfeiture. The structure is single-POV, one continuous scene, with minimal transition debt; escalation tightens through the question embedded in the spirals and the whistle's three-tone signal. One meaningful deepening is present, though the final image charges expectation more than it reconfigures prior stakes with undeniable price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city is vividly particular—bioluminescence dimmed, cracks spreading, settlement into mud—and the setting constrains Mira's toolkit (spiral-roads, hum-of-origin, pattern language) throughout. The marsh watchers and the rusted gate frame spatial pressure that shapes her inquiry. The whistle, tied to marsh reeds and the lost expedition's last campsite, functions as micro-setting object that charges the final beat when pressed to the shell. Sensory detail is filtered through cartographic bias (spirals, frequencies, tremors) and the "sunwashed dread" of relentless light. The setting drives the climactic choice: Mira kneels at the spiral intersection, listens, then acts—environment and tool converge to ignite closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the watchers and the expedition's fate—is signaled early and sustained through pattern-hunting and the forbidden question. Pressure accumulates via the spirals' changed resonance, the Council's prohibitions, and the watchers' patient vigil. The whistle sequence offers one meaningful tightening: Mira's choice to blow the three-tone signal narrows options and awakens the turtles, crystallizing a before/after threshold. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or cost that forecloses a live alternative on the page; the spiral glow reads more as tantalizing complication than as a price paid. Agency is present in the decision to sound the whistle, but the consequence remains poised rather than paid, fitting Charged Poise but not yet demonstrating the felt cost that would lift this into the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of memory (lost expedition), forbidden inquiry (the watchers), and the cost of observation versus intervention. The recurring motif of the whistle and the spiral patterns shifts meaning from superstition to active catalyst, charging the final image without explicit moralizing. The piece resists tidy answers—Mira's question ("Where do the watchers look when they are not watching?") invites reflection beyond plot, and the turtles' stirring reconfigures the city's foundation as living memory rather than static ruin. Subtext operates in the Council's silence, the watchers' stillness, and Mira's inheritance of the mentor's ink-dot notation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of agency and attention, though the conceptual cost could be sharpened to reach the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, filtering the turtle city through Mira's cartographic lens—"hum-of-origin," "pattern-between," "frequency." Diction is controlled and voice-specific, with syntactic rhythm modulating purposefully from patient exposition ("moved through the amber light") to compressed urgency at the whistle moment. No head-hopping; psychic distance narrows cleanly as pressure builds. One minor slip: "The Council said they had chosen to leave, that the scholars of the Spiral Compass had found their patterns…" reads slightly expository for a character who already disbelieves this, though it quickly pivots to contradictory evidence. Perceptual signature is distinct—Mira notices spirals, resonance, ink dots—and the prose rhythm tightens without register drift under peak stress. No dialogue present; internal voice remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (world-building, character motive, atmospheric charge). The opening's "spiral-shell cartographer moved through the amber light with the patience of someone who had learned…" establishes voice and stakes efficiently. Minor scaffold detected: "The patterns had changed since the rust. Where the shell spirals once pulsed…" could compress the transition. One instance of filter-verb density in mid-passage ("She had learned to crack the code…from her mentor, from the journals…") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure causality. The whistle sequence tightens propulsion cleanly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs; figurative language ("sunwashed dread," "relentless sun…like something dying") is apt and integrated. Proofreading is clean; one typo ("测绘ing") appears mid-sentence but reads as generation artifact rather than prose flaw—no deduction under Text Artifact Screen guidance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The turtle-city premise is specific and freshly realized—giant shells as urban foundation, bioluminescent spirals encoding lost knowledge, watchers as threshold guardians—avoiding generic fantasy templates. The cartographer protagonist and pattern-language method offer a non-obvious angle on the "lost expedition" trope, grounding mystery in craft rather than combat. Emotional specificity (Mira's patient grief, the mentor's vanishing, the reed whistle as inheritance) anchors universals in concrete detail. The piece commits fully to its conceit without retreat, letting the turtles' dream-state and the watchers' vigil remain ambiguous yet coherent. One risk: the whistle's activation of the spirals could veer toward convenient magic-key plotting, but the setup (eleven years of mapping, inherited notation, pattern-taught signal) earns the turn in hindsight. The synthesis of cartography, living architecture, and forbidden inquiry feels inevitable rather than assembled, though the closure gesture (spiral glow) stops short of the boldest available image.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her cartographic choices—listening for the hum-of-origin, consulting the journals, decoding the spiral sequence—shape multiple beats. Her decision to blow the whistle creates the story's key reversal: the turtles stir and the spiral glows, altering the city's dormant state. The character is signaled early, drives middle exploration, and enacts the closure beat. Cost is implied (awakening ancient creatures, defying the Council's prohibition) but not yet fully paid on the page. Removing Mira would collapse the story's agency and observational lens, but her choices trend more toward pattern-solving than morally weighted trade-offs, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The reed whistle appears three times: inherited from the oldest explorer (setup), carried as "superstition" charm (middle reflection), and blown in the three-tone sequence (closure beat). Its meaning shifts from memento to active catalyst, and its marsh-reed origin ties it causally to the lost expedition's last location and the pattern language. It directly enables the turtles' awakening and the spiral's glow—removing it would require a different mechanism for the ending. However, the whistle is not handled or physically described in distinct, evolving ways across those beats; its function remains largely symbolic until the final act. The closure linkage is strong, but mid-story development is thinner than ideal for the 7+ range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The lost expedition frames Mira's motivation, supplies the whistle artifact, and anchors the watchers' arrival ("the morning after the gate seized shut"). It drives her eleven years of mapping and pattern-reading, shaping tactics on the page (consulting journals, following the mentor's ink-dot notation, sounding the expedition's signal). The concept is present in setup, middle reflection, and closure gesture (the whistle sequence evokes the expedition's camps). However, the expedition itself remains off-stage—no on-page discovery, no dramatized revelation of their fate. The concept pressures stakes and enables the ending but does not undergo its own transformation or yield a visible cost directly tied to what happened to the scholars. Swapping "lost expedition" for "vanished mentor" would alter texture but not break structure, suggesting mid-range integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is embodied in Mira's "patience of someone who had learned that answers came…from observation" and her eleven-year commitment to mapping despite the Council's prohibitions. The trait enables her persistence and constrains her method—she listens, decodes, waits—rather than confronting the watchers or demanding answers. It shapes the story's accumulative texture and charges the whistle decision with the weight of long endurance. However, the attribute is more shown through action than tested by on-page friction; no moment forces Mira to choose between her quiet approach and a louder alternative with visible cost. The trait is consistent and causal but lacks a dramatic trade-off that would push it into the 7+ range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Crack" appears in two contexts: Mira's effort to "crack the code of these pattern languages" (middle reflection) and the "cracks spreading through the great shells" (atmospheric detail). The verb choice evokes breaking through concealment and structural fragility, thematically apt. However, neither instance drives a major turn—pattern-cracking is method rather than decisive action, and shell-cracking is environmental backdrop. The whistle-blowing and spiral-glowing constitute the story's key action, not "crack" itself. Swapping "crack" for "decipher" or "decode" would not alter plot structure or closure, indicating the action is present but largely ornamental. No cost or choice is uniquely tied to the act of cracking.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pattern languages are signaled early ("the frequency that the old cartographers called the hum-of-origin," "pattern languages") and their mechanics matter throughout: Mira reads the spirals' sequences, follows the mentor's ink-dot notation, and decodes the recurring question embedded in the shells. The method shapes her tactics—listening, consulting journals, pressing her palm to the shell—and enables the closure beat when she blows the three-tone sequence "that the lost expedition had used to signal their camps." The method is not merely a late reveal but a present constraint that guides attempts and makes the whistle's effect legible. Removing pattern languages would collapse the story's epistemological stakes. The method is integral across setup, middle problem-solving, and payoff, with visible cause-effect linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city is established in the opening lines and recurs as active constraint and resource throughout. The shells' changed bioluminescence signals danger; the cracks and settlement pressure Mira's urgency; the spiral-roads provide the physical space for her pattern-work; the shell's resonance guides her listening. Mira kneels "at the intersection of three major spiral-roads" and feels the shell warm and tremble—spatial choreography and tactile detail drive the climax. The setting is not postcard backdrop but living infrastructure whose dream-state and structural fragility shape every choice. The final image—spiral glowing, turtles shifting—depends entirely on this specific setting. Removing the turtle-city would require a fundamentally different story. The setting is indispensable, constrained only by the fact that its micro-mechanics (shell resonance, turtle sleep) are more asserted than dramatized with visible cost earlier in the piece.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rusted gate frames the story's present-tense constraint—it "seized shut" the morning the watchers arrived, eleven years before Mira's current mapping session. The timeframe establishes causality (expedition vanished → gate rusts → watchers appear → Mira maps for eleven years) and contextualizes urgency (the city is "slowly settling," the turtles are "dreaming again, or dying"). However, the gate's closure does not tighten on-page decisions in the present scene; no countdown or live pressure from the timeframe alters Mira's tactics. The element is setup and backstory rather than a clock that forces trade-offs. The whistle decision is motivated by pattern completion, not temporal scarcity. Present in setup and thematically relevant, but does not drive escalation or participate in closure, capping the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira's desire to question the watchers is dramatized through her pattern-hunting, the forbidden inquiry embedded in the spirals ("Where do the watchers look when they are not watching the city?"), and her defiance of the Council and Priestesses' prohibitions. The motivation drives her to decode the mentor's notation and blow the whistle despite the risk. Friction is present: the Council forbids approach, the watchers' silence is ominous, and Mira "knew better" than to accept the official story. However, the cost of pursuing this desire is more anticipated than paid on the page—the whistle awakens the turtles but does not yet bring the watchers' response or exact a visible price from Mira. The motivation is coherent and causal across beats, shaping the closure gesture, but lacks the on-page trade-off or sacrifice that would push it into the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Sunwashed dread" is signaled early ("the relentless sun that poured through the cloudless sky like something dying") and coheres throughout: the light "revealed too much," exposing cracks and decay; Mira's patient tension accumulates under its glare; the whistle's thin, reedy sound emerges into the "empty spiral-plaza" bathed in that same oppressive brightness. The tone modulates subtly—dread intensifies as Mira decodes the forbidden question and defies prohibition, yet the final image (spiral glowing, shells warming) introduces a flicker of charged possibility without dispelling the ambient threat. The tone charges the closure beat: the glow is not triumphant but ambiguous, charged with both promise and peril. The tone is consistent, purposeful, and integral to the story's atmospheric pressure, shaping perception and emotional texture across all beats and directly informing the final image's resonance.</comment>
