<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's interior world is detailed and her grief-driven motivations are consistent, but the piece leans heavily on reflective summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to "remain open to messages" feels more stated than earned through a visible on-page struggle that forecloses another path. Backstory dominates (~40% of the text) and although it anchors to the present meteorite work, micro-choices that alter present options are sparse. The phrase "recalibration of a heart" and similar abstractions drift toward therapy-speak without embodied cost in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Eleanor, attic, present-day restoration work) arrive within the first paragraph; the Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with sustained density across autumn weeks. The closure unit—Eleanor playing the reconstructed recording and choosing to "remain open to messages"—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she commits to trust as daily practice). However, the cost is asserted in abstract terms ("willingness to send another message") rather than shown through a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift on the page, weakening the felt weight at the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The attic skylight, workbench, and meteorite chip create a vivid micro-setting that constrains Eleanor's mapping method and charges the final transducer moment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: vanilla-and-forgetting smell, dust motes tracked in pencil, crystalline structures. The skylight's "single" constraint directly shapes her practice of stillness and the accumulation of light-particle trajectories, meeting the 9+ gate criterion by constraining choice and charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering lost songs to learn trust again—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when Eleanor connects dust-mote mathematics to sonic reconstruction, narrowing her method and emotional trajectory. The final act (playing the recording) is protagonist-driven, but the escalation unfolds through patient process rather than reversals that force trade-offs. Cost is present ("remain open… against evidence") yet feels conceptual rather than a visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—trust as practice, messages across voids—emerges organically from the Echo Project, grandmother's courier work, and Eleanor's aviary silence. The final image of the voice "blooming and withering in the same breath" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The meteorite motif recurs with reweighted meaning (papers → chip → transducer) and the lullaby about birds carrying messages between worlds directly charges the closure without stating a thesis. Minor slip: "trust is not a single decision but a practice" edges toward abstract summary in the penultimate sentence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; Eleanor's perceptual signature (mapping dust motes, courier-trained patience) is distinct and purposeful. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("recalibration of a heart," "particular weight of absence") that feels slightly outside her established voice under pressure. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and the blend of technical detail (transducer, crystalline formations) with lyric compression supports the Accumulative lens. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several passages loop conceptually: the trust/waiting motif is restated across three beats without added pressure. "The particular weight of absence" and "the shape of healing she had been unable to name" are stock metaphor strings that reduce specificity in peak moments. Template cadence appears in the third paragraph's paired "songs about home, about the particular weight" construction. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull immediacy, triggering cumulative penalties of approximately −0.8 in this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of courier pigeon heritage, Mars meteorite sonics, and the Echo Project is non-obvious and purposeful. The dust-mote mapping method as analogue for audio reconstruction shows ingenuity. However, the emotional arc—learning trust after loss—follows a familiar template, and the ending insight ("trust is… a practice") resolves into a somewhat tidy formulation. Specific details (Antarctica 1962, refugee camps, transducer pressed to meteorite) prevent full genericness and elevate the piece above mid-band, but transformation of the core grief-and-trust premise remains modest.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's courier-pigeon training is invoked as heritage and metaphor throughout; it informs her patience and her understanding of trust. However, her present choices (mapping dust motes, reconstructing recordings) do not hinge on pigeon-handling skills in a causal way—the attribute could be swapped for another messenger/patience profession with minor edits. It appears in setup (first paragraph) and payoff (final image of wings/messages) but does not constrain a middle choice, capping eligibility near 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Mars meteorite chip is handled in at least three beats: discovery in papers, mapping across weeks, transducer playback at closure. It provides the seventeen sonic traces that Eleanor reconstructs, directly enabling the final recording. The chip's extraterrestrial mineral structure is irreplaceable—no terrestrial object could carry the Echo Project encoding—and it charges the ending image. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage push toward the high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Paper trails" appear as the archival correspondences Eleanor follows through Morrow & Daughter's records to understand the Echo Project. The concept shapes her investigative tactics in the middle section and frames the inheritance chain. However, it functions more as method than as a stake that narrows options under pressure; removing "paper" and substituting "digital files" would alter texture but not break story logic. Setup and development are present; closure linkage is oblique.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Reinvents personal history" is not explicitly dramatized on the page. Eleanor reconstructs her great-grandmother's songs and reinterprets her grandmother's Echo Project work, which could be read as reframing inheritance, but no scene shows Eleanor actively altering her own past narrative or facing a cost for doing so. The attribute remains thematic and label-only, without a visible tradeoff in action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Balance" is invoked directly: "The balance of the work required stillness" and "She balanced the work between science and mourning." It constrains Eleanor's method (forcing stillness, preventing emotional consumption) and appears in the middle development. However, the story does not turn on a failure or success of balance in a decisive beat; the concept could be paraphrased as "patience" or "integration" without breaking logic. Present in setup and development, modest causal pressure, minimal closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mapping dust motes under the single skylight is signaled early, detailed in the middle (graph paper, particle trajectories, mathematics of suspension), and directly enables the sonic reconstruction method Eleanor applies to the meteorite. The skylight's singularity is a constraint that forces stillness and selective attention. The method shapes multiple attempts and the final success, demonstrating strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Irreplaceability is high—no other mapping technique is shown as viable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The vintage bookshop attic provides the skylight (single-source constraint), workbench, and archival papers that together enable Eleanor's work. The setting is introduced in the opening line, supplies resources across the middle (papers, quiet, dust motes), and houses the transducer playback at closure. The "vanilla and forgetting" smell and inherited inventory root Eleanor's grief in the physical space. The attic's isolation and vertical remove from the shop below subtly mirror her withdrawal from the aviary, adding thematic charge. Strong setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Across learning to trust again" frames the emotional arc from Eleanor's post-accident aviary silence to her final choice to remain open. The timeframe is signaled ("across the weeks of autumn") and organizes the narrative progression. However, the temporal span does not tighten decisions—no live clock or deadline alters tactics. The phrase "learning to trust again" is more thematic than mechanical; it describes the journey but does not pressure specific moments. Present in setup and payoff, modest development role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Eleanor's desire to preserve lost songs is stated early (papers about Echo Project, songs her grandmother hummed) and drives her reconstruction work across the middle. The motivation is tested when she must "remain present" and choose to trust the process despite grief. Friction between wanting recovery and fearing silence is implied but not sharply dramatized in a single high-stakes choice. The final playback fulfills the motivation with felt cost ("blooming and withering"), linking desire to closure. Setup, development, and payoff are solid; causal pressure is present but not maximal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Blooming withering" as tone appears explicitly in the closure beat: "bloomed and withered in the same breath, beautiful in its impermanence." The simultaneous flourishing/decay motif also colors earlier images (vanilla and forgetting, songs that fade). Tone modulates with Eleanor's emotional pressure—stillness in the attic, patient reconstruction, ephemeral playback—and charges the final image by embodying impermanence as beauty. Coherent through turns, purposeful at closure, strong payoff. Minor friction: the tone keyword is stated late, reducing early signal credit slightly.</comment>
