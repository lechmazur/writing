<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is distinct and embodied through her relationship with the pen and her patient approach to signal interpretation. Internal conflict emerges in her acceptance of the "wrong seeds" error and her comfort with uncertainty, though this remains more reflective than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to sit with the universe rather than rush the report shows character-specific restraint, but the stakes of this decision feel muted—no visible cost or path foreclosed. Micro-choices are present (adjusting frequency, touching the pen) but lack the pressure that would reveal a hierarchy of values under genuine duress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The closure effect reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira's acceptance that "every wrong turn was a form of filtering" reweights her career reassignment and the gravitational anomaly's role, charging the final image of her sitting with the universe. Cost is conceptual and felt—she's foreclosed the path of immediate verification, choosing solitary recognition over career vindication. One meaningful deepening occurs when she recognizes the signal as a response, shifting her understanding of the anomaly from distortion to refinement. The accumulative design (reflective blocks, signal work, epiphany) coheres, though the middle stretch leans heavily on exposition rather than scene pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly functions as both setting and constraint: it distorts signals, requiring Mira's patient unraveling method and ultimately filtering noise to reveal the essential response. The pen and monitoring station are handled concretely across multiple beats, and the amber light detail adds sensory specificity. Spatial choreography is clean within the single location. The anomaly's properties constrain her interpretive choices and charge the final image when she realizes it "filtered" rather than "broken" the signal, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. Minor gap: the outpost itself remains somewhat generic beyond the anomaly's presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decoding the folded signal to prove her interpretive skill after the Proxima Centauri misidentification. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira shifts from isolating frequencies to tracing contingent relationships, and the payoff—recognizing the signal as a response—deepens understanding and validates her unorthodox method. However, the escalation is primarily cognitive rather than enacted under rising pressure; no live option is visibly foreclosed, and the cost (delaying her report) is soft. The gravitational anomaly complicates but does not force a trade-off with felt stakes. Agency is present but operates more as patient discovery than decision under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of filtering and refinement through adversity emerges organically from Mira's career reassignment, the anomaly's distorting properties, and the pen as inherited wisdom. The closing insight—"every wrong turn was a form of filtering"—reweights prior material without stating a moral, and the final image of listening to the universe's breath offers resonant closure. Subtext operates in the pen ritual and the "strange comfort" of uncertainty. Minor slip: "planting the wrong seeds" as metaphor is stated rather than fully earned through scene particulars, and the epiphany arrives somewhat tidily without the friction of competing interpretations. Still, the thematic question (what meaning survives distortion?) is answered through image and event.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with Mira's perceptual signature (patient, metaphor-inclined, comfort-seeking) consistent. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "whispers of distant suns," "threshing meaning from experience." No dialogue present. Filter verbs ("she had learned," "she thought") are frequent but voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy in the key signal-work beats. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and wider reflection. One slip: "the way this particular frequency seemed to search for something" momentarily grants the signal quasi-agency in a way that blurs whether this is Mira's interpretation or narratorial assertion. Rhythmic control is steady, though the reflective middle stretch risks flattening momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are generally strong; information density is high in the signal-work passages. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: the pen's lack of ink is stated twice in close proximity ("no longer held ink" / "dried nib"), and "strange comfort" recurs across paragraphs without advancing pressure. Template cadence in reflective beats: "She had been assigned… She had learned… She did not mind…" creates a flat rhythm. Minor metaphor muddle: "folded into itself like origami made of radio waves" is vivid but the physics contradict (origami implies discrete folds; radio waves are continuous). These artifacts do not touch the closure beat but accumulate across the middle third. Apply −0.8 for distinct loop and template issues under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly as filter rather than obstacle offers a fresh angle on the "misfit finds purpose" template, and the pen as ritual object without function (no ink) is a specific, non-obvious detail. The signal interpreter profession and contingent-relationship method add occupational texture. However, the emotional arc—outcast finds validation through patient work—follows a familiar trajectory without bold transformation. The Proxima Centauri backstory and "wrong seeds" metaphor feel somewhat Generic Writing Exercise. The piece synthesizes its elements competently but does not take the structural or perspectival risks that would elevate originality into the high band. No close echoes of famous material; conceptual integrity is solid.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira (celestial signal interpreter) is present throughout and her choices drive the resolution: she adjusts her method, traces contingent relationships, and recognizes the signal as a response. Setup clear, development across two beats (frequency adjustment, method shift), payoff shapes the ending epiphany. Causal pressure moderate: her interpretive stance enables the discovery but no high-stakes decision with visible cost. The role is integral but the interpreter work is more passive observation than active choice under duress, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pen appears in three beats: initial carry as heirloom, ritual uncapping during signal work, and capping after findings saved. Setup by first third, development as ritual anchor (touching nib, feeling warmth), payoff when she caps it and reflects on grandfather and filtering. The pen's "exotic nib" and dried state matter thematically (memory without function) but do not constrain a tactical choice or alter the signal-work outcome. Purposeful early-final reprise reweights meaning (inherited wisdom → filtered clarity) but lacks causal pressure. Scores mid-band for strong thematic integration without mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Core concept "editing history" is absent or deeply oblique. The story centers on interpreting a signal and reframing a career error, not altering recorded events or revising the past. If "editing" is read metaphorically as reinterpreting her mistake, it remains thematic echo only—no on-page action edits a record or changes a documented fact. The concept does not shape stakes, constrain choices, or appear in closure. Ornamental at best.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" is labeled early ("learned to be confidently uncertain") and informs her patient, non-standard method (tracing relationships vs. isolating frequencies). Setup present, development shown in her two-hour work without demanding immediate clarity, payoff in her comfort with the "strange comfort of uncertainty." The trait enables her approach but does not constrain a specific choice with visible cost—she never faces a forced trade-off between certainty and action. Functional across beats but replaceable with "patient" or "flexible" without structural loss. Scores mid-band for presence and thematic fit without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Unbend" is signaled early (signal "folded into itself," "unbending the signal's folds"), drives the two-hour work sequence, and the resolution hinges on successfully unbending to reveal the response. Setup clear, development across the method shift and tracing patterns, payoff when resolution arrives. Causal role in the climax is strong. However, the action could be swapped for "decode," "unfold," or "resolve" with minor thematic adjustment and no plot break—the exotic verb is purposeful but not mechanically unique. Scores solid for driving the turn but not indispensable in strict terms.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Through contingent relationships" is signaled midway as Mira's method (tracing how one signal echoes another, peaks/valleys creating meaning through relative positions) and explicitly contrasted with standard isolation. Development: her two-hour work employs this approach. Payoff: the method enables recognition of the response. Setup delayed until second third (−0.3), but the method shapes her tactics and differentiates her from instructors who dismissed it. Causal pressure moderate; the specifics of "contingent" work are asserted more than demonstrated with granular technique. Scores mid-6s for functional integration without deep mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is present from the second sentence, distorts all electromagnetic frequencies, and Mira is assigned there precisely because signals arrive "bent and strange." Setup immediate, development across the signal work (anomaly tangles origins/destinations, bends the signal), payoff at closure when she realizes the anomaly "filtered" and "refined" rather than broke the signal, reweighting its role from obstacle to necessary constraint. The anomaly is causally essential: without it, the signal would be ordinary noise. Irreplaceable; story logic fails without this exact setting. Strong closure linkage and causal pressure push into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After planting the wrong seeds" (the Proxima Centauri misidentification) is backstory that frames Mira's motivation and current assignment. Setup by first third, thematic reprise in the closing reflection ("seeds she had planted in error"). The timeframe does not tighten present decisions or create a live clock; it contextualizes but does not pressure the signal work. No middle beat where the past error constrains a current choice. Functional as motivation but swappable with any career setback. Scores low-mid band for thematic presence without tactical or temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To thresh meaning from experience" is stated midway as Mira's work and recurs in her reflection on separating grain from chaff. Setup delayed until middle, development in the two-hour unbending effort, payoff when she achieves resolution and reflects on filtering. The desire is dramatized through her patient method and non-standard approach, though internal friction between wants (vindication?) and costs (isolation, slow recognition) is muted. Functional across beats but the motivational conflict is more acceptance than struggle. Scores mid-6s for presence and thematic fit without high-stakes dramatization of competing desires.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Strange comfort" is introduced early (comfort in "working where the rules bent"), modulates through the signal work (pen warmth, thrill of pursuit), and anchors the closing image ("strange comfort of uncertainty… strange comfort settling over her"). Setup clear, tone coherent across beats, payoff when the phrase reappears and charges the final moment of listening to the universe. The oxymoron sustains emotional texture and supports the theme of uncertainty as asset. Tone does not shift mechanically but deepens from acceptance to gratitude. Strong reprise and closure linkage; the exact pairing (strange + comfort) is load-bearing for the ending's emotional register.</comment>
