<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied ("ripple-mark skin tingled with borrowed energy"), and her mapkeeper training shapes her perception consistently. The choice to use the echo chamber stone and produce the tone feels earned by her professional skill set, though the emotional progression toward "hammered repose" arrives quickly without sustained internal contradiction. Minor issue: the moment of inviting the bloom reads slightly more procedural than conflicted, dampening the felt cost of her isolation before finding refuge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (Mira, deepest cavern, months after arrival). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through sensory detail, crack-pattern reading, and stone warmth until the spiral formation crystallizes the bloom of hush. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid)—Mira rests within the silence she found, forecloses the path of constant noise, and promises to return tomorrow with others. Cost is felt (months of chaos, survivors hiding, her own accumulated noise) and the final image reweights the echo chamber stone's purpose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The harmonic caves constrain Mira's search, and the frozen pool's crack patterns become the method through which she locates the bloom. The echo chamber stone functions as both tool and micro-setting element, its warmth guiding her to the spiral formation. Sensory hierarchy reflects her mapkeeper training (fingertip temperature discrimination, vibrational currents). The ice at the spiral's heart is the pivot for the final act, charging the closure image with concrete physical anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: find a bloom of hush as refuge from the energy beings' unceasing bombardment. One meaningful tightening occurs when the spiral pattern is recognized as formation rather than damage, narrowing the search to a specific method (pressing stone, producing tone). The cost is legible—months of accumulated frequency, survivors suffering—and Mira's agency (choosing to breach the shrine's sanctity, producing the mapkeeper tone) drives the bloom's emergence. The resolution feels more discovery than trade-off, slightly softening the escalation's bite.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the opposition of resonance and silence, the physics of null points, the echo chamber stone's true purpose revealed in paradox (not to amplify but to find quiet). The final image offers a non-literal answer to "how to survive constant noise"—by locating convergence points where opposing forces cancel. No overt moralizing; the bloom of hush functions conceptually as both physical phenomenon and thematic repricing of survival. Slight dependency on prompt vocabulary ("bloom of hush," "hammered repose") in key positions, but the integration with crack-pattern method and mapkeeper lore grounds it in scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and filtered through Mira's mapkeeper expertise; perceptual signature is consistent (vibrational currents, harmonic analysis). Diction is controlled and lyric ("silence into a forgotten luxury," "nothing-song") with purposeful elevation that matches the meditative closure. Minor wobble: "gently luminous" and "concentric circles that seemed to breathe" edge toward stock mystical phrasing without sharp sensory grounding, and the final paragraph's "nothing-song" risks poeticism over precision. No dialogue; interiority remains clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates well (long, layered sentences in exposition compress to shorter beats during discovery). Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (crack patterns = diagnostic method + thematic resonance). However, paraphrase loops appear: "relentless waves of light and sound" / "unceasing bombardment" restate the same pressure within two paragraphs, and "silence into a forgotten luxury" / "remembered what it felt like to exist without...frequency" echo closely. Template stems recur in the opening ("The beings themselves remained," "The mapkeeper's life had prepared"). These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull propulsion in non-closure beats. Apply −0.6 for loops and stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of crack-pattern reading (geological method) + acoustic null points (physics) + mapkeeper lore offers a specific angle on "finding sanctuary from overwhelming stimuli." The bloom of hush as convergent cancellation rather than mere absence is a strong conceptual move. However, the energy-beings-arrive premise and the sacred-relic-in-crisis setup follow familiar SFF templates, and the story does not deeply personalize Mira's internal conflict beyond her professional skill set. The final image is resonant but predictable given the setup. Solid execution within a recognizable frame; no bold structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's choice to pull the echo chamber stone from the shrine (breach of sacred vows), her decision to kneel and trace the ice cracks, and her act of producing the mapkeeper tone all drive key beats. Her observation feeds directly into action (recognizing the spiral as formation, not damage), and the closure depends on her agency. Present early, shapes the middle method beat, and executes the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The echo chamber stone appears in beat one (pulled from shrine), warms and pulses in beat two (responding to the spiral), and is pressed against the ice in the climactic act where Mira produces the tone. Its purpose is reweighted at closure: "not to amplify sound, but to find the quiet in the storm." Specificity (concentric circles, luminosity) matters to the method and final image. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bloom of hush is the dominant stake and shapes tactics throughout: Mira seeks it in the deepest cavern, the old texts guide her search, the spiral formation is recognized as the bloom taking shape, and she invites it by method. The concept is tested on the page (converging frequencies create null points, energy beings cannot exist in true silence) and the closure is the bloom's emergence. Strong causal linkage and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Gently luminous" describes the echo chamber stone and signals its active state when it "intensifies until the ice...seemed to glow." The luminosity enables the discovery (makes the spiral visible) and marks the stone's response to the convergence point. However, the trait does not impose a visible cost or constrain a choice; it functions as indicator rather than lever. Present across beats but mid-band for causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Conjure" is reframed on the page as "invite" rather than command, and the act (pressing stone + producing tone) is the climactic turn that brings the bloom into being. The action is prepared by mapkeeper training and drives the resolution. However, the phrasing "did not so much conjure...as invite" slightly hedges the element's exactness, and a near-synonym like "summon" or "call forth" could replace it with minor tonal edits. Strong closure linkage but moderate swappability lowers the ceiling slightly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Examining crack patterns in ice is signaled early ("by examining crack patterns in ice, a mapkeeper could read...stresses"), executed in the key middle beat (Mira traces fractures, distinguishes impact from rhythmic pressure, identifies the spiral), and the spiral's precision is what reveals the bloom's formation site. The method is irreplaceable and tied to Mira's professional skill; without it, the discovery mechanism fails. High specificity, causal pressure, and closure necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The harmonic caves supply the context (sacred chambers, vibrational currents, damaged passages) and the deepest cavern is the discovery site. The frozen pool and its ice are the physical medium for the crack-pattern method and the bloom's emergence. The caves' acoustic properties enable the null-point physics. Setting constrains the search (she came to the deepest cavern because texts spoke of blooms there) and participates in the ending (the cavern holds the silence). Strong functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "months since the energy beings arrived" establishes urgency (survivors hiding, ears stuffed with cloth) and motivates Mira's search. The three-month silence of the echo chamber stone marks the duration of crisis. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions within the scene; no clock or countdown presses Mira's moves in the cavern itself. Present and motivating but does not shape on-page tactics beyond establishing backstory pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira's desire to find quiet is dramatized through her search, her sensitivity to the stone's song, and her years of mapping vibrational currents. The motivation is tested on the page (she pulls the sacred stone, risks the cavern's dangers, performs the method) and shapes her choices. The final rest within the bloom fulfills the want. Slight weakness: internal friction is minimal; she pursues the goal with professional confidence rather than conflicting impulses. Strong presence but limited complexity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Hammered repose" is explicitly named in the penultimate paragraph and coheres with the piece's lyric, meditative cadence: long sentences, layered description, the slow pulse of the stone, the final "nothing-song." Tone modulates from urgency ("unbearable," "relentless") to stillness ("cool water," "gentle light") as pressure resolves. The closure image charges the tone with cost (months of chaos forged this quiet). However, the phrase itself arrives late and reads slightly imposed rather than emergent from prior diction. Strong tonal control with minor late-label friction.</comment>
