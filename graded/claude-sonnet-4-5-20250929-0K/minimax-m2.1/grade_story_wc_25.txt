<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is consistently grounded in sensory particulars—"steel groaned in fog," she can identify Dmitri's walk from fifty meters—and her decisions flow from established competence and loss. The zodiac coin and key carry intentional weight without therapeutic self-analysis. Minor slip: the final moment with Captain Reyes offers validation rather than internal contradiction, softening what could have been a harder-won stance. The closure choice feels clean but the path to it is a bit too frictionless given eleven years of whispered authority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors quickly (port, storm, radio failure). Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "something had shifted in the hierarchy of knowledge" crystallizes the reweighting of old networks over technology with felt social cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when Reyes's challenge becomes vindication. Cost is conceptual and relational—his admission "carried the particular weight of a man who had been wrong"—legible but somewhat muted on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vividly particular: "which doors stuck in humidity, which floors accumulated ice," violet storm-light on corrugated steel. Micro-setting through the annotated maps and the catwalk constrains her choices—she uses memorized routes when GPS fails. The geomagnetic storm pressures every tactic. Spatial choreography remains clear across multiple locations. The setting charges the final image: Mira on the catwalk, watching container walls shudder, embodying mastery of a space that demanded "old knowledge."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: "whispers travel farther than shouts" frames the challenge against official channels. One meaningful tightening: the storm disables all tech, forcing reliance on the whisper network. Agency is clear—Mira's decision to trust her annotated maps and send workers by word alone. The cost is conceptual (proving her network against Reyes's hierarchy) but remains somewhat abstract; we see two hundred workers guided but the escalation reads more as validation than a narrowing gauntlet. The reversal when Reyes concedes lands cleanly but the path feels more accumulative than pressured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely from the contrast between technological failure and embodied knowledge—"the oldest networks...could not be disrupted by any solar flare." The final image (Mira pocketing the key, descending into the maze) offers a resonant non-literal answer: continuity of practice over momentary victory. Subtext operates well in the coin's warmth and Reyes's unreadable face. Minor issue: the final paragraph edges toward overt statement—"proven that the oldest networks" declares rather than lets the reader infer. The thematic question is coherent but the answer is slightly over-explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: Mira notices "the cartography of someone who had walked every meter until it became memory," identifies colleagues by gait, reads steel's groan. Psychic distance is stable; diction remains consistent and voice-particular ("calculus of sound," "mycelium through soil"). The single exchange with Reyes carries subtext and goal pursuit. Dialogue feels natural and advances plot. Rhythm modulates well under pressure. One small slip: "the weight of that statement hanging between them" tells the effect rather than trusting the line itself to land.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language (mycelium, sea-goat climbing upward) is controlled. Minor scaffold detected: "not with official symbols but with her own notation" and the adjacent explanation feel slightly redundant. "The key was different" as a paragraph opener is functional but template-like. One paraphrase loop: the key's uselessness is restated across two sentences without added pressure. The final image is clean. Overall strong but a few seams reduce propulsion slightly in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of geomagnetic storm + analog knowledge + whisper network offers a fresh angle on technology-versus-tradition material. Mira's ability to identify walks and the annotated maps are specific and memorable. The zodiac coin and heirloom key add texture without forced quirk. Risk: the piece commits to a quieter, accumulative structure. Weakness: the core opposition (whisper network vs. official channels) and the "old ways prove superior in crisis" arc are familiar; transformation comes through detail rather than a bold conceptual leap. The final affirmation feels earned but not surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira (labyrinth maintenance worker) drives all key turns: she accepts Reyes's challenge, deploys her annotated maps when GPS fails, sends workers via whisper, and her choices validate the network. Her expertise (identifying walks, knowing which doors stick) enables the evacuation tactics. Present in setup, middle coordination, and the catwalk closure with Reyes. The role is causally indispensable—remove it and the premise collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Zodiac coin appears in two beats: Mira holds it mid-storm ("weight of intention") and feels it warm at closure ("as if her father's spirit had finally approved"). Both uses are reflective rather than action-driving. The coin does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as emotional anchor and thematic echo. Swappable with any talismanic object. Late payoff is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Folded maps shape stakes and tactics on the page: "more accurate than any digital schematic," annotated with humidity doors and ice floors, they enable Mira's navigation when GPS dies. Setup early, used in the middle (she unfolds them, trusts them), and implicit in the ending mastery. The concept is specific and causally active—remove the maps and her method becomes generic. Not fully indispensable (memory could substitute) but integral to the evacuation logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ability to identify people's walks appears in two beats: Mira can pick out Dmitri's drag from fifty meters, and she has memorized "the specific cadence of each person's walk." This trait underpins the trust network but does not drive an on-page choice where cost hinges on recognition. It enriches characterization and world but remains more atmospheric than plot-critical. Functional presence across setup and middle; no closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The challenge ("You think your whisper network can coordinate an evacuation faster than my official channels?") defines the central conflict, motivates Mira's tactics, and frames the closure when Reyes concedes. Setup early, pressure throughout, validated at the end. The entire story pivots on this action; remove it and the stakes dissolve. Essential across all three gates with clear causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The key with no lock is mentioned in setup (Mira tried every door, found none) and reappears at closure ("pocketed the key one last time"). Thematic function: "not everything useful has an obvious function." It does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; purely symbolic. The reprise charges the ending image slightly but the element remains swappable with any heirloom. Ornamental use despite two touches.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is indispensable: its scale and complexity create the navigation problem, humidity and ice details enable Mira's expertise, sound corridors and violet storm-light texture every beat, and the catwalk closure spatializes the hierarchy shift. Setup immediate, pressures all middle choices (GPS failure makes the maze lethal), charges the final image. Remove it and the story has no mechanism. Strong causal integration and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The geomagnetic storm begins three hours before the narrative and rages until "by dawn" closure. It disables all GPS and radio, forcing reliance on Mira's analog methods—direct causal pressure on tactics. Violet storm-light colors key beats. Setup early, active throughout, implicit in the ending's tech-versus-tradition payoff. Time is tracked loosely (three hours, midnight, dawn) but the storm's presence tightens every decision. Essential to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation ("whispers travel farther than shouts") is stated early, dramatized through her coordination moves (three workers sent east by whispered word, two hundred guided), and validated when Reyes admits "the whispers worked." The desire drives all on-page choices and shapes the ending's conceptual cost (hierarchy shift). Setup, development, and payoff all present. Friction is light—Mira's confidence never wavers—but the motivation is causally central and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tone of "calculated spontaneity" is signaled on the page: "every step a decision, every turn an improvisation grounded in years of preparation." The diction balances precision (annotated maps, specific gait memory) with fluid action (moving through the maze, whispers spreading). Tone modulates slightly under storm pressure but remains consistent. It charges the final image (descending to continue work) but does not deepen dramatically. Present across beats; coherent but not transformative at closure.</comment>
