<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren's "warmly observant" trait is established early but functions primarily as label rather than driving contradictory impulses in scene. Her stone-stacking choice feels motivated by backstory (grandmother) rather than present pressure testing her reticence against immediate cost. The final act of stacking stones lacks visible struggle or foreclosed alternative; she simply executes what the lighthouse "needs" without embodied hesitation or trade-off. Interior voice remains consistent but never forces Maren into a mistake or credible endurance that would narrow options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (skipper, lighthouse, weekly provisions). The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: stone discoveries layer toward a ritual understanding, culminating in Maren's offering that reignites the lamp. However, the closure—lamp flickers to life, grandmother's presence dissolves—reads as coincidental reward rather than earned Resonant Reconfiguration; no visible cost or foreclosed path accompanies the light's return. The cause-effect chain (stones ask for help → Maren places sea glass and stacks stones → lamp fires) lacks dramatized resistance or price, weakening the Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The lantern room's feverish stones and "ghost of the great lamp's heat" supply atmospheric pressure. Sea glass and stone stacks recur with spatial coherence (dock, supply room, stairs, lantern room). The lighthouse-as-mourner conceit colors perception but does not constrain a tactical choice at the closure beat; Maren's final stone placement unfolds without environmental obstacle. Occupational detail (supply skipper, weekly provisions) anchors plausibly but remains thin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reignite the lamp to honor the drowned—is signaled by midpoint. Pressure accumulates through stone discoveries, yet the escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; Maren learns the tradition from Ashford and enacts the ritual without on-page complication or cost. The lamp's restoration occurs immediately upon her final stone placement, with no failed attempt or visible price (she retains the sea glass metaphorically but loses nothing tangible). No meaningful reversal narrows options before closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing and honoring the dead emerges through stone stacks and Ashford's histories. The sea-glass offering as "bottled safety" and the grandmother's dissolution into light carry symbolic weight, but the final paragraph's "voices heard, their sacrifices witnessed" borders on thematic echo, labeling what the ritual already showed. The ending reweights prior lighthouse-mourning material yet the resonance depends on assertion ("finally rest") rather than a non-literal image that makes the cost undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; Maren's perceptual filter (barnacles shifting, gulls' storm calls) establishes her observational idiom early. "Luminescent ache" and "breathing thing" fog are purposeful texture. However, lines like "the method of communication that transcended life and death" and "bottle the feeling of safety" drift toward elevated summary that exceeds Maren's taciturn voice under pressure. Ashford's brief dialogue feels functional but not distinctly voiced. Distance control holds; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening sentence grounds voice and stakes cleanly. Paraphrase loop: "The stones asked for help, and Maren understood immediately what they needed" followed by extended explanation of what she understood—mild redundancy. "Liminal spaces where land surrendered to water" and "fossilized prayers" are vivid but cluster with "breathing thing," "ghost of heat," "luminescent ache" in quick succession, creating figurative density that slows momentum in the lantern-room beat. Clarity remains intact; no grammar errors. "Pockets were heavier with meaning than they had ever been with cargo"—the final line's metaphorical neatness undercuts concrete charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse, ancestral sea-glass talisman, and stones-as-messages combine familiar maritime-gothic motifs without sharp transformation. The grandmother's unfinished business and Maren's inherited pull are competently executed but track close to well-worn "returning to complete the ancestor's task" templates. The stone-stacking tradition offers a fresh communication method, yet its mechanics remain vague (how does stacking seven stones differ from six?), limiting specificity. Emotional arc feels predictable: discover ritual, enact it, light returns, peace descends—no risk that complicates or subverts expectation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maren (reticent supply skipper) is present throughout and her weekly run frames the visit. Her reticence is mentioned but does not constrain a key choice; she speaks little yet acts without visible struggle between silence and intervention. The stone-placement choice is hers, but the decision feels guided by Ashford's explanation rather than her own tactical shift. Functional but somewhat passive; she enacts rather than turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sea glass appears early (paragraph 3 setup), pressed to the lamp housing (middle use), and implied in the final offering. Three touches across the arc. However, its exact role in the closure is oblique—does she leave it, or merely press it as symbolic gesture? The text says "give it to the sea as an offering" but does not show the physical act of relinquishment. Swappable with any heirloom token; no unique property (shape, transparency, etc.) alters tactics. Present in closure zone but without irreplaceable causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Anonymous letter chain is introduced mid-story (paragraph 4) as backstory ("tradition had always existed here") rather than shaping Maren's present tactics. The stone stacks function as the method, and the "letter chain" label adds little mechanical specificity—what letters? The concept echoes thematically (silent communication for reticent people) but does not constrain Maren's choices; she learns of it, then enacts the ritual once without complication. Late, largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is stated in paragraph 1 and demonstrated (barnacles, gulls). It enables her to notice the stone stacks, but that noticing is a given for any protagonist in this scenario. No on-page moment where her warmth trades off against reticence under pressure, or where observation forces a costly decision. Label-present, functionally thin.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Protect appears in paragraph 3: "protecting this lighthouse's memory without knowing it." The verb frames Maren's inherited drive and her final act (stacking stones, offering sea glass) serves that protection. However, the action is told retrospectively rather than tested—what did she risk or lose by choosing to protect? Her protection unfolds as fulfillment, not contested choice. Present in closure but lacks visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stone-stacking is introduced early (paragraph 2), recurs at each story beat (dock, supply room, stairs, lantern room), and Maren's seven-stone stack at closure directly triggers the lamp. The method is specific and causal. However, its mechanics remain vague—why seven? what makes the balance "impossible"? The tradition is explained by Ashford rather than discovered through Maren's trial. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but specificity and earned cost are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Lantern room (haunted, feverish stones, lamp housing) is the closure setting and supplies atmospheric charge. The room's warmth and "ghost of heat" color perception. However, the space does not constrain Maren's final act—no locked door, broken stair, or environmental cost. It functions as symbolic arena rather than tactical pressure. Present in closure but passive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the lamp flickers out" (three weeks dark, weekly provisions) sets the situation. The darkness is the inciting problem and the lamp's return marks closure. However, elapsed time during Maren's visit is unmarked; no ticking clock or urgency shapes her choices. The timeframe is static context rather than live pressure. Setup and closure present, middle development thin.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Bottle the feeling of safety" appears late (paragraph 5) as stated motivation. It connects to grandmother's loss and the final offering, but is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants. No on-page moment where Maren's desire for safety clashes with cost of the ritual or with her reticence. The motivation is asserted at closure without prior friction. Told-only, late.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is named in paragraph 6 and dissipates at closure, replaced by "something steadier, something that looked like peace." The tone is coherent (elegiac, maritime-gothic) and modulates from mourning to resolution. However, the shift occurs in summary rather than charged image; the ache is declared to fade rather than shown dissolving through a concrete sensory turn. Tone supports closure but does not fully embody the final reconfiguration.</comment>
