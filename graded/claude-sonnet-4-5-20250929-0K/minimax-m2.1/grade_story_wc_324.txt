<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's professional role is established but her interiority leans on elevated diction ("negotiations between worlds," "persistently curious attention") rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to "run" at the end feels unmotivated—what cost does she pay, what path does she foreclose? Vera receives strong embodied grief (trembling hands, the whispered belief), but Elena's shift from procedural distance to urgency lacks micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is timely (who, where, when by paragraph two). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration: "the dead did not call to be answered—they called to be heard." However, the final paragraph tells us Elena "found Margot's message" and "understood finally" without showing what she finds or how it changes her options—the cost is conceptual but not made undeniable on the page. The causal lens wobbles: does the hearing aid preserve a literal recording, or is this metaphor? The piece does not commit, and the ending's causality (what Elena discovers in the mist, what it forecloses) remains vague.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight anchors mood and stakes effectively. The observation room with "equipment sensitive enough to register frequencies" functions as micro-setting that enables the plot turn. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the final beat ("the place where the girl had last stood") introduces an unmarked location. The hearing aid as object-setting charges the closure attempt, lifting the score above pure description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Elena's task to trace Margot's thread. One escalation occurs when the whisper emerges ("The atrium. Tonight. Come find me."), forcing Elena to act. However, the final beat does not show a tightening or trade-off—Elena "understood finally" without an on-page choice that forecloses a path. The phrase "to protect vulnerable voices" is told as mission statement rather than tested under pressure, and no visible cost lands in the ending image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of grief, connection, and listening emerges through image and event. "The dead did not call to be answered—they called to be heard" approaches resonance but is stated rather than imaged. The hearing aid and the atrium offer concrete particulars, and the incidental-heroism concept integrates obliquely. The final paragraph tilts toward moralizing ("she understood finally") when a charged image without assertion would have landed harder.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elena. Voice carries elevated diction ("negotiations between worlds," "liminal hour," "moth wings against glass") that feels consistent but occasionally drifts above a working contact tracer's likely register. Vera's whispered line and the hearing-aid message carry subtext, but Elena's interior stays smooth and analytical even at the climactic turn. No head-hopping, and the perceptual signature (grief softened, shadows pooled, impossible lightness) is consistent, though not always character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and several images are vivid ("shadows pooled like spilled ink," "pulse, soft as moth wings against glass"). However, repeated template stems appear: "Elena had seen…," "Elena had been hired…," "Elena understood…" The phrase "the reel of hush that settled" is opaque. The final paragraph loops concepts ("threads," "tracing," "calling," "heard") without propelling new information. Density is uneven, with some beats doing double duty and others restating.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise of a contact tracer for emotional/metaphysical threads offers a fresh angle, and the hearing-aid method is specific. However, the execution leans on familiar grief-work tropes (the wise mediator, the photograph, the twilight liminal space) without transforming them through sharply particular character choices or a non-obvious moral calculus. The ending reconfigures meaning obliquely, but "incidental heroism" and "protect vulnerable voices" remain prompt-like abstractions rather than lived stakes that the character wrestles with on the page.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena's role frames the story and she makes two decisions: to take the case and to run to the atrium. Both are signaled but neither involves visible cost or a trade-off that alters later tactics. The profession is descriptive scaffolding more than a constraint that shapes her final choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The photograph appears in beat one (Vera hands it over) and is mentioned again ("the photograph forgotten on the table"). It establishes Margot's identity but does not return with reweighted meaning or constrain a choice. Swappable with any keepsake.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Incidental heroism" is named in the text ("some heroes never intended to be heroic") and frames Elena's stance, but it does not create a tactical choice or cost on the page. The concept is thematically present but does not alter options or narrow the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Persistently curious attention" is told in paragraph two and implied when Elena adjusts dials and listens closely. It enables her to detect the whisper but does not impose a visible trade-off or cost. Label-plus-illustration rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elena assures Vera ("she assured Vera that she would find something"), which sets the expectation and stakes. The assurance reappears obliquely when Elena runs to fulfill it. However, the act of assuring is not causally tested—no moment where the promise costs Elena or forces her to choose between competing goods.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The hearing-aid method is signaled early, demonstrated in the observation-room beat, and delivers the pivotal whisper. It shapes the middle turn and the ending depends on its output. However, the mechanics remain vague (pulse-tracking, frequency-shifting, "impossible message"), so irreplaceability is moderate. Present in setup, development, and payoff, but swappable with any listening device if the prose were adjusted.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight anchors mood and frames the opening and closing. The setting provides atmosphere but does not constrain Elena's choices or supply a resource that alters outcome. The "place where the girl had last stood" is named at the end without prior spatial grounding, so closure linkage is asserted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"When the dead call" is introduced as "that liminal hour" and situates the opening. Time does not tighten tactics or create a ticking clock. The phrase returns obliquely in the final beat ("the dead did not call to be answered") as theme rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To protect vulnerable voices" is stated in paragraph six and reprised in the final beat. It names Elena's mission but is not dramatized through conflicting wants or a choice that tests it with cost. Told rather than enacted under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Reeling hush" is not named but the tone of quiet, suspended grief coheres across the piece. The atrium's collective breath, the mist, and the faint pulses modulate consistently. The final image attempts to charge this tone, though the shift to understanding and assertion softens it slightly. Tone is coherent and supports pressure without strong modulation at peak beats.</comment>
