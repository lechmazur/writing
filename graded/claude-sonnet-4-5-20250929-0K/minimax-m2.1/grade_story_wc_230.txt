<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her rationale for seeking the cure is established through reflection, but the piece lacks genuine internal contradiction or embodied struggle. Her "involuntary truthfulness" is asserted but never constrains an on-page choice or creates visible cost. The reflective passages dominate without meaningful micro-choices that alter present options; her climb and study feel predetermined rather than forced by conflicting impulses. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs—she simply continues her established pattern.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural mode with heavy reflection about the past virus and the orchard's symbolic persistence. Orientation is delayed—who Mira is and what she's doing now emerge gradually through backstory rather than concrete anchors. The closure is a quiet settling into study with symbolic resonance ("some things persisted"), which reads as Earned Stasis, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; no live option is visibly foreclosed. The ~50% reflection flattens present-tense pressure despite the BRR exception allowance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The hanging orchard is vividly rendered with specific detail—trees rooted in granite, storm damage, the hollow in the trunk. Sensory selection reflects Mira's forager expertise and the ravine's precarious physicality. The setting does constrain her route and provides the hiding place for supplies, giving it mild tactical relevance. However, the spatial choreography is somewhat abstract; we don't track her body's precise movements through the wreckage, and the setting's role in the final image is more symbolic than materially constraining.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety by finding the rumored cure—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; Mira climbs, reflects, and arrives at the hollow without meaningful obstacle orChoice under pressure. The "storm had battered this place" is past-tense description, not present escalation. The ending offers symbolic persistence rather than a decision that forecloses options or reveals cost. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification is expected but not delivered; the piece circles its premise rather than deepening it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the orchard-as-metaphor and Mira's reflections on isolation versus connection. The final image—"her truthfulness a quiet rebellion"—offers a non-literal answer to the central question about surviving emotional catastrophe. However, the piece leans heavily on the empathy-virus concept without dramatizing its cost in present action; the theme is more asserted through exposition than earned through scene pressure. The orchard's symbolic weight is purposeful but borders on overt allegory. Subtext operates more in image than in action or dialogue (none present).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV with stable third-limited focalization and a distinct texture: "fractured but functional, damaged but directed, graceful in the broken way." Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with purposeful metaphoric density. However, perceptual signature is somewhat generic—Mira's forager lens is asserted but not embodied in how she uniquely notices the world. Register occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("the patient architecture of persistence") that feels authorial rather than character-grounded. No dialogue to test distinction. Psychic distance remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied syntax and strong imagery ("mouth had become an open wound, bleeding sincerity"). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: the orchard's persistence is restated three times across paragraphs without added pressure; "fractured but functional, damaged but directed" exemplifies synonym churn. Template cadence in reflection: "She remembered... She remembered... She had adapted..." Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff, especially in non-peak beats. Information density is moderate; several paragraphs describe without advancing situation. The scaffold sentences lower momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The empathy-virus premise is fresh and the "involuntarily truthful" trait offers potential, but the execution leans on familiar post-apocalyptic-forager and symbolic-ruins templates. The glass-eye relic and discredited-textbook cure echo common speculative tropes without transformation through unique world logic or moral calculus. Emotional specificity is present in the premise but not in Mira's on-page experience, which reads as meditative catalog rather than urgent choice. The orchard's symbolic role is purposeful but predictable. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece chooses lyric resonance over dramatized stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is identified as a forager whose rationality translates survival ("symbiotic networks, underground connections"), and she navigates the ravine with "practiced efficiency" and readies her knife. However, her foraging skill does not create a key turn; she simply arrives at the hollow. Her rational frame is asserted in reflection but does not constrain or enable a pivotal choice. Present after the 40% mark as active identifier. Functional but largely replaceable with "survivor" or "scientist."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The glass eye appears early in her pocket, is described with backstory about the neurologist, and is placed beside the textbooks in the hollow at the end. Two touches (pocket, placement) but no evolving use or reweighted meaning; it does not constrain action or alter her options. Static relic. Swappable with any smuggled artifact. No causal pressure or closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "smuggled relic" is the glass eye, which border patrol dismissed. Smuggling shapes her backstory and frames the eye's potential as "bridge between isolation and reconnection," but this potential is not tested on the page. The concept echoes in theme and explains her possession of the artifact, participating in one beat (the pocket/patrol memory) and the final placement. Functional setup but no middle development or tactical consequence; she never uses or hides it under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Involuntarily truthful" is asserted: "Her mouth had become an open wound, bleeding sincerity no one wanted to receive." Label-only; no scene demonstrates her compulsion or its cost. It does not constrain an on-page choice or force a visible trade-off. Mentioned once in exposition without dramatization. Ornamental trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Occlude" does not appear as an action in the text. If interpreted as her hiding supplies in the hollow or the empathy virus occluding feeling, neither drives a major turn. The virus occludes empathy in backstory but does not create present obstacles. Her placement of the eye in the hollow is endpoint storage, not an action that redefines options. Absent or peripheral.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "rumored cures in discredited textbooks" are present in the hollow and mentioned in her rationale: "she had spent years studying the rumored cures." Signaled early in backstory and present at closure when she settles to study them. However, the method's mechanics do not shape on-page attempts; she has not yet applied the cure or faced a test of its efficacy. Setup and closure presence but no middle development or tactical constraint. Reaches two-gate threshold but remains passive.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hanging orchard is introduced early, described in physical detail (trees rooted in granite, storm damage, the hollow in the trunk), and is the site of the ending action. It constrains her route (collapsed path, fresh wreckage) and provides the hollow where she stores artifacts. The setting shapes two beats (the climb, the arrival) and is present at closure. Tactical relevance is mild but genuine; the orchard's survival mirrors her own and supplies the hiding place. Not indispensable but purposeful across setup, middle, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"After the empathy virus" frames the premise and explains the world's emotional isolation. The timeframe is backstory context rather than a live constraint; no ticking clock or time pressure shapes her decisions. She reflects on "three years" of storms and "three seasons ago" path collapse, but these are scenic markers, not tactical urgency. Present in setup and thematic throughout but does not tighten on-page choices. Functional backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To cultivate psychological safety" is stated explicitly: "Why cultivate psychological safety in a world that had forgotten what safety meant? Because she remembered." The motivation explains her years of study and her possession of the glass eye, and it contextualizes her final act of settling to study. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. No on-page friction tests this desire; she pursues it without obstacle or sacrifice in the present scene. Setup, thematic presence, and closure framing but no middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Fractured grace" is embodied in diction and imagery: "fractured but functional, damaged but directed, graceful in the broken way of things that had learned to survive." Tone is coherent and modulates with the landscape's beauty-amid-ruin and Mira's reflective determination. The final image—"her truthfulness a quiet rebellion"—sustains the tone and charges it with defiant persistence. However, the tone remains somewhat static across beats; no sharp modulation under peak pressure because no peak pressure occurs. Coherent and purposeful but does not dynamically escalate.</comment>
