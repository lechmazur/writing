<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's agency is present through her choice to stay ("withdrawn consent") and her secret drumming ritual, but motivation clarity wavers—the "quiet rebellion" remains abstract until the final scene. Internal contradiction is underdeveloped; her discomfort with scientists' reductiveness doesn't meaningfully constrain choices on the page. The entangled-memory premise and Mira's dream feel narrated rather than somatically inhabited, reducing embodied stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through setting detail and reflection, culminating in a charged final image. Orientation anchors arrive early (who/where/treatment context). However, closure cost is oblique—the drumming "feeds the dream" and the lagoon pulses, but no on-page choice or renunciation forecloses a live path with felt consequence. The scientists' future wondering is told rather than dramatized, softening the Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly rendered with purpose-driven sensory specificity (harmonic ferns, bass moss, crystalline trunks); the body and the observation platform constrain Elara's perch ritual. The auric lagoon anchors the final image and reweights prior description. One minor spatial question: the lagoon is "beyond the garden's boundary" yet Elara's drumming directly affects it without clear mechanism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—to externalize/realize Mira's dream—is signaled but remains abstract until the ending. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is subtle: the drumming pattern deepens from solo practice to a garden-wide cascade. No live tightening or trade-off narrows Elara's options; she performs the ritual without cost or complication. The scientists' future discovery is mentioned but not dramatized, undercutting closure pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory as entangled bridge and the persistence of shared dreams emerges through concrete images (the childhood signal, the lagoon breathing) without overt moralizing. The final line—"Mira smiled"—attempts resonance but risks sentimentality; it tells the thematic payoff rather than charging it through Elara's present-tense perception. "Auroral sorrow of a universe" in the penultimate paragraph reads as abstract philosophizing that intrudes without grounding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature (frequencies as "secret songs," stars vomited into a basin) is distinctive. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register incongruous with on-page urgency: "auroral sorrow of a universe that had taken too much" reads as authorial rather than Elara's lived syntax. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") cluster in reflective passages but remain voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is often vivid ("vomiting stars," "liquid light") but density suffers from paraphrase loops: "The lagoon was breathing" is stated, then restated as "the lagoon pulsed under starlight." Template cadence appears in the second paragraph ("the harmonic ferns that sang... the bass moss that pulsed... the chiming orchids that required"). Mixed metaphor: "auric rings" and "liquid light" blur visual logic. Final third avoids major artifacts, preserving closure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and entangled-memory treatment offer a fresh synthesis; the childhood drumming signal repurposed as a ritual gesture is specific and earned. However, the premise leans on familiar SFF therapy-space tropes (experimental protocol, guinea pig, neural mapping) without transforming them through grounded occupational or procedural detail. The final image—sister's presence across death via shared consciousness—is emotionally direct but conceptually well-trodden.</comment>
