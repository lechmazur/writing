<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timekeeper's interiority is consistently abstract and poetic but rarely embodied—she "thought about" things rather than experiencing visceral impulses. Her motivation to "understand the texture of time passing" remains declarative; no on-page micro-choice tests competing desires with visible cost. The final "understanding, settling into her chest" reads as an unearned epiphany delivered through assertion rather than dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who, where, when emerge slowly through ~180 words of abstract meditation before "emerald silo" anchors locale, triggering a −0.3 penalty in Q2 and capping Q3 at 7.0. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: the cremation urn fragment seed returns in the final paragraph with thematic reweighting (pause/texture of time), achieving a Conceptual Repricing. However, cost remains conceptual and oblique—no foreclosed path or visible trade-off on the page weakens closure legibility under the CR standard.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The emerald silo's "concentric rings of green glass" and "equations that no longer resolved" create vivid, concept-serving atmosphere. Spatial choreography is vague—her "workspace" appears suddenly in paragraph five without prior anchoring. The urn fragment charges the final image moderately, but the environment itself does not constrain a choice. Cap applies due to Q2 orientation debt: 7.0 ceiling enforced.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; her "rediscovery" three days ago is told in summary, and her garage-sale-listing method never encounters resistance or complication. The ending delivers thematic insight without protagonist agency or visible cost, failing the escalation test for Accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (time as unmeasured pause, existence beyond counting) emerges through image and the urn fragment's recurrence. The final paragraph borders on overt statement—"Time was not a river or a road...Time was the space between breaths"—treading close to moralizing (−0.4 guidance). The conceptual cost is oblique; the insight feels asserted rather than earned through embodied struggle, limiting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically consistent with purpose-driven elevation ("borrowed hours," "hemorrhage meaning"), and POV distance remains stable. However, diction drifts into essay register during reflection—"chronology itself began to hemorrhage meaning," "post-numerical economy of meaning"—clashing with the intimate texture elsewhere. Perceptual signature is present but static; the narrator's way of noticing does not shift under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: paragraph four's "She thought about the person...thought about how time had failed...how strange it was" cycles through restatement without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in paragraph three: "She wrote...She wrote...She wrote" (−0.4). Figurative density in most sentences ("sand through fingers," "wounded birds," "fragmented promises of memory") without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.5). Total artifacts: −1.1, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "timekeeper in a silo studying broken time capsules" premise synthesizes familiar metaphysical-fiction elements without a non-obvious inflection. The garage-sale-listing method is fresh but underdeveloped—mentioned twice, never dramatized as a live attempt with friction. Emotional specificity is absent; the protagonist's arc reads as generic contemplation. Transformation test fails: swap names and setting, the thematic meditation remains unchanged.</comment>
