<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior is dense with abstraction ("blessed pariah," "architect of temporal breakthrough") rather than embodied contradiction. The final "peace" moment arrives through summary rather than a micro-choice under pressure. Her motivation remains told ("confusion into exploration") without dramatized stakes that force competing impulses into collision. The glimpse of her father functions as memory rather than present decision friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density accrues through reflection, pattern, and the final sketching act. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance without fear), but cost remains conceptual and asserted ("blessing and burden merged") rather than legible in a forfeited path or visible sacrifice. Orientation anchors late (~paragraph 2) but remains functional. The shutdown provides backstory pressure but no on-page tightening that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The observation deck, containment fields, and glass window provide spatial grounding. The compass rose and sketchbook recur with purposeful constancy. However, the setting remains postcard: "liminal space between stars" and "great curved window" describe atmosphere without constraining a tactical choice. The final sketching beat charges the space modestly, lifting it above pure backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—turning confusion into exploration—is declared but never tested by a competing pressure or cost on the page. The "glimpse" delivers insight without requiring Mira to forfeit an alternative path. No reversal tightens options; the shutdown is backstory, and the final sketching act unfolds without obstacle or trade-off. Accumulative lens allows this, but pressure remains flat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme (wonder over control, patient exploration) emerges through the compass rose, family custom, and the final sketching image. The "true north" concept shifts from spatial to directional-in-the-soul, a workable Conceptual Repricing. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "not answers, but the courage to keep asking questions" and "true north was not a destination but a way of moving" replace scene pressure with thesis. This lowers resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (sky-watcher idiom, temporal vocabulary) but diction drifts into elevated register: "stretched thin across the fabric of subjective hours," "echoed silence that reverberated." Under the reflective pressure of the ending, syntax remains formal and distanced rather than tightening or varying with emotional intensity. No dialogue on the page.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy reflection dominates (~60% of text) with abstract phrasing: "liminal space," "echoed silence," "blessed pariah," "temporally stretched." Paraphrase loops appear: "the true north she had been seeking" recurs in varied synonyms across three paragraphs. Template cadence in the final paragraph stacks declarations without propulsion. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "understood") cluster in high-density beats, dulling immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the disallow-9+ rule and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The temporal-manipulation scientist seeking "true north" after a shutdown reads as a familiar frame (regret-scientist template). The family sketching custom offers a fresh angle, but its integration remains ornamental until the final beat. The "blessed pariah" label and the abstraction-heavy ending ("direction in the soul") substitute metaphor for earned transformation. Risk-taking is minimal; the piece hedges toward literary safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout but her choices (requesting solitary access, sketching) are low-stakes and unopposed. The "blessed pariah" status is declared but does not constrain action or force a reversal. She observes and reflects rather than deciding under competing pressures. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The compass rose appears in paragraph 1 ("felt heavier"), returns in the climax ("seemed to pulse with warmth"), and is tied thematically to guidance. However, it is never handled or used to constrain a choice—it remains symbolic backdrop. Two-beat presence with closure linkage, but no causal pressure or visible cost. Lyric reprise with modest reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"True north" is seeded early, drives the search across the middle ("fixed point around which all stretched moments revolved"), and is redefined at closure ("not a destination but a way of moving"). It shapes the protagonist's internal stakes and the final realization. However, the concept remains abstract and told; it does not narrow tactical options on the page. Three-beat presence with thematic centrality but weak causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Temporally stretched" appears in paragraph 2 and recurs once ("that temporally stretched instant"). The attribute is described rather than dramatized: no on-page action is enabled or constrained by altered perception of time. It functions as atmospheric label without visible cost or tactical consequence. Present in setup and middle, absent from closure action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "glimpse" arrives mid-story, delivering a vision of her father and alternate futures. It triggers the shift from confusion to clarity. However, the glimpse is a passive receipt of insight rather than an earned turn; Mira does not pursue or resist it. Present in middle and shaping the final realization, but swappable with "memory" or "realization" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The family custom of sketching the night sky is introduced early (paragraph 3), persists as tradition despite the shutdown, and culminates in the final sketching act that embodies the new stance. The mechanics (aged sketchbook, silver pencils, precise strokes) are specific and her final sketch departs from replication ("not as it was but as it might be"). Three-beat presence with closure participation, though the middle beat is summary. Causal pressure modest but closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The time dilation observation deck is named early and provides spatial anchors (windows, containment fields). It houses the action throughout. However, the setting does not constrain or enable a key choice; Mira's solitary access removes obstacle. The "residual temporal anomaly" mentioned once does not affect tactics. Present across all beats but functions as stage rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the shutdown" is signaled in the opening line and provides backstory context throughout. However, the timeframe does not create urgency or tighten decisions—Mira has "stretched hours" and "solitary access" without deadline. The shutdown is a completed event rather than a live constraint. Setup present, but no escalation or closure pressure tied to time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation to turn confusion into exploration is declared mid-story ("confusion… melted away, replaced by cold clarity") and restated at closure ("not answers, but the courage to keep asking questions"). It drives the internal arc but remains abstract and unopposed—no competing desire creates friction. Told rather than dramatized through conflicting micro-choices. Present in middle and ending with thematic centrality but weak embodiment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" is introduced early ("not mere absence of sound but something denser") and recurs in the penultimate paragraph ("In the echoed silence of the time dilation observation deck"). The tone is consistent and modulates subtly from oppressive to contemplative. It charges the final sketching image by framing solitude as necessary rather than punitive. Two-beat presence with closure linkage and moderate resonance.</comment>
