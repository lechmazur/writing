<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The guardian's interiority is label-heavy ("dimensionally homesick," "the ache that lived behind her sternum") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The seventeen-winter vigil and the pendant's arrival set up a change, but the final walk forward reads as abstract transformation without a concrete choice that forecloses a visible path. The protagonist observes and reflects extensively but makes no on-page decision with dramatized cost; "stop waiting and simply walk forward" remains a declaration rather than an enacted trade-off. No secondary character appears to apply pressure or test motive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation (who, where, when) arrives within the first sentence and remains stable. The piece attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the guardian stops waiting and walks into the mist), but the cost is asserted through metaphor rather than demonstrated: no concrete option is foreclosed, no visible price paid on the page. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density increase, pattern break), yet the ending recycles the same waiting/walking motif without a cadence shift or image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. Closure form is present but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The frozen garden in mist is vividly rendered and consistently maintained (mist thickens/thins, ice-covered bench, fog). Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, though weighted almost entirely toward the visual and abstract. The setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the protagonist's final action; it functions as backdrop and symbol rather than tactical pressure. The pendant's warmth contrasts with the cold, but this does not shape the guardian's decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—overcoming dimensional homesickness and ending the wait—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the guardian encounters the pendant, reflects, and then walks forward without a visible trade-off or price. Pressure is declared ("the waiting had become something else") but not dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path. Agency is absent: no decision, renunciation, or endurance with cost appears on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (making friends with uncertainty, threshold as home) is woven through image and motif, avoiding overt statement until the final passages. The ending attempts a resonant answer ("to make friends with uncertainty was the only true guardianship") but crosses into explicit philosophizing rather than letting the image speak. The cultist's pendant and the boundaries of light remain symbolic ornaments rather than particulars that constrain or reweight the central question. Multiple metaphors (prison/threshold, waiting/preparation, veil of sleep/waking) stack without deepening pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric, consistent throughout, though the register ("interiorized exteriors," "foggy lucidity," "generous boundary of light") often drifts into academic abstraction unsuited to a feral guardian's lived experience. Perceptual signature is present (pages tangled in hair, luminescent eyes) but undermined by over-articulate philosophical interiority. Psychic distance remains close but voice lacks contradiction or grit under pressure; syntax is uniformly elaborate across emotional states.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("honey through gauze," "breath held and released," "opium and ash," "silver becoming brightness"), creating density without propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "not a prison but a threshold, not a prison but a generous waiting room, not a prison but a friend" repeats structure without adding pressure. Template cadence runs across multiple beats ("the mist that was also clarity," "a home that was also a journey"). Multiple metaphors within single sentences muddle rather than sharpen ("veil of sleep that was also waking, through the boundaries of light that were also darkness"). Filter verbs and abstract nominalizations ("the quiet grief of being untethered") dull immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure beat, disqualifying 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The feral librarian in a liminal garden combines familiar portal-fantasy and threshold motifs without a fresh synthesis. The cultist's pendant arrives as convenient catalyst rather than emerging from established causality. Emotional specificity is obscured by lyric abstraction; the guardian's transformation could apply to many threshold narratives with minor edits. One fresh inflection—pages tangled in hair as saved seeds—offers tactile particularity, but the piece retreats into generic "journey toward the unknown" language at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The feral library guardian is present throughout and named early. She lifts the pendant, presses it to her chest, tucks it into her hair, and walks forward—but these are gestures of observation and movement rather than choices that narrow options or create turns. No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. She is the focalizer but not an agent who drives reversals.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cultist's pendant appears in the second paragraph, is lifted and pressed to the chest in the third, tucked into hair in the fourth, and mentioned warming against her scalp in the fifth. It returns across multiple beats and is present at closure, but its function remains symbolic (warmth, heartbeat from elsewhere) rather than causal. Removing it would not break plot logic; the walk into mist would proceed. It shapes atmosphere more than stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"The boundaries of light" is named twice and described as blurring/shifting, but it functions as metaphor rather than a constraint or tactical element. The guardian does not navigate, test, or breach a boundary in a way that alters her options. The concept echoes thematically without shaping an on-page choice or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Dimensionally homesick" is named in the first paragraph and revisited in the final line. It labels the guardian's state but does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost. The attribute is told rather than dramatized through a trade-off or friction that alters tactics. It reads as thematic claim rather than an embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Wait" is central: seventeen winters of waiting, "the waiting had become something else," "no longer waiting," "finally moving." The action structures the arc and the ending pivots on ceasing to wait. However, the transition from waiting to moving is declared rather than enacted through a choice with visible cost. The wait itself does not constrain a key beat or force a trade-off; it is the frame rather than the lever.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Interiorizing exteriors" is named once in the third paragraph as a method the guardian has learned, described as "taking the frozen mist into her lungs and making it memory." The mechanics are asserted but not shown in action; we do not see her use this method to solve a problem or alter her state. It appears briefly and ornamentally, without shaping attempts or outcomes.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The frozen garden in mist is established in the opening line, maintained throughout (ice-covered bench, mist parting slightly, fog), and present at closure. It shapes atmosphere and is the sole location. The garden does not supply a resource or constraint that alters the guardian's final action; however, the mist's parting at the end—"not enough to reveal what lay beyond but enough to suggest"—charges the final image and reweights the wait. Strong setup and closure participation with minimal middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Through the veil of sleep" appears in the third and fourth paragraphs as a descriptor of the guardian's state and the garden's liminality. It does not function as a timeframe or clock; no urgency or deadline is tied to it. The phrase is poetic texture rather than a constraint that tightens decisions or alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To make friends with uncertainty" is stated explicitly in the third paragraph and again in the fourth ("the only true guardianship there was"). The motivation is told and thematically central, but not dramatized through conflicting wants or a choice with visible cost. The guardian's walk into uncertainty is the enacted conclusion, but the friction between desire and cost is asserted rather than shown in a beat where she must trade off a competing want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Foggy lucidity is embodied throughout: mist that shifts, the veil of sleep, the grey becoming silver, clarity that is also fog. Tone is dreamlike and layered, coherent across all beats, and modulates slightly at the end when the mist parts and the guardian walks forward. The tone charges the final image and supports the accumulative design, though the uniformly lyric register does not vary with pressure. Strong coherence and closure participation.</comment>
