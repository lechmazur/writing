<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's skepticism is established early and her shift feels earned through concrete experience with the tile, but the transformation lacks sufficient internal friction—she moves from doubt to wonder too smoothly. The interiority is generally concrete ("something shifted in her chest—a loosening of doubt") though occasionally drifts toward stock phrasing. Her final stance preserves skepticism while adding wonder, which reads as credible endurance rather than collapse, but the micro-choices leading there need sharper contradiction to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure—Mira's palm-press and the flow of memories crystallize her transformation from observer to participant. Orientation is anchored early (tower, cliff, bay, whale season). The escalation is a single meaningful deepening: transcription → memory revelation → stance shift. Cost is present but somewhat abstract ("taking and giving in equal measure"); a more concrete forfeiture would strengthen the closure's bite.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tower's open roof and the whale songs below create a coherent spatial pressure that charges the final image effectively. Sensory detail is purposeful (salt winds, cool stone, distant songs) and filtered through Mira's scientific lens. The tile as micro-setting object constrains her action (transcription work) and returns at closure with reweighted meaning. The bay and whales function more as atmosphere than as elements that directly narrow her choices, but the setting coheres well with theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mira's internal conflict between skepticism and wonder—is signaled early and tightens through the transcription scene. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the tile holds generational memories, which reweights her purpose from documentation to participation. Agency is present in her choice to transcribe and press her palm, though the whale migration itself provides coincidental timing rather than direct obstacle. The cost is felt ("skepticism remained...but it had found a companion") but could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tile's discovery and Mira's shift from measurement to participation without overt moralizing. The recurring images (whales, stone, tower) accumulate pressure and the final palm-press reweights prior material effectively. The piece resists tidy resolution by preserving Mira's skepticism alongside wonder. However, phrases like "courageously kind offerings" and "threshold between worlds" lean slightly toward thematic echo, though they don't fully collapse into sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with consistent psychic distance; Mira's perceptual signature (scientific precision, controlled doubt) is distinct. Diction stays within her register throughout. The prose modulates well from clinical observation to lyric accumulation as pressure builds ("a choir of voices singing in unison"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The voice is purposeful and controlled, though some elevated phrasing ("prayers offered to an indifferent universe") occasionally feels authored rather than character-rooted.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor issues: "courageously kind offerings" in paragraph six feels slightly forced; "the skepticism remained—it was part of who she was, and she would not betray herself" in the final paragraph borders on explaining what the scene has shown. A paraphrase loop appears between "Her motivation shifted from documentation to creation" and the following elaboration. No major artifacts touch closure, so these remain contained deductions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The combination of memory-tile technology, whale migration as threshold, and skeptic-to-participant arc offers a fresh synthesis. The story avoids template resolution by preserving Mira's doubt alongside wonder. However, the core premise (scientist discovers mystical artifact that challenges worldview) follows a recognizable pattern, and the "technology of memory" concept, while specific, leans toward familiar genre territory. The execution is competent with some fresh inflections (whale songs as temporal marker, transcription as method) but doesn't fully transform the underlying structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's skepticism frames the opening and her choices (examining the tile, transcribing symbols, pressing her palm) create the key turn from observer to participant. The trait is active in decisions, not merely observational, and her final stance preserves the skepticism with felt cost. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure payoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tile appears in paragraph three (loose stone discovery), drives the transcription work in paragraph four, and returns at closure when Mira presses her palm. Its properties (cool despite warmth, grid of symbols, memory storage) are specific and matter causally. The object enables the central turn and charges the final image, making it nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Entangled memories emerge when Mira sees her mother's face and realizes the tile holds generational impressions. The concept reframes her purpose (paragraph six: "motivation shifted from documentation to creation") and shapes the closure action. It's present in middle development and payoff, though the mechanics arrive somewhat late (paragraph five). The concept alters tactics but could be more specifically constrained.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Courageously kind" appears once as a descriptor for the observers' offerings in paragraph six. It does not constrain an on-page action or create visible tradeoff; the phrasing feels inserted rather than dramatized through Mira's choices. Mira's courtesy to locals (paragraph two: "kindness often opened doors") gestures toward the trait but doesn't demonstrate courageous cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Transcription anchors the central beat (paragraph four), triggers the memory revelation (paragraph five), and culminates in the palm-press closure. The action is irreplaceable—removing it would collapse the plot. Signaled early when Mira catalogs equipment, executed with urgency, and paid off when she places the finished work beside the tile. Present across all three gates with clear causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tile's symbols are described as "patterns that seemed both chaotic and deliberate" (paragraph three), and paragraph six reveals they are "traces of countless observers." The method matters—she must transcribe to access the memories—but the mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized. Present in middle and closure, though the "forgotten patterns" phrasing itself is more thematic than tactically specific.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tower is established in paragraph one (spiral stairs, open roof, cliff, bay) and its open roof allows whale songs to rise through, charging the transcription scene and closure. The hollow floor provides the tile's hiding place. The setting pressures Mira's choices by isolating her with the discovery and supplying the acoustic connection to the whales. Present in setup, middle, and closure with clear causal contribution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The whale migration is signaled in paragraph one ("each autumn"), marks the evening of discovery ("first whales of the season," paragraph four), and provides the backdrop for transcription and closure. Time is tracked loosely (third evening, that night, hours, dawn) and creates urgency for the transcription work. The migration functions more as atmospheric clock than strict deadline, but it shapes the rhythm and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira's shift from documentation (paragraph two: "privately she doubted") to "sculpt space for reflection" (paragraph six) is dramatized through the transcription and palm-press. The motivation is told explicitly in paragraph six rather than emerging purely through action, which lowers the score slightly. Present in middle realization and closure, with visible cost in the final stance that preserves doubt alongside wonder.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The "unheard symphony" image appears in paragraph six ("a choir of voices singing in unison, an unheard symphony") and charges the thematic resonance. Tone modulates from clinical skepticism (paragraphs one–three) through lyric accumulation (paragraph four: whale songs, urgent transcription) to quiet wonder at closure. The tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting the Accumulative lens, though the explicit "unheard symphony" phrasing risks over-articulation.</comment>
