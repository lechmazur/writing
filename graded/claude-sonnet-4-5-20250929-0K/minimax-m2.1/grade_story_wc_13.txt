<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sera's profession filters perception aptly (moth species, documenting vanishing creatures), and her choice to journey toward the echo chamber under pressure is motivated. However, the climactic action—pressing the pendant and "borrowing" fragments—relies on abstract mechanics explained rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or visible struggle. The final choice feels declarative ("She understood now what she must do") rather than earned through on-page conflict between fear and resolve. Interiority remains generic in key beats: "troubled her deeply" and "sudden clarity" are stock phrases that flatten what should be a charged decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the second paragraph (Sera, studio, canal city). The journey structure—studio to chamber—provides causal progression, and the closure unit is a Decisive Change (echoes freed, silence ended). However, the cost is conceptual and told rather than felt on the page: we're informed she "remained...until dawn" documenting sounds, but no trade-off, loss, or visible price shapes the final image. The mechanics of "borrowing time from the giant's nap" arrive late and operate more as metaphysical exposition than dramatized constraint, weakening closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system is vividly anchored: narrow waterways, towers pressing close, flat-bottomed boat, whispered rhythm that stutters. Sensory detail (pale moth, cold pendant, water moving beneath) is selective and purposeful. The domed chamber with carved notations vibrating with suppressed sound constrains the final choice—Sera must press the pendant against those walls—lifting the setting into the 7-band. Small deduction for the canal "symphony of water, wind bells, and distant market chatter" being told in summary rather than shown through lived action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring the city's stolen rhythm—is signaled early and remains coherent. The journey tightens options (canals grow narrower/darker, interrupted cadence grows stronger), producing one meaningful escalation under an Accumulative lens. However, the climax lacks visible cost or trade-off: Sera "carefully, deliberately" performs the uncaging without dramatized risk, failure, or sacrifice. The resolution is smooth rather than hard-won, and no on-page consequence alters her state or tactics. Band entry at ~6.6 reflects the single tightening with conceptual rather than felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory, loss, preservation of the ephemeral—emerges from concrete images (vanishing moth, last songs of singing eels, city's voice) rather than stated thesis. The infinity pendant shifts from heirloom to tool, a purposeful reprise that reweights meaning at closure. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("preserved forever against any future silence"), and the grandmother's role as wise guide borders on stock mentorship. The piece resists overt moralizing but stops short of a non-literal answer; the resolution is tidy rather than resonant with ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, with perceptual signature tied to Sera's profession (illustration case, finest brushes, graphite blade, documenting in sketchbook). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, favoring concrete nouns. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Psychic distance modulates intentionally (close during the journey, slightly pulled back at closure). The piece enters the 7-band for clean execution; it does not reach 8+ because the voice, while competent, lacks a distinct rhythmic signature or syntactic compression that would charge the final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the journey sequence. Clarity is maintained throughout. However, multiple lines exhibit paraphrase loops and stock openers: "She understood now what she must do" / "Sera realized with sudden clarity" duplicate the epiphany beat; "carefully, deliberately" is boilerplate intensifier; "The echoes returned...reborn and released, flowing together" loops synonyms without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the opening paragraph's list structure. Apply −0.6 for pervasive scaffold and loops; no additional causality break, so penalty remains in Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The rooftop canal network and the domed convergence chamber offer fresh micro-setting detail. The infinity pendant as time-sculpting tool is a purposeful synthesis. However, the core arc—protagonist restores lost magic/rhythm by journey to hidden source—follows a familiar quest template without transformation through lived moral calculus or non-obvious stakes. The grandmother-as-guide and the sleeping-giant-dreaming-time premise lean on stock fantasy conventions. Emotional truth is present but not particularized enough to lift the material beyond competent execution of a recognizable structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Natural history illustrator filters perception (moth species, sketches, finest brushes, documenting sounds in sketchbook) and motivates the journey (she noticed the pattern first). However, her profession enables observation more than it constrains choice; the climactic action (pressing pendant, borrowing time) does not depend on illustration skills. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but causal pressure is moderate. Two-gate participation (setup, closure) with one middle beat; mid-band fit.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Infinity pendant appears in four beats: studio (cold against chest, grandmother's gift), journey (gripped through blouse, metal edges dig), chamber (began to glow, same metal as walls), and climax (pressed against notations, borrowed time). It enables the key action and is reweighted from heirloom to functional tool. However, the mechanics—how it "sculpts time"—are told rather than shown, and the pendant does not constrain an earlier choice or impose visible cost. Three-gate presence with causal enable at closure lifts it to mid-7 range; lack of felt trade-off caps below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interrupted cadence is the dominant stake: sounds stop mid-note (paragraph 2), water stutters and restarts (paragraph 4), trapped rhythm needs uncaging (paragraph 5). Sera's perception of the pattern motivates the journey, the interrupted cadence grows stronger as she climbs, and the climax centers on reconnecting the notes. The concept shapes tactics (following echoes, borrowing time) and the closure (cadence freed, rhythm restored). Essential across setup, escalation, and ending; strong causal pressure and closure linkage earn high-7 band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Sculpts time itself is a label attached to the pendant late (paragraph 6: "designed specifically to sculpt time itself"). It enables the final action (borrowing moments from the giant's nap) but does not constrain an earlier choice or impose visible cost. The trait is told rather than demonstrated through embodied tradeoff. Functional at closure but replaceable with similar magical-tool mechanics; mid-4 band for late setup and ornamental treatment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Uncage is the climax verb: paragraph 7 "began to uncage its components," "the interrupted notes...began to reconnect." The action resolves the dominant stake (freed cadence) and is irreplaceable—no synonym (release, free, open) carries the specific connotation of removing restraint from rhythm. The verb is seeded in paragraph 5 ("uncage the stolen cadence") and paid off in the final paragraph ("uncaging...ready for the next time"). Strong causal role, closure participation, and specificity place it in high-7 band; deduct slightly for the mechanics being told rather than dramatized with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Borrowing time is explained in paragraph 5 (take moments from the giant's nap without waking him) and enacted in paragraph 7 ("took a moment...then another, each stolen fragment allowing her to reach further"). The method enables the climax but is introduced late (second half) and operates through exposition rather than embodied constraint. It does not shape earlier tactics or impose a dramatized cost (e.g., fatigue, risk of waking the giant). Two-gate presence (setup in paragraph 5, payoff in 7) with moderate causal role; mid-5 band for functional but late and summary-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rooftop canal system is present in four beats: opening (networks silver threads, traveled her entire life), journey (canals grew narrower/darker, towers pressing close, flat-bottomed boat), chamber (convergence of three towers), and closure (echoes flowing through rooftop waterways). The setting provides the journey structure and the convergence site enables the climax. However, it does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics under pressure; it functions as atmospheric backdrop. Three-gate presence with closure participation but moderate causal pressure; mid-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Giant's nap is introduced late (paragraph 5) as metaphysical explanation for time flow and the method of borrowing fragments. It does not create urgency or tighten decisions; no clock counts down, no risk of waking dramatized. The timeframe is conceptual rather than tactical. Present in one expository beat and one action beat (paragraph 7), but absent from setup and does not shape pacing. Late introduction and ornamental function cap at mid-3 band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>To find the place where echoes are born is stated in paragraph 3 (grandmother mentioned once, source where echoes drew life) and pursued through the journey (paragraph 4: followed new direction). The goal motivates the journey structure and is fulfilled at closure (chamber found, echoes reborn). However, the desire is declared rather than dramatized with internal friction or competing wants; Sera never doubts, hesitates, or pays a visible price for seeking. Three-gate presence with moderate causal role; lack of on-page conflict or cost caps at mid-6.</comment>
