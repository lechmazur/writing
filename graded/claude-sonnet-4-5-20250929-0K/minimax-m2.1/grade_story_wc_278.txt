<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's guilt over her sister's death provides consistent motivation, but interiority relies heavily on abstract constructions ("something more desperate and something less") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to "rewrite what time had folded into permanence" arrives without dramatized internal conflict—we see no wavering, cost assessment, or competing impulse in the moment. Her constellation tattooist profession feels ornamental; it's mentioned but never constrains a choice or reveals character under pressure until the final metaphor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens (letters → laboratory → amber → translation → coordinates → chamber) but the closure unit lacks on-page cost: Mira "begins to work" with "trembling hands" yet no decision, renunciation, or visible consequence materializes. The orientation debt is severe—who/where/when remain vague past 120 words ("space between seconds," "laboratory of lost sounds") without concrete anchoring, and this disorientation never pays off at closure. The final image gestures toward action ("mapping the stars of redemption") but offers only metaphor, not a legible change in options or knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Vivid atmospheric details ("amber light," "velvet pedestal," "frequency that seemed to predate sound") create texture, but the laboratory remains a collection of evocative phrases rather than a space that constrains choice. The amber piece is described but not handled across beats—it's pressed to a console once, then abandoned for coordinate-following. Spatial choreography breaks: Mira moves from door to pedestal to console to "deeper into the laboratory" to a chamber, but distances, thresholds, and the physical layout never cohere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resolving guilt by hearing her sister's message—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens through protagonist agency. Every step (finding letters, entering lab, using amber, following coordinates) succeeds without friction, cost, or trade-off. The "one chance to translate her guilt into action" arrives as declaration, not dramatized narrowing of options. The story ends at the threshold of action ("began to work") rather than showing a choice with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of guilt and redemption is stated rather than emergent: "tether her guilt to its source," "translate guilt into action," "stars of redemption." The final paragraph's "mapping the stars of redemption across the firmament of her broken timeline" is pure thematic echo—prompt-like language replacing scene pressure. The meteor-hush motif and constellation work never evolve in meaning across beats; they're invoked as symbols without constraining choice or charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains stable distance and offers some perceptual signature ("the reverence of someone handling a prayer"), but diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with urgent discovery: "dissonance of that old guilt," "firmament of her broken timeline," "current of pure intention." Filter verbs stack in the final section ("understood," "could see") during what should be peak intensity. The prose reads as singular voice throughout, avoiding head-hopping, but the lexicon feels more authorial than character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "something more desperate and something less," "the ability to hear what the dead had tried to say, to translate the unspeakable communications"; "not as a ghost or a memory, but as a current"; "not accusations but instructions." Mixed metaphors muddle clarity: firmware in an insect trapped for millions of years yet "dated to the night her sister had died" collapses physical logic. Figurative density in nearly every sentence of the closure beat ("meteor hush," "stars of redemption," "firmament of her broken timeline") without pattern-teaching flattens propulsion. Artifacts touch the closure directly, triggering the cap and preventing 9+ eligibility globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The combination of haunted firmware, amber-trapped insect, and lost-sounds laboratory offers surface novelty but the emotional core—guilt over a sibling's death, messages from beyond—follows a familiar template. No element receives specific, grounded transformation: the firmware's mechanics remain unexplained metaphor, the laboratory exists as atmosphere, and Mira's tattooist work never constrains her approach. The closure gesture (rewriting the timeline) arrives as abstract wish-fulfillment rather than a fresh, earned synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and pursues the goal, but her choices are passive follow-steps (read letters, enter lab, press amber to console, follow coordinates). No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path; she encounters no friction requiring judgment. Swappable with any guilt-driven seeker.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The amber appears early (setup) and is pressed to the console (development), but after that beat it vanishes—coordinates, not the amber, drive the next move. It does not return in or shape the final image. Two-beat presence with no closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Haunted firmware is mentioned throughout ("firmware within the insect flickered to life," "haunted code," "firmware had been trying to tell her") but its mechanics never constrain a choice or require tactical adjustment. It functions as thematic label rather than a rule-set that changes options. Present in setup and mentioned at closure but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Baby-cry translation appears in exposition ("devices built by someone who had known that infant sounds contained frequencies beyond human hearing") and is invoked when Mira hears her sister's voice, but she does not perform the translation herself, nor does the attribute constrain her actions. Label-only; no visible cost or tradeoff tied to the skill.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Tether" appears in the letters passage ("letters had been her tether") and again at closure ("tether her guilt to its source"), but the action itself is not dramatized—Mira does not perform a tethering on the page. The metaphor recurs but remains abstract; easily replaceable with "resolve," "anchor," or "bind." No specific mechanics or cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Handwritten letters in antique furniture are signaled early, shaping Mira's multi-year search and framing her arrival. They enable the plot but do not recur or constrain middle choices. Setup present, no development beat, thematic mention at closure ("letters had always intended her to go"). Two gates; lyric reprise bumps slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds anchors the entire scene (setup), houses the amber and translation devices (development), and contains the chamber where Mira confronts the looped moment (closure). It supplies resources (translation console, coordinates) that alter her path. Not merely atmospheric; the setting enables key beats and the final image depends on its time-folding property.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"When time folds in on itself" is invoked three times but never tightens decisions—Mira does not race a clock or navigate temporal friction. The fold enables the ending vision (seeing herself as a child, the looped accident) but imposes no pressure or cost. Thematic atmosphere, not a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation to "hush the dissonance of old guilt" is stated early and drives Mira's search, but the guilt itself is told rather than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices. She feels no pull to abandon the quest, no competing desire; the dissonance is label, not embodied friction. Setup and closure mention; weak friction in between.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears once ("the meteor hush that preceded all significant silences") in the final section as descriptor. The tone throughout is elevated and solemn but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image distinctly. Single ornamental mention; no recurrence or tonal shift to reweight stakes.</comment>
