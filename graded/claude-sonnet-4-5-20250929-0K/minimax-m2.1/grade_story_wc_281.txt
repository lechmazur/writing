<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's "affectionate skeptic" stance is voiced but enacted weakly; her skepticism dissolves on contact with the crystal without meaningful internal resistance or cost. The somatic-marker framework (breath, heart rate, shoulder tension) provides concrete embodiment, yet the final pivot to "document everything, share her findings" arrives as assertion rather than earned choice under pressure. The telepathy-pill backstory anchors her wariness but remains expository; no on-page micro-choice dramatizes the conflict between her desperation for connection and her distrust of shortcuts. Internal contradiction is stated ("skepticism warring with hope") but never forces a trade-off that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation arrives promptly (studio, Mira, post-shock). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Mira's realization crystallizes a gentler method and charges the final image ("willowglass hope")—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no visible forfeiture or foreclosed option anchors the before/after. The static shock → geode pulse → somatic recognition → epiphany chain reads more as unveiling than escalation; Mira never narrows options or pays a price to access this insight. The ending reconfigures her stance yet the reconfiguration feels granted rather than wrestled from prior pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The light-painting studio is anchored early (RGB LEDs, velvet-lined case, cold metal table) and the geode's fractal refraction under colored light provides specific sensory texture. Spatial choreography is clean (coffee on table, crystal at temple, child three rooms away, stranger three floors below). The studio does not constrain a choice, but the crystal—treated as micro-setting—does: Mira presses it to her temple and the bodily response (warmth, pulse synchronization) enables the epiphany that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate narrowly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding connection without the pills' harm) is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira applies the crystal and perceives the "intricate web" of connection, reweighting her understanding of the pills' failure. Yet this deepening is delivered to her—no protagonist agency tightens the screw. The resolution (devise a gentler method) is declared, not demonstrated through a choice that forecloses an alternative with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift at the ending reweights meaning but does not narrow options or impose a felt price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme (consent and boundaries in connection) emerges from the pill-recall premise and the geode's "invitation rather than intrusion." The final image ("willowglass hope") offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the thematic climax leans on direct articulation: "Connection can't be manufactured through chemistry alone. It requires consent…" This Thematic Echo in a pivotal beat substitutes assertion for dramatized pressure. The closing metaphor ("fragile, translucent, trembling with potential light") resonates but the path to it is told more than discovered through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited with stable focalization. Perceptual signature is present (scientific training versus "something deeper") and diction mostly fits Mira's technical background. Purposeful compression in the somatic-marker passage works. However, elevated register appears in peak beats: "delicate, luminous threads," "the body's intricate signals," "fragile and breakable, but still beautiful" stack poetic abstractions where concrete perception would sharpen pressure. Filter verbs ("seemed to pulse," "felt like recognition") cluster in the geode-contact sequence without voice motivation, dulling immediacy at a critical moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clarity and rhythm are generally controlled. Paraphrase loops appear: "The crystal seemed to catch the ambient light differently… its internal facets gleaming" / "The geode's internal structure caught the RGB lights, refracting them into fractal patterns" restates without adding pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the second paragraph: multiple "The [noun] had [verb]" and "she'd [verb]" stems across five sentences (−0.4). Stock metaphor strings in the climax ("delicate, luminous threads," "fragile hope") trend generic (−0.3). Cumulative artifacts in Q7: −0.9. No loops touch the closure beat directly, limiting total penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The telepathy-pill premise is widely templated (pharmaceutical shortcut to intimacy fails, natural method awaits). The geode-as-alternative and somatic-marker framework offer a specific twist, yet the execution remains abstract: "fractally precise," "somatic markers," "willowglass hope" are intriguing labels without ground-level surprise in their use. The turn from pills to crystal is conceptually neat but arrives without a fresh emotional or causal inflection—Mira's path is more revelation than transformation. The premise could absorb a different object or method with minor edits, signaling mid-band swappability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira ("affectionate skeptic") is present throughout and her trait is voiced. Her choice to press the crystal to her temple is on-page but not a high-stakes decision; the subsequent epiphany and resolution ("devise… share her findings") are declared rather than enacted. She observes and receives insight more than she decides under conflicting pressure. Setup and middle involvement are clear; closure participation is declarative rather than causal. Two gates met; causal pressure weak; closure linkage is summary. Band ~4.0–5.0; weak agency and late summary lower to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The muscovite geode sliver appears in beat one (static shock, luminescence), beat two (fractal refraction), and beat three (temple contact, somatic response). Its properties (fractal precision, pulse synchronization) enable the climactic perception and charge the final image ("method of illumination"). Setup early (+0.8), three beats (+1.4), causal pressure moderate (+0.8), closure linkage strong (+1.2). However, the object's mechanics are asserted rather than shown constraining a choice with visible cost; it grants insight rather than forcing trade-offs. Band ~6.5–7.5; swappability concern and passive use lower to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Telepathy pill recall" frames the backstory and stakes (Mira's wariness, desire for connection). It shapes her motivation and the thematic question but remains off-page; the pills are discussed, not dramatized. The concept informs the closure realization ("pills had tried to blast open… geode showed another way") yet does not alter on-page tactics or narrow options during the present action. Setup strong (+0.8), middle absent (−0.5), closure present as thematic contrast (+0.7). Two gates; thematic use without present causal pressure. Band ~5.0–6.0; declarative payoff holds at 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" is applied twice to the geode's pattern. The trait is described vividly ("mathematically precise angles," "almost fractally precise display") but does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost. Mira notices the precision and infers intentionality; the attribute supports atmosphere but remains ornamental in terms of plot mechanics. Setup present (+0.3), no middle development, closure mentioned but not causal. One gate; swappable with "intricate" or "complex" (−0.6). Cap 3.8 per missing middle development gate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Devise" appears in the final paragraph as Mira's declared resolution: "She would devise a gentler approach… document everything, share her findings." The action is stated rather than dramatized; no on-page process shows her devising with visible cost or trade-off. Introduced late (final third, −0.8), resolves a problem (finding a method) it did not help create earlier (−0.7), summary-only (−0.5). Cap 4.6 per late introduction gate. Cumulative frictions would push lower, but dominant limiter (late + resolve without setup) sets neighborhood; round to 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Through somatic markers" is signaled in paragraph two ("method began to emerge through somatic markers") and enacted in paragraph three (tension release, breath deepening, heart synchronization). The means shapes the epiphany beat and is named again at closure ("somatic markers her body had shown her were the beginning of a language"). Setup mid-early (~30%, −0.2), two beats (+0.9), causal pressure moderate (+0.7), closure linkage strong (+1.0). However, the mechanics remain asserted; the reader is told these are markers rather than shown them constraining a choice with cost. Band ~5.5–6.5; told-mechanism and moderate irreplaceability hold at 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "light painting studio" is named and described (RGB LEDs, purple glow, velvet-lined case, cold metal table) in the opening beat. The setting provides atmosphere but does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome. The crystal's refraction under studio lights adds texture yet the studio itself is replaceable (any dim workspace would suffice). Setup strong (+0.8), no middle development, closure absent. One gate; postcard description without tactical constraint (−0.8); swappable (−0.6). Cap 4.6 per missing middle gate; frictions lower to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the static shock" anchors the timeframe in the opening sentence. All subsequent action unfolds in one continuous present sequence (shock → observation → contact → realization). Time does not tighten decisions; no clock or urgency alters Mira's moves. The frame is clear but non-restrictive. Setup present (+0.3), no middle pressure, no closure leverage. One gate; functional but non-constraining. Band ~3.0–4.0; minimal causal role holds at 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To illuminate hidden pathways" is voiced in paragraph two ("lost something… offer this fragile hope") and drives the final paragraph ("find a way to illuminate those pathways"). The motivation is stated and informs Mira's interpretive lens (the "intricate web" vision) but is not dramatized through conflicted choice with visible cost. Setup early (+0.8), middle involvement via thematic interpretation (+0.5), closure strong (+1.2), but told rather than tested (−0.5). Three gates; thematic rather than decisional friction. Band ~6.0–6.5; declarative execution holds at 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope—fragile, translucent, trembling with potential light" appears in the final sentence and names the tone. The adjective "fragile" recurs (hope, threads, connection) and the narrative balances wariness with openness throughout. Tone is coherent but static; no modulation under pressure—Mira's register remains steady from opening skepticism through epiphany. Setup implicit, development steady, closure strong (+1.5). Lyric reprise present but tone does not shift with escalation (−0.4). Band ~5.5–6.5; static mood with strong final image holds at 5.9.</comment>
