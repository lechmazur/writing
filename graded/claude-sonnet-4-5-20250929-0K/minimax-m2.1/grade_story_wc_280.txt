<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is established (forty-seven years tethered, understanding despair) but her interior contradicts itself: she "tasted violets when she heard grief" yet the synesthesia never constrains a choice or creates friction. Mira appears late and remains a cipher—her "catastrophic audition" is told, not shown, so her despair reads generic. The final "choice" ("Mira reached out and touched the coin") lacks prior struggle; she simply accepts the gift without visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (layered echoes, synesthetic texture). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Elara, emporium, courtyard). The closure unit—Mira touching the coin and "choosing to believe again"—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost is asserted ("her timeline rejoined the fractured whole") rather than dramatized in a concrete forfeiture or shift in tactics. The "weight of the coin lift[ing]" from Elara's palm suggests release, yet no prior scene established what she risked or lost by holding it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The emporium, courtyard, and orchard garden are vividly named and textured (boxwood walls, silver-tinged apples). The tarot coin is handled twice (Elara raises it, Mira touches it) and the garden's "impossible colors" charge the final image. However, the hedge maze is mentioned once without affecting access or choice, and the "hand-painted" detail remains static description. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara seeking an encore, Mira facing despair—is signaled early. The orchard encounter provides a single tightening (Mira's presence forces Elara to act), but no reversal narrows options: the echoes appear on command, Mira accepts without resistance, and the coin transfers without friction. Coincidence dominates (Mira "had come to the emporium because she had nowhere else to go"), and the resolution is granted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—despair as doorway, fractured timelines as possibility—emerges through the orchard echoes and the tarot coin's multiplicity. The final image (coin spinning, "all of them, not one timeline but the infinite web") reweights prior material. Yet the piece tells the theme overtly ("Despair is a performance you don't have to finish") and Elara's summary ("the quiet miracle of one soul choosing to believe again") replaces scene pressure with moralizing. The thematic claim outpaces the dramatized stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during her reflection, wider during Mira's introduction). Diction is mostly voice-consistent ("synesthetically blessed," "threshold place") though "suicide of hope" and "might-have-been and could-still-be" tilt toward elevated abstraction during peak beats. Elara's perceptual signature (synesthesia) is invoked but never filters action or choice under pressure. No dialogue appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies sentence-to-sentence; no template cadence or loops. Information density is moderate—each paragraph advances setting or reflection—but phrases like "threshold place where the edges of reality wore thin," "tapestry of might-have-been," and "the infinite web of connection" stack figurative language without concrete anchors. "The ghost raised the tarot coin, and its painted surface began to produce echoes" repeats "echoes" across adjacent lines without added pressure. Minor filter-verb stack ("seemed to shift," "seemed to dance") in mid-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—ghost aids living artist via tarot-coin echoes—combines familiar elements (stage ghost, magical artifact, redemptive encounter) without a fresh angle. The "fractured timeline" label and synesthesia are asserted but not transformed through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The emotional arc (despair → hope) follows a median template. The orchard and coin offer vivid textures but no structural surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her "encore" desire frames the story. She makes one key choice (raising the coin to produce echoes) that enables the ending. However, her agency is passive—she observes Mira's tears, then grants a gift—and the "encore" resolution is told ("for the first time in forty-seven years, she felt the weight of the coin lift") rather than earned through a prior on-page struggle or trade-off. Setup present, middle choice weak, closure participation via narration rather than action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The coin is handled twice (Elara holds it, Mira touches it) and its "painted surface" detail recurs. It enables the climactic beat (producing echoes) and transfers at closure. Yet its mechanics are vague ("began to produce echoes"), and no cost is tied to its use—Elara simply raises it and the effect occurs. The coin's "final performance, the trick she never got to reveal" is told backstory without present friction. Present in all three gates but swappable with any magical artifact.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "fractured timeline" is invoked repeatedly ("fractured timeline upon fractured timeline," "The fractured timeline revealed itself") but remains thematic gloss. The echoes show "every failure contained a seed of success," yet no choice on the page depends on navigating or reconciling multiple timelines. Mira "saw her failed audition transform" in retrospect, not through present action. The concept is asserted, not enacted.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Synesthesia is described once ("tasted violets when she heard grief, saw music as spirals of amber and gold, felt sorrow as a texture like crushed velvet") and mentioned again ("The synesthetic blessing made her words taste like honey and guilt"). It never constrains a choice, alters perception under pressure, or creates a tradeoff. Label-only; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Intertwine" appears once in the climactic beat ("The echoes intertwined with the present") to describe the visual effect of the magic. The action is specific to this moment but does not create a turn—the echoes simply appear and Mira accepts them. Easily swappable with "merge," "blend," or "converge." Present in closure but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Producing echoes" is signaled early ("its painted surface began to produce echoes") and the orchard "filled with the ghosts of performances never witnessed." The method is visually described and recurs ("The echoes continued to produce themselves"). However, the mechanics are vague—no cost, preparation, or constraint is shown—and the method could be replaced with any manifestation effect. Present in two beats and closure but does not shape tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The orchard garden is introduced early, described with specificity (boxwood walls, silver-tinged apples), and serves as the location for the entire climactic sequence. It provides atmosphere and a secluded stage for the encounter. However, the setting does not constrain choice or alter tactics—the maze is mentioned once without affecting access, and the garden could be any isolated, atmospheric space. Present in all three gates but functionally generic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the business closes" is stated in the opening line and creates the threshold condition ("the shop became something else entirely"). Time is mentioned once more ("the first lights of morning began to stir") at closure. No urgency or countdown shapes decisions; the night could be any length. Setup present, no middle development, weak closure reprise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elara's desire to "lure possibility from the brink of despair" is told in backstory ("she had learned...that despair was merely a door") and dramatized once when she raises the coin to help Mira. The motivation is present in setup and closure, but no friction or competing cost is shown—Elara simply gives, and the act costs her nothing visible until the final summary ("the weight of the coin lift[ing]"). Functional but not conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Nostalgia is present in Elara's reflection on "forty-seven years" and "performances...from a century ago" and rises in the orchard scene where past echoes fill the garden. The tone modulates with the emotional arc (melancholy opening, hopeful close) and charges the final image ("somewhere in the distance, the first lights of morning began to stir"). However, the tone is asserted more than embodied—synesthetic texture is told, not shown in diction or rhythm under pressure. Coherent but static.</comment>
