<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is dense with world-specific perception ("reading the frost," recognizing "compressed histories"), but her motivation remains abstract—she follows patterns without dramatized internal resistance or competing impulses. The final choice to "open, not hold" the whisper arrives as epiphany rather than friction-laden decision; no visible cost forecloses a path on the page. Her embodied reactions are sparse: "ink-stained fingers" and "felt the familiar resistance" do not ground emotional stakes under pressure. The piece leans on atmospheric detail in place of contradictory desires that would elevate agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered imagery (frost → bottle → press → expansion) toward a final cadence shift when the whisper is released. Orientation anchors arrive late: "who" is named line one, but "glass orchard library" and the post-Negotiation timeframe emerge slowly across the first third without clear spatial grounding until the frost scene. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the whisper's release reweights the Library's systems and Elara's stance ("some eternities needed to be opened"), but the cost remains conceptual—no on-page forfeiture or tactical alteration is legible in the final beat. One meaningful deepening occurs when the bottle is placed under the press, but causality between frost-reading and bottle-discovery feels elliptical rather than motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glass orchard, floating floors, and cloud-sea are vivid and purposeful—sensory detail is filtered through Elara's professional lens ("raised type," "platen," "form"). The letterpress functions as micro-setting that constrains the climactic choice: "Metal did not dream. Ink did not waver" grounds the resolution in tactile certainty. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (workshop → frost panes → shelving rupture → press). The post-Negotiation world rules are consistent and felt through action (scholars "half-phased," reality "negotiable"), though the bottle's sudden appearance in "a section that had not existed before" verges on convenient spatial expansion without prior setup.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating the whisper into permanence—is signaled early but remains abstract until the press scene. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara places the bottle against the platen, narrowing options to a binary (open or preserve), yet no dramatized obstacle or competing cost shapes that choice. The "rupture" and "cascade of syllables" deliver spectacle without tactical consequence: the Library grows new sections, but Elara's role or stance does not shift with visible price. Accumulative pressure builds through the frost → bottle → press sequence, but the final act lacks a trade-off that forecloses a live alternative with on-page weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—holding vs. releasing knowledge—emerges organically from the press action and the whisper's "compressed eternity." The final image ("some eternities needed to be opened, not held") reweights prior material without overt moralizing, and the cloud-sea's "new patterns" offer a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gesture: the press's "familiar resistance" and the bottle's "breath of centuries" carry meaning beyond assertion. However, the Negotiation premise and "reality becomes negotiable" verge on stock metaphor; the piece does not dramatize the ethical or practical calculus of that transformation, relying instead on atmospheric assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices "raised type," "compressed histories," and "syntax" in frost, filtering setting through her letterpress expertise. Diction is elevated and consistent ("after-reality," "knowledge-wood," "aether-ships"), though occasionally opaque without immediate anchoring ("reality's terms showed through"). One filter-verb stack appears mid-passage ("She had heard," "had learned"), slightly dulling immediacy. No dialogue on the page. The prose remains coherent under pressure, but the final paragraph's cadence ("The whisper had found its voice, and now the world would learn to listen") tips toward summary assertion rather than sustained image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the opening third (Negotiation, glass orchard, frost-reading compressed into three paragraphs). However, paraphrase loops recur: "whisper… compressing itself" / "compressed histories" / "compress… eternities" cycles the same root across beats without escalating meaning. Template cadence appears in the middle: "She had heard… people had learned… world had been" stacks past-perfect constructions. The metaphor "climate responded to thought" and "night-sweat of reality" is vivid but borders on mixed vehicle (sweat as thought-weather). Minor clarity slip: "运作" (Chinese characters) appears mid-sentence, likely a copy error. The final line's "learn to listen" risks cliché, though it coheres with prior rustling imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The glass orchard library and post-Negotiation reality offer a fresh synthesis of archive and mutable physics; the letterpress as the sole non-negotiable machine is a specific, non-obvious anchor. However, the bottled-whisper motif echoes familiar "message in a bottle" and "trapped voice" templates without transforming them through lived detail or moral calculus. The "rustling awakenings" concept remains ornamental—mentioned in description but not dramatized as a constraint or cost. The ending's wisdom ("some eternities needed to be opened") feels earned by the press action, yet the transformation lacks bold stakes: no renunciation, no visible loss that would push the synthesis into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout (setup ✓), reads the frost and selects the bottle (development ✓), and operates the press to release the whisper (closure ✓). Her letterpress expertise constrains method (metal/ink certainty vs. negotiable reality) in the climactic beat (+0.5 causal). However, her choices are reactive—following frost directions, placing the bottle—without on-page friction or competing desire that would demonstrate irreplaceability. A scholar or archivist could perform the same moves with minor edits (−0.6 swappability). Two beats (frost-reading, press operation) show distinct involvement (+0.9), but the character's cryptic/translator aspect is asserted more than dramatized in high-pressure moments.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bottle appears mid-story (~40% mark, −0.3 late setup), is handled at the rupture discovery (development ✓), and placed under the press to trigger the climactic expansion (closure ✓). Two distinct beats: discovery and press operation (+0.9). Its "clouded surface" and "rustling awakenings" sound give it specificity (+0.4), and the press action depends on its physical presence (+0.8 causal). Closure linkage is strong: the bottle's emptying reweights the Library's systems and Elara's stance (+1.2). However, the bottle resolves a problem (compressed whisper) it did not help create earlier in the narrative (−0.8). No visible cost is tied to opening it—Elara's fingers are "ink-stained" but no forfeiture or tactical trade-off lands on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The concept is named in the bottle's description ("rustling awakenings—the sound of leaves finding wind, of seeds breaking soil") and echoed in the cloud-sea's final "new patterns, written in the language of rustling awakenings." Setup ✓ (introduced with the bottle), payoff ✓ (final image). However, it remains ornamental: the concept does not constrain Elara's choices or alter tactics in any beat (−0.8 ornamental use). It functions as atmospheric theme rather than plot lever. The cascade of syllables is described but not shown shaping on-page decisions or costs. One beat (bottle discovery) references it, but swappable phrasing ("ancient voice," "primordial sound") would serve equally well (−0.6 swappability).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The attribute appears early: the glass orchard and Library systems are "perfect" and "too-perfect," and the frost/bottle create a "rupture" that "destabilizes" shelving and forces "new equations to solve." Setup ✓ (frost scene), development ✓ (shelving rupture), payoff ✓ (Library grows new sections). The destabilization enables the bottle's discovery by creating the rupture-space (+0.8 causal). Two beats: frost reading reveals the rupture, and the press expansion forces systemic change (+0.9). However, the trait is asserted more than dramatized—no on-page tactical constraint or visible cost for Elara results from the destabilization. The Library "shudders" and "will need to grow new sections," but these are told consequences without immediate pressure on the protagonist's choices (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The rupture is introduced with the bottle's discovery ("rupture in the shelving where perfect rows of books had begun to destabilize"), reappears when the press releases the whisper ("The rupture came not with sound but with expansion"), and shapes the ending (frost patterns shatter, Library systems recalibrate). Setup ✓ (shelving rupture, ~35%), development ✓ (press scene), closure ✓ (final reconfiguration). Three beats: discovery, press expansion, systemic aftermath (+1.4). Strong causal pressure: the rupture is both symptom (bottle's presence) and method (press's release) that drives the climax (+1.2). Closure linkage is clear: the rupture's resolution reweights the Library's state and Elara's role (+1.4). Specificity is high—"rupture" connotes both spatial break and conceptual breach, irreplaceable within the post-Negotiation logic (+0.6). Minor late setup (−0.2).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The frost is introduced early ("Each morning, she read the frost") and its mechanics matter: "patterns on the glass panes" are "compressed histories" with legible "syntax" that Elara traces to locate the bottle. Setup ✓ (opening), development ✓ (frost-reading directs the search), closure note (frost patterns "shattered" after the whisper's release). Two beats: frost-reading and its shattering aftermath (+0.9). Causal pressure: the frost's directions enable the bottle's discovery, and its destruction signals systemic change (+1.0). However, the method is used only in the setup and mentioned briefly at the end—no middle tactic or constraint involves frost-reading after the initial beat (−0.4). The shattering is ornamental consequence rather than cost-bearing action. Specificity is high: frost as information medium fits the world logic (+0.5).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The glass orchard library is foregrounded in the opening paragraph, its floating floors and cloud-sea backdrop anchoring the world. Setup ✓ (line one). The letterpress workshop within the Library provides the tool for the climactic press action (development ✓), and the Library's systems recalibrate at closure (payoff ✓). Two beats: frost-reading in the workshop, press operation (+0.9). The setting supplies the press (micro-setting that constrains method) and the non-negotiable certainty that contrasts with the post-Negotiation world (+0.8 causal). Closure linkage: the Library "will need to grow new sections" and the cloud-sea forms "new patterns" in response to the whisper's release (+0.9). However, much of the setting is postcard description—crystalline trees, floating scholars, aether-ships—that does not alter Elara's tactical choices (−0.6). Strong early setup (+0.6).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled early: "Three hundred years had passed since the Negotiation, when reality had learned to bargain." Setup ✓. The post-Negotiation rules (negotiable reality, bottled whispers, phased scholars) shape the world logic and contrast with Elara's press, which "required no negotiation" (development ✓). The closure recalibrates this: the whisper predates the Negotiation ("something older"), and its release forces the Library's systems to adapt (payoff ✓). Two beats: timeframe establishes stakes (Elara as last cryptic operator), and the press action asserts non-negotiable method (+0.9). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a deadline—Elara's morning routine is static, and no urgency or tactical constraint arises from the post-Negotiation state (−0.7). The element functions as worldbuilding more than plot lever (−0.5 ornamental).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation is stated in Elara's role: "translating what the world had become into something that could be held" and the final realization "some things… could not be compressed into smaller moments. Some eternities needed to be opened, not held." Setup ✓ (translator role, opening paragraphs), closure ✓ (final insight). One beat: the press operation dramatizes the shift from holding to releasing (+0.4). The motivation shapes the ending's thematic reconfiguration (+0.9 closure linkage). However, Elara's desire is asserted in summary rather than tested through friction—no on-page moment shows her resisting the impulse to compress or weighing the cost of release (−0.7 told-only). The whisper's "compressed eternity" mirrors the motivation, but swappable phrasing ("preserve the past," "archive knowledge") would serve similarly (−0.5 swappability). The final choice arrives as epiphany without dramatized conflict between want and cost.</comment>
