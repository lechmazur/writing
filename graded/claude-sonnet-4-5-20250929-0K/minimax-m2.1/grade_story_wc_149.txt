<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's core motivation (debt repayment through loving service) is consistent, and her final choice to pass the work to the gardener shows coherent progression. Interior life relies heavily on atmospheric description rather than contradictory impulses under pressure—she drifts, manifests, presses the bead, but we don't see her weighing competing desires in the moment. The gardener's sudden inheritance of "loving venom" and unexplained tears feel asserted rather than earned through prior characterization. Embodied emotion is present but leans decorative (ashen veil, translucent fingers) rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates atmospheric density and teaches a pattern of spectral visitation across centuries, landing on a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Elara solidifies, the gardener receives the blessing/curse, and dawn stars "recognize their old positions." Cost is conceptual and felt—Elara's near-completion of penance, the gardener's new burden—legible in the final image. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the gardener witnesses the scions' transformation and receives the "loving venom," reweighting Elara's stake from solitary penance to generational handoff. The closure reconfigures the endless-night premise into approaching dawn with visible cost (the gardener must now carry the work).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse—luminous coffin, artificial moons, iron rafters, propagation chamber glass—constrains Elara's manifestations and supplies the alchemical scions whose transformation is the pivotal event. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (frost and ferment, glass catching cold radiance), filtered through the ghost's post-mortal perception. The carved stone bead pressed against glass becomes a micro-setting element that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear: Elara drifts between rows, appears at the grafting station, lingers at the propagation chamber where the gardener approaches. The endless-night frame and winter-cracked fields recur to reinforce tone and charge the dawn mention at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Elara's debt repayment, signaled early ("the debt had begun three hundred winters ago"). One meaningful tightening occurs when the scions burst forth with healthy growth and Elara solidifies to transfer the blessing/curse to the gardener, narrowing her path toward freedom. Agency is decision and renunciation: Elara chooses to pass the work, and the gardener accepts it (albeit involuntarily, which slightly undercuts protagonist-driven escalation). The cost is legible—Elara moves closer to release, the gardener inherits the burden—but the gardener's consent is absent, which weakens the earned-reversal requirement. The final image reweights options (Elara's approaching freedom, the gardener's new responsibility) under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—debt, service, generational handoff, growth bound to responsibility—emerges from the scions' transformation, the bead's "loving venom," and the gardener's involuntary inheritance. The final image (stars recognizing old positions, Elara nearly finished) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. "Loving venom" and "alchemical gift" recur with shifting weight, avoiding token motif placement. Subtext operates in the gardener's unexplained tears and the bead's dual blessing/curse nature. One weakness: "to wake sleeping plants was to wake sleeping debts" articulates the premise too directly in the penultimate paragraph, edging toward thematic echo (−0.3 in this range).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV anchored to Elara; psychic distance is stable and appropriately elevated for a ghost bride's centuries-spanning perception. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated (luminous coffin, smoke refusing to rise, winter-cracked fields), with elevated register fitting the spectral, alchemical frame. One slip: "婚礼头纱" (Chinese characters for "wedding veil") appears mid-sentence, breaking linguistic consistency without setup or payoff—a register/idiom mismatch that pulls the reader out (−0.4). Free indirect style is clean when shifting briefly to the gardener's experience ("eyes that remembered loss"). No head-hopping; the gardener's interiority is accessed only through externalized perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing images are strong. Information density is high in places (the debt's origin compressed into one paragraph). Two craft issues lower the score: (1) Overwriting in the opening—figurative language in nearly every sentence ("luminous coffin," "smoke refusing to rise," "imprisoned light," "temperament of their keeper," "stars that never rose") without pattern-teaching or payoff; this registers as density without propulsion (−0.5). (2) Paraphrase loop: "The ghost bride had nearly finished her work. The young gardener would carry on now" restates the closure without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence appears in the debt-history paragraph ("She had been... he a... the price had been... but he had bargained") but remains functional. No loops or scaffolding touch the closure beat itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ghost-bride-tending-greenhouse premise is a specific synthesis of debt penance and alchemical horticulture, offering a fresh angle on haunting narratives. The "loving venom" concept and the scions' transformation feel particular to this world. However, the emotional arc—spectral figure nearing release through service—follows a recognizable template without a non-obvious turn; the gardener's inheritance is legible early and proceeds as expected. The carved bead, artificial moons, and endless night are vivid but don't fundamentally alter the familiar penance structure. Transformation test: the core plot (spirit completes debt through service, passes burden to successor) could swap settings with minor edits, suggesting mid-range originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara (ashen-veil ghost bride) is present from the opening, manifests across multiple beats (drifting between rows, pressing the bead, solidifying at the propagation chamber), and her decision to pass the work to the gardener drives the closure. Her ghostly nature constrains her interaction (ephemeral cameo appearances, translucent fingers) and her final solidification charges the ending image. The character is indispensable; removing her breaks the story's logic and stakes. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The carved stone bead appears early (third paragraph), is handled in two distinct beats (pressed against the propagation chamber glass, grows warm as the debt shifts), and its "loving venom" directly enables the scions' transformation—the story's key turn. The bead charges the closure when it "finally ready to be buried in earth that no longer feared the cold." Its origin (his gift, swallowed in Elara's final breath) and dual blessing/curse nature make it irreplaceable. Strong setup, causal pressure, and closure linkage; the bead is essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Resonant awakenings" shapes the core event (scions bursting forth with healthy growth) and the thematic layer (waking sleeping plants/debts). The concept is present in the middle turn (propagation chamber transformation) and echoed at closure. However, the concept is more thematic than tactical—it doesn't constrain Elara's options so much as describe the effect of her service. Two gates met (development, payoff) with moderate causal role, but the awakening is an outcome rather than a means that alters tactics, keeping it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Lovingly venomous" is signaled early (the bead "pulsed with a loving venom"), shapes the middle beat (scions' transformation depends on worthiness), and recurs at closure when the gardener receives "the loving venom... the blessing and the curse." The trait constrains one key action (the alchemical test of the scions) and is present at the ending. However, it operates more as metaphor than as a visible tradeoff with immediate cost; the "venom" is benign in execution. Functional across beats with thematic charge, but the cost is conceptual rather than dramatized, landing in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Ghost" as action-category defines Elara's mode of interaction (ephemeral cameo appearances, manifesting/vanishing, translucent fingers, post-mortal perception) and enables the major turn (her solidification at the propagation chamber). The ghostly mechanics are signaled early and shape multiple beats; her spectral nature is the reason the debt spans centuries and the gardener inherits the work. The action is essential and irreplaceable, though "ghost" is broad enough that minor edits could swap it for "spirit" or "wraith" without structural collapse, preventing a top-band score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through ephemeral cameo appearances" is signaled early (second paragraph: "ephemeral cameo appearances—manifesting briefly beside the grafting station, vanishing when the night gardener turned"), defines Elara's mechanics across beats (drifting, manifesting, felt only as a chill), and culminates in her one-moment solidification at closure. The method constrains her interaction (she cannot speak or physically intervene consistently) and the breach of that method (solidifying) charges the ending. Strong setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is present from the opening line, supplies the scions whose transformation is the pivotal event, and constrains Elara's manifestations (glass walls, propagation chamber, grafting station, iron rafters). The "endless night" frame recurs and the approaching dawn at closure reweights the premise. The greenhouse is indispensable; the story's logic (debt repayment through cultivating growth in dark places) depends on this exact setting. Strong setup, causal pressure, and closure linkage with high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Over the hush of winter-cracked fields" appears in the opening and again near closure ("swimming through winter-cracked fields of memory"), establishing tone and the seasonal frame. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page; three hundred winters pass in summary, and the present action unfolds without a live clock. The phrase is more atmospheric than causal. Lyric reprise reweights the stake slightly, but the element remains ornamental rather than a tactical constraint, capping it below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation (repay a debt across lifetimes) is introduced early (fourth paragraph: "the debt had begun three hundred winters ago"), drives Elara's appearances and service, and culminates in the debt shifting "closer to balance" at closure. The debt constrains her choices (she must tend growth in dark places), creates friction (centuries of penance, watching her partner fade), and the cost is legible (approaching freedom requires passing the burden). Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability; the motivation is indispensable across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Mournful elation" is established early (ashen veil, luminous coffin, endless night balanced against glowing fruit, resonant awakening) and modulates with pressure (Elara's "mournful elation of someone who had nearly reached the shore"). The tone charges the final image (approaching dawn, nearly finished work, the gardener's tears of "ancient grief and older joy"). Coherent through turns and purposeful at closure, the tone reweights the ending without collapsing into single-note mood. Strong setup and payoff with thematic charge.</comment>
