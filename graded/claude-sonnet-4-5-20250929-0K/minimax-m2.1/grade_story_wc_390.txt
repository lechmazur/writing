<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority reads as concrete and character-particular in the opening beats ("weight of that responsibility settle into her bones"), and her micro-choices under pressure (adjusting the key by fractions of millimeters) emerge from a consistent blend of technical training and emotional inheritance. The motivation—protecting her grandmother's legacy—shapes her actions throughout. However, the final choice lacks contradictory impulse; she executes a technical solution without visible internal conflict or renunciation, so the emotional progression feels one-note at closure. The "logically emotional" trait is asserted more than dramatized in a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph without penalty. The piece follows a causal lens: Maren's training → problem diagnosis → key adjustment → harmonic resolution. The closure is a Decisive Change (the harbor shifts from threatened to safe) with a felt cost (exhaustion and relief), and the inferred lens holds. However, the cost is summarized rather than shown in a final image that reweights prior material; "slumped against the lighthouse wall, exhaustion and relief" tells the outcome without a concrete sensory or choice-based close. The escalation tightens once (crystal tone warping, ice shuddering), meeting the minimum for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting details are selective and purposeful: the drift-ice marina, the copper cradle, the sunset's molten gold all anchor the scene and create atmospheric pressure. The crystal's housing and the key's "precisely machined surface" constrain Maren's choice by requiring vibrational tuning, meeting the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (breath crystallizing, ice groaning, sonic absolution rippling outward), and the frozen sea foundation integrates with the plot. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout the spiral stairs and lamp room.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preventing ice maelstrom, protecting the harbor) is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs: the crystal's tone warps, temperature drops faster than predicted, and subsonic tremor threatens the resonance. Maren's agency drives the resolution (she adjusts the key in real-time), and the harbor's safety depends on her action. However, the escalation is summarized ("with each passing moment the ice outside shuddered with increasing violence") rather than shown in a beat that narrows her options on the page. The cost at closure is told (exhaustion, relief) without a visible price that forecloses a live alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the marriage of logic and feeling, the inheritance of responsibility, and the balance of technical precision with intuition. The final line ("logically emotional, eternally vigilant, guardian of both sound and silence") risks overt thematic statement, though it stays tied to Maren's role. The sunset motif recurs with purpose (golden light fading as stakes rise), and the crypt keeper's key accrues symbolic weight through use. However, the ending summarizes the theme ("marriage of logic and feeling") rather than letting the image carry it without commentary, lowering resonance slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Maren's mind filters the world through vibrational mathematics and familial duty. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated (e.g., "sonic absolution," "temple of ice," "logically emotional"). Free indirect style is clean, and narrative certainty matches what Maren can plausibly know. However, phrases like "holy," "sacred artifact," and "eternal song" drift toward elevated register in peak beats without full dramatization, creating slight texture strain. No dialogue is present; voice remains singular and coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high in the technical beats (frequency tuner, harmonic spectrum, counter-oscillation). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The challenge was that she needed to adapt her approach in real-time, feeling her way through the harmonic spectrum" restates the vibrational-matching premise without new pressure. The final paragraph summary ("Through the windows, the last sliver of golden sunset slipped below the horizon, but the harbor was safe. She had adapted, as she always would, through the marriage of logic and feeling, and the sacred artifact would continue its eternal song") repeats closure points across three sentences without propulsion. Template cadence shows in the progression "She climbed... entered... withdrew... pressed... closed... adjusted," a stem-stack that flattens momentum. Minor filter-verb reliance ("felt the weight," "felt both beautiful") dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise (lighthouse keeper protects harbor via resonance crystal) is familiar but receives specific grounding through vibrational-matching mechanics and the crypt keeper's key as tuner. The "logically emotional" trait and the grandmother's legacy offer modest character freshness. However, the emotional arc (dutiful keeper executes technical solution, harbor saved, legacy continues) follows a template path without a non-obvious turn. The sunset clock and ice-pressure antagonist do not transform the core beats; swapping in a different natural threat would leave the arc unchanged. The transformation test suggests insufficient originality for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maren (azure-coat lighthouse engineer) appears in the opening line, drives the diagnostic beat (recognizing the crystal's warped tone), executes the key adjustment, and is present in the closure. Her choices create the key turn (matching the counter-frequency). However, her decision-making is unopposed; she succeeds on the first attempt without a failed try that would force adaptation. The role is essential but the arc is linear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crypt keeper's key is introduced in paragraph one (cold against her chest), explained as a frequency tuner in paragraph six, used on the page in paragraph seven (pressed against the crystal's housing, adjusted by fractions of millimeters), and returns in the closure beat ("The crypt keeper's key had worked once more"). Three distinct beats, causal pressure (enables the harmonic solution), and closure linkage. Visible cost tied to the key: Maren's exhaustion and the inherited responsibility. Strong integration, shy of indispensable only because the mechanics are explained rather than shown failing first.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Sonic absolution" appears once in the climax beat ("a wave of sonic absolution rippled outward, a cleansing frequency") as a metaphor for the harmonic solution. It does not shape earlier stakes or tactics; Maren pursues "counter-frequency" and "harmonic matching" without the concept of absolution influencing her approach. The term reads as thematic ornament rather than a driver of on-page choice. Mentioned but not integrated into the escalation or closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Logically emotional" is asserted in two places: paragraph three ("logical assessment of consequences intertwined with something far more visceral") and the final line ("logically emotional, eternally vigilant"). The trait is told rather than shown constraining a choice; Maren's actions lean technical (calculating frequencies, adjusting the key) without an on-page moment where logic and emotion clash or compete with visible cost. The attribute is thematically claimed but does not enable or constrain a beat. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Adapt" appears in the title-element list and is enacted in paragraph six ("she needed to adapt her approach in real-time") and the closure ("She had adapted, as she always would"). The action drives the key turn: Maren adjusts the key's position in response to the ice's threatening hum, finding the counter-frequency. However, the adaptation is summarized rather than shown in a failed-then-corrected sequence. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure, with causal role, but the mechanics feel linear (she adapts and succeeds immediately) rather than redefining options through trial.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vibrational matching is explained in paragraph three ("theory that any destructive frequency could be neutralized by matching its harmonic and introducing counter-oscillation"), shapes the middle beat (Maren searches "for that impossible perfect match"), and resolves the climax ("her mechanically precise movements synced with the crystal's desperate song"). The method is signaled early, structures her attempts, and delivers the closure effect. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown failing first, and the match occurs on the first depicted try without visible trial-and-error.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina anchors the opening line, supplies the threat (ice churning into maelstrom), and is present in the closure (harbor settles into stillness). The setting pressures the stakes: without the crystal's stabilization, the marina becomes "a tomb of frozen wreckage." The frozen sea foundation and ice's subsonic tremor are integral to the conflict. Spatial elements (spiral stairs, lamp room, copper cradle) guide Maren's movements. The setting drives the problem and resolution; removing it would collapse the plot.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The sunset appears in the opening ("twelve minutes until sunset") and recurs in paragraphs four, seven, and nine ("the last sliver of golden sunset slipped below the horizon"). The timeframe tightens the window for action and is tracked across beats ("The sunset was beginning its descent," "sunset flames burned lower," "last sliver... slipped below the horizon"). However, the clock does not force a trade-off or failed attempt; Maren succeeds before the deadline without visible cost tied to running out of time. Present and tracked, but the urgency does not alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to protect the sacred artifact (Resonance Crystal) is established early ("her grandmother had passed down with trembling hands"), drives her action (climbing the lighthouse, tuning the crystal), and is reaffirmed at closure ("her grandmother, and her grandmother before her"). The motivation is dramatized in her choices (pressing the key, adjusting by millimeters) and carries emotional cost (memory of the previous keeper's failure, exhaustion). However, the want is uncontested; there is no friction between protecting the artifact and another desire. Strong setup, causal role, closure linkage, but no internal conflict tied to the motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Fleshly ethereal" as tone is attempted through contrasts: "breath crystallizing," "groaned beneath... boots," "weight... settle into her bones" (fleshly); "holy," "sacred artifact," "eternal song," "sonic absolution" (ethereal). The tone is present across beats and modulates slightly (visceral urgency rising, then peaceful stillness). However, the ethereal register ("holy," "absolution," "eternal") risks purple overstatement in peak beats without full grounding in Maren's embodied experience. The tone is coherent but not fully integrated; the final image leans summary ("logically emotional, eternally vigilant") rather than charged sensory close.</comment>
