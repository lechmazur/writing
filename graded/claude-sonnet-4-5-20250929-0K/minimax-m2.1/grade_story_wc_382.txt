<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is present but often operates at a remove—her "motivation sharpened from mere curiosity into something closer to necessity" is told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. The tutor remains opaque by design, which serves the concept but limits relationship dynamics as a crucible. The final choice ("I don't need to know") crystallizes Elena's acceptance with visible cost (foreclosing the path of full truth), but the journey there lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Embodied emotion is sparse; much relies on metaphorical language rather than visceral reaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through recursive imagery (buildings, language, seals, stars) and shifts cadence at the meteor-shower interrogation, which narrows options and crystallizes Elena's stance. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elena's hand-over-hand gesture and decision to accept mystery reconfigures the relationship with undeniable pressure, though the cost (living with uncertainty, accepting the tutor's undead nature) is more felt than explicitly paid on the page. The final-paragraph reflection ("the language of walls that had witnessed everything") reweights prior material. One meaningful tightening is present; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid and purposeful: the antique desk with its seal-impression, the third-floor corner window facing east, the rooftop garden under the meteor shower all recur and charge the final image. The piece filters environment through Elena's architectural lens, and the buildings themselves "lean inward, eager to hear" at the climax, functioning as micro-setting that constrains choice. Spatial choreography is clean. The accumulative mode means environment reweights meaning rather than physically blocking paths, which the piece executes well enough to pass the 9+ gate test (recurring object charges the final image).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Elena's need to understand why she ended up in this building/life) is signaled early and tightens through the tutor's lessons. The meteor-shower interrogation is the key pressure point, where Elena's question forces a choice between comfort and truth. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as a single deepening rather than multiple turns, and Elena's agency at closure (placing her hand, saying "I don't need to know") arrives somewhat passively—the tutor does not resist, buildings exhale, stars continue. The cost (foreclosing full knowledge) is legible but muted. No major mid-story reversal; pressure accretes but does not visibly narrow options until the end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (the relationship between truth and agreed-upon lies, the language of memory and place) emerges organically from the desk seal, the architectural syntax, and the final acceptance. The meteor-shower image—"stars streaking across the darkness like corrections written in the margins of the universe"—is fresh and non-literal. The ending offers a resonant answer (some truths are too large for ordinary conversation; inhabiting mystery can be a form of knowing) without stating a moral. The tutor's ghostliness is handled with restraint, and the piece resists tidy resolution. Final image reweights prior material (buildings exhale, stars choreograph) with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elena's architectural-student perception. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, and free-indirect moments ("Wasn't it possible to know someone entirely through the architecture they inhabited…?") land cleanly. However, some diction drifts into elevated register during emotional beats ("the membrane between what was real and what was merely true") that feels slightly imposed rather than character-specific. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful. The tutor's "some signatures are made by the living and some by the spaces between them" reads as thematic shorthand rather than natural speech. Perceptual signature is present but could be more distinctly Elena's rather than generically lyrical.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports pacing, but several sentences loop conceptually: "agreed-upon lies" is named twice in the penultimate paragraph, and "language of old buildings" recurs without added pressure. The phrase "present in the way that only the dead can be" in the final paragraph borders on overt thematic statement. Figurative density is high throughout ("stars streaking…like corrections," "membrane between what was real and what was merely true") without clear pattern-teaching, which risks overwriting. Clarity holds, but momentum sags in the reflective passages. No major artifacts touch closure, but cumulative minor issues (paraphrase loops, elevated diction in peak beats) lower the score within the non-closure cap range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ghost-tutor premise is familiar, but the piece transforms it through the "dead language" double meaning and the architectural-syntax framing. The desk seal as inherited/exhumed artifact, the meteor shower as legible corrections, and the final hand-clasp that accepts mystery rather than demanding revelation all feel purposefully chosen. The emotional truth (intimacy coexisting with unknowability) avoids generic template arcs. However, the "tutor of lost knowledge" and "rooftop under stars" beats echo established literary motifs, and the piece does not take structural risks beyond its lyric accumulation. Synthesis is solid and specific enough to rise above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dead language tutor is present throughout and her lesson-giving shapes Elena's trajectory, but the tutor herself makes no on-page decisions that create key turns. She answers questions, shows the seal, and smiles enigmatically. The closest to agency is her not pulling away when Elena touches her hand, which is passive. Her choices are recounted (she dug up the seal, she chose to teach Elena) but not dramatized. Present and functional, but does not drive reversals.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The antique desk seal appears in beat one (the desk bears its circular impression), is handled and explained mid-story (inherited, buried, exhumed), and is invoked again in the reflection on agreements and signatures. It recurs with shifting meaning (document-marker → grave-artifact → symbol of binding truth) and charges the thematic layer, but it does not constrain a physical choice or alter Elena's tactics on the page. Solid lyric reprise, eligible for mid-6s under the two-gate + resonance allowance, but not indispensable to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Agreed-upon lies are named explicitly and shape the entire relationship: Elena and the tutor tacitly accept boundaries (the tutor is "a distant relative," the sessions are "architectural study," the seal was buried but the tutor was there before Elena was born). This concept structures Elena's final choice—she decides not to press for literal truth, accepting mystery as valid knowledge. It constrains tactics (no direct confrontation about the tutor's nature) and is present at closure ("The agreed-upon lies continued…shaping the membrane between what was real and what was merely true"). Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" is attributed to the tutor once, describing her movements and her handling of the seal with reverence. It does not enable or constrain an on-page action with visible cost; it functions as character texture. Label-only, no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Interrogate" occurs explicitly in the meteor-shower scene ("Elena finally felt bold enough to interrogate her tutor about the nature of their arrangement"), which is the story's key turn—Elena's question forces the stakes into the open and prompts the tutor's deflecting counter-questions, leading to Elena's climactic acceptance. The action is signaled, dramatized, and shapes the closure. However, the interrogation itself is fairly brief and could be replaced by another confrontational verb (challenge, question, press) without major structural loss. Solid mid-band causal role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Borrowing sugar in the opening beat initiates contact, and the escalation to weekly tea sessions and rooftop meetings is recounted as the relationship's arc. The method matters as the frame for their intimacy, and the final line ("And the tutor continued to teach her…lending their expertise to the living with a generosity that knows no bounds") echoes the borrowing/lending motif. Present at setup and closure, shapes the relationship's texture, but the mechanics do not alter a mid-story choice. Two-gate lyric reprise, eligible for low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during the meteor shower is the location of the climactic interrogation scene. The meteor imagery ("stars streaking across the darkness like corrections written in the margins of the universe") charges the moment and recurs in the final beat ("the stars continued their ancient choreography"). The setting does not physically constrain Elena's choice, but it supplies the resonant backdrop that elevates the acceptance into something cosmic. Solid presence in the closure zone, eligible for mid-5s under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elena's desire "to learn the language of old buildings" is stated early and intensifies ("her motivation sharpened from mere curiosity into something closer to necessity") as she seeks to understand why she chose this building and life. It drives her to accept the tutor's lessons and shapes her final acceptance—understanding through mystery rather than literal fact. The motivation is present in the ending reflection ("the only language worth knowing") and reweights the premise. However, it is more told than dramatized through conflicted on-page choices; no moment where learning costs her something tangible mid-story. Solid thematic through-line, eligible for mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mysterious familiarity is coherent throughout: the tutor is both neighbor and ghost, the building is both new home and ancient presence, the agreed-upon lies create intimacy without full disclosure. Tone modulates subtly—warmer in the tea sessions, cooler and more enigmatic during the interrogation, then settling into quiet acceptance at closure. The final image (hand over hand, buildings exhaling, stars continuing) charges the tone with earned ambiguity. The piece teaches its tonal pattern early and holds it through turns without static repetition.</comment>
