<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss, but her choices feel preordained rather than pressured. The soldier's shift from shame to laughter is told through summary ("the beginning of a smile") rather than dramatized with embodied contradiction. Internal conflict is claimed ("the familiar ache in her chest") but never shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to "adjust the harp's misaligned bridge and begin to play again" is continuation, not a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through ritual detail and spectral encounter, aiming for a cadence shift at closure. Orientation anchors arrive early (who/where/when by ~80 words). However, the closure lacks on-page cost—the soldier disperses "in something that looked almost like gratitude" and Mira simply continues her work. The ending recycles the opening's action ("adjusted the harp...began to play again") without reweighting options or imposing a felt price. The piece demonstrates competent linkage but the closure effect remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Echo gorge functions actively: its acoustics "amplified the frequencies of the unfinished" and "turned grief into something audible," directly enabling Mira's work. The harp's misalignment and the crocodile's tooth are integrated as tools with mechanical specificity. Spatial choreography is clear (gorge rim, heart, walls). The sunrise charges the final image ("luminous ache itself") and the gorge recurs with evolving pressure. Strong setting work that constrains method and charges atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (helping the soldier release) is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The soldier appears "many times" before this encounter, deflating urgency. No reversal or tightening occurs—Mira performs her ritual, the soldier responds predictably, the cycle continues. The ending announces "another spirit stirred, ready to confess" without escalation or cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or the cadence shift; here the piece loops without meaningful intensification.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (laughter integrating into grief) emerges from concrete particulars: the milk-out-of-nose story, the harp's distortion as metaphor for brokenness enabling connection. The piece resists easy morals and embraces complexity—the soldier "had been human before they became ghosts." However, the final paragraph edges toward theme statement ("laughter could integrate itself into the process of grief like light into a prism"). The crocodile's tooth and misaligned harp create purposeful symbolic architecture without forced recurrence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; focalization remains anchored to Mira. Perceptual signature is selective ("she had learned to move through grief like water through stone") and voice carries a distinct lyric texture. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains believability for mid-crisis interiority: "luminous ache itself," "calcified into regret," "sacred absurdity." The soldier has no dialogue; Mira's song is paraphrased rather than rendered, missing an opportunity for voice differentiation. Purposeful compression in the ritual descriptions works within the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative density supports atmosphere without overwhelming clarity. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "the attribute she wore modestly—fearlessness" is immediately restated as "exhaustion with fear itself"; "simple in description but impossible in practice" is scaffolding that could be cut; "the familiar ache in her chest that never quite healed, the wound that motivated her work" loops the same idea. Stock phrases cluster: "threads of amber light," "sacred absurdity," "luminous ache." These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats (−0.6 in Q7 for template loops and stock metaphor strings).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost-soul work, musical healing, and spectral confession offers a fresh angle, but the execution follows a familiar template: magical specialist performs ritual, ghost releases, cycle continues. The crocodile's tooth and misaligned harp are inventive specifics. However, the emotional arc (shame → laughter → release) is predictable, and Mira's "tired hope" at the end returns her to the same stance she held at the opening without transformation. The piece commits to its premise but does not surprise within it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira (lost soul collector) is present throughout and her profession frames all action. She makes tactical choices (using the tooth, singing the story, adjusting the harp) that enable the soldier's release. However, her choices do not create reversals—she executes a known ritual without friction or failure. She is the agent of the closure event but does not alter her own stance or tactics under pressure. Setup clear, development functional, closure participation via ritual execution. Causal role in one major beat (the soldier's release) but easily swappable with another soul-worker archetype (−0.4 for swappability).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The crocodile's tooth appears in three beats: received three nights prior (backstory anchor), pressed to strings during the ritual (method), and "grew warm in her hand" after the soldier departs (sensory callback). It enables the harp's frequency shift, which is mechanically necessary for reaching spirits. However, the tooth's properties are told rather than tested—no scene shows Mira discovering its function or adjusting its use. Setup (backstory mention ~25% mark is late but functional), development (used in ritual), closure (warm in hand, ornamental). Functional across beats but the warmth callback is decorative rather than reweighting (−0.5 for late setup, −0.3 for ornamental closure touch).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Spectral confessions shape the entire narrative: the soldier's confession of fear and selfishness is the stake Mira must address, and the gorge's acoustics "amplified the frequencies of the unfinished, the words never spoken, the confessions that had calcified into regret." The concept structures Mira's method (research his living years to find the milk-nose story) and defines success (the soldier's laughter as release). Setup early (gorge amplifies confessions), development (soldier's whispered confession), closure (healing comes through recognizing joy coexisted with shame). Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Modestly fearless" is labeled in the opening ("the attribute she wore modestly—fearlessness that wasn't courage but simply exhaustion with fear itself") but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. Mira performs her work without hesitation or struggle; no moment shows her fear being tested or her exhaustion altering tactics. The trait is asserted rather than dramatized. Setup (label-only mention), no development, no closure participation (−0.6 for label-only use, −0.5 for missing middle and closure gates).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Pursue" frames Mira's ongoing work ("she pursued the art of helping souls laugh," "pursuing the next soul") but the narrative shows arrival and ritual execution, not pursuit. The soldier is already present "at this same juncture"; Mira does not track, search, or adapt her approach under resistance. The final line ("pursuing the next soul") recycles the opening's frame without escalation. The action is thematic rather than dramatized. Setup (stated as ongoing practice), weak development (no on-page pursuit beats with friction), closure (label reprise). Lyric seed → final return without mid-scene use, but the return does not reweight stakes (cap at ~6.0 per lyric allowance, −0.5 for summary-only use, −0.3 for swappability with "help" or "guide").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The misaligned harp and its distorted notes are mechanically central: the imperfection "created the very distortion she required," and the notes "split into three as it hit the gorge walls, creating a cascade of sound." Mira presses the crocodile's tooth to strings, plays "a question, a strange and wobbly inquiry," then sings through the discordant notes. The method is signaled, demonstrated, and succeeds in the soldier's release. Setup (harp introduced ~40% mark, tooth earlier), development (ritual execution with mechanical detail), closure (adjusts bridge, begins again). The method shapes the central attempt and succeeds. Late first full demonstration (−0.3), but strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Echo gorge actively shapes the narrative: its acoustics "amplified the frequencies of the unfinished," its walls split notes into three, its narrowing wound is where spirits gather. The gorge is not merely backdrop—it is the mechanism enabling Mira's work. Spatial choreography (rim, heart, walls) tracks cleanly. The sunrise at the gorge's rim charges the final image. Setup early (first paragraph), development (acoustics enable method), closure (gorge holds "another spirit" and Mira's continuing work). Environment pressures choices and supplies the central resource.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Hidden sunrise" is mentioned in the opening ("hush of a hidden sunrise bled through") and returns at the soldier's release ("sun cracked fully over echo gorge's hidden rim"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency—the narrative is durational but untimed. The sunrise marks atmosphere and a transition beat (darkness to light as metaphor) but does not impose a deadline or alter Mira's tactics. Setup (opening image), weak development (no time pressure), closure (light arrives as backdrop to release). Lyric reprise reweights mood but not stakes (−0.5 for no time-pressure development, −0.3 for swappability with "dawn" or "morning").</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation (integrate laughter into healing) is stated ("she pursued the art of helping souls laugh before they let go") and demonstrated through her method: researching the soldier's life to find the milk-nose story that makes him laugh. The motivation "lived in her marrow, carved there by her own losses," linking personal grief to professional mission. However, the motivation is never conflicted—Mira does not face a choice between laughter and another path, nor does her method fail or exact a cost. Setup (stated early), development (method demonstrates motive), closure (continues mission without friction). Functional but uncontested (−0.4 for lack of friction, −0.3 for told-only personal stakes).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" is coherent and pervasive: "luminous ache itself—beautiful and painful in equal measure" explicitly names the tone at the soldier's release, and the opening's "threads of amber light" through stone walls, Mira's "familiar ache in her chest," and "tired hope" all sustain the register. The tone modulates from stillness (opening hush) to crescendo (soldier's dispersal) to renewal (final morning). The phrase charges the final third and the ending's "luminous morning" echoes it. Setup (implicit in opening atmosphere), development (named and sustained), closure (charges final image). Strong tonal control with purposeful modulation under pressure.</comment>
