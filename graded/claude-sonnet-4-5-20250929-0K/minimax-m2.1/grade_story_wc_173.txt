<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The courtesan's interior world is richly rendered with embodied resistance ("her wrists turned in ways that meant 'I refuse'"), but her agency remains observational rather than decisional through most of the piece. The work of untangling threads is described in metaphorical abstraction without concrete micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The defiance claimed in the final paragraph feels asserted rather than earned through on-page contradiction or cost—she was always awake, so what path was foreclosed? Interiority leans heavily on elevated, poetic register that occasionally distances rather than grounds emotional specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who she is, where precisely, and what immediate danger she faces remain vague past the opening third, triggering a −0.4 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The story operates in Accumulative/Textural mode, but closure lacks decisive cost—she departs "awake" and "defiant," states she already held at the opening, so no path is visibly foreclosed. The "harvest of echoes" work is metaphorical throughout; no concrete before/after in her options or knowledge lands on the page. Cause-effect linkage is minimal: kneeling, perceiving threads, and rising do not narrow choices or alter stakes in a legible way.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The silver courtyard and frozen fountain are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (prisms, fractured moonlight, snow). Spatial choreography is clear and the environment charges the final image when dawn transforms the prisms into rainbows. Capped at 7.0 due to orientation penalty applied in Q2. The setting constrains access (a secret sanctuary) and the prisms respond to her purpose, but these effects remain metaphorical rather than altering a concrete tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—remaining awake against the lullaby of conformity—is signaled early but never tested by on-page pressure. No antagonist appears, no choice between competing goods materializes, and the protagonist's untangling work proceeds without reversal or complication. The resolution claims she "had proven something to herself tonight," but the text shows no moment where that proof was at risk or cost was paid. Escalation is absent; the work proceeds smoothly from kneel to rise without a meaningful tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between conformity and resistance, charged by recurring images of the lullaby, threads, and awakening. The final image of defiant beauty reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the "lullaby of conformity" and "quiet rebellion" risk abstraction; the piece would benefit from one concrete, non-obvious dramatization of what compliance costs or what defiance enables. The ending offers resonance but stops short of a non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and lyric, with a consistent elevated register that fits the courtesan's cultivated grace. Perceptual signature is present in the way beauty and gesture are filtered through coded rebellion. However, the prose occasionally drifts into decorative abstraction ("liminal space," "spiritual residue") that feels more like thematic commentary than character-specific perception. No dialogue appears; focalization is stable and clean. Psychic distance remains consistent, though the elevated diction under peak moments (the untangling work) can distance rather than sharpen pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, but several patterns accumulate: "each one," "this was," and "she had" sentence stems recur across paragraphs; paraphrase loops appear ("the lullaby of conformity was a subtle thing, sung in lullabies"). Stock metaphors like "golden filaments of individual spirit" and "prison of beauty" lean on familiar phrasing. The metaphor of "threads" and "untangling" is extended throughout but never grounds in a concrete mechanic—how does one perceive a non-physical thread? Information density is high in description but low in action advancement. Template cadence and synonym churn in reflective beats trigger −0.8 in Q7; no artifacts touch closure directly, so high-band remains possible elsewhere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—a courtesan who resists through secret spiritual work—offers a fresh angle on conformity and agency, but the execution leans on familiar rebellion-against-beauty tropes without a sharp, non-obvious inflection. The "harvest of echoes" is poetic but abstract; the mechanics remain metaphorical, reducing specificity. The transformation test is weak: swap "courtesan" for "novitiate" or "handmaid" and the emotional arc holds nearly unchanged. The piece demonstrates craft and thematic coherence but lacks the bold risk or irreplaceable particular that would elevate originality into the high bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The chaste courtesan is present throughout and her perception drives the narration, but she makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She kneels, perceives, untangles, and rises—observation without decision. The attribute "chaste" is mentioned in the opening line but never constrains or enables action with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary appears in the opening third, is central to the untangling work in the middle, and transforms at closure when dawn creates rainbows. It is handled across multiple beats and its state evolves (frozen, catching moonlight, brightening, then scattering color). However, its role is largely atmospheric; removing it would weaken the imagery but not break the story's logic, as the untangling could occur at any spiritually charged location. The specificity of "prisms" does not constrain choice in an irreplaceable way.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The harvest of echoes is named and described across multiple beats and shapes the protagonist's stated purpose. However, it remains metaphorical and ornamental—no concrete mechanic, no on-page consequence if she fails to harvest, no visible cost or trade-off tied to this work. It functions as theme and imagery rather than a stake that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Bodily poetic" is described in the third paragraph and the final paragraph revisits it as "shifted in some essential way," but it never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. The head courtesan's misreading of the coded gestures is told, not dramatized. It reads as label-only characterization rather than a trait that alters tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Unlock" appears only in the final third: "She had unlocked something in herself through the patient work of freeing others." The action is asserted rather than dramatized, and no prior beat turns on an unlocking gesture or mechanic. Late arrival and summary-only use cap the score; swapping "unlock" for "discover" or "awaken" would require minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" is signaled early, described in detail during the fountain scene, and recurs in the final third. The method shapes the middle work and the protagonist's claimed transformation. However, the mechanics remain entirely metaphorical—no concrete action, no visible cost if a thread resists or tangles further. It constrains the protagonist's activity but not her choices, as the work proceeds smoothly without complication.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The silver courtyard under snow is established in the opening line, anchors all action, and transforms at closure with the dawn-rainbow image. It functions as sanctuary and reflects the protagonist's inner state. However, it does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome; it is a beautiful backdrop rather than a micro-setting that changes tactics. The frozen fountain is more active (prisms respond to her purpose) but still ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Between sigh and smile" appears in the opening and closing paragraphs as a poetic frame but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. No clock is present; the work proceeds from night to dawn without urgency or temporal constraint. The phrase is thematic decoration rather than a stake that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to defy the lullaby of conformity is named early, drives the protagonist's secret work, and is restated at closure. However, it is never tested—no moment where conformity tempts her, no scene where defiance costs her safety or standing. The desire is told and elaborated in reflection rather than dramatized through conflicted choice. Friction between want and cost is absent on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Tone blends serenity (snow, stillness, patient work) with subtle alarm (spiritual theft, rebellion, the palace's draining power). The phrase "alarming serenity" appears in the final third and the tone remains stable throughout, modulating only slightly as dawn breaks. It supports the accumulative design but does not charge the final image in a way that reweights prior material; the tone at the end matches the tone at the start. Coherent but static.</comment>
