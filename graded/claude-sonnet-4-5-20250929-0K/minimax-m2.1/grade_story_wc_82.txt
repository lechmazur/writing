<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's grief-driven transformation from basilica craftsperson to private maker is established, but her present choices remain largely contemplative rather than dramatic. The interiority is concrete ("polished the gem in slow circles") and the contradiction between building for others versus self is visible, yet the ending choice—watching her daughter's dream and folding another crane—repeats established pattern without a new cost that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is strong ("luminous torment," grief as "constant luminescence"), but the final beat consolidates rather than transforms, fitting Earned Stasis only if we read the building itself as the renunciation; that reading is available but not charged with fresh cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates grief-work particulars (gem polishing, crane folding, dream playback) and the final image reweights the opening frame: building containers becomes the method of living after loss. Orientation anchors (floating island tea garden, Mira, twilight, eighteen months post-shadow) arrive clearly within the first ~100 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira's choice to fold another crane after watching the dream consolidates her new craft as the response to unbearable loss, and the conceptual cost—living by memorializing—is legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when the dream plays and she continues folding, cementing repetition as survival. The lens holds and the cost is felt, though a sharper trade-off or foreclosed option would lift this into the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating tea garden, crystalline bushes, and crane paper anchor the setting vividly and filter through Mira's grief-saturated perception. The workbench, gem, and lantern constrain her physical actions (polishing, folding, watching), and the final image—lantern dimming to ember—charges the ending with sensory specificity. Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling among bushes, workbench nearby, lantern core). The detail is selective and voice-filtered ("cloud-sea below," "eternal twilight"), fitting the accumulative lens. The micro-setting (workbench and lantern) effectively functions as environment here, meeting the 9+ gate condition, but the tea garden itself remains largely atmospheric backdrop rather than actively shaping tactics, capping the score just below 7.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: how to hold and honor her daughter's memory after the shadow detached. The piece signals this early and tightens once when Mira stops working for the basilica and begins private lantern-making, a choice that narrows options (no longer sharing dreams with pilgrims). The final beat—watching the dream, then folding another crane—deepens the stake by showing the repetition as survival method, with the conceptual cost (endless memorialization as the price of living) legible. Under the Accumulative lens, this one meaningful tightening plus cadence shift at closure is sufficient for this length. Agency is present (she chose to stop basilica work, she chooses to fold again), and the cost is felt. A second reversal or a more visible trade-off would push this higher, but the escalation is coherent and earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—grief as both obliterating and generative, the paradox of making beauty from unbearable loss—emerges organically from the lantern-making particulars and is never stated baldly. The final image ("You built containers for what you'd lost and learned to call the building of them craft") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how one survives dissolution of the self, reweighting the entire accumulation without moralizing. The crane, gem, and lantern recur purposefully and accumulate pressure rather than serving as checklist symbols. Subtext operates in the choice to stop sharing dreams ("too personal to install in cathedrals") and in the paradox of "descending while ascending." The piece invites reflection and resists tidy resolution, embracing complexity. The thematic answer is earned from scene particulars and charged with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV, stable and intimate throughout. Psychic distance is controlled; perceptual signature is strong (Mira notices light, texture, craft mechanics, grief as luminescence). Diction is elevated but consistent with the lyric-meditative register ("luminous torment," "fold sorrow into shapes that could hold light"), and the syntax modulates with emotional intensity (longer, layered sentences during reflection; shorter beats during the dream playback). Free indirect style is clean. Purposeful compression and poetic phrasing are pattern-taught early and legible. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The prose reads as character-specific: a grief-saturated craftsperson whose perceptions are filtered through making and loss. Voice is distinctive and rhythmically controlled under pressure, meeting the 9+ quick test, but a minor register consistency check (occasional academic formality, e.g., "insidious: a constant luminescence") keeps this just shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines are strong. Information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic resonance). Clarity is generally excellent, though some figurative constructions border on overwriting: "grief… as something more insidious: a constant luminescence that hurt to look at directly" stacks metaphors densely in a single beat, and "fold sorrow into shapes that could hold light" risks abstraction. Template cadence appears briefly in the fold-sequence narration ("valley fold, mountain fold, squash fold…"), which reads as intentional technical specificity but flattens momentum slightly. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Grammar and tense are clean; pronoun references clear. The piece approaches 9+ density and propulsion but the occasional metaphor density in high-pressure beats (luminous torment, constant luminescence, strange grace) and one brief scaffold list keep it in the strong 7s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of lantern-making, dream recording, origami, and grief work feels organic and specific, not merely a prompt checklist. The concept of capturing dying dreams in lanterns is fresh, and the transformation from public (basilica) to private memorial craft offers a non-obvious angle on mourning narratives. The shadow detaching as bodily grief metaphor is vivid and particular. The final image—building containers for loss and naming that building "craft"—is memorable and arises inevitably from prior material. The piece takes risks with its lyric density and metaphysical conceits (floating island, shadow detachment) without retreating to genre safety. One friction: the world-building (dream-ascension, craftspullers, glass basilica architecture) is richly imagined but some elements (shadow detachment, dual-shadow girl) remain underexplored, hinting at template fantasy tropes. Still, emotional specificity and thematic courage elevate this well above median originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her choices (polishing the gem, folding cranes, watching the dream, choosing to fold another) drive the accumulative structure. She made an earlier decision to stop working for the basilica, which is recounted and shapes her present stance. The final choice—to fold another crane after watching the dream—consolidates her method of survival. Setup: clear. Development: her present actions (polishing, folding, setting crane into lantern, watching dream) constrain and enact her grief work. Payoff: she folds another crane in the ending beat, cementing repetition as her response. The character's choices create the accumulative pressure and shape the closure image, but the final choice repeats established pattern rather than introducing a new cost or trade-off, limiting the score to mid-6s rather than 7+.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The glass basilica is mentioned twice: once as a past client for lanterns embedded in architecture, and once to note Mira no longer works for it. Setup: mentioned early. Development: provides backstory contrast (public vs. private grief work) but does not appear in a present-tense beat. Payoff: absent from the ending. The basilica helps establish Mira's transformation but remains static description; it is not handled, revisited with reweighted meaning, or causally active. Cap for missing closure participation: 2.8; lyric-resonance allowance does not apply because the element does not return at the end. Functional but replaceable role (any former employer/client could serve the same contrast) and summary-only use lower the score within the available band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dream recording is the core technology and shapes the entire stakes: Mira's lanterns capture dying dreams, and her final act is to watch her daughter's recorded dream then continue making more. Setup: introduced early ("lanterns… that could record a dying person's final dream"). Development: the gem holds a dream "stirring… like a fish beneath ice," and she sets the folded crane into the lantern to interact with the dream-pulse. Payoff: the lantern plays her daughter's dream in the ending beat, directly charging the final image and her choice to fold another crane. The concept constrains her craft method and is causally active in the closure. All three gates present; causal pressure evident; specificity high; closure linkage strong. This element is nearly indispensable—remove dream recording and the story's logic collapses.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Descends while ascending" appears once as a past realization: Mira tried dream-ascension after the shadow detached and discovered the paradox. Setup: implied (the event occurred in backstory). Development: the realization "transformed her work entirely," a claim that shapes present action but is told rather than dramatized on the page. Payoff: the paradox does not return at the ending or constrain a present choice directly. The attribute motivates her shift from ascension to her current method (gem polishing, folding) but is not causally active in the present beats. Missing closure participation caps the score at 2.8 per the strict cap; however, lyric-resonance allowance applies: the concept seeds her transformation and the final image (building containers, not ascending) can be read as the payoff of that earlier inversion. Lifting to mid-5s under that allowance, but the lack of on-page cost tied directly to this attribute in a present beat limits higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Transform" operates throughout: Mira transforms grief into lanterns, raw dreams into contained light, paper into cranes. Setup: "grief came… as something… that transformed everything it touched." Development: she folds cranes ("transform[ed] her work entirely" after the ascension realization), sets crane into lantern, and the crane "unfold[s] in miniature" with the dream-pulse. Payoff: the final lines state "You built containers for what you'd lost and learned to call the building of them craft," crystallizing transformation as method. The action is thematic and structural—every beat enacts it—and redefines her response to loss. All three gates present; the action shapes multiple beats and the closure image. Swappability test: "create" or "remake" could substitute with minor edits, indicating some replaceability. Strong integration but not fully indispensable, capping the score in the 7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Gem polishing is signaled immediately ("polished the latest gemstone with a cloth woven from her own unwoven dreams") and its mechanics matter on the page. Setup: opening beat. Development: "She polished the gem in slow circles… could feel the dream stirring inside it" (two distinct beats: the physical act and the result), and she watches the gem pulse in the lantern core at the end. Payoff: "The lantern flickered… then caught the twilight… Inside it, a dream began to play." The polishing prepares the dream for display, and the final image depends on that preparation. All three gates present; causal pressure evident (the dream cannot play unless the gem is polished); irreplaceability high (the specific method is tied to her craft and loss). Cost connection: polishing is the meditative labor that enacts her grief work. Strong integration, nearing indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden is established early and provides the physical workspace (crystalline bushes, workbench, cloud-sea below). Setup: clear. Development: Mira kneels among the bushes, works at the bench, and another craftspuller's ascension "nearby" provides brief environmental pressure (she does not look up, reinforcing her choice to work in solitude). Payoff: the garden's "eternal twilight" is caught by the lantern in the ending beat, charging the final image with atmospheric specificity. All three gates present; the setting supplies the tools and mood but does not force a hard choice or constraint (she could perform the same actions in another workshop). Micro-setting option: the workbench and lantern qualify as constraining space. The twilight's presence in the final image adds resonance. Functional and purposeful, but not irreplaceable—cap in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "eighteen months since her daughter's shadow had detached" is signaled in the opening sentence and frames the entire narrative as post-loss. Setup: immediate. Development: the backstory (trying ascension "after the shadow detached," the daughter "back when the girl had been alive and whole") anchors present action in the timeline, and the dream that plays shows the daughter "at seven years old… shadow… not yet detached, not yet gone," creating temporal contrast. Payoff: the final line ("after a piece of yourself had drifted away into the gray") recapitulates the timeframe and charges it with the weight of eighteen months of accumulated grief work. All three gates present; the timeframe tightens the stakes (this is her life now, not a transitional phase) and the cost (endless repetition as survival) is tied to duration. Strong integration, nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Folding grief into origami cranes is both literal and thematic, driving every beat. Setup: "began the precise folds that had become her meditation… One corner to center, valley fold, mountain fold…" Development: "pressed the final point of the crane, set it gently into the lantern's core, and watched it unfold in miniature," then "gem polishing as prayer, crane folding as funeral rite." Payoff: "she began folding another crane, because this was what it meant to live after a piece of yourself had drifted away." The motivation is dramatized through repeated physical action and charged with cost (endless repetition as the price of survival). All three gates present; the desire shapes every choice and the friction between wanting to memorialize and the pain of reliving is embodied in the act. High causal pressure, closure linkage strong, irreplaceability high. Nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Luminous torment" is named once but enacted throughout: grief as "constant luminescence that hurt to look at directly," the twilight and lantern light, the dream-gem's glow. Setup: "the luminous torment the old masters had written about, the state of being half-blinded by sorrow and half-blinded by the strange grace it provided." Development: every sensory detail (twilight, amber cascade, dream-gem pulse, lantern ember) modulates the tone, and the paradox (beauty and unbearability) is sustained under pressure. Payoff: "The lantern flickered… caught the twilight in a cascade of amber… then dimmed to a soft ember"—the final image glows and fades, crystallizing the tone's paradox. Coherent through turns, charges the ending, and reflects the POV's grief-saturated perception. Modulation is present (brighter at dream playback, dimmer at closure) without flattening. Strong tonal control and integration.</comment>
