<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Yara's motivation is stated ("prove that wonder was essential") but never genuinely tested on the page; she encounters no meaningful obstacle or internal conflict. The synesthetic blessing is labeled repeatedly but operates as ornamental description rather than a trait that forces difficult choices. The seventeen-day journey and grandmother's coordinates suggest backstory depth, yet the cavern sequence unfolds as smooth execution without contradiction or cost. Emotional embodiment defaults to stock gestures ("tears freeze upon her cheeks") and the ending grants complete success without a visible trade-off or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive early enough, so no penalty is applied here. However, closure fails the cost-proof test—the final paragraph declares wonder "certified" and "begun again," but no on-page sentence shows what Yara sacrificed, lost, or gave up to achieve this. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural (aurora + bell-song layering), yet no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with felt pressure. The sculptor cameo at midpoint and end attempts simultaneity but adds no causal pressure or cost to Yara's arc, reading as decorative rather than a functional constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ice cavern is vividly rendered ("frozen lung," "fossilized snow," crystal-bell architecture) and sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The aurora functions as both setting feature and mechanism, constraining Yara's synesthetic method and charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The micro-setting (bell, amber sheet on ice altar) participates in the ending, lifting Q3 above mid-band despite the lack of on-page tactical pressure from the environment itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("certify wonder as essential") is signaled early but never meaningfully tightened or tested. Yara lifts the bell, rings it, and wonder flows outward without opposition, error, or a choice that narrows options. The "sculpted hush" transforms smoothly into "symphonic presence" with no reversal, friction, or cost visible on the page. Accumulative lens allows for deepening through density, yet the story offers only additive layering without a pressure point that forces Yara to trade one value for another or foreclose a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme ("wonder as essential heartbeat") emerges through image and aurora-layering rather than overt statement, which is a strength. The amber music sheet, ice-as-instrument, and synesthetic color architecture cohere atmospherically. However, the ending delivers thesis-adjacent language ("certified its essential nature at the moment of creation's first strike") that edges toward Thematic Echo, and the final assertion "wonder—essential, eternal, unfettered—began again" declares resolution rather than earning it through a non-literal final image with ambiguity. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into tidy affirmation without lingering friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (synesthetic color-vision) is consistent and voice-motivated. Diction is elevated and lyric ("prism-song bell ringer," "drink in the auroral light") but remains internally coherent without mid-beat register clashes. However, the prose occasionally slips into abstract poeticism ("water finding its level," "light through glass") that flattens specificity under peak pressure, and the sculptor interlude interrupts Yara's focalization without clear spatial or perceptual anchoring, creating a brief distance wobble.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and opening/closing lines frame well. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The ice had waited millennia… The music had been waiting just as long" and "She understood that the sculpted hush… was not merely absence… but presence of waiting" restate the same idea across adjacent sentences. Template cadence runs with "Yara perceived," "Yara felt," "Yara understood" cluster in the middle third. Mixed metaphor: "aurora… drink in" (aurora is light, cannot drink) and "wonder poured through her like light through glass" (light does not pour). These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats, triggering baseline Q7 deductions and disallowing 9+ globally per the filter-verb stack rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The synesthetic bell-ringer premise offers a fresh angle, and the aurora-as-mechanism integration shows ingenuity. However, the core emotional arc—lone protagonist travels to sacred site, performs ritual, certifies cosmic truth without personal cost—closely matches widely used quest-culmination templates. The sculptor simultaneity and "wonder certification" frame read as ornamental rather than transformative specifics that alter the stakes or moral calculus. The piece commits to its lyric premise but does not follow implications into genuine risk or non-obvious territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Yara is present throughout and performs the climactic bell-ring, but her choices are execution of a predetermined plan rather than decisions that alter tactics under pressure. No key turn traces to her agency; she simply completes the ritual as designed.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The amber music sheet appears in three beats: carried against chest (setup), placed on altar (middle), lifts and hovers at climax (closure). It returns with visual charge at the end but does not constrain a choice or shift Yara's tactics; its role is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Sculpted hush" is named and described repeatedly, transforming from "presence of waiting" to "silence that resounded." It participates in the ending image but functions as thematic metaphor rather than a mechanism that shapes Yara's choices or alters her options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Synesthesia is established early ("Middle C erupted… as violet dawn") and colors the narration throughout. It enables Yara's perception of bell-song as architecture but imposes no visible cost or tradeoff; no moment shows her blessing as a constraint that forces a difficult choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Unfetter" appears early as descriptor, recurs at midpoint ("unfettered her senses"), and charges the penultimate paragraph ("unfettered what the ages had kept prisoner"). The verb's thematic weight increases across beats and the final use reweights the ritual's meaning, though the action itself could be replaced with "release" or "free" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Aurora colors are signaled in paragraph three, woven through Yara's synesthetic perception in the middle, and present in the closure beat ("aurora blazed brighter, carrying that certification outward"). The method matters to the ending image but its mechanics—how aurora enables or constrains the bell-song—remain vague, limiting causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ice cavern anchors the entire sequence, supplies the altar and crystal-bell acoustics, and its transformation into "cathedral of living light" charges the final image. The setting enables the ritual and participates in closure, though it does not pressure Yara's choices or supply a resource she must work around.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The sculptor's chisel-strike is mentioned at midpoint and echoed at the end but does not tighten Yara's decisions or create a live clock. The simultaneity reads as thematic ornament rather than a temporal constraint that alters her tactics or the scene's urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Certify wonder as essential" is stated early and Yara feels "the weight of certification," but the desire is not dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. She performs the ritual without friction; no on-page moment shows her choosing this goal over another need or paying a price to pursue it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Tone oscillates between reverent stillness ("fossilized snow," "patient conjunction") and crescendo ("symphonic presence," "every color at once"), modulating with the ritual's progression. The final image carries tonal charge, yet the oscillation feels more like smooth crescendo than true repose-and-release tension that forces a stance shift.</comment>
