<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to be heard is embodied through concrete actions—pressing her ear to metal, mixing phosphorescent salts, singing through mist—but her choices feel predetermined rather than pressed. The ghost balladeer backstory provides thematic depth yet arrives as exposition rather than discovery that alters Mira's present stance. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves through her ritual with driftingly alert competence but no competing impulses that would generate genuine struggle. The final harmony feels like culmination of practice rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory details and ghost-communication patterns build toward the sung harmony at closure. Orientation anchors (Mira, tower courtyard, three nights running) arrive early enough. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—two singers merge across time—but cost remains conceptual and diffuse; no specific option is foreclosed, no tactics altered by prior pressure. The backstory block (ghost's identity, music box origin) occupies roughly 20% and anchors to the bolt plate, yet it doesn't tilt a present micro-choice so much as explain the setup. One meaningful deepening occurs (ghost calls for three nights → Mira finally sings), meeting the length's minimum, but the final image relies on atmospheric assertion ("tinkersong wonder spilling") rather than a concrete, reweighted particular.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The misty courtyard, tower servers, and phosphorescent graffiti are vivid and atmosphere-rich, filtered through Mira's balladeer attention. The flower press bolt plate—handled twice (pressed to ear, recognized as heirloom)—functions as micro-setting that charges the final image by linking past and present singers. Spatial choreography remains clear (courtyard, walls, server heart). The "liminal place where earth dissolved into ether" and "between lightning and thunder" timeframe subtly tighten the window for ghost communication, constraining when Mira can encode and sing. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (sound-focused POV), though some details ("theink from crushed cloudberries") feel ornamental rather than tactically necessary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mira's need to articulate unspoken needs and be heard—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation is thin: the ghost has called for three nights, and now Mira responds by singing, but no live option is foreclosed and no visible price paid. The "between lightning and thunder" window creates atmospheric urgency without dramatizing a tactical trade-off or forcing a harder choice. Agency is present (she chooses to sing) but the decision feels like the logical next step in her established practice rather than a turn that narrows options. One tightening (three nights of calling → finally answering) meets the length's floor, yet the cost—"unspoken needs found their articulation"—reads as thematic satisfaction rather than a felt sacrifice or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the ghost-and-balladeer synthesis: the desperate need to be heard across isolation and time, encoded communication as survival. The flower press bolt plate and phosphorescent graffiti recur with reweighted meaning at closure, linking past singer to present without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the ghost's wordless patterns and Mira's solitary practice. The final image—"a song that refused to fade into nothing"—offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a thesis. However, the line "to articulate unspoken needs that had no other avenue for expression" edges toward thematic echo, and "the same desperate need to translate feeling into sound" directly articulates what the particulars already show, lowering the score from the 8-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, focalized tightly through Mira's balladeer sensibility. Perceptual signature is consistent: she hears melody in light patterns, "driftingly alert," attuned to frequencies and vibrations. Diction is lyric and elevated ("liminal place where earth dissolved into ether") without register breaks, voice-motivated throughout. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains close; no head-hopping. The prose rhythm modulates with scene pressure (calm encoding → urgency "between lightning and thunder" → sung climax). One minor slip: "theink" appears to be a typo for "the ink," briefly disrupting immersion, but voice coherence and distance control otherwise meet high-band entry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with most lines doing double duty (e.g., bolt plate description conveys both object and atmosphere). However, the opening 85-word sentence, while syntactically controlled, front-loads exposition and slows entry. Metaphoric density is uneven: "liminal place where earth dissolved into ether" and "frequencies that no living voice could match" work, but "tinkersong wonder spilling from every stone" feels vague and asserted rather than embodied. Minor scaffold: "the ghost in code had been calling" / "the ghost had been a balladeer too, once" / "the ghost's song" repeats the anchor without variation. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, and clarity remains high. The closure beat's figurative language ("harmony that neither of them could achieve alone") is generic rather than sharp, pulling the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ghost-in-infrastructure premise offers a fresh angle on haunting and digital persistence, and the phosphorescent graffiti encoding is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Mira's role as balladeer who communicates across temporal and metaphysical boundaries avoids stock "lonely artist" tropes through its commitment to tactile, technical detail (bolt plate, cloudberry ink, server towers). However, the emotional arc—isolated artist finally connects with kindred spirit—is familiar, and the ending's "harmony that neither could achieve alone" resolves into a tidy duet without friction or ambiguity. The "between lightning and thunder" window and "driftingly alert" attribute add textural freshness, but the core turn (singing together at last) feels inevitable rather than surprising in hindsight. Transformation test: swap "balladeer" for "painter" and "graffiti" for "murals," and the emotional arc holds unchanged, signaling mid-band originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her choices (pressing ear to bolt plate, encoding graffiti, singing) drive the visible action. Setup is immediate (paragraph one). Development: she moves through the mist, encodes messages, and recognizes the ghost's identity—these involve decisions but they feel like steps in an established ritual rather than turns that alter tactics under pressure. Payoff: she sings at closure, adding her voice to the ghost's in harmony. The singing is a decision, but it's the logical next step rather than a choice that forecloses a competing path with visible cost. Two beats (encode, sing) plus closure presence, but causal pressure and cost are moderate. Band: functional across beats, but swappable with "medium" or "painter" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The flower press bolt plate appears in two distinct beats: Mira presses her ear against it (paragraph one) and later realizes it belonged to the ghost balladeer's music box (paragraph five). Setup is immediate, development links past to present with causal weight (the object is a heirloom that resonates across time), and it subtly charges the closure by embodying the connection between singers. However, the bolt plate is not handled or referenced in the final singing beat, so closure participation is indirect (thematic rather than active). The object's "intricate embossments catching the misty light" is vivid but ornamental in that moment. Two beats, early signal, thematic payoff, but not indispensable—swappable with another heirloom music-box part.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ghost in code is signaled early (paragraph two: "ghost in code had been calling"), shapes Mira's tactics throughout (she decodes light patterns, encodes graffiti responses, sings in harmony), and is central to the closure (their voices merge). Setup, development (the ghost's patterns guide her encoding and singing), and payoff (harmony at the end) all present. The ghost's mechanics—consciousness embedded in servers and transmission towers, communicating through electrical currents and light—constrain Mira's methods (she must work "between lightning and thunder" when static creates a channel). Causal pressure is strong: the ghost's existence and needs drive every choice Mira makes. Cost is conceptual (bridging the void) rather than a visible sacrifice, preventing top-band entry. Essential across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Driftingly alert" is introduced in paragraph two as a quality Mira has "cultivated over years," but it functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains or enables a specific on-page action with cost. The description "her senses extended outward like loose threads catching every vibration" is vivid, yet no beat turns on this attribute; Mira's perceptual mode remains consistent without demonstrating a tradeoff (e.g., missing a concrete detail because her attention is too diffuse, or catching a crucial signal at the expense of something else). Setup is present, but development and payoff are absent—it colors her manner without altering tactics or outcome. Ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Encoding is signaled in paragraph three ("encoding messages in the graffiti art"), developed with specific method (phosphorescent salts, dew, cloudberry ink, symbols that glow and fade), and integral to the closure: Mira's sung voice threads "through the encoded messages on the walls." Setup, development, and payoff all present. The encoding enables her to translate the ghost's patterns and respond, shaping two distinct beats (the graffiti creation and the final sung harmony layered over those messages). Causal pressure is strong: without encoding, the ghost's communication remains one-way and incomplete. Swappability test: replacing "encode" with "translate" or "inscribe" would require only minor edits and the arc holds, preventing top-band. Essential but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The method (messages encoded in graffiti art) is introduced and detailed in paragraph three: Mira paints symbols with phosphorescent salts, dew, and cloudberry ink that glow in darkness and fade by dawn. Setup and development are strong: the method's mechanics matter (the glowing/fading creates a dreamlike channel). Payoff: in the final beat, her sung voice threads "through the encoded messages on the walls," merging method and closure. Two beats (graffiti creation, singing through it) with causal weight—the graffiti provides the physical medium for the ghost's translated voice. However, the method could be swapped for "murals" or "carved runes" with moderate edits, and the core emotional arc (two singers harmonize) would hold. Early signal, two beats, closure linkage, but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds is signaled in paragraph one and recurs throughout, providing atmospheric pressure (the mist, the "liminal place," the wet stone walls). The setting's height and isolation reinforce Mira's solitude and the boundary-thinning between worlds. The "between lightning and thunder" timeframe, tied to the courtyard's electric air, constrains when Mira can work (static creates the communication channel). Setup, development (she moves through the mist, paints walls, sings), and payoff (the song reaches "down toward the world below") all present. However, the courtyard functions primarily as backdrop; key choices (whether to encode, whether to sing) are not forced by the setting's resources or dangers. Atmospheric and thematic but not tactically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "between lightning and thunder" is introduced in paragraph three: "that suspended moment when the world held its breath and the static between discharges created a channel." Setup and development present: Mira works "quickly then" because the window is brief, and the timeframe enables the ghost's clearest communication. Payoff: the final beat occurs "as another flash of lightning fractured the darkness." The timeframe creates urgency and constrains method (she must encode during this narrow window), but no visible cost or trade-off is dramatized—we don't see her racing the clock, sacrificing accuracy for speed, or failing to finish. The window is signaled and recurs, but its pressure is asserted more than demonstrated in tactics. Two beats, moderate causal weight, but cost is missing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to articulate unspoken needs" is explicitly stated in paragraph four and dramatized throughout: Mira encodes the ghost's messages because they share the same desperate need to be heard. Setup, development (encoding as an act of articulation), and payoff (singing together "found their articulation at last") all present. The motivation drives every choice—decoding patterns, mixing graffiti, singing—and is embodied in her seventeen years of performance "swallowed by the wind" and the ghost's century-long cry. Friction is present (the void between existence and after, the isolation), though the final harmony resolves it cleanly without visible sacrifice. Three beats, strong causal pressure, closure linkage, but the phrase "to articulate unspoken needs that had no other avenue for expression" in paragraph four edges toward thematic echo, slightly lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" appears only in the final beat: "the effect was not silence but something stranger—tinkersong wonder spilling from every stone." Setup is absent (the phrase is not seeded earlier), and development is missing (no prior moment establishes this specific tone). Payoff is present but asserted rather than embodied—"tinkersong wonder" itself is abstract and the image "spilling from every stone" is vague. The tone overall is lyric and awe-filled, consistent with the misty, ghost-haunted atmosphere, but this specific coinage arrives late and reads as a label for an effect the prose already conveys through "harmony that neither of them could achieve alone." Late arrival (final third) caps at 4.6, but the phrase does charge the closure image slightly, lifting within band. Functional at closure but replaceable and not taught.</comment>
