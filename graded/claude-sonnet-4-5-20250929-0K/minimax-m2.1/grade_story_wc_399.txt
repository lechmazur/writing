<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is presented largely through abstract meditation ("the seeing done not by looking directly but by sensing what brushed against the edges of awareness") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to preserve wisdom is told via reflective summary in the second-to-last paragraph, not dramatized through conflicting impulses in scene. The mask's bifurcated perception remains symbolic rather than constraining a specific on-page choice. No visible cost or foreclosed path emerges from her walk; she ends where she began with no alteration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a meditative, cyclic structure but lacks a decisive tightening or cost at closure. Mira's final walk back to the parapet mirrors her opening patrol without a visible reweighting of options or meaning. No on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing; the ending restates the premise without felt consequence. Orientation is adequate (who/where/when by ~120 words), but the absence of closure cost caps the band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pavilion, dunes, and kinetic parapet are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("bone-white columns," "whisperfield calm," "oscillations through the sand"). However, these elements remain largely atmospheric; the parapet's kinetic motion does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page, and the pavilion functions as a meditative backdrop rather than a micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, and the setting is purposefully selective.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wisdom through boundary-tending—is signaled early but never tested by an on-page reversal or tightening. Mira encounters no opposition, makes no trade-off, and faces no narrowing of options; her walk is observational rather than pressured. The piece circles back to the starting state without escalation or visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the lack of a meaningful deepening or pattern break that reweights the stake limits the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of preservation and memory emerges organically from Mira's actions and the landscape's "murmuring." The pavilion's "strange honesty" and the clearings function as resonant images. However, the ending does not offer a non-literal answer or reweight prior material; it restates the premise ("the kinetic parapet waited beneath the dunes to be tended again") without conceptual cost or transformation. Subtext operates in the landscape description, but the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary rather than earned particularity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct, elevated perceptual signature ("the seeing done not by looking directly," "whisperfield calm"). Diction is controlled and poetic, matched to the contemplative register. However, the prose occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("felt recognition," "echo of wisdom") where concrete embodiment would sharpen interiority. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance is consistent, and the voice texture is purposeful, though the meditative register flattens urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is deliberate and syntactically varied; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. However, figurative density is high throughout ("boundaries were forgetting themselves," "clearings she had conjured and consecrated," "echo would still be there to answer") without always serving pressure, creating ornamental texture in a story with minimal escalation. Some phrases verge on the abstract ("frequencies...new layers of meaning") where concrete action would increase propulsion. The prose is clean but momentum lags due to repetitive thematic circling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The half-masked perception and kinetic parapet offer vivid specificity, and the "whisperfield calm" is a fresh coinage. However, the core structure—a solitary guardian walking boundaries to preserve a prophet's wisdom—follows a familiar contemplative-fantasy template without a transformative turn. The piece commits fully to its meditative premise but remains in the safety middle: no bold risk that redefines stakes, no closure choice that grows from prior particulars. The ending restates rather than transforms.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her patrol frames the narrative, but she makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her walk is observational; she "felt," "perceived," "entered," and "began the long walk back" without a choice under pressure. The character is functional but does not create a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet appears in two beats (opening boundary mention, late "pressed her palm" moment, and final walk back) and is described with tactile specificity ("subtle oscillations," "patterns she had spent decades learning"). However, its oscillations do not constrain a choice or alter outcome; it remains a meditative prop rather than a causal actor. Mid-band for functional presence without decisive pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Conjured clearings are mentioned as spaces Mira has seeded to preserve wisdom, appearing in the fourth paragraph and referenced again in closure framing. They are thematically resonant but do not shape on-page stakes or tactics; Mira does not conjure one during the narrative, and no choice depends on their existence. Functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Strangely honest" is applied to the pavilion space, not to Mira as a character trait. The pavilion "did not pretend...offered no false comfort," serving as atmospheric descriptor. It does not constrain an action or enable a trade-off; label-only use without visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Consecration is referenced in past tense ("clearings she had learned to conjure and consecrate") and implied in her ongoing tending, but no act of consecration occurs on the page. The action frames her motivation but does not drive a turn. Told rather than dramatized; easily replaceable with "preserve" or "tend."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Peripheral awareness is signaled early ("seeing done...by sensing what brushed against the edges of awareness"), mentioned again ("Through peripheral awareness, Mira perceived"), and recurs in the climactic Q&A beat ("letting the words brush against her peripheral awareness"). The method is consistent and shapes her perceptual mode, but it does not alter an outcome or constrain a choice under pressure. Functional presence across beats without causal force.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion is central to the story's spatial logic, described in vivid detail ("bone-white columns," "whisperfield calm," plant-fiber roof), and Mira enters it at the narrative's heart. It frames the prophet's echo and offers a threshold space, but it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Atmospheric anchoring without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Three seasons after the arrival" anchors the timeframe early, and the prophet's absence is thematically relevant. However, time does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the narrative is unclocked, with no deadline or temporal pressure shaping tactics. The frame is present but static.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Preserving wisdom is Mira's stated motivation, dramatized through her boundary-walking and clearing-seeding. The reflective Q&A passage articulates this motive and hints at friction ("why she continued...so few remained who could hear"), but no on-page conflict tests the desire against cost. The motivation is coherent and frames action but lacks visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Whisperfield calm" is coined early, applied to the pavilion, and modulates subtly (the murmuring dunes, the quiet speech, the "strange honesty"). Tone remains meditative and consistent through the patrol, supporting the contemplative premise. However, it does not shift under pressure or charge the final image with new intensity; the ending mirrors the opening's register without tonal reconfiguration.</comment>
