<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor remains consistently observant but never makes a meaningful choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. Interiority is entirely summary ("they believed," "they had learned," "they understood") without embodied contradiction or pressure-driven micro-decisions. The kneeling gesture and star-fragment collection feel ceremonial rather than dilemma-driven; no competing impulses act simultaneously in scene. Label-only emotions ("empathy," "vulnerability," "strength") replace embodied experience throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early). The piece moves through observation → kneeling → collection without a causal turn or meaningful tightening; the janitor's stance at the end is identical to the opening. No closure unit is legible—no Decisive Change, no Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost, no Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior material. The ending summarizes a philosophy already stated in paragraph three, offering no before/after or felt price. Under an Accumulative lens the piece needed a pattern break or cadence shift to reweight the dominant stake; none occurs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "shooting star tracking station" and "yellow lantern glass" anchor setting and tool effectively. The station "floated in the hollow between celestial currents" and the "observation deck" provide spatial grounding, but these remain postcard descriptions without constraining a choice or shaping the final image. The fragment lodged in the corner is found without search friction; its location does not alter tactics. The micro-setting (body, lantern, fragment) is vivid but ornamental rather than pressure-applying.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—witnessing and understanding fallen stars—is signaled early but remains static. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the janitor encounters a star fragment exactly as expected and handles it exactly as described in prior reflection. No escalation under any lens: the fragment's discovery does not complicate, the janitor's method succeeds without friction, and the ending recapitulates the opening philosophy. Agency is observation, not decision with cost. Coincidence (finding the fragment) initiates the beat but no protagonist choice alters trajectory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme of "strength in vulnerability" is stated overtly multiple times ("they understood the vulnerability of endings," "the profound strength that lived in vulnerable openness") rather than emerging from dramatized events. The yellow lantern glass refracts rainbows, but this moment illustrates rather than tests the premise. The ending returns to the same thematic statement offered in paragraph three without reweighting it through a new cost or image. No counter-reading or friction complicates the thesis; the piece declares its meaning rather than enacting it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("flourishing stillness," "primal elegance"), but register drifts into corporate abstraction ("sacred importance of witnessing," "empathy the cosmic janitor had cultivated") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic; the janitor notices via summary rather than idiosyncratic detail. Sentence stems repeat ("The cosmic janitor…" opens four paragraphs; "They [verb]" recurs throughout), creating template cadence. No dialogue present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraph two restates "spiritually curious nature" as "empathy" and "understanding"; paragraph four cycles "vulnerability," "exposed," "naked exposure," "vulnerable openness" across adjacent lines. Template cadence runs through "They believed," "They had learned," "They had discovered," "They understood" in paragraph three. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh texture: "swim through warm water," "light and loss," "death and seed." Filter-verb stacks ("they believed," "they understood," "they felt") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Figurative language in most sentences of paragraphs four and five lacks coherence (rainbows glimpse a story; vulnerability is "naked exposure"; empathy is "cultivated"). Information density is low; many lines restate prior claims without advancing situation or knowledge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The cosmic-janitor-as-witness frame is familiar; the piece does not transform it through a non-obvious turn or specific lived friction. The yellow lantern glass and star-tracking station offer vivid particulars, but the emotional arc (compassionate labor finds meaning) follows a template path. The final image—carrying the fragment to the recycling chamber—could occur in any compassionate-custodian story with minor reskinning. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece narrates a philosophy rather than dramatizing a dilemma. Proximity to "found family of outcasts" and "quiet dignity of overlooked labor" tropes without fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor is present throughout and named in the title role. Setup clear by end of first paragraph. The janitor kneels, holds the glass, lifts the fragment (three touches across beats), but none of these actions create a turn or narrow options. The role is observational; no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. Swappable with "contemplative custodian" or similar archetype. Late first mention of name ("cosmic janitor") in paragraph one. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The yellow lantern glass appears in paragraph one (setup), is held up to trace paths in paragraph two, and used to refract light in paragraph four (two distinct beats). It enables the method of reading "luminous fingerprints" and charges the rainbow moment, but the glass does not constrain a choice or appear in the closure (carrying the fragment to the chamber happens without it). Specific property (amber refraction) matters, but the final image does not return to or reweight it. Three gates met; causal role in two beats; closure linkage absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Flourishing stillness" is named in paragraphs three and four as mood/theme but does not shape a stake or tactic on the page. The janitor moves through this stillness without it altering options or imposing cost. The concept is ornamental—a descriptor for atmosphere rather than a force that changes what the janitor can or must do. Present as tone; absent as constraint. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious" is stated in paragraph two ("possessed a spiritually curious nature") but never constrains an on-page action with cost. The trait is synonymous with the janitor's observational empathy; it does not create a tradeoff or complicate a choice. The janitor's method (tracing, kneeling, empathizing) flows from this trait, but no beat shows curiosity forcing a sacrifice or error. Swappable with "empathetic" or "contemplative." Label-only; no visible friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Empathize" is the core action, named explicitly in paragraph three and enacted in paragraph four (feeling the star's journey and arrival). Setup clear; development present in the kneeling beat where the janitor "felt what another being felt." The empathy moment enables the janitor to understand the star's transformation, but it does not create a turn or redefine options—the janitor proceeds to collect the fragment as planned. The action is central but does not drive escalation or closure cost. Two beats; causal role modest; closure unchanged by its presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Tracing the path of falling stars" is introduced in paragraph one, explained in paragraph two ("by tracing the path… they could read the luminous fingerprints"), and enacted in paragraph four ("tracing the path it had traveled with slow, reverent movements"). Setup and development clear. The method shapes how the janitor works but does not constrain a choice or alter the outcome; success is frictionless. The method is present in the closure vicinity (paragraph four) but the final act (carrying the fragment to the chamber) does not rely on it. Functional; one causal beat; replaceable with "observing closely" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "shooting star tracking station" is named and described in paragraph one (setup), provides the observation deck and collection chamber (two locations used in beats), but does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. The station is backdrop; the janitor's work would proceed identically in any quiet outpost. The fragment's location (corner of the observation deck) does not complicate retrieval. Setting is vivid but ornamental; it does not constrain tactics or charge the final image. Functional; swappable with "remote sanctuary" or "celestial waypoint."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Through the hush of an overlooked era" appears in paragraphs three and four as atmospheric frame; "overlooked era" recurs in paragraph five. The timeframe is vague (no clock, no deadline, no historical anchor that tightens decisions). It does not create urgency or alter tactics; the janitor's work unfolds at contemplative pace without temporal cost. Present as mood; absent as constraint. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"To find strength in vulnerability" is overtly stated in paragraph three ("the unexpected strength that could emerge from that exposed place") and paragraph five ("the profound strength that lived in vulnerable openness"). The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. No on-page moment shows the janitor risking exposure or trading safety for connection; the philosophy is declared, not tested. The motivation does not create friction or cost. Label-only; summary-only. Late signal (paragraph three); no development beat where the desire complicates a choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Primal elegance" is named in paragraph five ("the primal elegance that their role demanded") and echoed in diction choices ("reverent movements," "sacred nature," "dignified aftermath"). Tone is consistent—elevated, contemplative, ceremonial—but does not modulate with pressure (no pressure exists). The tone is static; it does not charge the final image or shift cadence at closure. Present and coherent; ornamental rather than dynamic. Single mood throughout; no turn.</comment>
