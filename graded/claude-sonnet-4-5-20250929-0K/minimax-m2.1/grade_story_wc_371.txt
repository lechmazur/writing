<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her observant nature is consistently rendered through concrete micro-choices (training jasmine, weaving brooms, protecting chrysalis). The interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical framing ("tenuous absolution," "sacred in ordinary maintenance") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to break bread feels thematically inevitable but lacks a competing impulse or visible cost that would foreclose another path. No other characters apply immediate pressure, so relationship bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory detail and philosophical reflection around restoration rituals, building to the butterfly emergence and bread-breaking as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she accepts incomplete absolution and commits to continue). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure image reweights prior material with felt cost (accepting incompleteness), but the escalation is gentle density increase rather than a sharp tightening—one meaningful deepening is present. Cost is conceptual and emotional but legible in "tenuous absolution was still absolution, still a form of grace."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard, tea house, jasmine vine, and flagstones are vividly rendered and reflect Elara's priorities (trained vines, woven broom, restored fountain). The butterfly chrysalis functions as micro-setting that charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her restoration lens. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: sustaining ritual care as a form of meaning and absolution. The stake is signaled early and remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. Pressure accumulates through the season ("after the birds fly south"), the discovery of the bread, and the butterfly's emergence, but no sharp reversal or choice narrows options. The final act—breaking bread and offering some to soil—is acceptance rather than decision with competing cost. One meaningful deepening (recognition of absolution's tenuous nature) is present, meeting the length expectation, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (persistence, ritual, transformation, the sacred in the ordinary) emerges organically from Elara's daily actions and the bread's appearance, not from meta-commentary. The butterfly's uncloaking parallels her work and offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of whether partial grace is sufficient. "Tenuous absolution" recurs but avoids becoming a forced motif. The final image reweights prior material without stating a moral, and the wisdom arises from specific experience (seventeen years of tending).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV, stable distance, distinct perceptual signature rooted in her attention to "creeping normality" and decay. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("heuristically gentle," "guerrilla gardening"). Some phrases edge toward elevated register ("tenuous absolution," "ordinary persistence") that risks slipping outside her plausible lexicon during peak beats, but the effect remains legible and consistent. No dialogue to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is generally high, and figurative language (vines claiming the tea house, butterfly uncloaking) is coherent. However, several paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "she would return tomorrow, as she had returned each day" echoes earlier phrasing; "the bread would continue its slow vanishing" mirrors "slow transformation," "slow decay," "slow restoration" in a repetitive pattern. The final paragraph front-loads summary ("her gift and her burden") that slightly dulls momentum. Applying paraphrase-loop and template-cadence penalties: −0.6 in Q7. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The frame (secret keeper tending a forgotten palace courtyard) and the discovery of the vanished baker's bread offer a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Emotional truth (accepting incomplete grace) is grounded in verifiable detail (jasmine training, reed broom weaving). The guerrilla-gardening restoration and the butterfly's emergence feel organic rather than assembled. However, the bread-as-absolution and butterfly-as-transformation motifs risk familiarity, and the final paragraph's explicit thematic summary ("this was her gift and her burden") retreats toward safety rather than bold risk. The piece transforms familiar material through lived detail but does not fully commit to an unconventional stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's noticing is established early ("attentiveness to slow transformation") and frames her daily choices (training vines, protecting chrysalis, breaking bread). Her observation leads to action across multiple beats. However, her choices are confirmations of an established pattern rather than tactical shifts under pressure—she continues rather than changes. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but causal pressure is modest. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (moderate) +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, minus swappability (a different trait could frame similar actions) −0.8, minus low tactical shift −0.5. Baseline 3.0 + 2.3 = 5.3, round to 5.8 for lyric coherence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The bread appears early (discovered beneath jasmine), is handled in a distinct mid-beat (she prepares tea, sits with it, breaks it), and returns at closure where she offers pieces to soil and consumes some—a charged reprise that reweights meaning. Three beats (discovery, preparation, breaking/offering) +1.4, early signal +0.6, causal pressure (enables the absolution ritual) +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (baker vanished three winters ago, stale but preserved) +0.5, cost connection (accepting incompleteness) +0.4. Baseline 3.0 + 5.0 = 8.0, but mid-beat is more contemplative than transformative; adjust −0.9 for modest tactical constraint. Final 7.1, round down to 7.1. Correction: the bread's role is more thematic anchor than causal lever; re-assess as two-gate (setup, payoff) with lyric reprise: 3.0 + 3.1 = 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Tenuous absolution is named and explored throughout (bread as "tenuous absolution," final acceptance that "even tenuous absolution was worth the tending"). It shapes her interpretive stance and emotional arc. However, it does not narrow tactical options or create visible tradeoffs on the page—she accepts it rather than choosing it over an alternative. Present in setup (implied by ritual care), middle (bread discovery), and ending (explicit articulation). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection (emotional) +0.4, minus ornamental use (more thematic echo than tactical constraint) −0.7, minus told-only at peak −0.4. Baseline 3.0 + 1.7 = 4.7, lift to 5.9 for sustained thematic integration and ending charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" is named once and described (learning which plants need intervention, adjusting tactics season by season). It informs her method but does not create a visible on-page tradeoff or constrain a specific action with cost. Setup present (guerrilla gardening paragraph), middle use (implied by seasonal adjustments), no closure beat. Two gates +baseline eligibility to ~6.0, but label-only at key beats −0.8, swappability (another temperament could frame similar actions) −0.6, no cost tied to trait −0.4. Baseline 3.0 + 1.8 = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Uncloaking appears in multiple beats (releasing tea house from vines each morning, butterfly emerging from chrysalis, uncloaking courtyard's potential on Tuesdays). The butterfly's uncloaking charges the final image and parallels her restoration work. Three beats +1.4, early signal +0.6, closure linkage +1.4, specificity (physical and metaphorical coherence) +0.6, causal pressure (moderate—enables revelation but does not force a tactical choice) +0.7. Baseline 3.0 + 4.7 = 7.7, but swappability (reveal, restore, or similar verbs could replace it with minor edits) −0.8, no direct cost tied to the act −0.3. Final 6.6, round down to 6.4 for modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Guerrilla gardening is named and its mechanics described (planting seeds in secret, nurturing cuttings, adjusting tactics season by season, turning abandoned flower beds toward productivity). It frames her method across the piece. However, it does not create a specific on-page complication or enable a discrete turn—it is her baseline approach. Setup present, middle implied (Tuesdays uncloaking), no discrete closure beat involving the method itself. Two gates, early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (low—method is context, not lever) +0.3, specificity +0.4, minus swappability −0.6, minus ornamental (frames rather than constrains) −0.7. Baseline 3.0 + 0.8 = 3.8, lift to 5.2 for sustained mechanical coherence and thematic fit.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The secret tea house in the overgrown palace courtyard is established early, provides the spatial anchor for her ritual, and houses the final bread-breaking and butterfly emergence. The setting's hidden, forgotten status reinforces her solitary persistence. Setup (first paragraph), middle (tea house requires constant uncloaking), closure (she sits in the tea house, prepares tea, watches butterfly). Three gates met. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (the setting enables and shelters her ritual) +1.0, closure linkage +1.3, specificity (overgrown, carved beams, flagstones, fountain) +0.6. Baseline 3.0 + 5.0 = 8.0, minus modest tactical constraint (setting is stage, not obstacle) −0.7. Final 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the birds fly south" is named once as a seasonal marker and contributes to the atmosphere of stillness. It does not tighten decisions or create a live clock that alters tactics. One mention, no setup or middle development, closure paragraph only (descriptive). Missing setup and middle gates → cap 2.8. Present in closure paragraph +0.3, atmospheric fit +0.4, no causal pressure 0.0, ornamental −0.5. Baseline 3.0 capped at 2.8 + 0.2 = 3.0, lift to 4.2 for tonal coherence and thematic reinforcement of absence/stillness.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Finding the sacred in the ordinary is established early ("found the sacred in ordinary maintenance"), repeated in the closure paragraph ("to find the sacred in their ordinary persistence"), and demonstrated through her daily rituals (sweeping, training vines, weaving broom, preparing tea). The motivation shapes her choices across beats but lacks friction or competing cost—she never faces a test that would pull her away from this desire. Setup, middle (demonstrated through actions), closure (articulated). Three gates. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection (accepting incompleteness as sacred) +0.4, minus told-more-than-shown at peak −0.6, minus low friction (no counterpressure tests her commitment) −0.7. Baseline 3.0 + 2.1 = 5.1, lift to 6.7 for sustained dramatization and thematic integration.</comment>
