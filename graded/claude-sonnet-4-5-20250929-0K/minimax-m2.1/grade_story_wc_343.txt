<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and specific ("her pencil worn to a stub," the meditative use of the phrasebook), and her observations drive the discovery. However, the protagonist feels more like a vessel for the plot than a character under meaningful pressure—her curiosity faces no real internal contradiction or cost. The "diligently curious nature" is told and labeled rather than demonstrated through competing impulses. The final triumph is asserted ("savored the moment") without embodied emotion or a visible price paid for the all-night vigil.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly and tracks causally: Bren's observation → Mira's pattern study → hopscotch discovery → all-night synthesis. However, the closure lands as summary ("she had captured their secret") rather than a decisive on-page change or renunciation with felt cost. The final beat tells us she will present findings and "savored the moment" without showing what was foreclosed, risked, or altered. Under a Causal lens the ending delivers information gain but no visible price or option-narrowing that reweights her stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The airship setting is vivid and purposeful: brass porthole, creaking timbers, iron stairs, observation gallery, and running lights all ground Mira's movements and discovery. The hopscotch board—etched into the floor, "dusty," "faded but unmistakable"—provides the geometric key and charges the final synthesis. Sensory detail is selective and integrated into action. The starlings, rigging luminescence, and chronometer constrain and enable her work, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment shape choice and charge the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—charting a discovery—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Mira's observation, measurement, and cross-referencing constitute agency under an Accumulative lens. However, the piece lacks a meaningful tightening or cost: no option is foreclosed, no competing desire tested, no visible trade-off paid for the all-night effort. The starlings' dispersal at dawn is atmospheric rather than causal, and Mira's success is frictionless. A single deepening with felt pressure would lift this significantly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—discovery through patient attention to hidden patterns—emerges from concrete action rather than statement. The phrasebook's marginalia, the hopscotch geometry, and the starlings' dance cohere around a navigational principle that invites reflection. However, the ending summarizes its significance ("if her discovery held the significance she suspected") rather than offering a resonant, non-literal image that reweights the question. The piece stops at intellectual satisfaction without thematic ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, controlled, and textured: "sociable isolation," "stranded luminance," "mesmerizing...coordination" all feel character-particular. Perceptual signature is clear—Mira notices geometric patterns, measures intervals, cross-references notes. The brief dialogue with Bren is natural and goal-driven. Free indirect style is clean, and diction remains within the POV's plausible lexicon (cartographer's apprentice, three years of training). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks detract from immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and information-dense. Sentences do multiple jobs ("The phrasebook's edges were soft...its margins filled with Mira's own handwritten notes") without padding. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor issue: "diligently curious nature" is a tell-y label, and "the call to chart the next great discovery thrumming through her veins like electricity" edges toward stock metaphor. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propels, slightly dulling momentum at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The combination—airship cartography, starling murmurations as navigational code, hopscotch geometry as cipher—feels fresh and specific. The synthesis is plausible in hindsight and avoids template plot beats. However, the "hidden pattern discovered through patient study" arc is familiar, and the piece retreats from bold risk by withholding what the discovery costs or changes for Mira personally. The ending summarizes significance rather than dramatizing a non-obvious consequence, keeping the work in the solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira, the curious map apprentice, drives every key turn: she observes the starlings post-Bren's comment, fetches the spyglass, races to the cargo hold, cross-references through the night. Her choices (measuring intervals, noting proportions, correlating phenomena) create the discovery. Setup by paragraph one, active in observation/measurement beats, and present at closure ("she had captured their secret"). The character is indispensable to the narrative arc, though her decisions face little friction or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The polyglot's phrasebook appears in paragraph two (setup), is handled and annotated in multiple beats (noting patterns in margins, cross-referencing with measurements, "clutched against her chest"), and returns at closure ("captured their secret in her grandmother's phrasebook"). The object's inherited history ("belonged to her grandmother," "edges soft from years of handling") and evolving use (meditation → working tool → archive of discovery) charge its presence. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff, though it could constrain a choice more directly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Stranded luminance" is vividly described ("luminescence caught in the airship's exterior rigging—stranded luminance that should have dissipated but instead seemed trapped") and triggers Mira's recognition in paragraph six. It recurs as part of the triangulated discovery (starlings, hopscotch, luminance). However, the concept functions primarily as an observed phenomenon rather than a stake-shaping force—Mira's tactics are driven by curiosity, not by the luminance itself. Present across beats but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Diligently curious" is labeled explicitly ("Mira's diligently curious nature would not let the observation rest") but not dramatized through visible trade-offs or constrained choices. The trait enables the plot—she pursues the pattern—but we never see curiosity cost her sleep, safety, or a competing desire on the page in a way that alters tactics. Functional but largely ornamental, closer to a character tag than a pressure-generating attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The action "note" is signaled early (paragraph two: "annotations," "handwritten notes") and becomes the engine of discovery: noting observations in margins (paragraph five), noting proportions of the hopscotch board (paragraph eight), cross-referencing notes through the night (paragraph nine). The all-night notation session produces "dozens of pages" and crystallizes the discovery. The act of noting is causally central and irreplaceable—without it, the synthesis does not occur. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hopscotch board appears at the halfway mark (paragraph seven), and its "unconventional geometry" becomes the key to decoding the starlings' formations and the luminance pattern. Mira measures its proportions and angles, and the method—correlating the board's design with the phenomena—drives the climax. However, the board is discovered rather than sought, and the specific mechanics of how geometry unlocks navigation remain abstract. Solid middle integration: present and functional, but the method's specificity could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The antique airship *Wanderer's Compass* is established in the opening line and anchors every beat: porthole for observation, navigation desk for work, chronometer for measurement, iron stairs and cargo hold for discovery, rigging that traps the luminance. The setting provides both the problem (following starlings, luminance phenomenon) and the solution (dusty hopscotch board in the hold). The ship's "creaking timbers" and "running lights" texture Mira's experience throughout. Essential to the story's logic and atmosphere; removing it would collapse the narrative.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The starling murmurations frame the entire narrative: they've been following the ship for three days, Bren comments on their behavior (inciting beat), Mira watches them through twilight and dusk, and they scatter at dawn to close the piece. The timeframe creates urgency (a live natural phenomenon, a ticking chronometer, an all-night vigil) and the dawn dispersal provides a natural endpoint. However, the murmurations don't tighten Mira's decisions—she could have studied the pattern over multiple nights. Solid shaping presence but not a hard clock that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to chart the next great discovery" is told in the final paragraph ("the call to chart the next great discovery thrumming through her veins") but implied throughout via her three-year apprenticeship, her materials spread on the navigation desk, and her all-night synthesis work. The motivation drives her choices (pursuing the starlings' pattern, measuring the hopscotch board) but faces no friction—no competing desire, no cost to the obsessive vigil, no test of whether the discovery is worth sacrificing something else. Functional but told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Sociable isolation" is named in paragraph one ("the kind of sociable isolation that had become her constant companion") and embodied throughout: Mira works alone but welcomes Bren's interruption "with genuine warmth," the crew moves around her at dawn while she finishes solo work, the ship itself is both communal (galley murmur, watch changes) and isolating (cabin vigil). The tone modulates purposefully—warm during Bren's visit, focused during the discovery, quietly triumphant at dawn—and charges the final image of solitary achievement within a social vessel. The exact phrase is integrated into the ending's emotional texture.</comment>
