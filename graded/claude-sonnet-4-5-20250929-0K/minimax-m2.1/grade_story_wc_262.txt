<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is filtered through her psychometry gift, but her motivations remain largely declarative rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The sisters' backstory is vivid and embodied (Clara's straight back, Margot's trembling), yet Mira herself makes no difficult choices on the page—she arrives, reads, weeps, and leaves the reel as found. Her decision to leave the film hidden feels philosophically tidy rather than earned through internal conflict or visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: emotional residue pools, visions layer, and the final act of returning the canister reweights "unused love" from mystery to witnessed stasis. However, closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) without a legible cost to Mira—she descends with "particular peace," but no option has been foreclosed or paid for on her end. The sisters' story carries emotional weight, yet Mira's role as passive witness keeps the ending from landing with felt consequence for the protagonist.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The projection booth, dressing-room mirror, and canister function as micro-settings that charge the vision sequences. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's gift: "hum of unused love," "jagged edges of the reel," "rotting seats and shattered glass." The booth's false floor and the act of hiding the canister supply spatial specificity that constraints the sisters' final gesture, and the lobby stairs anchor Mira's exit. The setting does not, however, constrain Mira's own choices—she navigates the space without friction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Mira's quest to understand where unused love is stored. Pressure accumulates through layered visions (mirror, letters, final performance), but Mira faces no reversal or tightening that narrows her options. The sisters' unuttered goodbye and hidden canister supply emotional escalation in backstory, yet Mira's present-tense arc is a straight line: locate, witness, return. No on-page cost or trade-off shapes her final action; the resolution is philosophical rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: goodbye letters as "doorways," unused love as "pure intention," recognition as completion without delivery. The final image—reel returned, love left to hum—offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("Some stories were not meant to be completed, only witnessed") rather than trusting the image alone. The piece resists tidy morals yet tips slightly into articulated wisdom where implication would suffice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; Mira's perceptual signature—"spatially imaginative mind maps these invisible landscapes in layers"—colors her observations. Diction is elevated and lyric ("quiet violence of hushed thunder," "cinema of unfinished endings") yet remains within a crystal gazer's plausible idiom. Psychic distance is consistent, though the prose occasionally drifts into expository interiority that explains rather than enacts: "she understood now why she had been drawn to this place" states the insight rather than showing micro-choices that reveal it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense ("hum of unused love," "accumulating dust in the silence," "ghosts fumbling for form"). However, the piece exhibits template cadence and paraphrase loops: "She understood," "She saw," "She knew from experience" across multiple paragraphs. The phrase "spatially imaginative" recurs three times as a label without fresh action each time. The closure paragraph stacks summary clauses that restate theme rather than trusting the prior image. Information density is high in the vision sequences but dulls in the frame passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of psychometry, vintage cinema, and unspoken farewells is specific and non-obvious. The image of goodbye letters as "doorways" and love stored in film canisters feels fresh. However, the premise leans on familiar templates: the empath who uncovers a tragic backstory and leaves the artifact undisturbed. The piece does not take bold structural risks—Mira's passive witness arc and the tidy thematic resolution sit in the safety middle. Transformation is present but not radical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira (crystal gazer) is present throughout and her gift enables the vision sequences, but she makes no key turn. She arrives with intent, reads the reel, and returns it as found—observation without decision. Her choice to leave the canister hidden is philosophically motivated but does not alter tactics or foreclose a live option with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The film strip appears early (paragraph 4), is handled ("fingers traced the jagged edges"), triggers the vision cascade (paragraphs 5–8), and is returned to the canister in the final beat. It shapes two major beats (triggering visions, being returned) and the closure image depends on its placement. However, its mechanics are static—Mira touches it, it releases memory—without evolving use or constraint that alters her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Goodbye letters are introduced early (paragraph 2) and recur as "doorways" the sisters stood before (paragraph 6), shaping the thematic question. They drive the vision sequence and charge the final image of love "waiting to be understood." However, they do not constrain Mira's present choices or create on-page friction. Their role is more conceptual anchor than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Spatially imaginative" is mentioned three times (paragraphs 1, 6, 10) as a label for Mira's gift, enabling her to "map invisible landscapes in layers" and see "emotional architectures in three dimensions." Yet no on-page action hinges on this trait with visible cost—it describes her perception without forcing a trade-off or constraining a choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Incubate" appears twice: the reel waits to incubate (paragraph 4), and the letters were hidden "where they could incubate into meaning" (paragraph 8). The term flavors the atmosphere but does not define a distinct action that turns the plot. Mira's process is psychometry reading, not incubation itself, and the element could be replaced with "ripen" or "mature" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Psychometry reading is signaled in paragraph 1, demonstrated when Mira's "gift flow[s] outward like breath" (paragraph 4), and drives the entire middle vision sequence (paragraphs 5–8). Her method shapes her approach (patience, touch) and generates the story's core revelations. It is essential across beats and ending, though the mechanics remain somewhat abstract—touch triggers vision without friction or failure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The vintage projection booth is named in the opening line and anchored with "false floor," "rusted stairs," and "rotting seats." It supplies the hiding place for the canister (paragraph 8) and frames Mira's descent (paragraph 10). The booth pressures the sisters' final gesture (a hidden, private space) but does not constrain Mira's present tactics—she navigates it without obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Forgotten lyrics search[ing] for tune" appears in paragraph 7 and is echoed in paragraph 9 ("The forgotten lyrics had finally found their tune in Mira's recognition"). The timeframe is more metaphor than ticking clock; it does not tighten Mira's decisions or alter her moves. The element colors atmosphere but remains ornamental to the causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—to find where unused love is stored—is stated in paragraph 2 and resolved in paragraph 9 ("unused love was stored here… in the cinema of unfinished endings"). It drives her quest and shapes the thematic payoff. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction; Mira's path is linear, without cost or competing impulse.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" appears twice: "quiet violence of hushed thunder" (paragraph 5) and "patient as thunder learning to speak softly" (paragraph 10). The tone is lyric, restrained, and elegiac throughout, modulating gently from mystery to recognition. It coheres across turns and charges the final image. However, the effect is more atmospheric consistency than dynamic pressure—there is no sharp tonal shift that reweights stakes.</comment>
