<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The poet's interior state is vividly rendered through concrete metaphors (greenhouse of the spirit, photosynthesizing pain) and her continuous action of writing. However, the piece lacks on-page contradiction or meaningful choice under pressure—she simply continues doing what she has done for years/centuries. The longing is embodied through the galaxy postcard and her accelerating writing, but no micro-choice alters her stance or reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The characterization is poetic and coherent but static, operating more as portrait than dramatic agent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors early (garrett, shell, poet who cannot sleep) and accumulates density through layered metaphors that reweight longing and creative endurance. The closure image—"poems becoming tendrils, becoming roots, becoming the blossom armistice...proof that beauty can grow from even the longest wait"—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the continuing act itself is crystallized as meaning. However, the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no on-page action forecloses a path or changes tactics. The "shyly unstoppable" quality and the trembling postcard gesture toward transformation but do not deliver a felt before/after with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell spiraling inward/outward is a vivid, purposeful anchor that shapes the poet's dual orientation. The garrett as greenhouse, the off-key wind, and reef-shadow imagery create a coherent atmosphere of isolation and bioluminescent beauty. The galaxy postcard functions as micro-setting, charging memory and desire. Spatial grounding is clear; the shell's spiral metaphorically constrains and extends her world, contributing to the final image of directionality ("both directions at once").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sustaining creative output and hope across immense longing—is signaled early and sustained throughout. Pressure accumulates texturally: the weight of centuries, the stretching of longing like taffy, the fear of snapping. However, there is no on-page reversal, tightening choice, or moment where options narrow with visible cost. The poet does not decide, renounce, or alter tactics; she simply persists. Under an Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but here the intensification (writing faster, poems becoming tendrils) reads as assertion rather than dramatized escalation with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the transformation of pain into beauty, longing as geography, continuance as faith. The photosynthesis metaphor and "blossom armistice" integrate grief, creativity, and endurance without overt moralizing. The final image—poems as tendrils/roots/blossoms offered to silence—reweights the premise with quiet resonance. The piece resists false equivalence and embraces complexity (the peculiar joy of the long wait, reef-shadow beauty). Minor deduction: "This is what poets do" briefly edges toward thematic summary, though it is quickly grounded in the specific greenhouse metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, focused tightly on the poet's interior and perception. Diction is purposefully elevated and lyrical, matching the character's vocation and timeless isolation. Perceptual signature is consistent: metaphors rooted in natural growth, light, and architecture. The prose rhythm modulates well (short declaratives at "But she does not break" anchor intensity). Minor weakness: some register overlap ("ensconce," "bioluminescence," "armistice") risks feeling thesaurus-driven rather than voice-organic, though the overall texture remains coherent and distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is dense but largely coherent. However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold: "shyly unstoppable" appears three times with minimal reweighting; "the long wait" recurs without evolution; "continues/continuing" is repeated. The photosynthesis metaphor is extended across multiple sentences in the middle third, flirting with overwriting. "Too long" and the author's self-edit note are meta-artifacts that break frame. Clarity is high, but density could be tightened by 15–20% without loss. Apply −0.6 for loop/scaffold and −0.2 for the meta intrusion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of shell-house, galaxy postcard, and poetic endurance is specific and evocative, with fresh metaphoric texture (reef-shadow joy, bioluminescence in sustained dark, grief as greenhouse). The framing of longing as geography and poems as living things with "determination" offers non-obvious angles. However, the core emotional arc—artist enduring isolation through creative transmutation—is familiar, and the piece does not transform it through a decisive turn or surprise inflection. The "blossom armistice" concept is beautiful but remains ornamental rather than causal. Risk-taking is present in the lyric density but does not heighten stakes or complicate the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The insomniac poet is present throughout and her continuous writing anchors the piece. She appears early, recurs in every beat, and is named in the closure image. However, she makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or narrows options; she observes, writes, and endures without decision. The continuance itself is thematized ("continuing is what the shyly unstoppable do") but not dramatized as a turn. Gates: setup ✓, middle ✓ (though passive), closure ✓ (writing faster is action, but no cost visible). Deductions: no causal pressure (−0.8), ornamental endurance without tradeoff (−0.5), swappable with "grieving artist" archetype (−0.4). Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development as decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The galaxy postcard is introduced early, reappears in reflection ("faded at the edges...someone who promised to return"), and trembles near the end as though sending a response. It seeds the longing motif and charges the final third. Gates: setup ✓, middle ✓ (walks through the geography of the promise), closure proximity ✓ (trembles, prompting faster writing). However, it is not handled or used causally; it remains observed and symbolic. Deductions: ornamental description (−0.6), no physical interaction or evolving state (−0.5), swappable with any keepsake (−0.4). Positive: early seed and lyric reprise (+0.6). Rounded down.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The phrase "blossom armistice" appears only in the final sentence as a metaphoric label for the poems she offers. It does not shape stakes, alter tactics, or constrain choices earlier. Gates: setup ✗, middle ✗, closure ✓ (appears in final image). The concept of truce-through-beauty is thematically resonant but ornamental. Deductions: late first appearance in final third (−0.8), ornamental use without action pressure (−0.8), swappable with "offering," "gift," "bloom" (−0.6). Positive: closure linkage as charged metaphor (+0.5). Cap at 4.6 for missing setup; apply −0.6 cumulative debt. Rounded down.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The phrase "shyly unstoppable" is introduced early to describe the dispersal method, reappears mid-piece as her style of longing, and returns in the final third as a character trait ("continuing is what the shyly unstoppable do"). Gates: setup ✓, middle ✓, closure ✓. It is thematized but not dramatized; no on-page moment shows her being halted or choosing to persist despite visible cost. Deductions: label-only trait without enacted tradeoff (−0.8), synonym loop across three mentions without evolution (−0.4), swappable with "persistent" or "patient" (−0.4). Positive: three-beat presence (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.7). Rounded down.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The verb "ensconce" appears once in the phrase "ensconce her longing in the architecture of verse." It is specific and purposeful, anchoring the poet's method of transforming grief. Gates: setup ✗ (appears in middle third), middle ✓ (describes core tactic), closure proximity ✓ (tactic yields the final poems-as-roots image). However, it does not drive a turn or alter options; it describes ongoing practice. Deductions: mid-piece first appearance (−0.3), summary-only without dramatized beat (−0.6), swappable with "house," "embed," "weave" (−0.5). Positive: lyric precision and closure linkage via architecture metaphor (+0.8). Rounded down.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The method "via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" is introduced early, recurs in the middle ("same ones she sings when the weight of waiting becomes too much"), and reappears in the final third ("whoever is listening on the other side of the wind"). Gates: setup ✓, middle ✓, closure ✓. It shapes how poems disperse and provides a sensory anchor for the poet's dual audience (self and unknown listener). Deductions: no mechanical constraint or cost tied to the method (−0.5), swappable with "whispers," "songs," "breeze" without structural change (−0.5). Positive: early signal (+0.6), three-beat presence (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.7). Rounded down.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is named early, recurs as the spiraling structure inward/outward, and contributes to the final image of dual directionality. Gates: setup ✓, middle ✓ (spatial anchor and metaphor), closure ✓ (spiral toward chair and world). It provides atmosphere and symbolic charge but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Deductions: postcard description without action pressure (−0.6), swappable with any nested/recursive dwelling (−0.4). Positive: early signal (+0.6), two-beat involvement (+0.9), closure linkage via directionality (+1.0). Rounded down.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "centuries" (later softened to "years" in the revision note) is mentioned early and late but never tracks as a live clock. It establishes scale but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. Gates: setup ✓ (centuries/years mentioned early), middle ✗ (no mid-point reckoning), closure ✗ (poems continue without temporal urgency). Deductions: vague duration without tracked progression (−0.8), no tactical impact or deadline (−1.0), swappable with "decades" or "ages" (−0.5). Positive: early signal (+0.4). Cap at 4.6 for missing middle and closure gates; cumulative debt −0.9. Rounded down.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to photosynthesize pain into beauty" is stated explicitly in the middle third and enacted throughout (writing poems, transforming grief into luminous blooms). Gates: setup ✓ (implicit in her continuous writing), middle ✓ (articulated metaphor), closure ✓ (poems as proof beauty can grow from the wait). However, the desire is more thematized than conflicted; no on-page friction between the want and a competing cost. Deductions: told-only in one sentence rather than dramatized choice (−0.6), no visible tradeoff or competing pull (−0.5). Positive: two-beat involvement (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.2), irreplaceability as core metaphor (+0.6). Rounded down.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The tone phrase "reef-shadow joy" appears once, naming the peculiar affect of making beauty from the long wait. The overall tone—melancholy endurance, bioluminescent beauty in darkness—is coherent and modulates subtly (fear of snapping, then "she does not break"). Gates: setup ✗, middle ✓ (named and enacted), closure ✓ (tone charges the final image of proof and offering). Deductions: phrase appears once without recurrence (−0.3), label-only in one beat rather than enacted across turns (−0.5). Positive: coherent tonal control across piece (+0.8), closure linkage via final resonance (+1.0), specificity of "reef-shadow" (+0.5). Rounded down.</comment>
