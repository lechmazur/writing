<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is densely rendered with concrete anchors (grandmother's tears at apple blooms, the birthmark matching the gnomon), and her decisions to remain and excavate show agency under pressure. However, the emotional progression from "warmly curious" through "cautious enchantment" to the final homecoming reads somewhat smooth and uncontradicted; the piece would benefit from a moment where her scholarly detachment conflicts viscerally with personal grief. The final paragraph's "cautious enchantment of a homecoming that was also a departure, a death that was also a kind of rebirth" tilts toward abstraction rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens with clear linkage: Mira's discovery of the birthmark-matched sundial motivates her week-long excavation, which culminates in her decision to restore the site and become its witness. Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she resets the sundial under moonlight, ending her interrupted journey and beginning another, with the cost legible in her acceptance of a custodial role that foreclosed her previous academic distance. One escalation point (the birthmark discovery) tightens options meaningfully. The piece teaches its lens early and holds it through closure, though the final paragraph's abstract phrasing ("a homecoming that was also a departure") slightly dilutes the concrete charge of the sundial-placement image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered with selective, purpose-driven detail: roots curling around skulls "with something approaching tenderness," the apple tree's trunk visible through a ceiling crack, the mineral-rich soil feeding the living. The setting constrains Mira's choices (the collapsed passage traps her, the sundial base's location determines her excavation path) and charges the final image (she places the gnomon where roots emerge "like arms reaching for sky"). Sensory hierarchy is consistent with Mira's archaeological focus (she notices carved runes, clay vessels, woven shrouds) while emotional urgency narrows perception at key beats. Spatial choreography remains clear across the week-long excavation and the final moonlit placement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why her grandmother never spoke of home yet wept at apple blooms—is signaled early and drives the excavation choice. The birthmark discovery tightens pressure meaningfully, narrowing Mira's options from scholar-observer to custodian-witness. However, the piece lacks a moment where this new role costs her something concrete on the page (e.g., a forfeited flight, a professional credential, a relationship). The final placement of the sundial reconfigures her stance, but the price reads more as acceptance than visible sacrifice. One clear escalation through protagonist agency; cost is felt but not sharply dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete images: roots drinking from bones, the sundial marking sacred hours, the apple tree connecting above and below. The piece resists tidy moralizing until the final two sentences, where "nothing is ever truly lost" and "something is always reaching toward the light" edge toward direct statement. The interrupted-journeys motif is woven through grandmother's flight, great-aunt's death, and Mira's delayed arrival, then paid off in her choice to continue rather than complete. The sundial's shadow "marking the hours once more" offers a resonant answer to the central question without overstating it. Minor thematic echo in the penultimate sentence lowers the score slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (Mira notices archaeological particulars: runes, bronze tools, woven shrouds). Diction stays within her plausible register, though "the cautious enchantment of someone who has stumbled into a story she did not know she was part of" reads slightly elevated for mid-excavation fatigue. The prose modulates effectively with pressure: short, concrete sentences during the birthmark discovery, longer rhythms in the reflective final night. One weak spot: "静脉" (Chinese for "veins") appears untranslated in the first paragraph, an artifact that momentarily breaks immersion and suggests inadvertent code-switching or generation error.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high, with most sentences advancing character, atmosphere, or stakes. Sentence openings vary effectively, and rhythm accelerates during discovery beats ("she saw that the gnomon…had been carved with symbols that matched the birthmark") then breathes in reflective passages. However, the piece carries minor paraphrase loops: "interrupted journey" recurs four times across the text, and the final paragraph's doubled structure ("a homecoming that was also a departure, a death that was also a kind of rebirth") reads as template parallelism. The untranslated "静脉" in paragraph one is a clear artifact. Filter-verb density is acceptable but clusters slightly in the opening ("she had crossed," "she stood," "she watched"). No loops touch the closure beat directly, so deductions remain moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of diaspora return, underground orchard, and sundial restoration offers a specific, non-obvious combination grounded in concrete detail. The birthmark-gnomon match and the apple tree connecting living and dead are fresh inflections on familiar material. However, the piece leans on established tropes: the returnee discovering ancestral secrets, the scholar becoming custodian, the literal and metaphorical "roots." The final image of moonlight catching the sundial's edge is evocative but not wholly unexpected given the setup. Transformation is present but moderate; the emotional arc and thematic question would function with different cultural anchors, suggesting the core premise is more vessel than engine.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira as diaspora returnee is signaled in the opening (crossed an ocean, grandmother fled during the war) and drives every major choice: she remains when the team leaves, excavates purposefully rather than academically, and decides to become the site's witness rather than return home. Her status shapes her perception (she sees the orchard through both scholarly and personal lenses) and her final act—placing the sundial to mark hours for future pilgrims—directly stems from her dual identity. Present in setup, middle excavation choices, and closure placement. High causal pressure and closure linkage; the story would collapse without her specific background.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sundial base appears in three distinct beats: discovery on day four (birthmark match), week-long excavation (uncovering runes and sacred hour markers), and final placement under moonlight (gnomon clicks into socket, will mark hours again). Each appearance advances pressure: discovery narrows her mission, excavation deepens understanding, placement crystallizes her custodial role. The object is irreplaceable (birthmark link, sacred function) and charges the final image. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity; removing it would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interrupted journeys is woven through setup (grandmother's flight, great-aunt's death, pandemic delay) and explicitly named in paragraphs four and seven. It shapes Mira's stakes (urgency to understand before losing connection) and her final stance ("Her interrupted journey had ended, but another had begun"). However, the concept functions more as thematic frame than tactical constraint; it does not narrow on-page choices as directly as the sundial or her returnee status. Present in setup and closure reprise, with middle development via backstory rather than active pressure. Lyric resonance qualifies it for mid-6s, but limited causal work caps higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" appears twice as a label (paragraph one "warmly curious despite her fatigue," paragraph six "warmer heart") but lacks on-page tradeoff or cost. Mira's curiosity drives her to remain and excavate, yet the attribute does not constrain her—no moment where warmth conflicts with rigor, or curiosity leads her into danger that detachment would avoid. Present in setup and one middle mention; functional but replaceable with "determined" or "compelled" without structural loss. No closure participation or visible price tied to the trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Rebuild" anchors the middle third explicitly ("Mira began to rebuild what she could, starting with the sundial") and culminates in the physical placement of the gnomon in the final scene. The action changes her role from excavator to restorer, which shifts the story's pressure from discovery to custodianship. Two distinct beats (excavation work, sundial placement) and clear closure linkage. Removing "rebuild" in favor of "document" or "study" would alter the ending's charge and her transformation. Strong causal pressure and specificity; near-indispensable to the closure effect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Purposeful wandering" is named once in paragraph two ("she wandered purposefully through these abandoned tunnels") but the mechanics are told rather than shown. We see her push through the entrance and discover the sundial, but the method itself—how wandering differs from systematic search—does not alter tactics or outcomes on the page. Present in setup; no middle development or closure participation. Swappable with "searching" or "exploring" without loss. Functional acknowledgment but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is present in every major beat: opening description (roots around skulls), sundial discovery (half-buried beneath bricks), week-long excavation (tree above, roots below), and final placement (roots emerging "like arms reaching for sky"). The setting supplies resources (the sundial base, the mineral-rich soil) and constrains choices (collapsed passage traps her, tree location determines placement site). The roots-and-bones imagery charges the final moonlit scene and directly supports the theme. Early signal, multiple beat involvement, high causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The excavation unfolds "through the week" with specific markers: day four (sundial discovery), "worked through the week," "final night." Time tightens Mira's urgency (great-aunt already dead, team abandoned three days prior) and structures her transformation from scholar to custodian across the seven-day arc. However, the timeframe does not create a live clock that alters tactics—no deadline forces a choice, no race against collapse or authority. Present in setup and tracked through middle; contributes to pacing but does not constrain decisions. Solid integration without sharp pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to restore lost faith is signaled early (grandmother never spoke of home yet wept at blooms, Mira seeks to understand "why") and drives her choice to remain when the team leaves. The excavation dramatizes the friction between scholarly distance and personal need, and the final act—placing the sundial to mark sacred hours—embodies restored faith. However, "faith" itself is more invoked than tested; no on-page moment where doubt nearly wins or restoration costs her another value. Present in setup, shapes middle choices, participates in closure. Strong thematic linkage but cost is implied rather than sharp.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Cautious enchantment" is named twice (paragraph three "cautious enchantment of someone who has stumbled into a story," paragraph seven "cautious enchantment of a homecoming") and the tone modulates across beats: initial curiosity, discovery wonder, reflective excavation, moonlit resolution. The tone charges the final image (moonlight catching the sundial's edge) and coheres through pressure without flattening into single-note mood. The dual quality—caution and enchantment—reflects Mira's balanced stance throughout. Present in setup and closure reprise; tone supports escalation and final reconfiguration. Strong coherence and closure linkage.</comment>
