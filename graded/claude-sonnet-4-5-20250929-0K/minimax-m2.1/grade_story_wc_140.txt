<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The nameless protagonist remains consistent in their observational stance, but the piece withholds agency until the very end. Interior life is filtered through heavy abstraction ("the nameless one understood then") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to continue collecting is thematically coherent but feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page struggle with competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: fragments accumulate toward the label discovery, which reweights the protagonist's understanding of survival. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the decision to continue as "something unnamed rather than something erased"), but the cost remains conceptual and abstract rather than felt on the page. Orientation anchors arrive late—"nameless one" and "port" are established, but spatial grounding ("towering labyrinth") delays until after the death certificate exposition, creating brief disorientation without ultimate payoff that charges closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vivid and specific ("corrugated walls forming corridors that shifted with the tides"), and the label's physical state (soft as cloth, ghost marks) is textured. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; the containers do not constrain a choice or alter tactics in any beat. The label discovery happens because the tide reveals it, not because the protagonist navigates the maze under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding erased histories through fragment collection—is signaled early but remains static. The label discovery is a deepening (reweighting the woman's story from failure to choice), yet no live option is foreclosed and no tactical shift occurs. The woman's departure into ship holds is recounted, not dramatized, so the cost of her choice is told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from the label's reweighting: survival as continuation despite erasure. The final image ("one that belonged to survival itself") resonates without moralizing. However, the penultimate paragraph edges into thematic summary ("one that could not be erased by any document") where image alone would have sufficed, and "the texture of memories" reads as prompt echo rather than earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct lyric register ("something without a name lived in the space between rhythm and rust"). Psychic distance is controlled, and the perceptual signature—collecting fragments, filtering reality through accumulated stories—is specific. Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the quiet detritus of human speech") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted, and the dockworker's dialogue is paraphrased rather than rendered, missing an opportunity for voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and varied; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the death certificate's effect is restated across two paragraphs ("declared nonexistent"/"mark gone"), and "one that could not be erased" / "one that shifted" / "one that belonged" creates a template-cadence run in the penultimate paragraph. Mixed metaphor: "accumulated like shells gathered from a shore that never remained still" conflates accumulation with instability in a way that muddies the vehicle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of death certificate error, fragment collection, and container labyrinth offers a fresh angle on erasure and survival. The label as "currency for stories" and evidence of the choice not to use poison are specific, non-obvious turns. However, the core frame—marginalized observer in liminal space collecting others' stories—echoes familiar literary templates, and the piece does not transform it through risky structural choices or moral ambiguity that complicates the protagonist's stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The death certificate error survivor is established early and frames the protagonist's altered perception. However, the character's choices are observational (collecting, recognizing, tucking away) rather than decisive; the final act of continuing is thematically coherent but does not create a key turn that alters tactics or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The label appears in two beats: discovery in the tide-exposed crack and the dockworker's story that reweights its meaning from relic of failure to evidence of choice. It is handled on the page (pressed into concrete, soft as cloth, tucked into pocket) and shapes the protagonist's understanding at closure. The label is irreplaceable—its specific history drives the thematic turn—but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Erased histories shape the dominant stake (understanding fragment-collected pasts) and are dramatized through the death certificate error and the woman's story. The concept appears in the opening third and recurs at closure ("one that could not be erased by any document"). However, it functions more as thematic claim than tactical constraint; the protagonist's method does not change in response to the erasure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Filters reality differently" is mentioned once as a result of the death certificate error ("the world filtered differently...developed a transparency"). The trait does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost; it remains a label for the protagonist's perceptual state rather than a mechanic that alters on-page action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Layering (mapping fragments into meaning) is signaled early ("Each morning...the nameless one began the layer work") and frames the protagonist's method throughout. The label discovery deepens this work by adding texture. However, the action is primarily descriptive; removing "layer" and substituting "gather" or "assemble" would require only minor edits and would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Collecting fragments of overheard stories is established in the opening ("collected fragments of overheard stories like shells") and recurs across beats (conversations from workers, the dockworker's account, the final continuation). The method shapes the protagonist's understanding and charges the closure image ("collect what others had forgotten to speak aloud"). However, the mechanics are told rather than dramatized—we do not see the protagonist actively overhearing and choosing fragments under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is introduced immediately and provides vivid texture ("rusted skyscrapers," "corrugated walls forming corridors that shifted with the tides"). It recurs at closure ("container corridors," "deeper into the labyrinth"). The setting supplies the label discovery (tide exposes the crack) but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the protagonist moves through it without navigation pressure or spatial consequence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Tidal rhythm is signaled early ("Each morning, as the water rose") and frames the story's temporal structure. The tide exposes the label and recurs in the closing line ("following the tide's eternal rhythm toward another morning"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the tides mark passage without altering tactics or imposing a deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to discover the texture of memories is stated in the opening third ("how memory could be approached") and dramatized through fragment collection. The label reweights this search from abstract to specific (the woman's choice). However, the desire is not visibly conflicted—no competing want or cost complicates the protagonist's pursuit—and the final continuation is frictionless rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Nameless identity is established immediately ("something without a name") and sustained throughout; the protagonist is "the nameless one" in every reference. The tone modulates subtly from lyric observation to thematic resonance at closure ("something unnamed rather than something erased"). The coherence is strong, and the final image charges the namelessness with survival meaning, though the tone remains static across emotional beats rather than shifting under pressure.</comment>
