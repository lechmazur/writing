<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and specific—she seeks to understand "the architecture of lies"—and her decade of training shows through selective perception. However, interiority remains abstract ("quiet accumulation of evidence," "patient reconstruction") rather than embodied. The final realization that Konstantýn was an architect of lies rather than a victim arrives without internal friction or visible cost; she steers toward the next clue with the same serene confidence she began with, foreclosing the opportunity for genuine character pressure or change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear lens (Accumulative/Textural: the protagonist gathers fragments toward understanding) and anchors who/where/when adequately. The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration—Konstantýn shifts from victim to architect—but this reversal is delivered through summary narration ("she realized") rather than dramatized pressure. The cost is conceptual but not viscerally legible on the page; she simply "steers the barge toward" the next step with no visible sacrifice, foreclosed path, or felt consequence. One meaningful deepening occurs, but without on-page cost the closure reads thin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid and purposeful: the twilight barge canal, black glass water, amber warehouse lamps, and brick walls showing older construction all anchor the scene effectively. The sundial functions as micro-setting, handled twice and charging the final third with its "precise line across the curved dial face." The environment does not constrain a choice at closure—she simply steers toward the next location—but the recurring object (sundial) and the layered canal setting contribute atmospheric weight that supports the thematic investigation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering why a canal was erased from memory—is signaled early and remains coherent. The piece offers one meaningful tightening: the realization that Konstantýn was complicit rather than a victim. However, this turn is delivered via summary ("she realized") without on-page agency or visible cost; no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off enacted. The protagonist's serene confidence from opening to close leaves pressure static rather than escalating under stress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme—how deception is layered until indistinguishable from truth—emerges organically from the canal investigation and Konstantýn's maps. The sundial as recurring object gains meaning: it measures "hours that stretched across decades, marking time that refused to stay hidden." The final image of steering toward hidden construction offers a resonant answer to the thematic question without stating a moral. However, the protagonist's unearned epiphany ("she realized") and lack of internal friction prevent the theme from fully grounding in dramatic cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and controlled throughout; the narrative voice is distinct, favoring elevated diction ("liminal auditory space," "serene upheaval") that suits a scholar-seeker. Perceptual signature is consistent: she reads landscapes, interprets wear patterns, and trusts training instincts. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not tested. Minor slips: "silence of morning radio" is a curious phrase (radio silence typically means no broadcast, not static-hush), and "training instincts" appears twice in identical phrasing, creating a template echo that slightly dulls the voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is largely clear and rhythmically controlled, with strong specific images ("black glass," "gnomon cast a precise line"). However, several artifacts accumulate: "training instincts" appears twice in identical phrasing (template cadence); "architecture of lies" and "serene upheaval" feel like prompt labels rather than earned metaphors; "thoughtfully clear satisfaction" is abstract where embodied emotion would sharpen the beat. Paraphrase loops appear: "patience reconstruction of what had been deliberately obscured" restates the prior sentence's content without added pressure. These issues cluster but do not obscure causality, so penalties remain in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The legend-seeker premise and canal mystery offer a competent synthesis, but the core frame—scholar pursues historical secret, discovers complicity—is familiar. The sundial and erased waterway provide specific texture, yet the emotional arc and final turn (victim becomes architect) arrive without fresh complication or moral calculus. The piece executes its premise cleanly but does not transform it through lived detail or non-obvious insight. No bold structural risks are taken; the serene tone insulates against surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The errant legend seeker character is present throughout and her choices (purchasing the sundial, setting the alarm, steering toward the brick walls) create progression. However, these are low-stakes tactical moves; no key turn hinges on a difficult character-specific decision under pressure. The final realization is told rather than dramatized through choice. Present across beats but replaceable with a generic investigator without altering structure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The antique pocket sundial appears in three beats: salvaged from Prague (setup), examined for wear patterns and the engraved name (middle), and held in fading light to cast a shadow (ending). It enables the connection to Konstantýn and charges the final image ("measuring hours that stretched across decades"). However, it does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost; it functions as a clue-token rather than a pressure point. Solid integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Hindsight clarity is named in one phrase ("thoughtfully clear satisfaction") and implied in the protagonist's realization that pieces "began clicking into place." The concept echoes thematically but does not shape stakes or alter tactics on the page; she arrives at understanding through passive assembly rather than a choice forced by the concept's constraint. Present as theme claim but not dramatized as a causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully clear" appears once as a label in "thoughtfully clear satisfaction" but does not constrain or enable any on-page action. The trait is told rather than shown through micro-choices or visible trade-offs. It reads as a descriptor applied to a moment rather than a characteristic that alters behavior under pressure. Ornamental mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Salvage appears three times: she "salvaged" the sundial from Prague, "had salvaged not just an artifact but a perspective," and the verb frames her larger project of excavating forgotten truths. The action drives the inciting setup (acquiring the sundial) and is reweighted thematically in the penultimate paragraph, charging the closure image. A major turn (connecting Konstantýn to deliberate obfuscation) traces to this action. Strong integration; removing it would weaken both setup and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"By training instincts" appears twice identically ("training instincts honed over a decade," "by training instincts that had become indistinguishable from intuition") and signals the protagonist's method of reading landscapes and steering the barge. The method is present in middle and ending beats but its mechanics remain vague; we see results (she steers toward older construction) without the tactile process. Functional but not indispensable; the exact phrasing is swappable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The twilight barge canal anchors the entire scene, providing spatial continuity and atmospheric pressure. The setting supplies resources (the canal's brick walls showing older construction) that guide the protagonist's final move. The "black glass" water, amber lamps, and converted warehouses layer historical depth. The environment constrains her investigation to this specific waterway and its hidden terminus. Essential across beats and directly shapes the ending choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"The silence of morning radio" appears once as a time anchor ("set the alarm for this specific moment") and frames the liminal space between night and day when her "clearest thoughts emerged." The timeframe creates atmospheric texture but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; she experiences the moment passively rather than racing against it. Mentioned early and motivates one beat but does not constrain the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the architecture of lies" is explicitly stated and frames the quest: she seeks to discover why the canal was erased and who did it. This desire drives her purchase of the sundial, her fieldwork, and her final steering toward hidden construction. However, the motivation is never conflicted or tested; no competing want or cost creates friction. Functional across beats but not dramatized through difficult choice or visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" appears once as a phrase describing her understanding, attempting to marry calm clarity with disruptive realization. The tone aims for contemplative intensity but remains uniformly elevated and abstract throughout; no modulation occurs under pressure, and the protagonist's untroubled confidence from start to finish undercuts the "upheaval" half. Present as a label but not enacted through tonal shifts that charge the final image.</comment>
