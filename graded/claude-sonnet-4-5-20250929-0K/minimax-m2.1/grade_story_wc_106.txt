<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira remains entirely internal and observational throughout; the man with camellias never becomes a live participant, reducing him to a prop. Her "art of the golden-hour theft" and "jar of captured moonbeams" are presented as established competencies without on-page struggle or cost. The ending gesture—her smile of "quietly savvy knowledge"—asserts completion without dramatizing a choice that forecloses a path or alters her stance. Interiority leans heavily on abstract meditation ("moments chose their observers," "destiny's door") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately and teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens through recurring images (moonbeams, camellias, golden light). However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows Mira's options; she waits, observes, photographs, and departs with the same capacity and stance she began with. The man's slight shift in expression offers a micro turn but does not rebound to alter Mira's trajectory or impose visible cost. Closure reads as thematic restatement rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The emerald station, golden-hour light, and moonbeam jar are vividly rendered and recur across beats, charging atmosphere and anchoring the accumulative design. The camellias function as a symbolic object that Mira decodes, and the setting's "emerald-tinted glass roof" and "wooden bench" offer concrete spatial anchors. However, the environment does not constrain Mira's choices or alter her tactics; she moves through it with "careful reverence" but no friction. The station functions as a backdrop rather than a pressure that shapes the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Mira's dominant stake—to capture "illuminated moments" and reveal "paths untraveled"—is declared but never tested on the page. No opposition, resource scarcity, or internal conflict tightens her options; she executes her ritual without hindrance. The man's slight expression change is observed, not earned by Mira's agency, and does not rebound to force a trade-off or foreclose a path. The final paragraph summarizes her philosophy rather than dramatizing a choice with visible cost, leaving escalation minimal under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of "stolen moments" and "destiny's whispers" is coherent and recurs through image and idiom. The moonbeam ritual and camellia symbolism offer a purposeful motif system. However, the final paragraph over-articulates the theme with direct statements ("the only true theft was the failure to listen when fate knocked"), crossing into sermonizing. The ending asserts meaning rather than allowing the closure image to resonate non-literally, reducing thematic subtlety and inviting a −0.5 penalty for moralizing in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyric and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature ("luminous disbelief," "jar of captured moonbeams," "bruised amber and soft viridian"). Psychic distance remains stable in close third, and diction is controlled. However, the prose leans toward elevated, poetic register throughout without modulation for pressure; peak moments (the photograph, the man's departure) receive the same ornate treatment as exposition, flattening urgency. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Purposeful compression is present but risks opacity without clear payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("bruised amber and soft viridian," "liquid silver," "luminous disbelief"), but appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or functional variation, triggering a −0.5 overwriting penalty. Paraphrase loops occur: "the portraits she took were never really stolen…just borrowed" echoes "the true gift…not the stealing of moments, but the revelation." Scaffold phrases recur ("quietly savvy," "luminous disbelief," "illuminated moments") without evolving meaning. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propels, adding −0.3 for momentum drag. Information density is moderate; many sentences describe rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "golden-hour portrait thief" frame and moonbeam-capture ritual offer a lyric fantastical angle, and the camellia-code detail adds specificity. However, the core arc—observer witnesses stranger, intuits hidden meaning, departs unchanged—follows a familiar template without transformation through character friction or non-obvious stakes. The ending recycles the setup ("another golden sunset, another emerald station") rather than offering a synthesis that redefines prior material. No bold structural risk heightens stakes; the piece plays safely within its lyric register.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her role as "golden-hour portrait thief" frames the piece (setup gate met). She performs the photograph ritual in the middle beat (development gate met weakly) and reflects on her work in the ending (closure participation as thematic summary, not causal action). However, her choices do not create turns; she executes an established routine without friction or cost. The element is functional but does not drive escalation or alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The jar appears in the opening description, is uncapped and poured over the lens in the central ritual beat, and is noted as "empty" in the ending paragraph, meeting all three gates. However, its use is procedural rather than constrained by scarcity or risk; Mira never struggles to obtain moonbeams or pays a price for their expenditure. The jar's state change (full → empty) does not reweight her options or charge the closure image with cost. It functions as a prop within a ritual rather than an object whose specificity narrows or enables a key choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Illuminated moments" is stated in the opening, shapes Mira's goal throughout (to capture "the truly significant"), and is invoked in the final paragraph. It operates more as theme than as a concept that alters on-page tactics; Mira's method (waiting for golden light, using moonbeams) enacts the concept rather than testing or complicating it. The concept frames stakes but does not narrow options or impose a visible trade-off, placing it in the functional but replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Quietly savvy" appears twice as a label (opening and ending) but is not dramatized through a choice that trades off openness for caution or vice versa. Mira's competence is asserted rather than tested; no beat shows her leveraging insider knowledge at a cost or withholding impulse under pressure. The trait could be replaced with "patient," "reverent," or "confident" without altering any action, making it ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Mira "reinterprets" the man's life through the portrait she captures, and the word "reinterpretation" recurs in the text. The action occurs in the central beat (development gate met) and is invoked at closure. However, the reinterpretation is described in the abstract ("a coded message from a future self") rather than shown to change Mira's or the man's options on the page. The action could be replaced with "reveal," "translate," or "capture" without breaking the story's logic, placing it in the functional but swappable band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Flower codes are mentioned in the second paragraph (roses, lilies, chrysanthemums) and the white camellias are read as "a message she alone might decipher." The method is present and used once (middle beat), but its mechanics are not tested or complicated; Mira's interpretation is asserted as correct without friction. The flowers do not constrain her approach or fail her, and no other character challenges or confirms the code. The method signals early and participates in closure thematically but does not shape attempts or tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "emerald station by moonlight" is anchored in the opening line and recurs throughout, meeting setup and development. The "emerald-tinted glass roof" and "wooden bench" provide concrete spatial detail. The station is invoked in the final line ("another emerald station"), participating in closure as a lyric reprise. However, the setting does not constrain Mira's choices or supply friction; she moves through it freely. The moonlight transition marks time but does not tighten decisions. The station functions as atmosphere and motif rather than a micro-setting that alters tactics, placing it in the purposeful-reprise band near the 5.5–6.3 allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "fleeting golden sunset" is present in the opening line and the light's shift to moonlight is tracked in the middle beat, meeting setup and development gates. The sunset's brevity is asserted ("fleeting") but not dramatized as a ticking constraint; Mira waits "until the last train departed" without urgency or risk of missing the moment. The timeframe does not narrow her options or force a trade-off, making it functional but not pressurized.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To press your ear against destiny's door" appears in the fourth paragraph describing the man's weariness and is echoed in the sixth paragraph as Mira's own habit. It frames desire thematically but is not dramatized through conflicted choice or visible cost. Mira's actions (waiting, photographing, departing) align with the motivation without friction; no beat shows her torn between listening and retreating, or paying a price to pursue this goal. The motivation is told and invoked rather than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Luminous disbelief" appears as a descriptor for the developed portrait image and again in the man's expression as he departs. The phrase charges two beats and is coherent with the lyric, mystical register. However, tone remains uniformly elevated and reverent throughout; no modulation occurs under pressure, and the "disbelief" is attributed rather than embodied in Mira's or the man's reactions. The tone supports atmosphere but does not shift to heighten the closure image with surprise or cost, placing it in the functional-reprise band.</comment>
