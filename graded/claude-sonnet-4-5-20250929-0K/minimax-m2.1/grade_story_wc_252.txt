<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior life is built through embodied detail—"hands sure, steps fluid"—and the scrimshaw functions as a concrete anchor for her emotional guardedness. The shift from locked to open carries some weight, but the epiphany arrives largely through reflection rather than contradiction acted out in scene. The whale's call operates more as catalyst than as pressure that forces her to choose between competing goods. Internal conflict is present but tilts toward summary of her armor-building rather than contradictory impulses playing out simultaneously under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the whale's call accumulates pressure through sensory layering and the scrimshaw's symbolic weight deepens across beats. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (heart opening, stepping into water, leaving the scrimshaw behind) with felt cost—she forecloses her guarded life. Orientation anchors quickly (harbor, docks, twilight, Maren alone). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the scrimshaw's true purpose and acts on it. The cost is legible in the final image: she swims toward unknown transformation, the scrimshaw left behind as a deliberate severance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe functions as active setting—"neither shore nor sea but something that contains the truth of both"—and constrains her final choice by offering a liminal space that mirrors her transformation. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "cold, but not unkind," bioluminescence, the dock's wooden beams resonating with whale song. The harbor and water are filtered through Maren's labor-trained perception. The scrimshaw as micro-object charges the final image when laid down, and the water itself becomes the crucible that receives her.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Maren's choice between guarded self-preservation and vulnerable liberation—is signaled early and tightens when the whale's call forces her to act. One meaningful turn occurs when she realizes the scrimshaw unlocks her own heart, not others', and steps into the water. Agency is present: she detaches from the talisman and moves toward transformation. The cost is felt—she forecloses her known life and steps into mystery. Pressure accumulates through the whale's repeated call and her interior shift, though the escalation leans more on reflection than on competing live options dramatized in action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the scrimshaw's evolving meaning and the water/land threshold. The final image—"some locks only open when you set down the key"—offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing, though it edges close to summary. The piece resists easy binaries (surrender vs. combat, safety vs. freedom) and layers "combative tenderness" through the whale's call. However, phrases like "embracing one's true nature" and "the world's ugliness" tilt toward abstraction. The scrimshaw's arc from heirloom to detached talisman carries thematic weight, but late articulation of its "true purpose" feels slightly engineered rather than discovered through prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider lyric observation. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "elegy than silhouette," "combative tenderness," "sublittoral fringe." Perceptual signature is consistent—Maren notices the world through labor and guardedness. Some register drift occurs: "re-education ships," "fortress engineers," and "combative tenderness" read slightly elevated for a dock worker's interior lexicon, though they may reflect narrator overlay. No head-hopping; focalization is clean. Purposeful compression in the final paragraphs maintains clarity under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several passages loop or paraphrase. "She had guarded herself fiercely" and the following two sentences restate her armor-building without added pressure. "The scrimshaw had never unlocked anything. She had kept herself locked" is synonym churn. Template cadence appears: "not a demand... an invitation," "not to unlock others' hearts, but to unlock her own," "not through combat, but through surrender. Not by holding on, but by letting go." Stock metaphors cluster: "heart... opened like a flower," "the world could transform the tender into the terrible." Figurative density in the final third (bioluminescence, disappearing island, flower) crowds without clear pattern payoff. Minor pronoun ambiguity: "their violence become legend, their treasures become heirlooms" could briefly confuse antecedent. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template runs, −0.4 for stock metaphor strings in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The scrimshaw-as-self-lock premise offers a modest inflection on the familiar "letting go" arc, and the sublittoral fringe as threshold space is specific. However, the core emotional journey—guarded person learns to be vulnerable through symbolic detachment—follows a well-worn template without significant transformation. Turns feel signposted: the whale's call, the realization about the scrimshaw's purpose, the step into water. "Combative tenderness" and the pirate/occupation backstory add texture but do not fundamentally alter the arc. The ending insight ("some locks only open when you set down the key") is cleanly stated but arrives as thematic summary rather than a fresh synthesis discovered through action.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout and makes the key choice to detach from the scrimshaw and step into the water. "Graceful" appears early and is embodied in her movement along the pilings. Her decision alters tactics—she leaves behind her guarded life—and the cost is visible. She appears in the closure beat. However, "dock worker" is signaled only through "years of labor" and rope-coiling; occupation itself does not constrain the central choice. The attribute "graceful" constrains less than her guardedness does.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scrimshaw is handled in multiple beats: pressed into her hands by her father, worn against her chest, lifted and unclasped, laid on the dock. It returns with reweighted meaning—from protective talisman to symbol of self-imprisonment. Its presence shapes the middle realization ("This was the talisman's true purpose") and the final act of detachment. Removing it would break the closure's symbolic charge. It is causally active and irreplaceable, though the whale's call does more tactical work than the object itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Disappearing island" appears only as metaphor in the final paragraph ("the disappearing island of her former self"). It does not shape stakes or tactics on the page; it is not a literal island, nor does it constrain choices. The concept is ornamental—a lyric flourish rather than a structural element. Swappable with "vanishing shore" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Unlocks guarded hearts" is introduced in backstory and reinterpreted late: the scrimshaw unlocks her own heart, not others'. The attribute does not constrain action until the final third, when she detaches from it. It is present in the closure but introduced as a label her father spoke, not dramatized through prior choices. The unlock metaphor is told more than shown, and the shift from "others' hearts" to "her own" is a thematic twist rather than a cost-bearing tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Detach" is signaled early in the prompt elements and dramatized on the page when Maren unclasps the scrimshaw and lays it down. This act is the story's pivotal turn—she detaches from the safeguard, from her father's legacy, from her frozen state. The action is irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the closure. It shapes the final image and forecloses her prior path. The cost is visible: she steps into uncertainty. However, the detachment occurs somewhat late (final third) and could have been more deeply seeded in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The whale's call is signaled early ("The call rose from the deep as the tide turned") and recurs across beats, shaping Maren's realization and final choice. Its mechanics—song that resonates through water and bone—matter and are specific. It is the catalyst that forces her to act, and she swims toward it in the ending. Removing the call would eliminate the external pressure that crystallizes her choice. However, it functions more as thematic trigger than as a method she must learn or employ; she does not use it, she responds to it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is named early, described as "where land became sea and certainty became mystery," and becomes the literal space Maren enters. It supplies the liminal threshold that mirrors her transformation and constrains her final choice—she must step into this in-between zone. It is irreplaceable as the story's spatial metaphor and physical setting for closure. However, it does not alter tactics in the middle; its work is concentrated at the beginning and end.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After violence becomes impossible by decree" anchors the backstory (the surrender, the occupation, the re-education) and explains why the pirates are "stories now." It sets the world's rules and Maren's context of careful silence. However, it does not tighten present decisions or create a live clock. The timeframe is static context rather than dynamic pressure. Swappable with "after the war ended" or similar without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The desire to find freedom in embracing one's true nature is dramatized through Maren's interior conflict and her final choice to step into the water. It is signaled early ("what she was meant to be") and tested at closure when she detaches from the scrimshaw and swims toward the whale. Friction is present: she has built walls to survive, and opening her heart risks the world's cruelty. The cost is felt—she forecloses safety. However, the phrasing "true nature" appears somewhat abstractly and the motivation is more reflected upon than shown in contradictory micro-choices under immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Combative tenderness" is named explicitly and threaded through the whale's "fierce gentleness" and Maren's shift from guardedness to vulnerability. Tone modulates from measured reflection to lyric intensity in the final third. The oxymoron charges the final image—surrender as strength, opening as bravery. However, the phrase is told more than embodied in sentence rhythm and diction choices. The tone is coherent but does not intensify through syntactic or cadence shifts that mirror the combative/tender duality under pressure.</comment>
