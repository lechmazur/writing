<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glassblower's interiority is vivid and particular—his relationship to glass craft and internal glaciers is embodied through handling the bookmark and shaping the vessel. The motivation to "craft safe zones for inquiry" remains abstract and told rather than tested through contradictory impulses in scene. No secondary character pressures choices, and the protagonist's reflection dominates without on-page micro-choices that alter present options. The final act of placing the bookmark beside the cooled glass reads as a symbolic gesture rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers imagery of thawing, glass-working, and the bookmark across a single continuous scene. Orientation is clear (glassblower, control room, spring thaw) by the opening. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing lands on the page—the ending restates the thematic premise ("prepared to begin again") without altering options or foreclosing a path. The Cost proof test fails: no sentence in the closure beat makes a felt or conceptual price legible. Under the selected lens, the final image reiterates rather than reweights.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned control room is anchored early with rusted consoles, cracked windowpanes, and the glory hole, establishing a specific micro-setting. Sensory detail (icicles weeping, amber glass catching light, ice cascading from the overhang) is filtered through the glassblower's craft-focused POV. The glory hole constrains the glass-working action in the middle beat, and the melting ice parallels the internal thaw. The bookmark and cooling glass function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test for setting-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—internal thawing and vulnerability—is signaled early but remains abstract. The glass-working sequence (retrieve gather, reheat in glory hole, shape vessel) provides procedural beats but no reversal or tightening that narrows options. The protagonist's agency is observation and craft execution without a trade-off or price that forecloses a path. The ending ("prepared to begin again") asserts cyclical readiness rather than a turn driven by prior causality. No escalation under the Accumulative lens beyond density of imagery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through breaking and thawing emerges concretely through the cracked bookmark, the melting ice, and the shaped glass vessel. The "safe zones for inquiry" motivation and the "weighty lightness" phrase veer into abstract philosophizing rather than arising from particulars. The final image of bookmark-beside-glass gestures toward resonance but does not reweight prior material—it summarizes the theme rather than offering a non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the craft gestures and seasonal imagery, but the piece edges toward thematic echo in "prepared to begin again."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled; the glassblower's perceptual signature filters detail through craft knowledge and philosophical reflection. The theatrical solemnity of his spoken announcement ("Now then…") is voice-motivated and distinct. However, diction in interiority ("thoughtfully spirited," "weighty lightness," "cautiously beating heart") drifts into elevated, label-heavy register that reads generic rather than character-specific. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the prose at peak beats leans on abstract phrasing instead of embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language (ice as internal glaciers, glass as potential) is coherent. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "thawing" is restated across multiple sentences in the opening and closing without added pressure. Template cadence in the fourth paragraph: "He had stumbled… when the ice was melting then too and he was looking… What he found instead…" runs a predictable pattern. The phrase "temperamental temperament" is tautological. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed to understand") cluster in reflective beats but do not dull immediacy given the lyric mode. Overwriting in figurative density (nearly every sentence carries metaphor) without clear escalation triggers modest penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The glassblower-as-metaphor-for-personal-transformation premise is familiar; the piece does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or world logic. Specific craft detail (gather, blowpipe, glory hole, cooling tank) and the abandoned control room setting provide textural freshness. The cracked bookmark's backstory (dropped reaching for molten glass) offers a concrete inflection. However, the thematic arc—breaking yields growth, winter thaws to spring—follows a well-worn template without risk or surprise. The ending's cyclical readiness is anticipated rather than inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The glassblower is present throughout and his craft actions (retrieve gather, transfer to glory hole, shape vessel) structure the beats. However, his choices are procedural rather than stake-altering: no decision forecloses a path or changes options. Setup present, development functional (middle craft beat), closure participation ornamental (places bookmark beside glass). The character observes and enacts routine rather than making a turn under pressure. Swappable with another contemplative artisan without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The cracked leather bookmark is introduced early (setup clear), handled in the opening beat with backstory about its origin and the crack, and reappears in the final beat placed beside the cooled glass. Two distinct beats, but the second use is descriptive pairing rather than causal action. The crack's backstory (dropped reaching for molten glass) ties to the craft world, but the bookmark does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic. Lyric reprise reweights meaning modestly (scars as value), reaching mid-6 range, but lacks irreplaceability—any cherished object with a flaw could serve the same function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Thawing appears as metaphor (internal glaciers, ice melting outside, "unfreezing of something essential") throughout, signaled early and echoed at closure. However, it remains thematic overlay rather than shaping stakes or altering tactics on the page. The glassblower's glass-working proceeds identically whether the thaw is literal or metaphorical. No choice is narrowed or enabled by the thaw; it is illustrated rather than enacted. Functional presence across beats but swappable with another seasonal metaphor without changing the plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully spirited" is a label applied in the opening paragraph ("a thoughtfully spirited craftsman") without on-page demonstration. The attribute does not constrain or enable an action with cost—choices are contemplative throughout, and no visible trade-off arises from this trait. Ornamental descriptor rather than active attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Abandon" appears twice with purpose: abandoning the cooling tank to transfer glass to the glory hole (middle beat, procedural necessity), and the abandoned control room setting (framing choice that enables the sanctuary). The control-room abandonment shapes the protagonist's motivation (work without supervision) and is signaled early, contributing to setup and closure participation (setting charges final image). The cooling-tank line is a craft step rather than a major turn. Two-gate fulfillment with causal pressure on the setting choice lifts the score above mid-band; however, the glass-transfer action itself is easily swappable with another procedural verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dramatically narrating mundane tasks is signaled in the theatrical announcement ("Now then… we must abandon the cooling tank… where the hungry flames shall warm our ambitions") and visible in the descriptive glass-working beats. However, the method does not shape attempts or constrain tactics—it is tonal coloring rather than a mechanic that alters pressure. Setup and development present, but closure participation is weak: the final beat describes rather than dramatizes. Functional across beats but replaceable with straightforward narration without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The abandoned control room is introduced in the opening sentence, anchors spatial choreography (consoles, windowpanes, glory hole), and provides the sanctuary motivation ("a place that seemed to understand his motivation"). The setting's discovery backstory (three springs ago) and its function (no supervision, no expectation) directly enable the protagonist's craft practice. The melting ice on the building's overhang participates in the final beat, charging the image of release. Three-gate fulfillment with causal pressure: the setting choice shapes the protagonist's ability to work freely. Essential rather than ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Ice melting is signaled early ("Spring had arrived") and returns in the middle (ice on overhang) and closure (thawing heart of the season). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—glass-working proceeds at the protagonist's pace without a live clock. The seasonal metaphor reweights meaning in the final image but does not pressure choices. Two-gate presence (setup and closure participation) with modest causal role reaches mid-5s; lacks the urgency required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Crafting safe zones for inquiry is stated explicitly in the fourth paragraph backstory ("his motivation—to craft safe zones for inquiry") but never dramatized through an on-page choice or friction. The glass vessel's description ("a space made solid, a zone of safety made manifest") restates the motivation rather than testing it. Told-only motivation without conflicted action trends low. Setup and closure echo present, but no middle development or visible cost tied to this desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Weighty lightness" is introduced early ("the peculiar weighty lightness") and repeated in the final paragraph ("weighty and light by turns"). The tone modulates across the piece—elevated diction in reflection, grounded detail in craft action—but does not charge the final image with additional pressure. The phrase feels coined rather than enacted through rhythm and cadence. Two-gate presence (setup and closure mention) with modest coherence reaches mid-5s, but the tone is applied as label rather than embodied through syntactic control under pressure.</comment>
