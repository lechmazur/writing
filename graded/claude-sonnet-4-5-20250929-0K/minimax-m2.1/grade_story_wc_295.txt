<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is heavily abstract and retrospective ("she had always known," "fifteen years documenting"), with minimal contradiction or embodied emotion under present pressure. The telegram moment offers no micro-choice that alters her stance; she simply understands in a smooth epiphany. Peak beats rely on therapy-speak ("healing words," "burden of knowledge") and diagnostic self-awareness ("witnessed the architecture of unconsciousness") rather than character-particular thought. The final decision to write "for all who would come after" arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; no penalty. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pattern recognition across journals, dreams, and stellar data—but the closure lands as a summary realization ("she finally understood") rather than a decisive image or reconfiguration with felt cost. The piece narrates understanding rather than dramatizing a choice or renunciation that forecloses an option. Cost is asserted ("shared burdens," "healing words") but not made legible in a concrete action or forfeiture at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The observatory dome, spiral staircase, and research desk anchor spatial movement cleanly. Sensory detail is selective (copper gleaming, Variable Star 47 pulsing) and filtered through Elara's astronomical expertise. The daylily-pressed telegram functions as a recurring object that charges the final reflection, and the observatory setting provides professional context. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains a backdrop for interiority rather than shaping action under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding ancient inscriptions via dream correlation—is signaled early, but pressure remains static: Elara ascends the stairs, reviews journals, and recognizes a pattern without obstacle or complication. The telegram summons her, yet no tightening narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The final decision to "write not just for herself" is declared rather than earned through a visible cost or foreclosed alternative. Escalation exists only as intellectual recognition, not as on-page pressure that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme (shared knowledge, generational transmission) is explicitly stated in multiple passages: "burdens we've carried together," "passed forward like the variable stars," "healing words exchanged." The daylily motif is over-explained ("symbolized the fleeting nature of insight") rather than allowed to resonate through image. The final paragraph moralizes the piece's thesis directly, replacing scene pressure with abstract commentary. The conceptual repricing is asserted but not made concrete or undeniable in the final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("lucid dream chronicler," "pulsing in its long, slow rhythm"), though register occasionally drifts into workshop idiom ("burden of knowledge," "healing words") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Psychic distance is controlled but lacks perceptual signature—Elara's noticing is general astronomer rather than distinctly hers. Purposeful compression in the final paragraph ("midnight solace," "healing words") coheres with the reflective mode but flattens urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean with varied syntax, but several beats loop conceptually: paragraph three restates "understood" multiple times; paragraph four paraphrases "dreams had always been different" in adjacent clauses. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph ("not to solve...but to share," "not from answers...but from"). Stock metaphors (stars "spoke in languages," "tide of recognition") appear frequently without fresh inflection. The closing lines summarize rather than propel, and figurative density ("healing words," "burden of revelation") in the final third obscures concrete action. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence; cap at 8.7 per artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—astronomer discovers ancient star maps via lucid dreams—echoes familiar tropes (astronomer-mystic, dreams as data, temple=observatory reveal) without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The epiphany arrives smoothly without friction or cost, and the "shared burdens" resolution is asserted rather than earned through specific choices. Emotional specificity is absent; Elara's arc could transfer to any scholar-protagonist with minor edits. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece executes a familiar template without fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her role as chronicler is established in exposition; at closure she decides to "write...for all who would come after," a declaration without visible cost. Present in setup, middle description, and ending reflection, but observation dominates over decision. Swappable with "astronomer" or "scholar" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The telegram is pressed with daylily in the opening, carried in the satchel, spread on the desk at midpoint, and referenced symbolically at closure ("daylily symbolized the fleeting nature"). Appears in three beats with evolving context. However, it is handled passively—described and interpreted—rather than used to enable or constrain a choice. The object's meaning is explained rather than charged through action. Strong setup and lyric reprise lift it into mid-band, but lack of causal pressure caps it below 6.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Shared burdens is named repeatedly ("burdens we've carried together," "share the burden") and articulated as theme in the telegram and final reflection. Does not constrain an on-page choice or create tactical friction; it functions as thematic echo rather than stake-shaping pressure. Present across beats but ornamental—assertions of the concept without cost or action tied to it. Functional label without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Healing words" appears twice: in paragraph four ("healing words written in dreams") and the final line ("healing words exchanged"). Treated as poetic label without on-page demonstration—no scene shows Elara using words to heal or constrain a choice. Mentioned but not enacted. No visible tradeoff or cost tied to the attribute; purely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Witnessing drives the middle beat: Elara "witnesses the architecture of unconsciousness" and watches Cepheid variables, leading to the recognition that temple builders were astronomers. The action appears in setup (dream journals as witness records) and culminates in the climactic realization. However, "witness" is easily swappable with "observe" or "study" without loss; the specificity does not alter her method or add constraint. Present in two key beats and linked to closure, but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Variable stars are introduced early (Variable Star 47, Cepheid variables), analyzed through the observatory lens at midpoint, and returned to in the final image ("Cepheid variables continued their ancient pulse"). The method shapes the recognition—stellar light curves match dream patterns—and is present across three beats. However, the mechanism remains abstract description rather than tactical constraint; the stars provide data but do not force a choice or alter her approach under pressure. Strong presence and closure linkage, but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The observatory is named early, its copper dome and spiral staircase described, and Elara ascends to the research desk where the climax unfolds. Setting provides spatial grounding and professional context, and the final image places her under the dome with the stars visible. However, the location does not constrain a choice or supply resources that affect outcome—any quiet study space could serve. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but functionally replaceable; postcard description more than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"When understanding dawns" frames the timeframe and appears in the title of paragraph three and the final line ("understanding dawned across the sky"). The moment is signaled but not sharpened into a live clock—no urgency or countdown pressures Elara's decision. Time functions as thematic marker rather than tactical constraint. Present in setup and closure as lyric motif, but does not tighten choices or alter moves. Mid-low for static temporal mood without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode inscriptions is stated in the telegram and drives her ascent to the observatory; the recognition that inscriptions are "precise recordings of stellar behavior" forms the climactic beat. Present in setup, middle realization, and final resolve to share findings. However, desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no friction between wants and costs, no visible sacrifice tied to decoding. Functional presence across beats without embodied struggle or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Midnight solace is evoked through setting (midnight sky, quiet observatory) and thematic reflection ("midnight solace came not from answers found in isolation"). Tone is contemplative and consistent, modulating slightly as recognition dawns, and charges the final image with the stars' "ancient pulse." However, tone remains a single static mood—reflective calm—without sharp modulation under pressure. Present in setup and ending with coherent texture, but lacks dynamic range or tension that would elevate closure charge.</comment>
