<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mage's motivation is clear and intensifies logically toward the repair work, with his lukewarm magic framed as inadequate yet ultimately sufficient. Internal contradiction appears in his surprise at his own warmth of purpose, though the piece leans toward summary of traits rather than embodied choices under pressure. The final choice to stay and ring the bell demonstrates endurance with cost (his ongoing commitment), but the fishermen's hollow-to-wonder transformation and the mage's self-assessment ("earnestly naive...wise enough") edge toward external validation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. No therapy-speak or diagnostic labels in peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early (lukewarm mage, sapphire viaduct, dawn, post-fish-famine). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the mage commits to ringing the bell at dawn and dusk, tethering the village through persistent modest action with visible cost (his ongoing station on the viaduct). The textural pattern—dripping water, patient accumulation, lukewarm warmth—deepens across the repair sequence and charges the final image ("faint drip of water wearing down stone"). One meaningful tightening occurs when the crack narrows and vanishes through repeated droplet applications, reweighting the dominant stake (cosmic imbalance) with felt cost (hours of work, thin magic, persistent faith). No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct is visually vivid and spatially coherent (center, railing channels, stone basins, blue glow), and the setting's moisture (morning dew, dripping water) directly enables the repair method. The viaduct's ancient light is absorbed by the bell, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (irregular drip intervals, blue-to-noonday-sky color shift), filtered through the mage's patient observation. The micro-setting (body, bell, water droplets) constrains the repair choice and participates in closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for environment shaping tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cosmic imbalance causing fish famine) is signaled early and clear. One meaningful tightening: the mage's application of lukewarm-infused droplets narrows the crack from full fracture to hairline to vanished, with visible cost (hours, aching arms, thin magic stretched). Agency is decision and endurance; the mage chooses the modest persistent method over extreme temperature, and his faith in inadequacy drives the repair. The fishermen's return with abundant catches demonstrates the imbalance righted, with the mage's ongoing bell-ringing as the price paid. Escalation is textural (density increase via repeated droplet application) under the Accumulative lens, and cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the dripping-water motif and the mage's inadequacy reframed as necessity: modest persistence can heal what overwhelming force would shatter. The bell's transformation (absorbing sapphire light, carrying water's patience) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the imbalance question. Subtext operates in the father's urgency, the village's silence, and the fishermen's weeping wonder. No overt thematic statements in the body, though the final paragraph's explicit linkage ("patient and eternal, gentle and unstoppable") edges toward direct articulation rather than pure image. The ending avoids moralizing but does state the lesson more openly than ideal for the 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on the mage; psychic distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is clear: he notices dripping rates, fracture patterns, and patient accumulation, filtered through his modest self-assessment. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("lukewarm," "earnestly naive," "patient accumulation"), though some phrases edge toward elevated register ("belied his failing strength," "cosmic imbalance"). No head-hopping. The piece uses free indirect style cleanly. However, the final paragraph's explicit thematic summary ("the steady application of something modest and persistent, exactly as the dripping rates had taught him") reads as helpful-narrator syndrome, tilting toward reader assistance rather than trusting the dramatized image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with most lines advancing character, action, or atmosphere. However, template cadence and synonym churn appear: "The mage was earnestly naive enough...and wise enough" mirrors earlier "too weak...too much...What it needed"; "modest and persistent" recurs three times in the final third without functional variation. The final paragraph contains paraphrase loops: "steady application of something modest and persistent, exactly as the dripping rates had taught him" restates the repair method already shown. Stock metaphors ("hollow eyes," "chest ache with purpose") and elevated diction in a few beats ("belied," "cosmic") slightly jar the established voice. Apply −0.6 for template runs and loops; −0.3 for stock phrases. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lukewarm-mage-as-ideal-repairer premise offers a fresh angle: inadequacy is not overcome but revealed as the correct tool. The dripping-water method and sapphire viaduct are specific and memorable. However, the "modest hero discovers hidden strength" frame is a widely used template, and the cosmic-imbalance-solved-by-humble-magic arc is familiar in fantasy. Transformation comes through the specificity of dripping rates and lukewarm infusion, lifting the piece above pure derivation. Emotional truth (the mage's surprise at his own purpose) adds depth. The bell-as-anchor-for-abundance concept is evocative but not wholly original. Apply −0.5 for template proximity; credit +0.3 for the dripping-rates mechanic and lukewarm-as-necessity specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lukewarm mage is present from the opening line, frames the story, and drives all major turns: studying the bell, kneeling to repair it, applying droplets at measured intervals, lifting and swinging the restored bell, and committing to ring it at dawn and dusk. His choices (gathering water, infusing it with lukewarm power, patient application) create the repair and closure. Early signal +0.8; three distinct beats (study, repair, ring/commit) +1.4; causal pressure (his method narrows options and enables the repair) +1.2; closure linkage (his ringing and ongoing station shape the ending) +1.5; cost connection (hours, thin magic, ongoing commitment) +0.5. Total additive ~5.4 from base 3.0 → 8.4, round down to nearest tenth within band constraints. Strong causal presence and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The broken ship's bell appears in the opening line, is studied and handled in multiple beats (carried for three days, fracture examined, droplets applied to the crack, lifted and swung), and its restored voice shapes the closure. Early signal +0.8; four distinct beats (carry, study, repair, ring) +1.4; causal pressure (the bell's silence causes imbalance; its repair enables the fish's return) +1.4; closure linkage (ringing and its transformed sound anchor the ending) +1.6; specificity (the crack's voice, absorbed sapphire light, dual dawn/dusk ringing) +0.7; cost connection (father's death, village silence, mage's labor) +0.5. Total additive ~6.4 from base 3.0 → 9.4, but swappability friction (another ritual object could serve with edits) −0.6 → 8.8, round down within band. Near-indispensable but not fully unique.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Brittle devotion" as a concept does not appear explicitly on the page. The mage's persistence could read as devotion, and the bell's brittleness is literal (extreme temperature would shatter it), but the phrase itself is absent and the thematic link is oblique. The piece enacts modest persistence and gentle repair rather than brittle devotion. If interpreted as the mage's fragile commitment that could break under force, it shapes tactics (he chooses patience over intensity), but the concept is not signaled by name or clear proxy. One beat (choosing lukewarm over extreme) +0.4; causal pressure (brittleness constrains method) +0.8; late conceptual linkage +0.3 → ~4.5 from base 3.0, but label-only absence −0.3 and swappability (another constraint could serve) −0.5 → cap mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Earnestly naive" appears explicitly in the second paragraph: the mage believes his inadequate magic might suffice and is wise enough to see inadequacy as requirement. This trait constrains his method (he chooses modest warmth, not grand power) and enables the repair. Setup signal +0.5; one distinct beat (choosing the lukewarm method) +0.4; causal pressure (naivety allows him to try what others wouldn't) +1.0; closure linkage (his modest persistence is echoed in the final image) +0.9; cost connection (his faith in inadequacy is tested across hours) +0.4. Total ~6.2 from base 3.0, but the trait is labeled rather than fully dramatized in micro-choices under contradictory pressure −0.3 → mid-6s. Functional and present but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The "rebuild" action (repairing the bell) occupies the entire middle section and drives the closure: the mage gathers water, infuses droplets, applies them at measured intervals, watches the crack narrow and vanish, then swings the restored bell. Early signal (opening line: broken bell) +0.8; three distinct beats (study fracture, apply droplets, ring restored bell) +1.4; causal pressure (repair is the sole method to right the imbalance) +1.5; closure linkage (the bell's voice and the mage's ongoing ringing anchor the ending) +1.7; specificity (droplet application, lukewarm infusion, sapphire-light absorption) +0.8; cost connection (hours, thin magic, ongoing station) +0.6. Total ~9.8 from base 3.0, but a different restorative action (re-casting, re-forging) could serve with moderate edits −0.8 → high 8s. Nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Understanding dripping rates" is signaled in the second paragraph: the mage watches dew gather and drip at irregular intervals, notes patterns, and realizes the key is working with natural rhythms. This method shapes his repair attempt (applying droplets at measured intervals) and the closure (the bell's voice carries the drip's patience). Setup signal +0.6; two distinct beats (observation, application) +0.9; causal pressure (the method enables repair where force would fail) +1.3; closure linkage (dripping patience is echoed in the final line) +1.2; specificity (irregular intervals, measured application) +0.6. Total ~7.6 from base 3.0, but the mechanics are somewhat summary (we don't see precise rate calculation) −0.3 → mid-7s. Essential method, moderately detailed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct at dawn is anchored in the opening line and shapes the repair: its blue glow is absorbed by the bell, its railing channels collect dew, and the setting provides the water and light that enable the method. The mage remains on the viaduct at closure, ringing the bell. Early signal +0.8; three distinct beats (opening, repair, closure station) +1.4; causal pressure (the viaduct supplies water and light; its ancient properties charge the bell) +1.3; closure linkage (the mage stays on the viaduct, ringing at dawn/dusk) +1.4; specificity (sapphire color, railing channels, stone basins, blue-to-noonday shift) +0.7. Total ~8.6 from base 3.0, but another elevated structure with moisture could serve with moderate edits −0.8 → mid-7s. Essential but not wholly unique.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last fish is caught" anchors the story's stakes: the mage has carried the bell for three days since the final haul, and the repair's urgency stems from the village's empty holds and silence. The ending notes "that evening" and "by morning" when boats return, confirming the timeline. Setup signal +0.7; two beats (three-day carry, evening/morning return) +0.9; causal pressure (the fish-famine drives the imbalance and repair urgency) +1.0; closure linkage (the fish return, confirming the imbalance righted) +0.8. Total ~6.4 from base 3.0, but the time pressure is context rather than live ticking clock −0.3 → low-6s. Functional frame, not indispensable constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to right a cosmic imbalance" is stated explicitly in the first paragraph: the silence created an imbalance that needs mending, and the motivation burns in the mage with surprising warmth. This desire drives his repair attempt and closure commitment (ringing the bell to keep the village tethered). Setup signal +0.8; two beats (repair, ongoing ringing) +0.9; causal pressure (the imbalance drives all action) +1.2; closure linkage (the imbalance is righted, fish return) +1.0; cost connection (hours, thin magic, ongoing station) +0.5. Total ~7.4 from base 3.0, but the motivation is told more than dramatized in conflicted choices −0.3 → low-7s. Clear and essential, but not fully embodied under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Plausible impossibility" as tone: the story balances magical repair (lukewarm-infused droplets healing metal) with grounded physical detail (dripping rates, crack narrowing by fractions, hours of work). The viaduct's inner blue glow and the bell absorbing sapphire light read as wondrous yet anchored in the story's logic. Tone is coherent across beats and modulates with pressure (patient observation → aching labor → ringing wonder). Setup +0.6; development (repair sequence balances magic and physics) +0.9; closure linkage (the bell's voice carries both transformation and patience) +1.0; specificity (sapphire glow, faint inner light, fish abundance as earned result) +0.6. Total ~6.1 from base 3.0, but the tonal label is not taught explicitly and relies on inference +0.7 → mid-to-high 6s. Coherent and purposeful, not indispensable.</comment>
