<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's trajectory from pyramid-scheme survivor to quantum-promise witness is motivated, but the transformation at the mushroom farm feels under-earned—her shift from total distrust to tears of belief lacks sufficient on-page friction. The "virtuously mischievous" trait is asserted but never constrains a choice with visible cost. Interior voice is distinct (the coffee-can detail, the mark's-eye view), yet the final epiphany arrives without dramatized resistance, lowering the cost legibility of her arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates glitchy texts, grandmother's bolt, mushroom-farm wonder, and parallel-Maya encounter toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "promises could become something true"). Cost is implied rather than felt—no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift ties the bolt's glow to a price Maya pays. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately; the closure image reweights her premise, but the cost remains conceptual and oblique, preventing higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vividly rendered ("blue-green twilight," "frozen waterfalls") and the bolt returns with tactile presence ("threads digging into her skin like tiny teeth"). The farm constrains her path and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate materially. Minor: the farm's interior layout and the "third junction" appear without earlier spatial setup, creating a brief choreography gap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Maya trust a promise again? The glitchy texts complicate, the farm deepens, but no reversal narrows options—she walks in, witnesses, and exits lighter without a visible trade-off. The "quantum promise" manifests passively; Maya's only agency is to show up and cry. Under Accumulative lens one deepening suffices, yet the cost of belief is told ("feeling lighter") rather than paid in action or renunciation, capping escalation credit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—promises as traps vs. transformative potential—emerges from the pyramid-scheme backstory and the bolt's metaphorical shift from "carbon of broken expectations" to "something precious." The final image offers a non-literal answer but leans heavily on direct thematic statement ("this time the promise was becoming something true") rather than letting particulars resonate. The "diamonds forming from pressure" conceit is apt but slightly overwrought, nudging toward overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single-POV voice is consistent and textured ("virtuously mischievous by nature," "seductive pull toward possibility"). The parallel-Maya dialogue carries interference effect ("her voice crackled") but risks convenience—she articulates the thematic thesis with minimal subtext. Filter verbs are sparse; psychic distance is stable. The piece avoids head-hopping but drifts toward elevate-register metaphor ("concepts become physical," "quantum promise") that slightly exceeds Maya's established idiom under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "promises could be traps, beautiful lies dressed in the language of hope" front-loads abstract thesis, "the way her grandmother must have felt...the way Maya herself felt now" is paraphrase loop, and "the bolt sat cold and ordinary...but something had changed" restates without added pressure. Template cadence: "she should have / she found herself / she grabbed / she wondered" in paragraph two. Figurative density ("frozen waterfalls," "heartbeat beneath the surface," "taste like anticipation and copper") in the climax muddies rather than sharpens. Deductions: −0.6 loop/scaffold, −0.4 density, −0.3 cadence = baseline ~5.9; artifacts touch closure (final paragraph restatement), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Core premise—quantum promise across dimensions—feels template sci-fi without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The pyramid-scheme survivor angle adds specificity, but the mushroom-farm setting and parallel-self encounter read as convenience staging rather than inevitable synthesis. The bolt's symbolic role (pressure → diamonds) is functional but not fresh. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −0.8 within Q8 for widely used parallel-dimension trope without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya's survivor status frames her distrust and is seeded early, but her only on-page choice is to drive to the farm and witness—observation without a decision that alters tactics. The backstory motivates but does not constrain a middle beat with cost. Present in setup and thematically at closure, missing development gate: cap 4.6; swappable with "betrayed lover" or similar without major edits: −0.4 = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bolt appears early (coffee can, grandmother's war story), returns in transit (cold, threads like teeth), and transforms at climax (glowing, translucent). Three beats, causal involvement (she brings it as instructed), closure linkage (the glow charges the promise's manifestation). Cost tie is indirect—bolt is a prop for the ritual, not a forfeiture. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure +1.0, irreplaceability +0.3, no visible price tied to its loss −0.4 = ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Quantum promise is named in the glitchy text, discussed by parallel-Maya, and manifests in the climax. It shapes the dominant stake (can promises be trusted?) but does so thematically rather than through tactical constraint—Maya does not choose between competing promise-forms or pay a price to manifest it. Setup +0.5, closure participation +1.0, label-only in middle beats −0.3, no causal pressure narrowing options −0.5 = ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Virtuously mischievous" is asserted twice but never drives a choice—Maya's decision to investigate is framed as learned caution ("choose which risks to take"), not mischief. Label-only, no on-page tradeoff where the trait enables or costs. Ornamental: cap 2.9, −0.1 for synonym drift = 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Volunteer" is thematized ("learned that word meant...exploitation") but Maya explicitly does not volunteer—she finds herself walking in anyway. The action is negated rather than enacted. Present in reflection, absent in deed; swappable with "accept invitation" or "submit" without structural change. Setup +0.3, no beat involvement, theme claim −0.3, negation contradicts prompt = 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Glitchy texts appear early (3:47 AM, "QUANTUM PROMISE MANIFESTING SOON," knowledge of the bolt), recur as motivation to drive to the farm, but their cross-dimensional mechanics do not shape Maya's tactics at the farm—she waits passively. Method seeds expectation but does not constrain middle choices. Setup +0.6, one beat (decision to go) +0.4, no closure mechanics −0.2, swappable with "dream" or "vision" −0.4 = 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mushroom farm is vividly rendered, appears in two-thirds of the text, and supplies the ritual space where the promise manifests—environment enables the climax. Blue-green bioluminescence, third junction, and fungal canopy are specific and charged. Setup +0.6, two beats (entry, climax) +0.9, closure space +1.2, specificity +0.5, no tactical constraint in middle (Maya simply arrives) −0.1 = 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"When concepts become physical" is stated as the farm's property and illustrated in the bolt's glow, but time pressure is absent—Maya does not race a deadline or choose between competing windows. Timeframe is thematic framing, not a ticking clock. Setup +0.3, closure image (manifestation happens) +0.8, no tactical urgency −0.3, summary-only −0.3 = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Translating pressure into diamonds is the story's central metaphor, seeded in the pyramid-scheme damage and paid off in the bolt's transformation. Maya's desire to believe again is dramatized through tears, but the choice to witness is passive—no conflicted decision where want and cost friction on the page. Setup +0.5, closure payoff +1.1, thematic rather than tactical −0.3, no visible forfeiture −0.5 = 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Shadowseam wonder"—liminal, eerie hope—is consistent through the glitchy texts, blue-green farm, and parallel-Maya encounter. Tone modulates from distrust to tears, charging the final image. No static mood; coherent through turns. Setup +0.6, closure modulation +1.2, pervasive texture +0.8, some overwrought metaphor muddies wonder ("frozen waterfalls," "heartbeat beneath the surface") −0.2 = 6.4.</comment>
