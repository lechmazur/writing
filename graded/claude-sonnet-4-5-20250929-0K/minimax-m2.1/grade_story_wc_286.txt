<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is richly textured and character-particular ("phototropic to kindness," clay memory), with embodied perception throughout. However, the protagonist remains largely observational; her choices (walking three days, picking up the lantern, sitting to look through it) do not demonstrate contradictory impulses acting simultaneously or high-stakes internal conflict. The final decision to take the lantern home feels stated rather than dramatized with visible cost that forecloses a path. The potter framing bracket is elegant but does not advance agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Mira, oasis, three-day journey) arrive cleanly within the first third. The piece accumulates density through layered imagery (clay, beekeepers, timelines, lantern thrum) and achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Mira internalizes the oasis's "stubborn green" as a carried frequency. Cost is conceptual and felt—she understands gentleness as sharp, persistent—but the final paragraph's thematic articulation ("would take… would set… would let") operates in future intention rather than on-page action, softening immediacy. One meaningful deepening is present; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The oasis (stone walls, well, dust, scorched wasteland) is vivid and purposeful, anchoring Mira's quest and supplying the lantern glass. Sensory detail is selective and layered (flattened smoke, honeyed vibration, clouded glass), filtered through Mira's perceptual priorities. The lantern glass functions as micro-setting, constraining her grip and charging the final image with its thrum. Spatial choreography is clear; the setting's resistance to fire directly mirrors theme. No occupational depth issues at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding why places resist change. The journey and discovery provide one meaningful deepening—Mira perceives fractured timelines and realizes gentleness can be "sharp enough to cut through any timeline." However, escalation is primarily perceptual; no on-page reversal forces a difficult choice or forecloses an option with visible cost. The lantern's thrum and Mira's phototropic response create coherent pressure, but the final beat recounts future intention rather than immediate agency. Cost is conceptual (carrying the oasis inside her) rather than a live tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—gentleness as persistence, memory as resistance—emerges organically from beekeepers' kindness, the oasis's refusal to burn, and Mira's phototropic nature. The lantern glass recurs with reweighted meaning (patient waiting → active frequency), and the final image ("stubborn green inside her like a secret glaze") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: the penultimate paragraph ("some places resisted change because…") edges toward thematic statement rather than letting image carry full weight. No overt moralizing, and the conceptual cost is legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices through touch, light, and craft metaphors. Diction ("honeyed vibration," "sigh that had lost its fire") is purposeful and consistent. Psychic distance contracts during the lantern encounter, appropriately intimate. Minor artifact: "phototropic to kindness, had been since birth" reads as brief exposition that could anchor more concretely in a present cue. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("she found," "she felt") are voice-motivated. Rhythm modulates with the scene's contemplative pacing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("clay remembered everything," "smoke… like a sigh," "timelines stacked like plates in a kiln") and occasionally risks overwriting without pattern-teaching or payoff—most metaphors are craft-adjacent but cluster heavily in contemplative beats. Paraphrase loop in paragraph four: "The answer… was not in the land… but in the accumulated kindness" restates the theme already implied. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph ("would take… would set… would let"), reducing propulsion. Sentence openings vary; no clarity breaks. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty, others linger.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of potter + fractured timelines + phototropic trait + beekeeping oasis is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template fantasy or crisis plots. The gentleness-as-sharpness inversion and the oasis as fixed point in burning wasteland offer fresh angles. However, the "zen-minded artisan journeys to mystical ruin and gains insight" frame is familiar, and the story does not fully transform it through bold risk or lived conflict. Emotional truth is present but contemplative throughout; no high-stakes choice tests the premise under pressure. Proximity to lyric essay rather than dramatized fiction lowers ingenuity slightly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her craft lens filters all perception (setup, development). She makes low-stakes choices (walking, picking up the lantern, sitting) but no pivotal decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. The final beat recounts future intention ("would take… would set… would let") rather than on-page action. Observation dominates; the potter trait shapes voice but not high-pressure agency. Present in closure as future plan, not causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lantern glass is introduced mid-scene (paragraph three, within first third), handled physically (picked up, held to light), and its thrum recurs in two distinct beats with evolving meaning (matching heartbeat, then conveying understanding). It appears in the final paragraph as an object Mira will carry forward, reweighted as "patient thrum" and frequency shaper. However, it does not constrain a difficult choice or enable a tactic under stress; its role is primarily symbolic and perceptual. Two-beat involvement and closure presence lift it into mid-band; lack of causal pressure or visible cost caps higher range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Fractured timelines are introduced in paragraph two, described in paragraph five ("overlapping in harmonies"), and implied in the final understanding. The concept frames the oasis's mystery (setup) and Mira's realization (payoff), but does not change on-page tactics or force a choice with cost. It functions more as thematic backdrop than causal engine; no beat depends on navigating or altering timeline mechanics. Present across the arc but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Phototropic to kindness" is introduced in paragraph three with backstory ("had been since birth"), filters Mira's perception of the lantern's thrum (adjusting grip, "offering rather than taking"), and motivates her resonance with the beekeepers' gentleness. However, the trait does not constrain a choice or create visible tradeoff on the page; it colors interiority but does not force a decision between competing goods or impose cost. Label-heavy mention ("phototropic to kindness" appears once as exposition) and summary-only use lower integration. Present in middle beat (lantern handling) and implied at closure, but swappable with "drawn to gentleness" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The lantern's thrum appears in two beats: first when Mira picks it up (matching her heartbeat, changing pitch with her grip), then when she understands its message (paragraph six). The action conveys information (gentleness as frequency) and charges the final image (continuing thrum in her workshop), but does not drive a major turn or redefine options. It is specific and tied to the lantern's identity, yet the story's resolution—Mira's understanding—could occur through visual perception or texture without fundamental structural loss. Early signal, two-beat involvement, closure linkage; moderate causal pressure; some swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Sun patterns are mentioned once in paragraph one ("following sun patterns the way her grandmother had taught her—rise, peak, descend") as backstory method for Mira's journey, then never return or shape on-page tactics. The method does not constrain navigation, force a choice, or reappear at closure. Setup only; no development or payoff. Easily replaced with "following her grandmother's directions" or "reading the stars."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The oasis is introduced early (paragraph one), anchors the quest, supplies the lantern glass (resource), and its "stubborn green" becomes the final image Mira internalizes. The setting's refusal to burn despite surrounding fire directly embodies theme (resistance, gentleness as persistence) and motivates Mira's investigation. The well, ruins, and dust constrain where she sits and what she finds. Strong setup, development (discovery beat), and payoff (carried inside her). No swappability; the oasis's specific resistance is indispensable to story logic and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"As chimney smoke flattens" appears in paragraph two, signaling Mira's arrival at "the right moment—the precise hours when the barrier between times grew thin." The timeframe is mentioned again in paragraph five ("flattening smoke painted the sky") but does not impose a live clock or tighten decisions. Mira sits and contemplates without urgency; no countdown or tactical shift. Setup and cameo at closure image; no development pressure. Swappable with "at dusk" or "as light fades."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation to understand resistance to change is stated in paragraph four, implied by Mira's three-day journey (paragraph one), and answered in paragraphs four and six (accumulated kindness, gentleness as sharpness). It frames the quest and shapes the thematic resolution. However, the desire is not dramatized through conflicted choice or friction between want and cost on the page; Mira observes, realizes, and plans future action without on-page struggle. Setup, thematic development, and closure participation present; told more than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tone blends contemplative gentleness (Mira's phototropic nature, patient observation, slow movements) with sharp imagery ("gentleness could be sharp enough to cut," scorched wasteland, fire). Diction like "honeyed vibration," "stubborn defiance," and "secret glaze" sustain the paradox. Tone is coherent through turns and charges the final image ("carried its stubborn green inside her"). However, the piece remains in one contemplative register throughout; no modulation under pressure since stakes stay low. Strong setup and closure linkage; moderate development.</comment>
