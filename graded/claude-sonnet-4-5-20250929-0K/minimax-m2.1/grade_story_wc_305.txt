<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's contemplative interiority is consistent and her forgiveness decision is earned through dramatized climbing and reflection. However, the final epiphany about contentment-as-process arrives through extended abstract reflection rather than a scene choice that forecloses options with visible cost. The brother Aldric exists only in summary; his presence might have created crucible pressure. Internal contradiction is present (searching despite peace) but the resolution feels conceptually tidy rather than embodied in a difficult micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure. The piece opens with clear anchors (grotto, Elara, hairpin) and accumulates through reflection on forgiveness → searching → climbing → epiphany. The CR ("contentment was not a destination...the cycle itself") reweights the premise, but the cost is conceptual and oblique—no concrete path is foreclosed on the page, only an understanding shifts. The piece teaches its reflective pattern early and holds it, but the final beat lacks the felt or visible price that would elevate closure from insight to sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The grotto's particulars (limestone arches, storm clouds beneath, mist-fed succulents, ash tree) are vivid and purposeful. The scallop cloud formation charges the final recognition. The tree functions as micro-setting that enables Elara's thinking and constrains her physically ("branches thinned to twigs"). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting directly enables the climactic realization, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but sensory density remains visual-dominant and the grotto's pressures are more symbolic than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding the source of contentment. The searching is signaled early and deepens through repeated climbs. However, the escalation is reflective rather than action-driven—no live option is tested and abandoned under pressure. The "hollowness" is told, not dramatized through a failed attempt or sacrificed alternative. The final insight reconfigures understanding but doesn't narrow tactical options or force a trade-off with on-page cost. One meaningful deepening is present but agency remains contemplative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme (impermanence, presence, cyclical care) emerges organically from the grotto-tending, forgiveness arc, and climbing pattern. The scallop hairpin and cloud formation create a purposeful image-braid. The final insight resists overt moralizing yet the phrasing "not permanence, but presence; not arrival, but the continuous, sacred act of arriving" edges toward thesis statement. The theme is conceptually clear but the particulars (luminescent flowers, mist) remain somewhat ornamental rather than constraining choices that test the theme under pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct contemplative register. Perceptual signature is consistent (mist, clouds, light, silence). The prose modulates effectively between action ("climbed higher than she ever had") and reflection without head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated philosophical register ("the continuous, sacred act of arriving") that feels authorial rather than character-organic. No dialogue present to assess, appropriately for the solitary mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. Opening anchors effectively; final image recycles the hairpin with reweighted meaning. However, the piece contains light paraphrase loops: "contentment was not a destination. It was the cycle itself. The tending was the point. The caring was the reward" restates the same insight across four sentences without added pressure (−0.3). "The moment-to-moment work of nurturing what could not nurture itself—that was the source" repeats the pattern. Figurative language is controlled but occasionally stacks ("vineyard hush," "golden light," "quiet fullness") without clear pattern payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The grotto-above-clouds and mist-fed garden offer fresh spatial specificity. The forgiveness-then-searching structure avoids template revenge or reconciliation arcs. However, the core insight (contentment-as-journey not destination; caring-as-reward) is a widely used contemplative resolution. The scallop motif (hairpin/cloud) is purposeful but the epiphany arrives through reflection rather than an unexpected synthesis of prior particulars. Emotional truth is present but the thematic territory feels familiar, and the piece does not transform it through bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her committed caretaking frames all action. Her choice to forgive Aldric is recounted (beat 1, past). Her decision to climb repeatedly drives the search (beats 2–3). Her final hand-placement on flowers is a small enacted choice but doesn't alter tactics. Two gates met (setup, middle); closure participation is gestural rather than causal. Early signal +0.6; two beats +0.9; closure linkage weak +0.2; swappable with "devoted gardener" −0.5. Total guidance: ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The hairpin appears in paragraph 1 (setup), is worn daily (passive middle), and catches light in the final paragraph (closure reprise). Three gates met but only the final mention carries reweighted meaning ("gleaming with a warmth that seemed to come from within"). No mid-story beat where the hairpin constrains a choice or alters tactics. Early signal +0.6; closure linkage (lyric reprise) +0.7; ornamental middle use −0.6; swappable with any keepsake −0.4. Total guidance: ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Rebirth/cycle is named in the climactic paragraph ("The cycle of rebirth had been her framework") and the resolution hinges on reinterpreting it. Setup implicit in garden-tending and forgiveness. Development: the searching represents misunderstanding the cycle. Closure: epiphany redefines it. Two gates clear (middle, closure). Early signal weak (not named until late) −0.4; closure linkage strong +1.2; concept shapes final understanding but doesn't alter tactics on the page −0.3; swappable with "impermanence" or "flow" −0.5. Total guidance: ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Kindly decisive" is demonstrated in forgiving Aldric (kindly) and descending to grant it (decisive), both recounted. No middle beat where this trait constrains or enables a present choice with cost. Closure: hand placement is gentle but not a decisive fork. One gate (setup via backstory). Early signal (backstory) +0.3; one beat (past) +0.4; label-only in present −0.5; swappable with "compassionate steady" −0.6. Total guidance: ~3.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Scallop" appears as hairpin shape (paragraph 1) and cloud pattern (paragraph 4, the recognition trigger). The cloud scallop enables the epiphany but the action itself is noticing, not scalloping. No tactile scallop act on the page. One gate (closure). Late first thematic appearance (60% mark) −0.5; closure linkage (image recognition) +0.9; ornamental object description −0.6; easily swappable with any symbolic shape −0.7. Total guidance: ~2.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Climbing trees is signaled in paragraph 2 (past: climbed ash tree to forgive), repeated in paragraph 3 (began climbing for clarity of spirit), and peaks in paragraph 4 (climbed higher than ever, epiphany at top). Three gates met. The method directly enables the final realization and the physical constraint (branches thin to twigs) charges the moment. Early signal +0.7; three beats +1.4; causal pressure (thinking requires height) +1.0; closure linkage +1.2; irreplaceable (grotto's verticality) +0.6. Total guidance: ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Grotto setup in paragraph 1 with specific detail (limestone arches, clouds beneath, mist-fed plants). Middle: provides the ash tree Elara climbs and the scallop cloud formation. Closure: "umbral grotto" named in final paragraphs; the garden's "heart" is the action site. Three gates met. The verticality enables the method and the scallop cloud triggers insight, but the grotto doesn't constrain a choice (Elara could think anywhere). Early signal +0.7; two beats +0.9; closure presence +0.4; causal pressure (supplies tree/cloud) +0.8; swappable with any remote garden −0.6. Total guidance: ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Timeframe "after forgiving the unforgivable" is explicit in paragraph 2. The "three seasons past" and "seven cycles" anchor duration. The searching spans unspecified time until "the morning of the harvest moon" triggers resolution. Two gates (setup, closure). Time doesn't tighten decisions—Elara can climb indefinitely without cost. Early signal +0.6; closure participation (harvest moon) +0.5; one middle beat (cycles of searching) +0.4; no tactical pressure (no deadline) −0.3; swappable with "after achieving peace" −0.5. Total guidance: ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation "to find the source of contentment" is named in paragraph 3 and drives all subsequent climbing and reflection. Setup clear; middle beats (repeated climbs) enact the search; closure delivers the answer. Three gates met. The desire is told ("searching for something she could not name") more than dramatized through failed attempts. Early signal +0.7; three beats +1.4; closure linkage (answer found) +1.3; friction between peace and hollowness +0.5; summary-only searching −0.6; swappable with "seeking purpose" −0.5. Total guidance: ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Vineyard hush" appears twice: paragraph 4 ("vineyard hush of that impossible height") and final paragraph ("The vineyard hush settled over the garden"). Two gates (middle, closure). The tone is quiet contemplative throughout, modulating slightly with the epiphany's warmth. Setup weak (not named early) −0.3; closure reprise +0.9; coherent mood +0.5; charges final image +0.6; static (no pressure-driven shift) −0.4; swappable with "sacred stillness" −0.5. Total guidance: ~5.7.</comment>
