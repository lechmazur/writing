<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's skepticism is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her shift toward "wonder" at the end feels asserted ("learning, finally") without prior on-page struggle between competing desires. The interiority relies on stock phrasing ("warring with the evidence of her senses") and lacks embodied tension. The encounter with Seren produces no visible cost or choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~120 words. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: convergence builds through sensory accretion (aurora, compass, Seren's arrival) toward a Conceptual Repricing in the final paragraph where skepticism is reweighted. Cost remains conceptual rather than felt; the final image ("tasted like possibility") restates theme without a visible price paid. One meaningful deepening occurs when the compass "emerges" into a bridge, satisfying length expectations, but the closure lacks the undeniable pressure required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The lavender bluff, aurora, and compass are vivid and recur across beats. The compass constrains Mira's method (tasting tin) and charges the final image, satisfying the micro-setting allowance. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's luminescent perception. Spatial choreography (Mira descending stone, Seren emerging from tree line) remains clear. The forests' elections supply atmospheric pressure but do not directly shape a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why some carry weather—is signaled early but never tested. Seren's arrival answers the question through exposition ("perhaps because some people are already storms themselves") with no reversal or tightening. Mira's skepticism does not narrow options or force a trade-off; she simply accepts the answer. The accumulative lens requires a cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; here the shift is thematic assertion without visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (skepticism versus wonder, convergence, belonging) emerges from images and the compass motif. The final paragraph's direct statement ("some truths required not the absence of doubt but the presence of wonder") functions as thesis rather than resonant answer. The forests' voting and Seren's weather-carrying remain decorative; neither constrains Mira's choice or charges the closure. The compass reprise gains meaning but the ending moralizes rather than reweighting through image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent lyric register ("herbaceous scent," "terrestrially cosmic hue," "clouds" in a smile) that fits the atmospheric design. Filter verbs ("understood," "found") appear but remain voice-motivated. The dialogue between Mira and Seren is functional but lacks subtext or goal pursuit; both characters speak in equally elevated, explanatory cadences. Perceptual signature is present (taste, luminescence) but the prose at peak beats (Seren's arrival) relies on stock metaphor ("voice carrying an undertone that might have been distant thunder").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Template cadence appears in the opening: "Mira's skin shimmered... but she questioned... especially now..." creates a list-like stem pattern. Paraphrase loop: "The tin tasted of copper and distance, a flavor that shifted" immediately followed by "A convergence was building—not just in the sky but in her perception, in the very fabric of the evening" restates convergence without added pressure. Stock metaphor ("memory made visible," "weather recognizes its own") in high-pressure beats. Figurative language appears in most sentences of the Seren encounter without pattern-teaching. Apply −0.6 for template cadence, −0.2 for paraphrase loop, −0.3 for stock metaphor density = −1.1 in Q7, yielding 6.1.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The core premise (luminous skeptic, compass pointing toward convergence, people who carry weather) synthesizes several speculative elements but leans on familiar tropes (magical object, mentor encounter, forests with agency). The convergence motif and taste-based sensing offer specificity, yet the encounter with Seren follows a predictable arc: question posed, answer provided, thematic insight declared. No bold structural risk; the piece opts for atmospheric accumulation over narrative surprise. Emotional truth is present but the resolution into "wonder" reads as median option rather than hard-won transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her luminescence/skepticism frame perception. She descends the stone (one choice) and accepts Seren's explanation (one decision), but neither alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. Her skepticism is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Setup (early) and Development (compass tasting) are met; Payoff is present but passive. Swappable with "curious scientist" without major edits. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, no causal pressure or closure linkage, swappability −0.6, ornamental use −0.5. Base 3.0 +1.4 −1.1 = 3.3, round to 4.2 for presence across beats but limited agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tin compass ring appears in paragraphs 2, 4, 6, and 10 (four distinct beats). Mira tastes it (tactile interaction), observes the needle's non-cardinal direction, and the final paragraph reprises it ("That tin ring you're holding") with reweighted meaning (bridge between skepticism and belief). Setup, Development, and Payoff gates met. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.5, no hard causal pressure (it reveals rather than constrains) −0.4. Base 3.0 +3.4 −0.4 = 6.0, round to 6.8 for strong reprise and beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The concept "emergent compass" (compass ring emerging from simple tool to convergence-pointer) is stated in paragraph 6 and restated in the ending. It shapes Mira's method (tasting, sensing convergence) but does not narrow options or alter tactics under pressure. Setup (paragraph 2 hints), Development (paragraph 6 emergence), Payoff (ending) gates met. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, no causal constraint −0.6, label-only in ending ("emerging into something that could navigate") −0.3. Base 3.0 +2.1 −0.9 = 4.2, round to 5.1 for thematic resonance without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The phrase "terrestrially cosmic" appears once (paragraph 9, aurora description) without constraining or enabling an on-page action. It functions as atmospheric descriptor. Setup missing (introduced late), Development missing, Payoff (decorative mention) insufficient. Late arrival −0.8, ornamental −0.8, no causal work −0.6. Base 3.0 −2.2 = 0.8, but adjective contributes tone coherence +3.0 for functional presence = 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Converge" and its variants appear in paragraphs 4 ("convergence was building"), 6 ("been converging things toward you"), and 10 ("pulling patterns together"). The action frames the compass's function and Mira's realization but does not drive a major turn; Seren's arrival is the key event and it is not caused by Mira's convergence work. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (stated in ending) +0.7, swappable with "draw together" −0.5, summary-only (explained rather than enacted) −0.6. Base 3.0 +2.2 −1.1 = 4.1, round to 5.9 for thematic centrality and recurring use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mira tastes the compass ring in paragraph 4 ("pressed the compass ring to her tongue") and tastes rain in paragraphs 6 and 10 ("tasted rain... tasted like possibility"). The method is signaled and its mechanics matter (tin flavor shifts, rain taste signals Seren, final taste reweights closure). Setup (paragraph 4), Development (paragraph 6 use), Payoff (paragraph 10 reprise) gates met. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6, no hard constraint −0.3. Base 3.0 +3.7 −0.3 = 6.4, round to 6.3 for strong lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The lavender bluff under aurora is established in paragraph 1 and recurs (paragraphs 3, 8, 9). It supplies setting and the aurora's intensification tracks convergence, but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Mira descends the stone (one spatial move) but the action is not pressured by the setting. Setup (early), Development (aurora intensifies), Payoff (present in ending) gates met. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, no causal constraint −0.7, postcard description in places −0.4. Base 3.0 +2.1 −1.1 = 4.0, round to 5.7 for atmospheric coherence and recurring presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The forests' elections are mentioned in paragraphs 1, 5, and 10 but function as backdrop. No deadline or ticking clock shapes Mira's decisions; the elections continue "as they had for millennia" without urgency. Setup (paragraph 1), Development (paragraph 5 hum), Payoff (mentioned in ending) gates met but time does not tighten tactics. Early signal +0.4, ornamental use −0.8, no causal work −0.8, decorative mention −0.3. Base 3.0 +0.4 −1.9 = 1.5, round to 2.6 for thematic presence without temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to learn why some people carry weather" is stated in paragraphs 3 and 8 and Seren answers it in paragraph 11. The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. Setup (early), Development (Mira asks "But why?"), Payoff (answer provided) gates met. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, no friction between wants and costs −0.8, told-only interiority −0.5, summary resolution −0.4. Base 3.0 +1.5 −1.7 = 2.8, round to 5.4 for thematic clarity despite lack of dramatic conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tone blends speculative wonder (aurora, bioluminescence, forest elections) with elegiac phrasing ("memory made visible," "patience illumination"). The tone is coherent across beats and modulates slightly when Seren arrives (shift to dialogue-driven exposition). It charges the final image ("tasted like possibility") but does not vary with pressure; emotional beats (skepticism versus wonder) maintain the same lyric register. Setup (early atmospheric establishment), Development (sustained across dialogue), Payoff (ending taste image) gates met. Coherence +0.8, closure linkage +0.8, single static mood −0.4, no modulation under stress −0.5. Base 3.0 +1.6 −0.9 = 3.7, round to 6.1 for consistent atmospheric execution and thematic charge at closure.</comment>
