<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation to reach the lagoon is clear and her grief/wonder mixture is embodied, but her agency at closure is passive—she witnesses her grandmother's apparition and receives information rather than making a difficult choice. The grandmother's crystalline appearance and the "parley" feel externally delivered rather than earned through Miriam's struggle. Interior contradiction is minimal; she moves from desire to revelation without genuine conflict that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story layers memory, encoded messages, and setting toward a final encounter. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the grandmother's message delivered), but the cost remains abstract—"someone who would remember"—without on-page forfeiture or altered options. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph. The sequence progresses through discovery → transit → arrival → revelation, but the final beat feels delivered rather than crystallized through protagonist choice, limiting closure charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The zeppelin, obsidian lagoon, and arranged beach debris are vivid and purposeful. The lagoon's stillness and the cipher made of shells/driftwood constrain Miriam's approach and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective—"black water," "salt of ancient tears," "crystalline" apparition—and filtered through Miriam's POV. The zeppelin as floating library supplies atmospheric pressure but does not alter tactics at closure, keeping this in mid-7s rather than higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering her grandmother's truth—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The tightening occurs when Miriam deciphers the diary and descends to the lagoon, but the resolution is delivered by the grandmother's apparition rather than Miriam's agency. No on-page reversal or trade-off; the parley succeeded off-stage, and Miriam becomes a passive witness. The cost of "remembering when all others had forgotten" is declared but not felt in forfeited options or visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory, witnessing, and deferred truth emerges organically from the encrypted diary and temporal prison. The final image of Miriam as witness offers a non-literal answer to "what survives when power erases," but the grandmother's speech—"the terms required a witness"—edges toward thematic statement rather than embodied resonance. The obsidian lagoon and beach cipher carry symbolic weight without forced recurrence. Subtext operates in the "parley" and "temporal bondage," though the ending leans explanatory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent—"searing mixture of grief and wonder," "mechanical lullaby," "crystalline"—matching Miriam's scholarly lens. Psychic distance is controlled. The grandmother's dialogue at closure ("powers beyond human understanding," "temporal bondage") shifts into expository register, slightly diluting voice under peak pressure. Perceptual signature is present in the way Miriam notices cipher patterns and archival details, lending character-specific texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and propulsion is steady through the descent sequence. No loops or synonym churn. Line-level clarity is high. Minor overwriting: "that searing mixture of grief and wonder that had defined her entire adult life" stacks modifiers at a reflective beat; "crystalline, each memory preserved in perfect clarity like an insect trapped in amber" layers metaphor without added pressure. Filter verbs ("felt the weight," "saw her grandmother rising") appear but do not stack densely. Information density is moderate; some sentences could do more than one job.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The encrypted diary, temporal prison, and zeppelin setting offer a fresh synthesis, but the core arc—descendant uncovers ancestor's secret sacrifice—is a familiar template. The "parley with powers beyond understanding" and "retrocognitively trapped" labels gesture toward originality without grounding those concepts in specific, verifiable constraint. The obsidian lagoon and beach-debris cipher are vivid particulars, but the grandmother's exposition at closure ("negotiations," "temporal bondage") resolves through summary rather than earned surprise. Transformation is partial; the emotional truth of archival grief is present but the plot mechanics feel assembled.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Miriam is present throughout and her choice to descend is legible, but at closure she witnesses rather than decides. Her role as archivist frames her lens (recognizing cipher, valuing documentation) but does not constrain tactics or force a trade-off. Setup and development are clear; closure participation is passive observation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is seeded in paragraph one, functions as destination and threshold in the descent, and hosts the final apparition. Its black water and stillness charge the ending image. It does not constrain a mid-story choice or evolve across beats; it remains a static destination. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The encrypted diary drives the story's premise and Miriam's journey. It appears early, shapes her nightly decipherment work, and the messages it contains justify her descent. At closure, the diary recedes; the grandmother's speech delivers new information not encoded in the diary. Setup and development are strong; closure linkage is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is label-only exposition; the grandmother was "caught in a loop of memory" but the mechanics and cost are told rather than shown. No on-page constraint or visible price tied to this trait during the story's present action. It motivates backstory but does not shape Miriam's choices or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "parley" is referenced as backstory promise and resolved off-stage ("The parley had been successful"). It motivates Miriam's search but does not occur on the page or drive a present-tense turn. The grandmother's speech at closure recounts the parley rather than dramatizing it. Setup is clear; development and payoff are summary.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Arranging beach debris as messages is seeded in grandmother's cipher invention, visually enacted when Miriam kneels to trace shell/driftwood letters, and the act of decoding them charges her approach to the lagoon. The method shapes two beats (diary cipher, beach cipher) and is specific to character. Missing only deeper causal pressure at closure to reach higher.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The zeppelin's floating library is vivid and establishes Miriam's professional world. Captain Voss hands her a spyglass, but the zeppelin does not constrain her choices or alter tactics—it functions as transit. Postcard description ("great airship drifted westward," "massive gasbags gleaming amber") dominates over pressure. Setup and one micro development; no closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Timeframe is anchored: "three weeks ago" for the diary's arrival, "thirty years" of waiting, "descent" and "windless afternoon" mark the present scene. Time is tracked but does not tighten decisions—Miriam's actions are not racing a deadline. The clock is present but passive, shaping sequence rather than urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation to uncover truth is dramatized through Miriam's nightly decipherment, solitary descent, and emotional register ("reverie tightening around her heart"). Friction between grief and wonder is embodied. At closure, the desire is satisfied without visible cost or competing want, limiting tension. Setup, development, and thematic payoff are present; choice-level friction is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Searing reverie" is coherent: elevated diction, contemplative pacing, grief-charged imagery ("salt of ancient tears," "crystalline" memory). Tone modulates slightly from reflective scholarship aboard the zeppelin to charged stillness at the lagoon. The grandmother's expository speech at closure flattens intensity somewhat, but the final image of witness-burden sustains the reverie register. Tone charges the ending without dramatic modulation.</comment>
