<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The keeper exhibits a consistent perceptual signature—laughter as power, light-bending focus—but lacks contradictory impulses in scene. His motives are asserted ("purpose distilled to its purest form") rather than tested through competing desires or visible cost. The ships appear and turn because he laughs and speaks; no on-page choice forecloses a path or reveals hierarchy of values under genuine pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: density builds through recurring motifs (laughter, glass, starlight) and the final image reconfigures the keeper's isolation as gift and burden. However, the closure lacks decisive cost—the ships are saved, the keeper remains unchanged, and no visible price is paid on the page. The RR reads as a mood statement rather than a stance crystallization with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse, glass lantern wick, and star-sea setting constrain the keeper's ritual and charge the final image with purposeful specificity. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("velvet case," "green fire," "black water"). The lighthouse's ancient purpose and post-newspaper timeframe frame the keeper's isolation, though the setting does not force a single pivotal choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—guiding ships to safety—is signaled early but lacks escalation. The three vessels appear in sequence without complication; no reversal or deepening alters tactics. The keeper's laughter and words succeed without resistance, cost, or trade-off. Under the accumulative lens, pressure should tighten through pattern break or cadence shift; instead, the beats loop without meaningful intensification.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the keeper's "accidental prophecy," the extinction of newspapers, isolation as purpose. The final image—"the sky smiled back"—offers a non-literal answer to loneliness and duty without overt moralizing. However, "shaping a new dawn using ancient shadows" verges on thematic statement, and the closing reflection summarizes rather than charging the image with undeniable resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a distinct lyric register with purposeful compression ("dream remembering itself," "held breath"). POV distance is stable; the keeper's perceptual bias filters all detail. Rhythmic control modulates with intensity, and no head-hopping occurs. The voice occasionally slips into abstraction ("purpose distilled," "invisible hand") that dilutes immediacy in peak beats, preventing entry to the high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "he had learned to feed the wick through total internal reflection" is immediately restated as "bending light back upon itself until the glass burned from within." Template cadence in the ship sequence ("The first ship emerged... The second vessel appeared, followed soon by the third") and figurative stacking ("monuments of shadow and hope," "green fire," "shadowed elation") in adjacent lines without pattern payoff trigger −0.6. The closing paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—lighthouse keeper whose laughter and words reshape fate—offers a fresh synthesis of myth and solitude. "Total internal reflection" as metaphor and method adds specificity. However, the core emotional arc (isolated keeper performs duty, reflects on purpose) follows a familiar template. The post-newspaper timeframe and "accidental prophet" angle provide surface distinction but do not transform the arc's predictability. Risk-taking in voice and imagery elevates slightly within band.</comment>
