<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is declared ("turn bitterness into cosmic joke") but never dramatized through conflicting micro-choices under pressure. Amari's transformation is told via static-laden phone exposition rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final step forward reads as symbolic gesture without visible cost or foreclosed path—what does Mira sacrifice or lose by entering the harmony? Interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical language ("frequencies that made the hair rise," "frostbitten hope") rather than character-particular sensory anchors.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear by ~150 words, meeting the test. The closure unit—Mira stepping into the harmony—reads as Charged Poise under a Hybrid lens (causal setup, accumulative imagery at the end), but the cost is implied rather than legible: what option does she foreclose, what price does she pay? The phone-call structure provides causal linkage (Amari's voice triggers the garden's response), yet the final beat substitutes thematic declaration ("becoming the punchline") for embodied consequence. Escalation occurs (garden shifts, creature emerges) but the protagonist's agency in the turn is passive observation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The underground garden's gravitational playfulness (water trickling upward, floating soil) constrains spatial choreography and charges the final image when Mira rises off the ground. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (bioluminescent moss, frost-tasted air), filtered through Mira's scientific lens. The flint arrowhead and cordless phone are handled as tactile anchors. However, the herbalist and the "first peoples" backstory remain expository gestures without spatial or choice pressure, and the creature's emergence from walls lacks clear physical staging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving the cryptid research valid—is signaled early but never tested by a choice that narrows options. Mira's progression is observational: she listens, understands, and steps forward without visible cost or tradeoff. The garden's response and creature's emergence are triggered by Amari's voice (external coincidence) rather than Mira's decision. One tightening occurs when the vines uncoil and gravity intensifies, but this complication resolves into harmony without friction. No live option is foreclosed; the ending grants cosmic revelation without dramatized price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of transforming bitterness into cosmic humor emerges through Amari's arc and the garden's metaphorical resonance. The final image—Mira stepping into the harmony—attempts to reweight skepticism as openness, but the payoff is declared ("You're becoming the punchline") rather than earned through specific, irreversible consequence. Subtext operates in the gravitational playfulness and Amari's fragmented voice, yet the closing beats rely on meta-commentary ("truth, no matter how strange, was worth pursuing") that states the theme rather than dramatizing it. The flint arrowhead and phone return with symbolic charge but no fresh tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a speculative-literary register ("harmony untamed," "frostbitten hope," "cosmic humor") that fits the cryptid-research frame but occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats ("manifestation of pure metamorphosis," "symphony of untamed nature"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; Amari's phone-transmitted lines pursue subtext ("bitterness is just cosmic humor that hasn't found its punchline yet"). Psychic distance compresses cleanly during the garden shift. Minor filter-verb clusters ("felt herself rising," "heard in faculty meetings") dull immediacy in two beats but do not obscure focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Runs of identical syntactic stems appear across adjacent paragraphs ("It was here," "It was said," "This was not," "This was the harmony"). The phrase "missing and had returned changed" recurs three times without added pressure. Figurative language is dense in high-pressure beats ("membrane between worlds," "frequencies of sound and silence," "pure metamorphosis") but several metaphors remain abstract rather than concrete. Information density is moderate; the herbalist's belief and the arrowhead's origin are mentioned but not integrated into action. Overwriting in the final third (stacked modifiers, passive constructions) slows momentum. No severe clarity breaks, but scaffold phrasing and paraphrase loops lower propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The cryptid-researcher premise and "truth hidden beneath the city" frame follow familiar speculative templates without sharp transformation. The gravitational playfulness and bioluminescent garden offer texture, but the emotional arc—skeptic becomes believer via cosmic revelation—resolves predictably. The "bitterness into cosmic joke" motivation provides a fresh angle, yet the payoff declares the transformation rather than enacting it through irreversible choice. Amari's metamorphosis and the phone-as-conduit are intriguing but underexploited; the story tells us he "understood the garden's true purpose" without dramatizing what that understanding costs or enables. No bold structural risk; the two-scene structure (arrival, revelation) is competent but safe.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Amari worked undercover (told in paragraph 5) and his research led to his transformation, but his choices occur off-page. Mira is present but observes rather than decides; her "undercover" role is never dramatized. The character appears in setup and is referenced at closure but does not drive a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The flint arrowhead is introduced in paragraph 3 ("pressed against her chest"), mentioned as a relic sent by Amari, and described with backstory (carved by first peoples). It reappears in the final paragraph as part of the thematic summary but is never handled, used to enable a choice, or reweighted with new meaning. Two beats (introduction, thematic echo) but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Harmony untamed" is named in paragraph 4, drives the garden's gravitational behavior, and structures the creature's emergence and the vines' response to Amari's voice. Mira's final step "into the harmony untamed" provides closure linkage. The concept shapes the setting's physics and the story's stakes (refusing categorization), appearing across three beats with causal and thematic weight, but the cost remains implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Gravitational playfulness is signaled in paragraph 4 (water trickling upward, floating soil), intensifies in paragraph 6 when Mira's feet leave the ground during the phone call, and charges the final image as the garden vibrates in harmony. The trait constrains spatial choreography and enables the creature's manifestation. Present across three beats with visible effect on action and closure, though the cost (what does defying gravity prevent or demand?) is not fully articulated.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" appears in paragraph 2 (Amari "had metamorphosed"), paragraph 7 (creature as "manifestation of pure metamorphosis"), and the penultimate paragraph ("moment when the cryptid became real... the missing returned changed"). The action frames Amari's transformation and the research's shift but does not drive a specific on-page choice by Mira. It operates thematically across the arc but could be replaced with "transform" or "change" without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cordless phone is introduced in the opening line, used in paragraph 2 to establish Amari's calls, and becomes the active conduit in paragraphs 5–6 when his voice triggers the garden's response and the vines uncoil. Mira lowers the phone at closure. Present across four beats; the means matters (the phone's frequency shapes the environment), but its mechanics (why static, why this phone) are never tested or constrained by a problem.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The herbalist's underground garden is established in paragraph 1, its gravitational playfulness detailed in paragraph 4, and it becomes the active stage in paragraph 6 when vines uncoil, gravity intensifies, and the creature emerges from the walls. The setting's physics constrain Mira's movement (her feet leave the ground) and supply the resources (bioluminescent moss, rare herbs, responsive vines) that enable the revelation. Present in setup, middle escalation, and closure; the environment drives tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the missing return changed" frames the story's present (Amari returned three months ago), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a ticking clock. The past (Amari's disappearance, the arrowhead sent before he vanished) is recounted without urgency. The ending's transformation unfolds without time pressure; Mira's choice to step forward is not constrained by a deadline or the risk of losing a fleeting window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke is stated in Amari's phone dialogue (paragraph 5: "bitterness is just cosmic humor that hasn't found its punchline yet") and echoed in Mira's realization (paragraph 8) and the final thematic summary. It shapes the story's stakes (vindicating dismissed research) and informs the tonal arc. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting micro-choices; Mira never faces a moment where bitterness and hope pull her in opposite directions with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Frostbitten hope" is named in paragraph 4 ("the air tasted of frost and possibility, the frostbitten hope") and reprised in the penultimate paragraph as part of the thematic payoff. The tone—cold wonder, guarded optimism—modulates through the garden's shift (vines uncoil, Mira rises) and charges the final image when she steps forward despite uncertainty. Coherent through turns; the ending sustains the mix of frost and hope rather than resolving into easy warmth. Minor: the phrase itself is somewhat abstract, relying on the reader to infer the affective blend.</comment>
