<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's perceptual work is credible and her final resolve reads as internally consistent, but she remains largely observational throughout. The "resolve crystallized" ending announces change rather than dramatizing a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal contradiction is minimal; her shift from cataloger to guardian feels inevitable but lacks an embodied micro-choice under pressure that would lift this into the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors are present early (library, blackout, Mira's role). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (resolve crystallization/Charged Poise) where Mira commits to preserving marginalia truths, but the cost remains conceptual and slightly diffuse—"adding her own annotations" implies future action rather than an on-page forfeiture or pivot that narrows present options. One meaningful deepening (discovery of hidden archive) tightens her understanding, satisfying the lens, though the final image could land harder with a single enacted micro-choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The submerged archive, candlelight, and blackout constrain Mira's perception and discovery method, charging the closure image with "reclaimed stillness." The ink stamp functions as a micro-object that anchors her authentication work and connects past to present. Sensory detail (darkness, density, quiet) is selective and purpose-driven, filtered through her patient attention, and the false panel discovery integrates setting into plot without postcard padding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—tracing honest origins and preserving hidden truths—is signaled early. The blackout and marginalia discovery deepen her understanding, but no on-page reversal forces a trade-off or narrows options with visible cost. Her final commitment is a declaration of intent rather than a decision under competing pressures. One meaningful tightening (pattern recognition) is present, but escalation remains cognitive, not enacted, keeping this mid-band under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—truth preserved through marginal cunning, bureaucracy as shield—emerges organically from the archive's hidden structure and Mira's discovery. The ink stamp and reclaimed stillness accumulate meaning without overt statement. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic declaration ("sanctuary of preserved truths") rather than letting the image carry the weight, and the resolution feels slightly abstract. The central question (how to preserve suppressed knowledge) is answered but lacks the sharp conceptual repricing that would reach 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; Mira's perceptual signature (patient, logical, detail-oriented) is consistent and voice-motivated. Diction is controlled but occasionally drifts into elevated register ("tranquilly perceptive," "construct alternatif hypothesis") that feels writerly rather than internally lived. No dialogue is present. Distance and tense are clean, and the prose reflects her methodical mind, though some constructions ("the quiet had a different quality—a density that suggested presence") edge toward ornamental phrasing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are generally strong, but several constructions loop or restate: "reclaimed stillness" appears three times with minimal reweighting; "honest origins" and "forgotten truths" cycle near-synonymously; "the darkness stripped away" echoes "the blackout had stripped." Template cadence is mild ("she had been," "she had never," "she understood now"). Register occasionally drifts ("construct alternatif hypothesis" mid-thought). No major artifacts obscure closure, but cumulative line-level issues and paraphrase loops lower the score. Apply −0.8 for distinct loop and scaffold issues within the non-closure accumulation cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—hidden archive within bureaucratic marginalia—offers a fresh angle on preservation-under-oppression narratives, and the ink stamp as authentication tool is specific. However, the emotional arc and thematic moves (scholar discovers suppressed truth, vows to continue the work) follow a familiar template without sharp transformation. Mira's discovery feels more like puzzle-solving than high-stakes choice, and the final commitment lacks the bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus that would elevate originality into the 8-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira (logical page indexer) is present throughout and her analytical habit drives the marginalia discovery, satisfying setup and development. However, her final choice is a vow to continue rather than a pivotal on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Present in closure but not causally decisive there, placing her mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The antique ink stamp appears in three beats: pocket presence, notebook impression, comparison to documents. It enables her authentication insight (development) and appears in the closure reflection, reweighted as a symbol of belief in truth. However, its role at closure is more thematic echo than causal lever, and the stamp could be replaced with a similar verification tool. Two-gate with lyric reprise justifies low-6 range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" is introduced early and returned to at closure, shaping Mira's perceptual stance (blackout forces candlelight attention). It influences her method (patient observation) but does not constrain a key choice or narrow options with cost. Lyric reprise without mid-scene causal work places it in the 5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" is asserted twice as a label but never dramatized as a constraint or tradeoff. It describes her existing habit rather than enabling or foreclosing an action under pressure. Label-only use without visible cost keeps this below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Readjust" (her approach to the catalog) is present at setup and triggers the marginalia discovery, a key turn. It enables her shift from routine indexing to pattern recognition. However, the action itself is generic (any review or reconsideration would work) and does not directly shape closure. One strong beat, but swappable mechanics cap it mid-6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Alternative hypothesis" (construct alternatif hypothesis) appears once at the discovery beat, enabling her interpretation of marginalia as deliberate. It signals method and shapes one key turn but is not returned to or tested further. Single-beat causal work justifies low-5 range; its diction awkwardness is noted in Q6/Q7, not re-penalized here.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The forgotten library in the submerged city is present throughout, supplies the archive and false panel (resources), and the blackout constrains her method (candlelight forces closer attention). Setting pressures discovery and charges the closure image (reclaimed stillness of the stacks). Essential across beats and ending, strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The blackout is introduced early, strips artificial light, and forces Mira's candlelit method. It tightens perception and contributes to the "reclaimed stillness" at closure. However, no live clock or urgency escalates; the blackout is a static condition rather than a ticking pressure. Two-gate with thematic charge at closure justifies mid-6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To trace honest origins" is her stated motivation, shapes her cataloging habit, and drives the marginalia investigation. Present in closure as she vows to preserve truths. However, the desire is told more than dramatized through conflicted choice; no visible friction between this want and a competing cost appears on the page. Setup, development, and closure presence with modest causal pressure justifies low-6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" as tone is harder to verify on the page; the prose maintains a measured, contemplative register throughout without sharp modulation under pressure. The ending's "slow certainty of sediment" approximates resolve, and "dappled" might map to the interplay of candlelight and darkness, but the tone does not shift or intensify to charge the final image. Coherent but static, mid-5 range.</comment>
