<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is richly textured with embodied grief and the weight of inherited craft, yet her arc lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The progression from seeking understanding to achieving it feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle—she moves through the greenhouse and arrives at insight without visible internal resistance or cost that forecloses a path. The spectral presence and generational inheritance are evocative but function more as atmospheric backdrop than as pressures forcing difficult micro-choices. Her final understanding is asserted in summary rather than dramatized through a renunciation or endurance with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: details layer toward a resonant final image. However, the closure effect—Elara's understanding of collective grief and her return to the workshop—lacks visible cost; the realization is told rather than made legible through a decisive image or action that reweights prior material. The butterfly migration provides a temporal frame, but no on-page tightening narrows options or forces a trade-off. The ending summarizes thematic arrival without demonstrating what was sacrificed or foreclosed to reach it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—rusting iron, amber light, humid green breath—and filters through Elara's grief-laden perception. The setting actively participates in the ending: the golden light and gathering butterflies charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the environment's evolution from twilight to violet dusk mirrors the emotional arc. Minor: the moss-covered table and flagstone path are mentioned but do not constrain a choice or alter tactics in a way that would push this into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding collective grief before the butterflies depart—is signaled early and held. Yet the escalation is weak: Elara walks, reads, and realizes without encountering resistance or a moment where her agency narrows options. The butterfly departure functions as a deadline but does not tighten her choices; she simply achieves understanding and returns to the workshop. No reversal or tightening forces a trade-off with legible cost. The ending recounts her decision to carve the epitaph tomorrow but does not dramatize the price of that commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—grief as weather, memory as waystation, hands shaping stone—and the piece resists overt moralizing until the final paragraph. The greenhouse and butterfly migration offer concrete anchors for abstract questions. However, the closing lines veer toward theme summary: "the words mattered less than the hands that shaped them" articulates the thesis rather than trusting the image to carry it. The spectral presence and ribbon poems accumulate meaning, but the protagonist's realization is told directly rather than embodied in a final action or image that reweights the question without stating an answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyric and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: "weathered glass," "drumming stillness," "thundering calm." Psychic distance remains stable; Elara's interiority is richly textured without head-hopping. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like "spectral mentorship" and "collective grief," which edge toward academic abstraction. The prose modulates with emotional intensity—shorter beats at the butterfly ascent, longer reflection earlier—but maintains coherence. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply. The voice reads singular and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and many lines carry double duty—sensory detail advances emotional state. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the words mattered less than the hands that shaped them, and the generations of hands before hers that had learned to hold grief like stone" restates the prior clause. Template cadence is visible in repeated "she + verb" stems in the middle third. Figurative language is dense—"humming warmth," "concentrated green breath," "thundering calm"—and occasionally muddles: "thundering calm" itself is a strained oxymoron without clear embodiment. The closure beat is less affected, but the accumulation of artifacts and loops throughout prevents high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and butterfly migration is purposeful and specific, avoiding stock grief-journey templates. The greenhouse as sacred space and the ribbon roll as inherited text offer fresh inflection. However, the protagonist's passive observation and the declarative epiphany trend toward familiar bildungsroman beats. The spectral grandmother and migrating butterflies, while vivid, risk symbolic convenience—both appear to validate Elara's understanding without complicating her path. The piece commits fully to its lyric frame, but the resolution's safety and the lack of a bold, risky choice keep it in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's occupation is established early and surfaces in her observation of the ribbon poems and her plan to carve her grandmother's epitaph. However, the carving itself does not appear on the page; her choice to return to the workshop and carve "tomorrow" is recounted, not dramatized. The craft informs her lens—seeing memory as waystation, words as stone—but does not constrain a choice or drive a turn. The character could be another contemplative profession with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ribbon roll is introduced early, handled on the moss-covered table, and its poems are read aloud—two distinct beats. It participates in the closure: Elara tucks it "safely in her pocket" as she returns to the workshop, signaling continuity of inheritance. However, the ribbon does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure; it functions as a symbolic carrier of memory rather than an active agent. Its reweighted meaning at the end is implied but not charged with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship is signaled early—"her grandmother's ghost had never fully left"—and reappears at the ending when "her grandmother's spectral form smiled." It shapes Elara's understanding of inheritance and frames the stakes. However, the ghost does not constrain a choice or impose a cost; it validates her realization without complicating her path. The concept is thematically present but does not drive a beat or tighten options. It participates in the closure image but lacks causal pressure or felt consequence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Fiercely meditative" is asserted in the text—"she moved with a fiercely meditative focus"—but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The trait describes her manner of walking and reading but does not narrow a choice or create a trade-off. It could be replaced with "deeply focused" or "intensely contemplative" without altering the narrative. The attribute is label-only and does not shape tactics or consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Retracing her grandmother's path is signaled early—"Elara walked the path her grandmother had walked each evening"—and frames the ritual structure of the scene. It participates in the ending when Elara's understanding arrives as she completes the walk. However, the action does not drive a turn or narrow options; it is a contemplative gesture rather than a decision under pressure. Removing the retracing would weaken the thematic resonance but not break the plot. It shapes one key moment—the final realization—but lacks causal force across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The family custom is introduced early—"traded at dinner, passed across the table like bread"—and Elara selects and recites a poem aloud, enacting the custom in solitude. It appears in two beats: the backstory explanation and the ritual recitation. However, the custom does not constrain a choice or shape tactics; it provides context for the ribbon's significance but does not drive escalation. The recitation participates in the closure sequence but lacks felt cost or causal pressure. It is purposeful but replaceable with another inherited ritual.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse is established early, richly detailed, and charged throughout: rusting iron, amber light, humid air. It constrains Elara's movement—she walks the flagstone path, unrolls the ribbon on the moss-covered table—and supplies the golden light and gathering butterflies that shape the ending image. The setting is indispensable: without the greenhouse's specific atmosphere and its link to her grandmother's work, the closure effect would collapse. It drives at least two beats (entry and observation, final realization) and participates directly in the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The butterfly migration is signaled early—"Elara had promised herself she would understand, by the time the last butterfly departed"—and provides a temporal frame. The butterflies' ascent coincides with Elara's realization, and their departure marks the ending. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions; Elara completes her walk and achieves understanding without the clock forcing a trade-off. The migration participates in the closure image—"each one carrying its small burden of longing"—but lacks the pressure of a live deadline that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation is stated early—"understand…the shape of collective grief"—and drives the entire scene. Elara's choices (walking, reading, reciting) all pursue this goal. The motivation is resolved on the page when she "understood now" and saw grief as weather. However, the desire is not dramatized through friction or cost; she seeks and finds without resistance. The motivation shapes the arc but lacks on-page conflict between want and obstacle, trending toward told-only.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The tone is established early—"drumming stillness," "concentrated green breath"—and recurs in "thundering calm" at the ending. The oxymoronic pairing of intensity and stillness is coherent and modulates subtly as dusk deepens. However, "thundering calm" itself is a strained metaphor without clear embodiment, and the tone remains relatively static across beats rather than tightening under pressure. It charges the final image but does not shift decisively to reflect escalation. The tone is purposeful and distinct, present in at least two beats, but lacks dynamic modulation.</comment>
