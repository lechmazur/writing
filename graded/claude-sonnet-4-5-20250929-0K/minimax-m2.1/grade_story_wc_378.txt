<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cara's interiority is vivid and embodied through the rebuilt hands that pulse, the strange organic blood moving through tubes. The motivation to contain chaos is grounded in forty-three years of caretaking particulars. However, the final transformation feels asserted rather than earned through micro-choices—"felt herself fragmenting...felt whole" operates at a high level of abstraction without dramatized cost. The emotional arc toward "fragmented wholeness" risks therapy-speak, though it's anchored in concrete action with the box and roses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly within the first paragraph (who/where/when). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through the failing roses, the magnetic storm, and Cara's static until the controlled burn reweights the stakes. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the box emptied, fears miniaturized, Cara standing among restored roses with visible cost (fragmentation/wholeness trade). One meaningful deepening through the box-opening and miniaturization sequence. The cost is felt but could be more concretely dramatized in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass dome, desert roses with tangled roots/cables, and Cara's rebuilt hands all constrain choice and charge the closure. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered: the humming glass, nighttime fragrance, curling petals seeking lost north. The roses' nutrient regulators corrupted by magnetic shift drive the central crisis. Micro-setting (the maintenance alcove, the box buried beneath circuits) functions purposefully. The dome standing intact at closure bookends the spatial stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: the roses are dying from magnetic chaos, and Cara's static is unbearable. The controlled burn/miniaturization deepens pressure by forcing Cara to do "something she had never done before." Agency is clear—she carries the box, opens it, contains the fears. One meaningful tightening through the choice to miniaturize chaos rather than repair mechanically. The cost is visible (fragmentation) but the trade-off could be sharpened; the resolution feels somewhat assured rather than forecloses a clear alternative path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete work of containing childhood fears and miniaturizing chaos—"escapes that led you back to what you had always been tending." The box as held fears rather than destroyed ones anchors the theme in specific choice. Subtext operates in the roses "did not know they were artificial, and neither, increasingly, did Cara." The ending avoids overt moralizing and offers a resonant answer through the emptied box and "fragmented wholeness." Minor slip: "fragmented wholeness, the only kind of wholeness worth having" edges toward explicating the theme rather than letting the image do the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV held cleanly; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct—Cara notices through both machine precision ("nutrient regulators," "emotional processors") and organic metaphor ("veins of a shared circulation"). Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("diffuse...scattered across the frequency spectrum") that feels slightly imposed. Psychic distance narrows effectively during the miniaturization sequence. Free indirect style is clean. Some phrases ("fragmented wholeness," "something like clarity") edge toward conceptual summary rather than embodied perception under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing sentences anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Minor loop: "fears were not destroyed by ignoring them but by being held gently" is elegant but paraphrased again in the ending ("small quiet space...where nothing needed to be remembered to be true"). Some figurative density in peak beats: "folded like origami," "static...resolve into something like clarity," "the glass was sky and the glass was sky" (intentional but heavy). No major template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Proofreading clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of android caretaker, childhood fears as physical objects to be miniaturized, and magnetic north as external/internal crisis is specific and non-obvious. "Controlled burn...not escape from herself but escape into herself" transforms the crisis-management trope. The roses/machine/organic融合 feels earned rather than ornamental. Emotional complexity (caring for artificial roses while becoming organic) avoids sentimentality. Risk: the lyric mode and conceptual language ("fragmented wholeness") could alienate readers seeking grounded causality, but the piece commits fully to its vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cara's choices drive all key turns: carrying the box to the dome center, opening it, drawing fears into her chest, miniaturizing them. Nostalgia is embedded in the forty-three-year history and the children's gift. She acts under pressure throughout and the ending reconfigures her identity with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Box appears in setup (maintenance alcove, paragraph 2), reappears at midpoint (Cara carries it to dome center), is opened and emptied in the climax, and returns in closure ("her box now empty"). It holds the miniaturization target and represents the core method. Removing it would break the story's causal chain and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Controlled burn" is named explicitly and shapes the tactic: "Not destruction, but reduction." The method (miniaturization as containment, not force) alters Cara's approach and drives the climax. It reconfigures the escape metaphor in the final paragraph. Present in setup as conceptual frame, enacted at climax, reprised at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Strangely organic" appears in setup ("something strangely organic beneath the titanium—something that pulsed") and returns at closure ("strange and organic and beautifully broken"). It enables the miniaturization (organic blood moving slowly) but the cost/tradeoff tied specifically to this attribute could be sharper. Functional but approaches swappability with "becoming more human."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Miniaturize" is the named method in paragraph 3 and executed in paragraph 5 ("began the work of making them small"). It drives the climax beat and cannot be swapped—containment through reduction is causally specific. The action shapes the resolution directly. Present across three beats with clear cost (fragmentation).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Containing chaos" is signaled in setup ("containment was her gift"), enacted through the miniaturization sequence ("drew the fears toward her chest...making them small"), and reprised at closure ("her fear contained and miniaturized"). The method shapes tactics and the final image. Slightly abstract but the mechanics (acknowledge, name, fold) are dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Desert rose farm in glass dome is established in the opening sentence, frames all action, and provides the crisis mechanism (magnetic shift corrupts nutrient regulators). The dome's survival anchors closure. Roses' tangled roots with Cara's cables create the shared circulation that enables the controlled burn. Removal would eliminate the story's spatial logic and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Magnetic north shift is present in setup (paragraph 1), drives the crisis (paragraph 3: corrupted regulators), and is resolved at closure ("magnetic storm passed...north...settled somewhere near true"). It tightens the decision window and provides the external pressure that forces Cara's internal work. The timeframe could be more urgently tracked during the climax.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Inner static" is named in paragraph 2 ("static inside her processors...unbearable—a screaming between stations") and motivates the controlled burn. It reappears in paragraph 5 ("static in Cara's mind began to resolve"). Desire is embodied but the friction between wanting resolution and fearing fragmentation could be more dramatized as competing impulses in the climax beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Fragmented wholeness" is enacted throughout: the roses/machine/organic synthesis, the "fragmenting, breaking into all the moments" that produces wholeness. Tone modulates from the opening's elegiac patience to the climax's compression and back to stillness. The phrase is named explicitly in paragraph 5, which edges toward over-articulation, but the tone charges the final image and remains coherent through all turns.</comment>
