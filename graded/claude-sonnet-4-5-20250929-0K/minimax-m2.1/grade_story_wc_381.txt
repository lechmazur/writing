<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The summoner's interiority is consistently filtered through a lush, philosophical lens, but her choices feel more contemplative than conflicted. The decision to "smooth" rather than "fight" the prophecy unfolds as a meditative process without genuine internal friction or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final realization—that the prophecy was a warning from her future self—arrives as exposition rather than earned through on-page struggle. While the character's stance is clear, the lack of embodied contradiction or visible cost in her choices keeps this in the functional band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered imagery (brook, origami wing, silence-mapping) rather than causal reversals. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing when the summoner understands the prophecy as "desperate plea from a future self," reweighting her magic as receptive rather than combative. However, the cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture or visible alteration of tactics occurs. The final image of the wing floating downstream gestures toward consequence but doesn't anchor a felt price, keeping this below the high band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal brook setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (ghost-mote breath, water whispering to stone, frogs falling quiet). The environment subtly constrains the summoner's method: she kneels at the water's edge, uses the brook's rhythm to guide her ritual, and the wing's movement on the current provides spatial closure. While the setting shapes the ritual's texture and charges the final image, it doesn't force a tactical choice under pressure, placing it just below the essential band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing a prophecy that threatens the court's future—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Pressure accumulates through the summoner's gradual understanding rather than escalating conflict: she traces the prophecy's nature, performs the ritual, and receives the warning. The ritual itself proceeds smoothly without reversals or complications; the wing lifts "not summoned but invited," frogs quiet mid-note, and the revelation arrives cleanly. Under an Accumulative lens one deepening moment suffices, but the absence of visible cost or a tactical trade-off limits the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central metaphor: prophecy as frequency rather than fate, noise that can be smoothed rather than fought. The piece explores agency through receptivity—"quieting the very medium through which it traveled"—without overt moralizing. The final image of the wing carried downstream and the summoner walking in "tranquil blaze" offers a resonant answer to the thematic question. However, phrases like "terrestrially cosmic truth" and "vast倾听 of the world" (mixing languages) read as authorial intrusion, and the closing paragraph edges toward theme summary ("even fate could be soothed") rather than letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice sustains a distinct, elevated register with consistent lyricism ("ghost-motes," "latticework," "braille made of absence"). POV remains stable in close third, filtering all perception through the summoner's philosophical lens. However, diction occasionally drifts into academic abstraction ("the terrestrially cosmic truth," "the mapping of silence as cartographers once mapped stars") that feels imposed rather than organically character-rooted. The single POV is clean with no head-hopping, and psychic distance remains controlled, but the uniform texture lacks modulation under the ritual's pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose is consistently elevated with controlled rhythm and vivid figurative language ("smoke through latticework," "pale flame of folded possibility"). However, density issues appear: adjacent sentences in paragraph three paraphrase the same insight about prophecy as frequency/signal/noise without added pressure. Template cadence emerges in paragraph four with repeated participial openings. The phrase "vast倾听 of the world" mixes languages without clear purpose, creating a micro-opacity. The final paragraph edges toward summary ("the knowledge that even fate could be soothed") rather than trusting the dramatized image, applying the paraphrase-loop penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—unmaking prophecy by "smoothing hush" and mapping silence—offers a fresh angle on summoner/prophecy tropes, emphasizing receptivity over force. The reveal that the prophecy is a warning from the summoner's future self adds conceptual ingenuity. However, the emotional core (fear of predetermined fate) follows a familiar template, and key turns arrive through contemplation rather than specific lived detail that would make this summoner irreplaceable. The synthesis is solid and the philosophical frame is executed with care, but the lack of surprising friction or a bold structural risk keeps this in the mid-competent band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The solitary summoner is present throughout and her choice to practice "smoothing" rather than "fighting" frames the opening and shapes the ritual. However, her decisions are contemplative rather than pressured: she kneels, traces patterns, invites the wing to lift, and receives the revelation without on-page resistance or tactical alteration. The character drives mood and method but doesn't create a key turn through a conflicted choice under pressure, landing in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The origami crane wing appears in the opening third ("rested in her palm"), lifts during the ritual, and settles on the water in the ending image. It bridges past (mother's teaching) and present (ritual tool), then carries downstream as embodied closure. While it participates in three beats and charges the final image, its role is largely symbolic; removing it would weaken resonance but not break story logic. The wing's "careful folds" and "paper wings" are described rather than causally manipulated, keeping it from the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Smoothed hush" is named directly and drives the summoner's method: she practices "the smoothing of hush itself" and quiets the prophecy by "smoothing the rough edges of precognition." The concept appears in the opening third, shapes the middle ritual, and is echoed in the ending. However, it functions as thematic label rather than a constraint that alters tactics under pressure. The story could substitute "silencing" or "calming" with minor edits, indicating moderate swappability and landing mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" appears once in paragraph three as a descriptor for the summoner's insight: "The terrestrially cosmic truth had come to her gradually, sitting by streams." It's a label-only trait without visible cost or on-page consequence. The phrase reads as authorial abstraction rather than a quality that constrains or enables a specific action. Late first appearance, ornamental use, and high swappability place this in the low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Flow" is signaled early ("She felt the flow of power begin") and shapes the ritual's texture throughout: "gentle, persistent current, like water finding its way through countless small stones." The final image of the summoner's magic "flowing as quietly and inevitably as water toward the sea" reprises the element with thematic weight. However, the flow proceeds smoothly without complication or tactical trade-off; it describes the ritual's character rather than creating a turn. Present across beats and in closure, but replaceable with "current" or "stream" without breaking structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is introduced in the opening third ("the mapping of silence as cartographers once mapped stars") and enacted in the ritual: "tracing the silence between the brook's murmurs as though reading braille made of absence." The method shapes the summoner's approach and is echoed at closure ("in the mapping of silence, she had found something better"). However, the mechanics remain metaphorical; the story does not show how mapping differs from listening or smoothing in tactical terms, leaving it as thematic gesture rather than plot-altering means.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the brook is present from the opening and shapes every beat: the summoner kneels at the water's edge, the brook's whispers guide her ritual, frogs fall quiet, and the wing's movement on the current provides closure. The setting supplies the medium for "smoothing" (water as metaphor and literal tool) and constrains the summoner's posture and method. While it doesn't force a tactical choice under duress, it's integral to the ritual's logic and charges the final image, reaching the essential-across-beats threshold.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" gestures at the prophecy's coded nature and the court intrigue mentioned in the opening, but time itself remains untracked. "Three nights had passed since the seers spoke" anchors backstory, and "By morning, the court would wake" sets a loose future boundary, but no ticking clock shapes the ritual's urgency or the summoner's choices. The timeframe is atmospherically present but does not tighten decisions, landing in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation to "hush a prophecy spoken in code" is stated in the opening paragraph and drives the entire ritual. The summoner's desire is dramatized through her solitary journey, her choice to practice smoothing rather than fighting, and her receptive stance during the ritual. However, the motivation proceeds without internal friction: no competing want (e.g., desire to know the prophecy versus fear of it) creates visible tension. The goal is pursued consistently with on-page cost (solitude, ritual effort) but lacks conflicted choice, placing it in the solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is named explicitly twice: "the ritual's tranquil blaze—the surface calm, the core burning with purpose" and again in the final paragraph. The oxymoron captures the piece's dual texture—lyrical calm paired with focused intensity—and modulates subtly as the summoner moves from contemplation to understanding. However, the tone remains largely static; emotional pressure does not escalate or fracture the tranquility. The phrase charges the final image but functions more as thematic label than lived tonal shift, landing mid-band with lyric-reprise credit.</comment>
