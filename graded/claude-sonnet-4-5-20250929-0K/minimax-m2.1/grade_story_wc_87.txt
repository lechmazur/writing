<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's interior contradiction—clinging to the stubborn hope while carrying collapsed expectations—is embodied through her kayaking motions and the compass pressed against her skin. The renunciation of Maren and withdrawal from friends feels somewhat told rather than dramatized in the present stakes, though it establishes credible regret. The final laugh and course adjustment demonstrate agency under pressure with visible cost (enduring broken vision, choosing movement over stillness). Minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated reflection on "aligning heart and action," which borders on therapeutic label-speak but remains grounded in the physical act of paddling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara continues paddling despite broken vision, forecloses withdrawal, and discovers a new navigation method with felt cost (loss of celestial mastery, reliance on humble poles). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through reflection interleaved with present action, culminating in the laugh and course correction that reweights her expectations. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when she gravitates toward the poles and realizes she's "aligning heart and action," then the current catches her and she laughs—a micro turn that charges the ending without requiring a second decisive change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The coastal launch details (weathered ramp, granite boulders, cedar poles, osprey nest) are filtered through Elara's memory and constrain her new navigation method. The compass pressed against her thigh recurs with shifting emotional weight, and the utility poles function as micro-setting waypoints that alter her tactics from celestial to terrestrial navigation. The final image of the current pulling her seaward and her gravitating back toward the poles charges closure by grounding the emotional recalibration in concrete spatial choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she navigate with broken vision—is signaled early and tightens when she gravitates toward the shore poles rather than open water. The escalation is Accumulative: each pole passed is a small victory that deepens her realization she can find a new way forward. The current catching her and forcing a course correction provides one meaningful pressure point with visible cost (must abandon old celestial methods, accept terrestrial markers). Agency is present in her choice to launch and her active paddling adjustments, though the closure cost could be more viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—finding a new way forward after loss—emerges from the concrete shift from celestial to utility-pole navigation. The compass serves as a charged object that shifts meaning from reminder of loss to warm companion. Minor penalty for the somewhat overt articulation "aligning heart and action" in the penultimate section, which edges toward stating the theme rather than letting it resonate purely through image. The laugh and course adjustment offer a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with close psychic distance; perceptual signature filters setting through Elara's priorities (navigator's eye, memory of the osprey nest). Diction stays within her lexicon—"stubborn as tide pools in drought," "gravitated toward the shore"—and modulates appropriately under emotional pressure. No dialogue present; internal voice is distinct and consistent. The phrase "aligning heart and action" reads slightly elevated but remains plausible for a former research professional in a moment of breakthrough.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening complex sentences give way to shorter beats during the paddling sequence. Information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or theme. Minor paraphrase loop in paragraph five: the litany of "regretfully" constructions (ended relationship, withdrew, shrunk world) cycles through similar phrasing without added pressure, applying a −0.2 deduction. No other template cadence or scaffold detected. The final image—laugh, course adjustment, continued paddling—propels cleanly without artifice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shift from celestial to terrestrial navigation (utility poles as waypoints) offers a specific, non-obvious transformation of the "return to the sea after injury" premise. The compass as both gift and reminder avoids pure sentiment through its dual charge. The story commits to its limited scope and executes the quiet, accumulative arc without hedging. Slight deduction for the "backlash of regrets" as a somewhat familiar recovery-narrative beat, though the specificity of stereoscopic vision loss and the navigator's tools elevate it above template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choice to launch despite three years' absence creates the inciting pressure; her mid-water decision to gravitate toward the poles rather than rely on celestial methods constitutes a key tactical turn; her laugh and course correction at the end complete the arc. The "broken navigator" identity is causally active across all three beats and shapes the closure directly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The compass is introduced early (first paragraph), handled physically (pressed against thigh/hip, warming against skin), and carries symbolic weight as gift-turned-reminder. It appears in three beats but does not directly enable a tactic or constrain a choice; its function is more atmospheric and thematic. The warming detail at closure adds modest charge but the compass does not decisively shape the navigation method—the poles do. Swappable with another memento without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Backlash of regrets" is named explicitly in paragraph five and dramatized through the litany of withdrawals (Maren, friends, expeditions). It shapes present stakes by establishing what Elara is trying to overcome, and the laugh in the final beat signals a small victory against that pressure. However, the concept is more thematic backdrop than an active tactical constraint; the navigation challenge could proceed without the regret element. Present in setup and closure, but middle development is light.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Merrily melancholic" appears as a labeled mix in paragraph six ("melancholy... mixed with... merriness") and is embodied in the unexpected laugh near the end. The trait enables the tonal shift that charges closure but does not visibly constrain an earlier choice or create a tradeoff. Setup is late (second half), development is minimal, and closure linkage is modest. Functional but somewhat ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Gravitate" recurs three times: she gravitates toward shore/poles in paragraph four, gravitates back in the final line, and the verb choice subtly mirrors her pull toward terrestrial navigation. The action enables her new method and shapes the major tactical turn. Removing "gravitate" and substituting "move" or "paddle" would weaken the thematic resonance of being pulled by necessity. Present across setup, middle choice, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Navigating by utility poles is introduced in paragraph four as necessity teaching what choice would not, demonstrated through three poles passed (including the osprey nest), and returns in the final beat when she adjusts course back toward the pole line. The method directly enables her success and defines her new tactical identity. The mechanics matter—each pole is a waypoint—and the method is irreplaceable; celestial navigation is explicitly unavailable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The coastal kayak launch (Mussel Point) is named and detailed in the opening, supplies concrete resources (ramp, boulders, shoreline, poles), and the choppy water forces her tactical choice to stay near shore. The setting is more than postcard; it constrains her navigation options and the current catching her seaward provides the final pressure that she must counter. Spatial choreography (shore versus open water) is legible and affects tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"When expectations collapse" frames the backstory (three years since the accident, collapsed expeditions/confidence) and the morning launch occurs at the moment she tests whether any smaller hope remains. The timeframe is more psychological threshold than live clock; no on-page ticking urgency. Present in setup and thematically charged at closure, but does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat. Functional bracket rather than active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to align heart and action" is articulated explicitly in paragraph six and dramatized through the choice to launch, the paddling rhythm, and the final course correction. Friction exists between her collapsed expectations and the stubborn hope, and the cost is visible (enduring broken vision, accepting a humbler method). The phrase itself edges toward label-speak but the surrounding action grounds it. Strong setup and closure participation; middle beats show the alignment in progress.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Flickering faith" is embodied in the "stubborn... flickering" hope in paragraph two and recurs in the final line ("faith flickering but not yet extinguished"). Tone modulates from melancholy weight in the opening through the unexpected merriness to the charged poise of the laugh and adjustment. The tone is coherent under pressure and charges the final image by balancing doubt with movement. Strong lyric reprise that reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
