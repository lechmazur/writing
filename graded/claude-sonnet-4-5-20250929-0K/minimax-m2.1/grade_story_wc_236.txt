<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is concrete and embodied ("hands knew the language of essential oils"), and her arc from loss to adaptation shows genuine progression. The renunciation of scent as "the point" carries cost, though the final realization feels slightly over-articulated ("she understood now that the sensing had never been only about smell"). Mira's backstory as midwife adds depth but remains largely static; her choices don't pressure Elena on the page. The protagonist's internal conflict—mourning versus acceptance—could be more contradictory and simultaneous rather than sequential.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (Elena, shop, morning fog, "Thirty-seven days ago"). The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration—Elena's attention reframes her loss as a shift in sensing mode rather than pure deficit, with the cost legible in the forfeited profession and sensory world. The screw motif seeds early, returns at closure ("still warm in her hand"), and reweights the premise. Pressure accumulates through layered reflections rather than plot reversals, consistent with the chosen lens. One persistent weakness: the final paragraph's explicit thematic statement ("she understood now") slightly undermines the image-driven closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The water clock shop is vivid and purposeful: silent bell, worn pine floors, copper pipes, brass gears create a sensory-specific environment. Fog functions as both atmosphere and constraint, pressing "like something wanting in" and lifting to mark Elena's internal shift. The birthing clamp screw—a small, worn object—charges the final image and links setting to theme. Micro-setting (workbench, tea cups, the screw itself) constrains attention and enables the climactic realization. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Elena's effort to reconstruct purpose after sensory loss. Pressure deepens through accumulation—thirty-seven days ago, learning clock architecture, the screw revelation, tea moment—rather than external reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. Agency manifests as sustained attention and reframing rather than decision; the cost is visible in her forfeited identity as aromatherapist. One meaningful tightening occurs when the screw's history reweights her understanding of "beginnings." The piece lacks a second live option or visible trade-off at the closure beat, keeping it mid-band for this category.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—sensing as attention rather than literal perception—emerges through the screw, clocks, fog, and Elena's hands. The water clocks as "small heart[s] beating" and the screw as threshold object ground abstraction in concrete image. "Unveiling ordinary miracles" integrates with Elena's arc without overt moralizing until the final paragraph, where "she understood now that the sensing had never been only about smell" edges toward thematic echo. The closing image (screw "still warm in her hand") offers a resonant answer to the central question. Subtext operates well in Mira's gesture of offering work "the way one might offer shelter from rain."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elena with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is character-specific: "invisible things," "architecture of time," fog as occluded view. Diction is controlled and purposeful, though a few lines drift toward elevated register ("occluded," "humanize through occluded views"). The phrase "The humanize through occluded views" in paragraph seven appears ungrammatical or incomplete, suggesting either a typo or over-compression that harms clarity. Psychic distance modulates appropriately. No dialogue present, so dialogue bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing images anchor well ("bell above the door," "screw still warm in her hand"). Information density is high in early paragraphs. However, several artifacts accumulate: "reading between the lines" appears twice in identical phrasing (paragraphs 5 and 6), and paragraph nine contains paraphrase loops ("she understood now" repeated across three sentences). The phrase "The humanize through occluded views" is grammatically broken, obscuring meaning at a peak reflective beat. Template cadence in the penultimate paragraph: "She had helped... She could not... She understood..." Stack of filter verbs ("could almost smell," "could not taste") clusters in a single beat without pattern payoff. Apply −0.6 for loops and template, −0.3 for the grammatical break, totaling −0.9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pairing of anosmia with clock repair and the midwife-to-clockmaker transition offer fresh synthesis. The screw as birthing tool transformed into mechanical part is a specific, memorable inflection. However, the emotional arc—loss leading to reframed purpose—follows a familiar redemptive template without bold risk. The fog-as-metaphor and "reading between lines" remain somewhat conventional. Specificity in the screw and water clocks elevates, but the piece does not take structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes beyond the expected arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena (aromatherapist who lost smell) is present throughout and her past profession seeds the arc. Her loss drives the premise and her realization at closure. However, her choices on the page are largely receptive—accepting work, learning, noticing—rather than decisions that alter tactics. The profession appears in setup and closure but does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) with strong lyric reprise but limited causal pressure in development.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The birthing clamp screw appears in three beats: initial notice on workbench, Mira's revelation of its history, and Elena holding it warm at closure. It seeds early, its history reweights meaning mid-story, and it charges the final image. The screw links Mira's past to present theme and becomes the story's central object. Removing it would weaken closure significantly. All three gates met; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Reading between lines" is stated twice explicitly (paragraphs 5 and 6) as thematic claim but does not shape on-page tactics or narrow options. Elena's work involves interpreting clocks and sensing emotional terrain, but the phrase itself remains ornamental rather than a method that alters choices. Lyric presence in setup and closure without middle development or visible cost tied to the concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Maps emotional terrain" describes Elena's past work with scent and her new attention to clocks and people. It appears in setup (paragraph 2) and recurs implicitly at closure. However, the trait does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost; it functions as backstory and thematic frame. Two-gate lyric presence without causal pressure in a middle beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Humanize" appears once in the phrase "The humanize through occluded views" (paragraph 7), which is grammatically unclear and reads as artifact rather than action. If interpreted as Elena's effort to humanize experience through limited sensing, it remains implicit across the arc but never dramatized as a distinct action that turns the plot. Present in theme but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Through occluded views" (fog, loss of smell, indirect sensing) is signaled early and sustained: fog pressing against windows, Elena's sensory deficit, Mira's indirect revelation. The method shapes Elena's experience and tactics throughout. However, it remains more atmospheric constraint than a mechanics-driven method that alters specific on-page choices. Strong thematic presence and closure participation, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The water clock repair shop is anchored early and supplies the story's micro-setting: workbench, clocks, tools, fog-pressed windows. The shop's quiet and patient work rhythm mirrors Elena's internal arc. The screw on Mira's bench becomes the story's focal object. Setting enables the closure moment (workbench, tea, screw in hand). All three gates met with moderate causal pressure and strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Within the hush of morning fog" anchors the opening and the fog's lifting marks the story's temporal arc and Elena's shift. Time is tracked through the fog's presence and dispersal. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose urgency; it functions as atmosphere and symbolic parallel rather than a live constraint on tactics. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) with thematic charge but limited pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To unveil ordinary miracles" is stated explicitly in paragraph 8 and implied throughout Elena's arc (sensing through limitation, water clocks as "small heart[s]," the screw as threshold object). The motivation drives her acceptance of new work and reframing at closure. However, it is told more than dramatized in conflicted choices; no visible friction between this want and a competing cost on the page. Strong thematic presence and closure linkage, moderate causal embodiment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Trembling calm" is sustained throughout: silent bell, soft footsteps, fog's gentle pressure, patient drip of clocks, tea steam rising. Tone modulates slightly as fog lifts and light "crept across the workbench like something curious," charging the final image without breaking the established mood. The tone coherently supports the accumulative design and Elena's quiet transformation. Distinct, purposeful, and present at closure.</comment>
