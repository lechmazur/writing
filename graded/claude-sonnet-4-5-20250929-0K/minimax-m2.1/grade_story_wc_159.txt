<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The caretaker is defined entirely by her role—"glass-orchid caretaker," "keeper of vanished things"—with label-only interiority ("foxglove regret," "gently systematic grace") that never contradicts or complicates her stance. No micro-choices under pressure appear; she moves through rounds "with reverence" in a static loop. The work is preservation without friction, cost, or competing impulse. No meaningful change or credible endurance with visible price emerges by the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Orientation Test: Who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, but the piece never establishes a present stake or pressure that tightens. The caretaker begins her nightly rounds, completes them, and returns the wind chime—no reversal, escalation, or foreclosed path. The final paragraph ("she had already begun preparing for the work ahead") explicitly telegraphs stasis without cost. No Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price, or Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior material occurs on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The opal library, marble-into-glass architecture, and clouds with non-earthly colors are vividly rendered and thematically coherent. The wind chime's cracked bamboo is handled twice (finding it, using it at cases, returning it) and the fracture pattern is specific. However, the environment does not constrain a single choice or alter tactics—the caretaker moves freely, unimpeded. No micro-setting element charges the final image or narrows options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>No dominant stake is dramatized. The caretaker's work—lifting the wind chime to display cases, collecting names into memory—proceeds without opposition, cost, or complication. "Foxglove regret" is asserted as a feeling but never forces a trade-off or reveals competing values. The piece cycles through description and summary ("she worked through the night, as she always did") with no on-page tightening, deepening, or choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme of preservation versus forgetting is coherent and avoids overt moralizing. "Foxglove regret" as "love for things that could not be recovered coupled with a fierce determination" offers complexity. However, thematic resonance remains abstract; the caretaker's final rounds and preparation for tomorrow literalize the cycle without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer. The wind chime's return and "soft recognition" glow echo setup without charging the ending with fresh cost or insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct lyric register ("opaline spaces between memory and loss," "weather of the world below"). Diction is elevated but consistent. No dialogue present. The perceptual signature is poetic but generic—no character-specific bias or selective noticing that distinguishes this keeper from any contemplative archivist. Syntax varies purposefully, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("marble spun into glass," "memory hung in the air like frozen breath," "happinesses once common as sunrise," "dust of the absolute dark"). Paraphrase loops appear: "for as long as the museum of extinct feelings required its caretaker, for as long as there were names worth saving" restates the same idea. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "she had already begun preparing" after "she would need it again, tomorrow night and the night after that." Density −0.6, loop −0.3, cumulative −0.9 in Q7. Information density is low; most sentences ornament rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The opal library and museum of extinct feelings are evocative, but the emotional-preservation-as-museum premise closely tracks widely used templates (elegiac keeper of lost things in a beautiful, isolated space). The wind chime's mechanics (casting light to surface names) offer a fresh detail, but no turn or reconfiguration transforms the frame. The cycle—nightly rounds, return, preparation for tomorrow—is static. No bold structural risk or non-obvious synthesis elevates the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The glass-orchid caretaker is present throughout but makes no decisions that alter tactics or stakes. She lifts the wind chime, collects names, and returns the tube—actions without friction or cost. Observation and description dominate; no key turn traces to her choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The wind chime bamboo tube is handled in three beats: discovery flashback, use at display cases, and return at story's end. Its cracked surface and light-casting mechanics are specific. However, its function remains static—no evolving use, no reweighted meaning at closure. It enables the work but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with fresh cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Deserted marvels" anchors the Hall of Obsolete Joys and Corridor of Lost Longings—vivid setting details. The concept echoes thematically ("abandoned feeling had once burned bright") but never shapes an on-page stake or tactic. The caretaker's reverence is asserted, not tested. Present and thematically legible, but ornamental to plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" appears twice ("gently systematic grace," "In her gently systematic way") as label-only description. No on-page action shows the trait constraining or enabling a choice with cost. The caretaker's thoroughness is told, never dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Light (the wind chime's "soft and blue-green" illumination) surfaces names at display cases—a functional beat. It appears again as "opal glow" at the tube's resting place. However, light does not drive a major turn or redefine options; it is a tool without friction. Swappable with another name-recovery mechanic without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"By the echo of a long-forgotten song" does not appear as method or means. The wind chime does not sing in the traditional sense—"it cast illumination." No echo or song shapes attempts or closure. Absent from the narrative mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The opal library above clouds is vividly established (marble, glass, pearly light, clouds in non-earthly colors) and frames all action. It supplies the display cases and observation decks the caretaker moves through. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Postcard description elevated by lyric diction but not by tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Across the museum of extinct feelings" names the spatial scope, not a tightening timeframe. "She worked through the night, as she always did" establishes duration but no clock that narrows decisions. Time is vague and cyclical ("tomorrow night and the night after that"), never a live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To preserve the sound of forgotten names" is stated and demonstrated (names surface, settle into memory). The caretaker's commitment is asserted ("fierce determination"), but no friction between this desire and a competing want or cost appears on the page. Told motivation without dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Foxglove regret" is named and glossed ("not sorrow exactly—something more complex, a love for things that could not be recovered coupled with a fierce determination"). The tone is elegiac and coherent through all beats. It modulates slightly at observation-deck pauses but remains static overall. The final image ("soft recognition" glow) sustains rather than charges the mood with fresh cost.</comment>
