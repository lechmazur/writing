<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miriam's interior life is concrete and her thirty-year dedication grounds her choices, but she remains largely observational until the ritual. The woman arrives, vanishes, and returns on schedule with minimal friction or misbelief to complicate either character's arc. The ending grants recovery without visible cost—grandmother's memories are simply reawakened and "ready to be shared once more"—which reads as wish fulfillment rather than earned transformation with foreclosed paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: Miriam's ritual gathers narrative weight through hyperbolic geometry and the scarf's luminescence to reawaken stored memory. However, closure arrives as convenient success—no decision narrows options, no price is paid, and the woman's 3 AM return feels orchestrated rather than causally motivated. The Cost Proof Test fails: the final paragraph asserts "purpose fulfilled" without pointing to a sentence where Miriam or the woman sacrifices, loses, or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The hyperbolic library is vividly particular—walls curving inward, parallel lines meeting, Stack Section 7.14—and Miriam's profession filters detail through decades of learned observation. The circular reading room constrains the ritual spatially, and the scarf's glow casts geometric patterns that charge the ending image. Micro-setting (the treatise on folded space, the scarf's placement) supports the closure moment, narrowly meeting the 9+ gate criteria by shaping the final image, though the library's impossible angles remain more decorative than decision-forcing throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where stories live—is signaled early but remains abstract. Miriam performs her ritual without opposition, risk, or visible trade-off; the scarf simply responds, the woman returns exactly on cue, and the reawakening succeeds. No reversal tightens options, no failure forces adaptation, and the ending grants recovery without cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density or cadence shift; here it flattens into a demonstration rather than a contested escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of analog memory embedded in physical objects emerges organically from Miriam's ritual and the scarf's transformation, avoiding overt moralizing until the final paragraph's "purpose fulfilled" summary. The hyperbolic-geometry metaphor for narrative accumulation is specific and sustained. However, the ending offers a tidy, symmetrical resolution—lost memories restored, love reawakened—without ambiguity or counter-reading, and the grandmother's woven stories are told rather than dramatized, reducing thematic complexity to nostalgic recovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and confident, blending scientific precision ("hyperbolic space," "optical illusions") with poetic cadence ("observed solitude," "the weight of accumulated narratives"). Psychic distance remains stable in close third around Miriam, and diction fits her decades of eccentric scholarship. The woman's brief dialogue carries reverence appropriate to the moment. Minor register drift appears in phrases like "analog memories that lived in every binding and marginalia," which edges toward essay rather than lived perception, but voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (walls shifting, threads straightening, geometry responding) supports the ritual's atmosphere without overwhelming clarity. Orientation is efficient, and information density is high in the opening paragraphs. However, the final two paragraphs loop thematically—"reawakening," "analog memories," "stories lived," "purpose fulfilled"—restating the premise rather than advancing it, and the phrase "the particular satisfaction of purpose fulfilled" tells rather than shows closure. Template cadence appears in "She understood, suddenly, what she must do" and similar declarative stems across the ritual sequence, applying −0.4 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The fusion of hyperbolic geometry with narrative theory offers a fresh conceptual hook, and the midnight library's impossible architecture is vividly particular. However, the core plot—lost heirloom recovered through ritual—follows a familiar recovery arc without transformation or moral calculus. The scarf's reawakening solves the problem it introduced (the woman's loss) with no prior complication, and the ending's "purpose fulfilled" declares thematic satisfaction rather than earning it through specific, non-obvious synthesis. The premise is inventive; the execution hedges toward the safe middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Miriam is present throughout and her three-decade expertise frames the story, meeting the setup gate. She performs the ritual in the circular room (development) and witnesses the woman's retrieval (payoff), satisfying all three gates. However, her role is largely observational and facilitative—she recognizes the scarf, carries it, speaks collected words—without a decision that narrows her own options or imposes visible cost. The woman's arc (loss → recovery) drives closure; Miriam enables it. No friction, no trade-off tied to Miriam's choices. Two gates plus facilitation without personal cost: mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scarf appears on the return desk in paragraph two (setup), Miriam lays it across the treatise during the ritual where its threads straighten and color deepens (development), and the woman retrieves it in the final beat where it glows and casts geometric patterns (payoff). All three gates are met. The scarf's transformation—frayed teal → luminescent tropical water—drives the reawakening and shapes the closure image. Its specific properties (teal silk, frayed edges, ocean-salt scent, woven stories) are irreplaceable. Cost linkage is weak: recovery without sacrifice. Strong beat involvement and closure participation, minor cost deficit: upper 7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Analog memories are named in paragraph two ("anything about memory that isn't digital") and recur as Miriam's career concept (paragraph four) and thematic anchor (final paragraph). The concept frames Miriam's motivation and justifies the ritual, meeting setup. However, it remains abstract and thematic rather than shaping on-page tactics or decisions—no choice hinges on analog versus digital properties, no cost is tied to preserving physical form. The scarf's reawakening demonstrates the concept but does not test it. Present across beats, thematically coherent, but ornamental to stakes: mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is declared in paragraph one and echoed in "eccentric dedication" near the end (setup and payoff). The trait justifies Miriam's odd-hour preference and ritual practice, but no on-page action depends on being eccentric rather than merely dedicated. No choice is enabled or constrained by this specific attribute, and no cost accrues from it. The label decorates her role without driving a beat. Present, logically consistent, swappable with "dedicated" or "unconventional" with minor edits: cap 3.8 per the swappability rule.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Reawaken" is Miriam's stated goal ("the reawakening began," "this demonstration that narrative existed… waiting to be found"), performed through the ritual (development), and completed when the scarf glows and the woman retrieves it (payoff). All three gates are met. The action defines the story's central event and closure image. However, the reawakening succeeds without complication or cost—no failed attempt, no price paid—making it demonstrative rather than contested. The woman's arrival at 3 AM is foreshadowed ("as Miriam had known she would"), reducing causal tension. Essential to closure but low-friction: upper 6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is introduced in paragraph one as the library's architecture (setup), invoked during the ritual where "the hyperbolic geometry of the room seemed to respond" (development), and present when the scarf casts "geometric patterns" (payoff). All three gates are met. The method justifies the library's impossible design and Miriam's theory, but its mechanics remain vague—how does curved space "contain and amplify" narrative? No choice depends on geometric properties versus any other symbolic framework. The method is thematically coherent but functionally ornamental: upper 4s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Midnight Library's hyperbolic corridors and circular reading room are established in paragraph one (setup), the room's inward-curving walls host the ritual and "seemed to respond" (development), and the geometric patterns cast by the scarf's glow charge the final image (payoff). All three gates are met. The setting's impossible architecture provides the unique venue for the reawakening and Miriam's three-decade practice, and the circular room's geometry is specified as essential ("the building's geometric heart"). The library constrains where the ritual can occur and supplies the spatial logic for narrative accumulation. Strong across all three gates, modest causal pressure: mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Patrons browsing is mentioned in paragraph three ("throughout the evening") and recurs in the final paragraph ("patrons continued their quiet browsing"), meeting setup and payoff. However, the timeframe remains decorative—no patron interaction pressures Miriam's ritual, no browsing schedule tightens her window, and the woman's 3 AM return is predicted rather than creating urgency. The browsing creates "observed solitude" (tone) but does not constrain tactics or alter decisions. Two gates, thematic function, zero causal pressure: low 3s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation—"to find the place where stories live"—is declared in paragraph one as her thirty-year theory, invoked in paragraph four ("the place where stories lived"), and affirmed in the final paragraph as "purpose fulfilled." All three gates are met. The desire drives her ritual performance and frames her career arc. However, the motivation is never tested or conflicted—no competing want, no friction between cost and goal, no moment where she questions or adjusts her method. The woman's need provides the immediate stake; Miriam's quest remains backdrop. Present across beats, causally weak, told rather than dramatized under pressure: mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Observed solitude" is named in paragraph three and recurs in the final paragraph, framing the library's atmosphere (setup and payoff). The tone is coherent throughout—quiet, contemplative, marked by "the sense of being witnessed while remaining profoundly alone"—and modulates during the ritual as attention focuses and the room responds. The tone charges the ending by sustaining the paradox of communal privacy. However, it remains static rather than shifting under pressure, and the final paragraph reasserts it without transformation. Coherent, purposeful, insufficient modulation for high scores: mid-6s.</comment>
