<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's role as "culture shock absorber" is stated but her internal contradiction between preserving community and accepting inevitability shows some depth. The foundation stone chip is handled physically and emotionally, grounding her purpose. However, her competence is never tested by genuine failure—she paints symbols with assured purpose but faces no on-page cost that would deepen characterization. The grandmother's teaching and Mira's fluency in the cipher feel convenient rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Mira moves through the carnival painting symbols, building a network through density and pattern. Orientation is clean (Verada, Flotilla District, carnival night). The closure is a Charged Poise moment—"tomorrow, the investors would return" to find "a living network, reorganized and ready"—but the cost remains conceptual and future-tense rather than felt on the page. The stone chip's shift from "relic" to "promise" is asserted in narration, not dramatized through a concrete choice or forfeiture that changes her present stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The raft city carnival is vividly anchored with sensory detail—creaking rafts, glass platforms, gilded barges, clicking shoes. The setting's duality (old wood vs. new glass) mirrors the thematic tension and the canals function as both literal and metaphorical channels. The foundation stone chip constrains Mira's emotional geography and the graffiti locations (ferry dock underside, food stalls, flickering lantern) are specific enough to feel inhabited. The carnival's music modulates with her emotional state in the final beat, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protecting community from displacement—is clear early. Mira's tactic (resurrecting the graffiti cipher) is purposeful but never meets on-page resistance or complication. The investors tour but don't interact; no reversal forces her to adapt. The escalation is textural (more symbols painted, more reach implied) rather than causal pressure that narrows her options. The ending asserts readiness without showing a trade-off: what did she forfeit, miss, or risk by working alone through the night?</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of community foundation versus commerce emerges through the stone chip and graffiti network without overt statement. The dual allegiance—home vs. inevitable change—operates in Mira's reflection and her choice to "shape how gentrification unfolded" rather than stop it. The final image of the stone chip shifting from relic to promise offers a non-literal answer, though the reweighting is told ("felt less like a relic and more like a promise") rather than shown through a concrete action. The cipher as living tradition vs. aesthetic spectacle carries conceptual resonance but lacks friction or ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV, stable third-person limited with consistent perceptual signature: Mira notices patterns, maps displacement, catalogs faces—all aligned with her "orderly intuitive" trait. The narration stays within her knowledge and the diction fits her cultural fluency ("perpetual carnival," "Flotilla District," "foundation stone chip"). No head-hopping. The phrase "orderly intuitive rhythm" in paragraph two edges toward diagnostic labeling but is anchored in observable action (cataloging, noting, mapping). Psychic distance is controlled; no filter-verb stacks or voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is clear and sensory with varied sentence rhythm. Information density is high in the opening paragraph (raft city, carnival, dual role, apartment location, stone chip, Market Hall dismantling). Minor scaffold appears: "She needed to reorganize not just the physical space, but the community's response" restates the prior beat without adding pressure. The calliope callback and stone-chip reprise ("less like a relic and more like a promise") rely on explicit interpretation rather than image alone. No major loops or template cadence, but some telling replaces scene work in the final paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The gentrification-via-secret-language premise offers a fresh angle and the raft-city carnival is a memorable setting. The cipher-in-decorative-patterns concept is specific and non-generic. However, the core arc—lone organizer painting symbols to rally resistance—follows a familiar activist template without complication or subversion. The investors remain faceless and no reversal tests Mira's approach. The transformation from "relic" to "promise" is conceptually satisfying but predictable in hindsight, lacking the felt risk or surprise that would elevate ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira is introduced as "culture shock absorber" in the opening sentence, her role framing the entire piece (setup). She makes the decision to resurrect the graffiti cipher and acts on it through the night (development). Her stance—shaping rather than stopping gentrification—crystallizes in the final paragraphs (closure participation). However, her choices don't create reversals; she executes a plan without friction. The role is present across all three gates but functions more as premise than causal engine. Swappability is moderate—another organizer role would fit with minor edits. Two beats (decision to paint, final assertion of readiness) but no visible cost tied to her specific role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip appears in paragraph one (setup), is described as "cold and jagged" and handled physically ("sat in her pocket"). It reappears in paragraph four ("pressed against her thigh, grounding her in purpose") during the graffiti work (development). In the final paragraph it shifts meaning from "relic" to "promise" (closure participation). Three distinct beats with early signal and a lyric reprise that reweights. However, the chip doesn't constrain a choice or enable a tactic—it's symbolic grounding, not a tool. The reweighting is narrated ("felt less like...more like") rather than shown through action. Specificity is high (piece of Market Hall) but swappability is moderate; another artifact of the old community would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dual allegiance is named explicitly in paragraph five: "caught between the only home she'd ever known and the inevitable tide of change." It shapes Mira's tactic—"negotiate terms rather than simply surrender"—so it affects approach (development). The ending reinforces the duality: "reorganized and ready" implies engagement, not retreat (closure linkage). Setup occurs mid-story rather than early (second third), and the concept is more thematic stance than on-page pressure. It's named and reflected upon but doesn't create a choice dilemma with visible cost—Mira never wavers or sacrifices one allegiance for the other. Swappability is low (the specific tension is integral) but dramatization is thin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" is introduced in paragraph two ("her mind working in its characteristic orderly intuitive rhythm—cataloging faces, noting which rafts they lingered near, mapping the geography"). It appears again implicitly in her methodical painting ("moved through the carnival with purpose"). Setup is clear, development shows the trait in action, but there's no cost or constraint tied to it—no moment where intuition conflicts with order or where the trait limits her. It's a label that describes her competence without friction. One beat (the cataloging/mapping moment) with no closure linkage. Swappable with "methodical" or "strategic" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Reorganize" is signaled in paragraph two ("she needed to reorganize not just the physical space, but the community's response") and drives the entire second half: painting symbols, spreading the network, preparing for negotiation (development across multiple beats). The action shapes the ending: "a living network, reorganized and ready" (closure). Early signal, causal pressure across three beats (decision, execution, final stance), and the ending depends on this exact action. Strong irreplaceability—"mobilize" or "unite" would shift the mechanics. However, the reorganization is completed without friction or cost, which limits the ceiling. No visible price or trade-off for working alone through the night.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method (graffiti cipher) is introduced in paragraph three ("the cipher hidden within the carnival's decorative patterns") and enacted in paragraph four with specific symbols (spiral, interlocking circles, coordinate dots). Setup by ~40%, development across one full beat (the painting sequence), and the method shapes the ending assertion ("they would find...a living network"). The cipher's mechanics matter: founders designed it, Mira resurrects it, symbols carry warnings and coordinates. Two beats (introduction and execution) with closure linkage. High specificity and low swappability—removing the graffiti would break the story's logic. No on-page cost tied to the method (no risk of discovery, misinterpretation, or failure).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The perpetual carnival on a raft city is introduced in the opening sentence and anchors every beat: Flotilla District location, old rafts vs. glass platforms, canals, fortune teller's tent, ferry dock, food stalls, flickering lanterns (setup and continuous presence). The setting supplies the graffiti medium (decorative patterns founders embedded) and the community geography Mira navigates (development). The carnival's music modulates with her work and the ending image ("a living network, reorganized and ready") depends on the floating, interconnected structure (closure). Strong irreplaceability—a static city would lose the raft-to-raft trust metaphor. Micro-setting elements (dock underside, lantern) constrain her graffiti placement. Three gates met, causal pressure across multiple beats, high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe ("before privatization") is stated in paragraph one ("once the developers privatized the entire canal system") and creates urgency: "Tonight, the carnival's energy vibrated with tension" and "Tomorrow, the investors would return" (setup and closure). The window tightens her action to one night of graffiti work (development). However, the deadline is conceptual—no on-page pressure shows time running out, no moment where she must choose speed over care or risk being caught before dawn. The timeframe frames the scenario but doesn't constrain her tactics. Two beats (tonight/tomorrow) with closure mention but minimal cost tied to time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation (navigating gentrification) is introduced in paragraph one (investors, privatization threat) and paragraph two (Mira watching investors tour properties). It drives her decision to paint symbols and her stance of shaping rather than stopping change (development). The ending crystallizes the navigation: "negotiate terms rather than simply surrender" (closure). Setup is early, the motivation threads through the piece, and the final assertion depends on it. However, the navigation is entirely internal—no on-page friction between wanting to preserve and accepting inevitability. She commits to one path without visible sacrifice or competing desire. Two beats (observation, action) with closure linkage but no dramatized conflict between wants and costs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone blends hopefulness (grandmother's teaching, "moment of hope," "promise") with desperation (threat of displacement, "tension," working alone through the night). The carnival's energy "vibrated with tension" and the music "growing deeper, more urgent" modulate tone with pressure (development). The ending balances both: "reorganized and ready" (hope) but "absorbed the weight of that responsibility" (desperation) (closure). Setup in paragraph two, coherent modulation through the graffiti sequence, and the final image carries both registers. However, desperation is more asserted than felt—no on-page moment where Mira's composure cracks or her hope wavers under cost. Two beats with closure charge but limited friction.</comment>
