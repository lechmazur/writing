<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is dense and specific, anchored in concrete details (the geode, the act of urination, the scorch marks). Motivation is consistent—hunting unused potential through perturbation theory—though the internal contradiction between overthinking and the need to search feels more stated than enacted in scene. The "perturbation theory applied to existential crisis" frame yields micro-choices (holding the geode up to the window, watching the ruins), but the piece leans heavily on reflective processing rather than pressure-tested decisions. Embodied emotion appears in the geode warming in the palm, but much of the grief and survival guilt remains at the level of articulate philosophical musing rather than contradictory impulse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece is anchored early (floating observatory, wedding survivor, watching circuit breakers cool) and sustains an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through looped meditation on unused potential, with the geode as a recurring image. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the final sentence reweights the hunt itself as the only possible stance, with cost visible in "the hunt that will never end but must continue anyway." The cost is conceptual and existential rather than a decisive action, which fits the lens. Minor causality slips (the geode "grows warm" without clear trigger; the "particular purple of a sun that set years ago" introduces temporal confusion) and the lack of a sharp turn or tightening beyond accumulation keep this out of the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating observatory is vivid and purposeful: electromagnetic cables, artificial light scattering through the geode, the ruins below. The geode itself functions as micro-setting, charged and handled across beats. Sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's philosophical lens (scorch marks "like deliberate camouflage," crystals scattering light "into geometries that feel almost like answers"). The body and object constrain choice minimally—holding the geode is contemplative rather than instrumental—but the setting charges the final image and sustains tone throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why some calculations resolve and others dissolve—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation is textural rather than causal: density increases through looped meditation, the geode warms, the circuit breakers cool. No sharp reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the piece accumulates rather than escalates. The cost at closure is conceptual ("bleak exhilaration," "the hunt that will never end") and felt, but the pressure remains contemplative and does not force a visible forfeiture or decision that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: unused potential, the mathematics of destruction, the geode as a sleeping god, the wedding as a before/after line. The final image—holding the geode up to the light, watching it scatter into "geometries that look, for just a moment, like answers"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the juxtaposition of mundane survival (urinating behind olive trees) and cosmic indifference. The piece resists tidy resolution and commits fully to its bleak exhilaration. Minor issue: "perturbation theory applied to existential crisis" and the explicit articulation of the hunt's purpose edge toward thematic echo, though they remain character-voice rather than authorial.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: philosophical, dense, image-driven, with purposeful compression ("things that were there and are not, things that were not there and are"). Psychic distance is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (mathematical metaphors, the geode as anchor) is consistent. The prose modulates under pressure—short bursts ("She was right. She was also dead now, and I was alive") against longer, looping meditations. Minor issue: some figurative language edges toward over-density ("the sky outside the observatory's windows burns with the particular purple of a sun that set years ago" introduces temporal confusion without payoff). No dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift; information density is high. The geode beats are vivid and propulsive. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "unused potential pools" is restated three times across the piece; "things that were there and are not, things that were not there and are" is echoed in "futures that never activated, possibilities that aborted mid-sentence, lives that were calculations this universe chose not to complete." The final paragraph runs long with multiple appositives that restate the hunt without advancing it. Stock phrasing: "false comfort of purpose," "bleak exhilaration" as a label. These loops and template cadences dull momentum and trigger −0.6 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—wedding survivor hunting unused potential through perturbation theory on a floating observatory—synthesizes familiar grief with a fresh conceptual frame. The geode as both inheritance and talisman, the detail of urination as mundane survival, and the circuit breakers as a temporal anchor are specific and non-obvious. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows its implications without retreat. Minor hedging: the "bleak exhilaration" label and the explicit articulation of the hunt's purpose edge toward explaining rather than embodying. The emotional truth and human complexity elevate the piece despite the somewhat abstracted frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The survivor is named early, drives all reflection, and the decision to "hunt differently" through perturbation theory frames the piece. The narrator's choices are contemplative rather than action-driven: holding the geode, watching the ruins, articulating the hunt. The final image—holding the geode up to the light—is a micro-choice that reweights prior material. Two gates (setup, closure); middle development is reflective rather than action-based. The character is essential but decisions do not sharply alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The geode appears in the opening line, is handled in multiple beats (palm, pocket, burned but untouched, held up to the window, grows warm), and charges the final image. Its properties—rough exterior, sleeping god, crystals scattering light—constrain the narrator's meditation and provide the closure image. All three gates; causal pressure; closure linkage; specificity. The geode is indispensable to the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept appears in the final paragraph as an explicit label ("the unfiltered awakening I could not avoid"). It is seeded earlier in "the geode sits in my palm like a sleeping god finally waking," but its mechanics—what "unfiltered awakening" means in terms of stakes or tactics—remain abstract. The concept charges the final image and reweights the hunt, but it does not shape on-page choices or narrow options. Two gates (seed, closure); development is absent. Lyric reprise with thematic resonance but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The attribute is introduced early ("intangibly tangible in my grip—present yet elusive, solid yet whispering of something beyond physics") but remains descriptive rather than action-shaping. It does not constrain or enable a choice with cost; it labels the geode's paradoxical quality without dramatizing a tradeoff. The attribute is ornamental and could be removed without breaking the story's logic. One gate (setup); no development or closure participation beyond metaphorical resonance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hunt is named early ("I hunt differently. I hunt through perturbation theory") and sustained as the dominant stake. The narrator's contemplative action—watching, holding, reflecting—drives all beats and frames the closure. The final image ("the hunt that will never end but must continue anyway") redefines the narrator's stance with cost. All three gates; causal pressure; closure linkage. The hunt is essential, though its execution is contemplative rather than kinetic, which fits the Accumulative lens but limits irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Perturbation theory is named early and its mechanics are described ("the mathematics of small changes rippling into impossible futures," "every action perturbs every other"). It frames the narrator's meditation and provides the conceptual lens for the hunt. However, it does not shape a specific on-page choice or tactic; it remains a metaphor rather than a method with dramatized mechanics. Two gates (setup, closure); middle development is thematic rather than causal. Functional but somewhat replaceable with another philosophical frame.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The floating observatory is named early and provides spatial coherence: tethered by electromagnetic cables, forty thousand feet, observation window, artificial light. It supplies the vantage for watching the ruins and the geode's light-scattering. The setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—the narrator could reflect anywhere—but it charges the final image and supports tone. Two gates (setup, closure); no middle development where the setting pressures a decision. Solid integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is introduced early ("watch the circuit breakers cool, to monitor the gradual dissipation of heat") and mentioned at midpoint and closure ("The circuit breakers cool below us, their red LED status lights fading to amber"). However, it does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the cooling is descriptive rather than a live clock that alters moves. Two gates (setup, closure); no middle development where the timeframe pressures tactics. Functional but swappable with any other ambient temporal marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation is named early ("I'm hunting the reservoirs of what-might-have-been, the pools of unused potential") and sustained throughout. It is dramatized in the narrator's choices—holding the geode, watching the ruins, articulating the hunt—and the final image reweights it with cost ("the hunt that will never end but must continue anyway"). All three gates; causal pressure; closure linkage. The motivation drives all reflection and the final stance, though the friction between want and cost is felt rather than kinetically tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tone is named explicitly ("This is bleak exhilaration") and enacted throughout: the mundane survival detail, the philosophical density, the geode as both hope and futility, the final image's simultaneous futility and necessity. Tone modulates with pressure—short bursts of grief ("She was right. She was also dead now") against looping meditations—and charges the closure. All three gates; coherent through turns; the final image crystallizes the tone. Minor issue: the label "bleak exhilaration" is stated rather than purely embodied, but the execution supports it strongly.</comment>
