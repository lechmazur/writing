<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Yara's interior life shows concrete grounding through plant-hearing ability and family history, with credible fear driving her silence. However, the final choice lacks visible cost: unsealing the chamber reads as consensus affirmation rather than a renunciation that forecloses another path. Anya's "insurgent" label is asserted without internal contradiction or embodied stake, and the embryo's "pulse" at closure replaces character agency with magical ratification.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors appear by ~180 words (greenhouse, post-eruption reconstruction, Yara and Anya present). The dominant lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration attempted at closure. However, the ending delivers theme statement ("the courage to evolve what they had been given") rather than a concrete image that reweights prior material with felt cost. The decision to unseal is affirmed by warmth from the embryo—external validation rather than protagonist choice under pressure—weakening closure under any lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting constrains choice (Yara tends it, plants chorus recognition) and volcanic hot springs appear at closure to underscore geologic transformation. Sensory detail (ash clouds, mineral-rich steam, foggy panes, amber fragment) is purposeful and filtered through Yara's plant-awareness. Spatial choreography remains clear despite multiple objects (kite, embryo, greenhouse). The setting participates in the final image, though the hot springs mention feels ornamental rather than tactically essential.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whether to unseal the chamber versus rebury the embryo) is signaled by mid-story. One meaningful tightening occurs when Yara recognizes the kite script as a map and chooses to decode it with Anya. However, the resolution lacks visible cost: plants "calm," the embryo pulses warmth, and the decision reads as mutual affirmation rather than a trade-off that forecloses safety or violates community trust. Pressure coheres but does not narrow options with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of tradition-as-evolution emerges through concrete particulars (sealed embryo, cryptic script, ancestral founders). The plants' recognition and Yara's realization that her gift was "given… specifically for this moment" risk teleological convenience, but the image of "destiny… planted like seeds" integrates organically. The final paragraph edges toward moralizing ("to show her people that the insurgent spirit… had always been about growth") rather than letting the embryo's pulse and held hands carry resonance without thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with Yara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct (plants speak in "colors and temperature shifts," silence valued due to her mother's burning). Diction occasionally inflates under pressure ("hybrid futures and evolved consciousness," "genetic script and ancient wisdom") but recovers quickly. Anya's dialogue carries defiance credibly. The embryo "pulsing with warmth" at closure risks convenient magic rather than POV-earned perception, yet the overall voice texture supports the moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Minor scaffold appears: "the old woman heard the plants… rise up in a chorus" and "Yara felt the plants calm around her, their message complete" are near-paraphrases of the same receptive beat. The phrase "implanted destinies" in Anya's dialogue and "genetic script and ancient wisdom" at closure risk elevated register outside lived speech. No severe loops or artifacts touch the closure image directly, but cumulative minor slips (−0.6 for template phrasing and register drift in peak beats) lower the band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise combines plant telepathy, ancestral seed-bank mystery, and volcanic reconstruction into a coherent whole. However, "hidden chamber beneath the greenhouse," "embryo sealed in amber," and "cryptic script on drifted kite" follow familiar genre templates (chosen-one gift, ancient artifact, map-riddle). The story does not transform these through unexpected moral calculus or lived cost; Yara's decision is validated externally (plants calm, embryo pulses) rather than earned through contradiction or sacrifice. Fresh details (lightning-strike origin, mother burned for witchcraft) add texture but do not fundamentally alter the arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Yara (insurgent grandmother) is present throughout and makes the key choice to decode the script and unseal the chamber. Her insurgency is inherited (mother burned, taught silence) and enacted on-page. However, the final decision reads as consensus with Anya and magical affirmation (embryo pulse, plants calming) rather than a solitary defiant act with visible cost. Setup clear, middle development present (recognition of kite script), closure participation confirmed but agency diluted.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The embryo in amber is introduced early (Anya brings it at dawn), handled on-page (placed in Yara's hands), prompts plant chorus recognition, and pulses warmth at closure—reweighted from relic to "key to the future." Three distinct beats (discovery, recognition, final pulse). However, its closure role is reactive (responds to intent) rather than driving Yara's choice. Strong integration but not indispensable; Yara's recognition of the kite script does the causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Implanted destiny" shapes stakes explicitly: elders demand reburial, Anya defies, and Yara realizes ancestors "created and sealed away" the embryo during their own reconstruction. The concept drives Yara's choice to unseal and is articulated in the script ("destiny could be planted like seeds"). Present in setup (Anya's dialogue), middle (Yara's realization), and closure (embryo as "promise of futures written in genetic script"). Strong conceptual pressure with visible thematic cost (tradition redefined), though closure leans declarative.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Yara's plant telepathy (acquired via lightning strike at age seven) enables three on-page beats: she hears plants speak in colors/temperature, they chorus recognition of the embryo, and they "scream" urgently about the chamber before calming at closure. The trait constrains her silence (fear of witch-burning) and enables the realization that her gift was "for this moment." Setup clear, middle use causal, closure participation direct. Cost is conceptual (breaking silence) rather than physical trade-off, limiting irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unseal" is named as the climactic action ("Help me read the script," "She would unseal the chamber") and opposes the elders' demand to rebury. The choice is signaled mid-story and shapes the ending. However, the actual unsealing occurs off-page; closure is the *decision* to unseal rather than the act itself. Redefines options (tradition as growth vs. stasis) but lacks on-page enactment with immediate consequence. Setup and middle present; closure participation is intentional framing rather than dramatized execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The cryptic script on the kite tail appears mid-story (drifted in overnight), is decoded jointly by Yara and Anya ("together they traced the ancient symbols"), and functions as the map to unseal the chamber. Two beats (recognition, decoding). However, the mechanics are told ("a map… of intention, a guide to unsealing") rather than shown; no false attempts or constraint on method. Present after the first third, functional in middle, shapes ending but could be replaced by any decoding device without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Volcanic hot springs are mentioned in the opening context (post-eruption reconstruction) and return at closure as "mineral-rich steam rising like the breath of the earth," supporting thematic resonance. However, they do not constrain Yara's choice or supply tactical resources. The greenhouse (micro-setting) does more causal work (houses plants, frames the unsealing site). The hot springs function as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure element. Setup present, closure reprise noted, but no middle development or decision constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"During the reconstruction" frames urgency (refugee camps, seed bank establishment, ruins excavation) and is referenced throughout (ash clouds, ancestral home buried, new seed bank). The timeframe pressures Yara's choice implicitly (community rebuilding requires direction) and supplies the kite's arrival ("drifted in through the broken window during the night"). Three beats: setup (post-eruption context), middle (reconstruction as parallel to ancestors' time), closure (sun breaking through ash clouds as hopeful image). Time is thematic scaffold rather than live ticking clock, but coherent across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Yara's motivation—"to evolve tradition with intent"—is dramatized through her internal conflict (fear of witch-burning vs. honoring her mother's memory and the gift's purpose) and externalized in the choice to decode the script with Anya. Anya articulates the principle ("traditions evolve with intent, not without it"), and Yara enacts it ("not to destroy tradition but to fulfill it"). Setup clear (silence vs. revelation), middle friction (elders' demand vs. plants' urgency), closure choice. Friction between safety and transformation is present, though the embryo's affirming pulse reduces felt cost slightly.</comment>
