<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority relies heavily on abstract summary rather than embodied contradiction: "resilient positivity" and "made peace with permanent transience" are asserted labels rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final merger action lacks visible cost or conflict—she steps forward "with her heart steady with purpose" in a moment that should expose doubt or forfeiture. Internal state remains diagnostically smooth ("she felt the universe shudder") without the irrationality or competing impulses that would charge the peak beat. The choice to become "the nexus" feels unmotivated by prior causality; no on-page struggle or trade-off forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The orientation Test is satisfied by ~120 words (ferry, deckhand, spectral grotto established early). However, closure lacks visible cost: Maren's merger succeeds without dramatized forfeiture, injury, or consequence—"the ferry continued its route" and "passengers would return home" soft-reset the stakes. The causal chain from "someone was trying to merge the timelines" to Maren's decision is told rather than earned through on-page pressure or choice. The lens reads Causal-aspiring but key linkages (why now, why her, what price) are elided, and the ending offers Conceptual Repricing without undeniable cost on the page. Apply −0.3 for cost-proof failure and −0.2 for the unmotivated peak choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The spectral grotto, sideways stars, and flickering hull create vivid, purpose-driven sensory anchors filtered through Maren's familiarity ("particular electricity," "quality of silence between stars"). The empty hourglass, ferry rail, and radio function as micro-setting elements that recur and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean across the single continuous scene. Deduct −0.2 for the grotto fading into "ordinary night sky" at closure, which undercuts the world's established instability without causal explanation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—merging parallel timelines—is signaled early via the urgent radio transmission. However, escalation is told rather than dramatized: the "terrible instability that made passengers dissolve at the edges" never manifests on the page, and Maren's decision to "stand at the intersection point" encounters no visible obstacle or complication. The merger succeeds without tactical adjustment, loss, or price; "passengers would return home to lives that had gently realigned" soft-resets consequences. Under the Causal lens, one meaningful tightening is present (radio urgency → decision) but lacks cost clarity at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of transience and acceptance emerges through the empty hourglass, "permanent transient" framing, and the spectral grotto imagery. The final image—"a road with no end and no beginning, only the journey"—attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but tips into overt thematic summary ("ardence that made every crossing worthwhile"). The hourglass reprise charges the ending with purposeful ambiguity. Deduct −0.3 for the penultimate paragraph's moralizing tone ("she had made her peace") that replaces scene pressure with assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; Maren's perceptual signature (measuring "by the quality of silence between stars") is character-specific. However, diction drifts into elevated register under pressure: "the nexus, the point where parallel timelines could touch and recognize themselves" and "universe shudder and sigh" read more lyric-abstract than grounded in Maren's working deckhand idiom. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she could see") cluster in key beats without voice-motivated purpose. No head-hopping; single-POV focalization is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in the opening paragraphs. However, paraphrase loops appear: "permanent transience" / "permanent transient" and "made peace with" recurs without reweighting. The peak beat—"she felt the universe shudder and sigh as the impossible merger began to hold"—stacks abstract nominalizations ("impossible merger," "nexus," "intersection point") that obscure concrete action. Template cadence in paragraph 4: "She had learned…She had learned…" Apply −0.6 for loops and figurative muddle in the closure beat, and −0.2 for the stack of weak nominalizations that dull propulsion at the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The vanishing-ferry-in-fractured-timelines premise offers a fresh synthesis of commuter mundanity and spectral transit. However, the emotional arc (acceptance of transience) and plot structure (urgent transmission → solo heroic fix → successful reset) follow template paths without transformation. The hourglass and "ardent" recurrence gesture toward motif but feel ornamental rather than causally integrated. The merger solution—Maren becomes "the nexus" through unexplained capability—reads as a late rule introduction rather than earned ingenuity. Deduct −0.4 for derivative emotional resolution and −0.3 for convenient heroism that lacks groundwork.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout and makes the decision to merge timelines, but the choice is asserted rather than earned through on-page conflict or cost. "Ardent" appears as a label in two beats (para 4, 6) without constraining tactics. The action occurs but her agency is undermined by lack of visible struggle or trade-off. Two gates met (setup, closure participation) but middle development is summary-only. Apply −0.4 for swappability (any dutiful protagonist could fill this role) and −0.3 for label-only trait use.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The hourglass appears in three beats: introduction (para 2), mid-journey check (para 6), and final reprise (para 8). Its emptiness is thematically charged ("honesty of its emptiness," "measure journeys by the quality of silence") but it never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The object is handled ("checked," "feeling its weight") but remains static—no evolving use or causal pressure. Two gates (setup, closure participation) but missing middle development. Lyric reprise reweights meaning slightly but without cost connection. Apply −0.5 for ornamental recurrence and −0.3 for swappability (any symbolic object could serve).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The vanishing ferry and fractured routes frame the entire story and shape Maren's occupation and the merger stakes. The concept appears in every paragraph and drives the climax action (holding the connection steady). However, the mechanics of vanishing are told rather than dramatized—passengers "barely noticed," the ferry "flickered," but no tactical constraint or visible consequence arises from the instability. Three gates met (setup, development, closure) with strong causal pressure. Deduct −0.4 for summary-only development (the "terrible instability" never manifests on the page) and −0.2 for mechanics that remain abstract at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Resilient positivity" is asserted in para 4 ("carried her through worse nights") but never tested by on-page pressure or cost. The trait enables her to smile at passengers and proceed "with practiced ease" but does not constrain or complicate her decision at the intersection. Label-only mention without visible tradeoff. One gate (setup) only; missing middle development and closure participation. Apply −0.6 for label-only trait and −0.5 for late first functional appearance (para 4, past the 40% mark as a concept).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The radio appears in four beats: station crackle (para 3), parsing urgent transmission (para 3), mid-journey adjustment (para 5), and final use at the intersection (para 7, "pressed to her ear"). The urgent transmission drives Maren's decision and the radio is causally active at closure. Three gates met with strong closure linkage. The radio enables her to become "the nexus" by holding "the connection steady." Deduct −0.3 for the mechanics remaining abstract (how the radio "holds the connection" is told, not shown) and −0.2 for the object being swappable with minor edits (any communication tool could serve).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Interconnected patterns" are mentioned in para 3 ("those interconnected strands of frequency and static") and para 7 ("intricate patterns she had spent years learning to read"). The method shapes Maren's expertise but does not constrain tactics or alter the merger mechanics on the page. Two gates (setup, closure mention) but missing middle development beat. The patterns are decorative rather than causal—removing them would not break the merger logic. Apply −0.5 for ornamental use and −0.4 for summary-only mention at closure (she "felt the universe shudder" without visible pattern-reading action).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The spectral grotto appears in five beats and provides vivid micro-setting throughout. The crystal-and-shadow walls, sideways stars, and the "intersection point" frame the climax action spatially. Three gates met (setup, middle, closure). The grotto constrains Maren's movement (she must reach the intersection) and charges the final image ("spectral grotto fade into ordinary night sky"). However, the setting does not alter tactics or supply resources—it functions as backdrop rather than active pressure. Deduct −0.4 for passive rather than constraining use and −0.2 for the unexplained fade that soft-resets world logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Clocks run sideways" is asserted in para 2 ("Time ran differently here, sideways and slippery") and para 8 ("night stretched ahead like a road with no end and no beginning") but never tightens decisions or alters tactics. No countdown, no temporal pressure that forces urgency at the intersection. Two gates (setup, thematic closure mention) but missing middle development. The timeframe is decorative world-color rather than causal constraint. Apply −0.5 for ornamental use and −0.3 for swappability (any magical time-distortion could replace it).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The desire to merge parallel timelines is signaled in para 3 ("someone was trying to merge the timelines again") and drives Maren's climax action in para 6–7 ("to merge the parallel timelines properly"). Three gates met (setup, middle recognition, closure action). However, the motivation is told rather than conflicted—Maren acts "with her heart steady with purpose" without visible friction between want and cost. The merger succeeds without dramatized trade-off. Deduct −0.5 for lack of on-page conflict (no doubt, hesitation, or competing desire) and −0.3 for summary-only motivation at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Permanent transient" is introduced in para 4 and recurs in para 8 ("she had made her peace with being a permanent transient"). The tone of acceptance and serene duty modulates slightly under the urgent radio pressure (para 3) but returns to static calm at closure. Two gates met (setup, closure reprise). The tone charges the final image ("guide through impossible passages") and coheres across beats. However, the tone does not shift meaningfully under pressure—Maren's emotional register remains diagnostically smooth throughout. Deduct −0.3 for static mood that does not modulate with stakes and −0.2 for the reprise reading as overt thematic summary rather than earned resonance.</comment>
