<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is legible—isolation as suffocation—and the final choice to step through the threshold with the doorknocker ring is clear. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("love could suffocate," "isolation was simply another word for slow suffocation") rather than embodied contradiction. The shadows as "memories made visible" remain ornamental; they watch but do not pressure choices. The arc from severing to reopening is present but the micro-choices that earn the turn are thin on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation arrives quickly (sanctuary, charred timber, doorknocker ring). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: motifs recur (threshold, suffocation, bridges) and density increases toward the ending image. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she steps through carrying the ring into starlight—but the cost is abstract ("suffocating breath of a world") rather than felt in a concrete forfeiture or alteration of tactics. The gasping figure teaching her the lesson feels expository rather than a dramatized reversal that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ashen charcoal sanctuary is vividly anchored and the doorknocker ring's "cold like recognition" is sensory and specific. The threshold's physical erosion—"fading," "boundary growing indistinct"—pressures the protagonist's stance. However, spatial choreography inside the sanctuary is vague; we do not see her handling tools, moving between defined zones, or using the environment to alter tactics. The starlight at the end charges the final image but arrives late without prior constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to remain isolated or reopen contact—is signaled early and sustained. The encroachment and the appearance of the gasping figure introduce pressure, and the protagonist's choice to step through the threshold is on the page. Yet the escalation is abstract; the figure "teaches" rather than forcing a trade-off with visible cost. No live option is foreclosed mid-scene, and the resolution feels more like acceptance than a turn driven by protagonist agency under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme—isolation as another form of suffocation—emerges from concrete images (charred timber, doorknocker, fading threshold). But the final paragraph states the lesson explicitly: "isolation was simply another word for slow suffocation" and "thresholds were meant to exist between states, not to disappear entirely." This moralizing replaces earned resonance. The gasping figure is more allegory than lived particularity, and the shadows function as static symbols rather than elements that constrain choice or accumulate pressure toward the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent lyric register ("tender shadow keeper," "loaded emptiness") that matches the reflective, interior mode. Diction occasionally drifts into abstract therapeutic language ("suffocating to breathe," "careful amputation of something that had grown too heavy") that sits uneasily with the physical world of charcoal and ash. Perceptual signature is present but not character-specific; another narrator might use similar metaphors. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without teaching a pattern or varying cadence under pressure: "thresholds," "suffocating," "drowning," "sanctuary," and "bridges" appear in nearly every paragraph, often in adjacent lines with overlapping meanings. Paraphrase loops are visible: "sanctuary implied safety" / "she had forgotten what safety meant"; "love could suffocate" / "some embraces were simply another form of drowning." Template cadence in the opening ("selecting each charred timber," "creating a space," "she called it") and filter-verb stacks ("she understood," "she had learned," "she understood then") dull immediacy in peak beats. The final paragraph clusters abstract declarations where concrete image would serve better.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—a woman who burned her bridges builds a sanctuary from their remains—offers a striking central metaphor. However, the allegorical frame (shadows as memories, gasping figure as lesson-giver, doorknocker as invitation) reads as template psychological fantasy without fresh inflection. The "suffocating to breathe" paradox is stated repeatedly rather than discovered through specific, non-obvious action. Emotional territory and turns feel familiar; the transformation test suggests swapping names and setting would leave the arc largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The tender shadow keeper is present throughout and makes the final choice to step through the threshold. She is introduced in the opening line, handles the doorknocker ring in the second paragraph, and is the focalizer for all key beats including the encounter with the gasping figure and the closing action. Her decision to open the door and step through is on the page with the doorknocker ring in hand. However, many beats consist of reflection and summary rather than on-page choice under duress; the middle section recounts her past severing without showing present tactical friction. The final choice is narrated cleanly but feels more like acceptance than a turn driven by immediate pressure. Early signal and closure participation are strong; beat involvement is present but observational in the middle third.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The doorknocker ring appears in paragraph two ("found...buried in the ash"), is described with sensory specificity ("cold in a way that felt like recognition"), reappears as the encroachment begins ("the doorknocker ring in her hand had not been buried by accident"), is re-interpreted ("not an invitation to reopen old doors, but a reminder"), and is carried through the threshold in the final action ("carrying the doorknocker ring with her into the starlight"). It is handled in at least four distinct beats and its meaning shifts from invitation to reminder to carried talisman. The object enables the final choice and charges the closure image. Early signal, beat involvement, causal pressure (it prompts her understanding), and closure linkage are all present. However, its mechanics are abstract—"waiting for her to become ready to hear"—and the ring does not constrain a mid-scene tactic or impose a visible cost; it functions more as symbolic permission than functional tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The fading threshold is introduced in paragraph one ("the threshold between her sanctuary and the forest beyond was fading"), recurs as the encroachment's entry point ("the figure materialized at the threshold"), is reweighed mid-story ("thresholds were meant to exist between states, not to disappear entirely"), and anchors the final action ("walked to the fading threshold...opened the door...and stepped through"). The concept shapes the protagonist's understanding and directly alters her final choice. It is not merely thematic; the physical erosion of the boundary creates the pressure that forces her decision. Early signal, beat involvement across at least three moments, causal pressure (the fading compels action), and closure linkage are all strong. The threshold's dual role—physical boundary and metaphor—drives the stakes and the resolution with visible cost (she must leave the sanctuary).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The attribute "burns bridges carefully" is stated explicitly in paragraph two ("she had burned those bridges carefully, methodically") and referenced in the backstory ("each one cut with the precision of someone who knew exactly which connections were slowly suffocating her"). It informs her past actions but does not constrain or enable an on-page present choice with visible cost. The final decision to reopen the door reverses the pattern rather than demonstrating it. The trait is label-only in the present frame; we do not see her burning a bridge or choosing not to burn one under pressure. It shapes backstory and theme but lacks dramatized friction in the live scene.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The encroachment is introduced at the start of paragraph four ("when the encroachment began"), triggers the protagonist's response ("the tender shadow keeper rose to meet it"), brings the gasping figure into the scene, and leads directly to the climactic realization and choice. It is not swappable; the intrusion's nature—carrying "the weight of all the conversations she had refused to have"—is specific to the protagonist's history. The action drives at least two beats (arrival and confrontation) and shapes the closure. However, the encroachment itself is abstract; no concrete object or person breaches the wall, and the mechanics are told rather than shown. Early signal (paragraph four of seven), beat involvement, and closure participation are present, but causal pressure is diffuse.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The method "linking through scars" appears twice: "linking through scars to the wounds that had created them" (paragraph three) and "links through scars that connected her to the person she had been and the people she had loved enough to set free" (paragraph six). It is a metaphor for the shadows' connection to past relationships. It does not shape a present action or constrain a tactic; the protagonist does not perform linking or use scars as a means to achieve a goal on the page. The method is thematic commentary rather than a dramatized process. No early signal (first mention is in the middle third), no beat involvement beyond label, and no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ashen charcoal sanctuary is anchored in the opening line, described with sensory detail ("charred timber," "ashen charcoal walls"), and its physical erosion ("fading threshold") creates the pressure that drives the protagonist's final choice. The sanctuary is not mere backdrop; it is a space she built from burned bridges, and her decision to leave it carries relational and emotional cost. The starlight is introduced at the close and charges the final image. The setting participates in at least three beats (construction, erosion, departure) and shapes the ending. However, interior spatial choreography is vague—no tools, zones, or resources alter her tactics mid-scene—and the sanctuary functions more as metaphor than micro-setting constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after cutting off all contact" is stated in the opening and establishes the story's present as post-severance. It frames the protagonist's isolation but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page; no clock or deadline is live. The narrative spans an indeterminate period (she finds the ring, reflects, encounters the encroachment, and decides) without temporal pressure. The timeframe is backstory context rather than a present constraint. It is mentioned but does not escalate or alter moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach suffocating to breathe" appears late (paragraph four: "what it had to teach about suffocating to breathe") and is restated in paragraph five ("the lesson she had been avoiding"). It is abstract and allegorical; the protagonist does not pursue teaching as a goal with on-page friction. The desire is ascribed to the doorknocker ring and the gasping figure rather than dramatized as the protagonist's own conflicted want. The motivation is told rather than shown through choices that pit it against competing costs. No early signal, weak beat involvement, and the final action (stepping through) is more acceptance than active teaching.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The tone "loaded emptiness" is named in paragraph five ("the loaded emptiness of her sanctuary had felt like peace") and the mood of isolation, stillness, and reflective melancholy is consistent throughout. The prose maintains a lyric, contemplative register with recurring motifs (shadows, thresholds, suffocation) that support the tone. However, the tone does not modulate meaningfully under pressure; the final paragraph's rhythm and diction are similar to the opening, and the emotional temperature stays cool even as the protagonist steps into "suffocating breath." The tone charges the setting and theme but does not shift to heighten the closure image or reflect the cost of the decision.</comment>
