<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to rescue knowledge is stated but her micro-choices under pressure remain abstract—she "traces fingers along spines," "realizes," and "understands" without embodied contradiction or visible cost in the moment. Interior life consists largely of reception and translation rather than competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final "rescue mission" realization arrives as epiphany rather than earned through dramatized friction. No secondary character appears on the page to test her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation debt: who/where/when anchors appear early, but the story remains in summary-dominant mode throughout—Elara moves through chambers, discovers notes, realizes purposes, all recounted rather than dramatized in continuous present pressure. The closure unit (her understanding that rescue means confronting fear of knowledge) reads as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains abstract and asserted rather than felt on the page. Drive lens infers Accumulative/Textural, yet no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs; the final paragraph restates theme without a decisive image that reweights prior material. Apply Cost Proof Test: I cannot point to an exact sentence where the cost of her stance is legible at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore supplies vivid images (spiral ramp, nautilus chamber, infinite shelves) and the mountain's shifting geography is noted, but these details remain atmospheric rather than constraining Elara's choices. The botanical diary as micro-setting object is handled twice (opening and translating near the end), and its specimens frame her vocabulary of loss, which does modestly charge the final approach. Spatial choreography is loose—chambers and passages are named but distances and access points do not shape tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (renegotiate the failed bargain to recover lost wisdom) is signaled, but Elara's escalation consists of summary transit and realization rather than on-page choices that narrow options. The time traveler's failed negotiation is recounted, not witnessed; Elara's counter-proposal is described in principle ("translating specimens into a vocabulary of loss") without a concrete scene where cost or trade-off materializes. No reversal or tightening choice forecloses a live path with visible price. Pressure remains conceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (knowledge, loss, the courage to encounter what is forgotten) emerges from the premise and images, but the final paragraph ("the rescue mission was not to save knowledge from destruction but to rescue humanity from its fear") states the theme outright rather than letting the final image resonate. The botanical diary's shift from preservation to "vocabulary of loss and recovery" offers a modest reweighting. Subtext operates lightly in the guardian's rejection of futures as "probabilities and fears." The closing note of recognition is asserted, not earned through specific prior beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and occasionally archaic ("书架's base" inserts untranslated Chinese without cue, reading as artifact or typo). Register is consistent but abstract—"delicate harmony," "quiet vibration," "crystalline note"—leaning toward placeholder lyricism rather than Elara's perceptual signature. Prose modulates little under the conceptual pressure; sentence rhythm and vocabulary remain uniform across transit and realization beats. No dialogue on the page to assess naturalism or goal pursuit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Clarity is high; no grammar or tense errors. Information density is moderate—many sentences advance atmosphere or concept without altering situation or choice. Paraphrase loop: "She understood now why she had been summoned" / "she understood that the rescue mission" restates theme across paragraphs. Template cadence: "She found…," "She understood…," "She realized…" recurs across beats. Figurative language ("unheard symphony," "crystalline note") appears frequently but remains generic rather than vehicle-specific. Mixed metaphor: "cracks spreading through ice" (frozen) / "rippled through" (liquid) within one clause. Apply patterned-artifact baseline: −0.6 for loops and stems, −0.3 for mixed vehicle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Premise (arcane linguist navigating a sentient mountain library to renegotiate terms with a guardian entity) synthesizes familiar quest and archive tropes without a sharp angle. The time traveler's failed bargain and Elara's botanical-diary translation offer modest specificity, but execution leans on abstract concepts (gaps, absences, unlearned lessons) rather than lived detail. The transformation test: swapping names and the diary for another symbolic object would leave the emotional arc largely intact. No bold structural risk or close-quarters invention that personalizes the frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role as linguist frames her method, but her choices (trace fingers, open diary, translate specimens) remain observational and summary. No on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses an option with visible cost. Setup clear, mid-story involvement functional but replaceable, closure participation asserted rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The botanical diary is handled in two beats: opened at the reading nook and translated near the end into "vocabulary of loss and recovery." This reprise reweights its meaning modestly and links to closure, but the diary's mechanics (how specimens map to words, what translation entails) remain abstract. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, swappability −0.5 (a grimoire or journal could serve similarly).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Rescue missions" is named in the opening (library of unlearned lessons as mythical collection) and restated at closure ("the rescue mission was not to save knowledge…"), but the concept shapes stakes only thematically; no on-page tactic or choice is constrained by rescue mechanics. Setup +0.4, thematic echo only −0.6, closure mention without causal work −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful methods" is mentioned once in paragraph three as past skillset now inadequate; the attribute does not enable or constrain an on-page action with cost. Label-only mention −0.6, no beat involvement −0.5, swappable with "meticulous" or "scholarly" −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Renegotiate" is named as the council's request and Elara's task, but the act of negotiation occurs off-page or in summary ("propose terms," "translating specimens"). No dramatized bargaining scene where renegotiation alters options. Setup +0.5, summary-only use −0.7, closure adjacent but not enacted −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Researching gaps" is signaled in paragraph three (missing catalog entries, empty shelves) and Elara investigates these absences mid-story, but the method's mechanics and payoff remain abstract—no specific gap discovered on the page changes her approach. Setup +0.4, one functional beat (finding empty shelves) +0.4, ornamental rather than causal −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore occupying the mountain is present throughout, supplies vivid images (spiral ramp, nautilus chamber, shifting passages), and the keeper's warning that geography has shifted adds mild pressure. The setting does not constrain a specific choice or force a tactical shift, but the final "single doorway" image charges the closure. Setup +0.6, atmospheric presence across beats +0.7, closure linkage +0.8, causal pressure light −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After the time traveler arrives" anchors sequence: Elara arrives "three days after," the traveler's notes are discovered, disturbances continue. No ticking clock or deadline tightens Elara's choices; the timeframe functions as backstory context rather than live pressure. Setup +0.3, no escalation tied to time −0.6, ornamental −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"To find the library of unlearned lessons" is named as the time traveler's goal and frames Elara's mission (renegotiate access), but Elara's own friction with this desire remains abstract—no on-page moment where wanting the library conflicts with another need or cost. Setup +0.5, thematic presence +0.4, told rather than dramatized −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" is named twice (mid-story and at closure, where passages resolve into "a single, crystalline note"), supplying a lyric through-line. Tone remains elevated and meditative throughout without modulating sharply under pressure. The final musical image charges closure modestly. Setup +0.5, reprise at closure +0.9, static register across beats −0.4, specificity (aural metaphor) +0.3.</comment>
