<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tutor's interiority is consistently filtered through his chess-teaching precision, with embodied details like the worry stone's "single deep dent" grounding his anxiety. However, the piece offers no on-page choice that tests his motivations under pressure; he arrives, sits, reflects, and rises without contradiction or cost. The final "waiting itself was a kind of teaching" reads as self-soothing epiphany rather than earned renunciation, and no micro-choice forecloses a live option. Internal conflict remains asserted in past-tense summary rather than dramatized in present action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored by ~120 words (who, where, when). The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers reflection, image, and motif without causal linkage or situational reversal. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final eclipse metaphor reweighting the covenant, but no on-page cost is legible—the tutor's circumstances, stance, and options remain unchanged from opening to close. The eclipse retreats, but no action, forfeiture, or realization alters what the tutor can or will do next, reducing the ending to thematic summary rather than felt or conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is vividly rendered through sensory detail—"invisible forces compressed and expanded like breath held too long," "stones beneath his feet hummed." The setting recurs across beats and charges the final image ("magnetic currents shift beneath his feet like an exhalation finally released"), creating a coherent spatial and metaphorical anchor. However, the nexus does not constrain any on-page choice or alter tactics; it functions as atmospheric mirror rather than active pressure, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sustaining purpose in exile—is signaled early and held throughout. However, no on-page escalation or tightening occurs: the tutor performs the same reflective stance from opening to close without a reversal, complication, or choice that narrows options. The piece substitutes thematic restatement for pressure, and the final image offers no visible or felt cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift would suffice, but the ending merely echoes the opening's posture without reweighting it through action or renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—finding beauty in difficulty, teaching through silence—emerges from the worry stone, magnetic nexus, and eclipse imagery without overt moralizing. The final paragraph, however, tilts into explicit thematic summary: "to teach without speaking, to understand without being understood, to find beauty in the difficult and call it home" replaces resonant image with stated thesis, triggering a −0.6 penalty. The eclipse metaphor shifts meaning subtly from broken covenant to eventual revelation, but the effect is muted by the surrounding exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the tutor filters experience through chess precision and magnetic metaphor. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("thoughtfully precise," "eclipsed covenant"). However, the prose drifts into elevated, abstract register during peak reflection ("the most profound teachings lived not in what was spoken but in what was waited for"), creating slight distance from embodied urgency. No dialogue present. Sentence rhythm modulates effectively with emotional beats, but filter-verb stacks ("he had come to understand," "he had learned") appear in the final third, applying a −0.3 penalty in Q7 rather than here.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clarity and rhythm are generally strong, with vivid concrete detail ("copper light," "polished basalt"). However, the final paragraph exhibits paraphrase loops and template cadence: "to teach without speaking, to understand without being understood, to find beauty in the difficult" cycles through near-synonyms without added pressure. Filter-verb stacks cluster in high-pressure beats ("he had been," "he had learned," "he had not been sent away"), dulling immediacy. These artifacts trigger −0.8 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The magnetic-nexus-as-exile metaphor offers a fresh synthesis, and the worry stone's "single deep dent" is a specific, grounded detail. However, the core premise—exiled mentor reflecting on lost pupil, finding purpose in solitude—closely matches template arcs without transformation through risk or non-obvious moral calculus. The piece hedges toward safety with balanced, abstract philosophizing rather than committing to a bold stance. The eclipse and magnetic imagery are vivid but deployed ornamentally rather than as irreplaceable causal elements.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The exiled chess tutor is present throughout and his past teaching shapes the reflective content, but he makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or outcomes. He arrives, sits, reflects, and rises—observation without agency. The character is setup early, developed in backstory, but does not participate causally in closure, capping the score at ~4.6. Swappable with "exiled advisor" or similar mentor archetype without structural change, applying an additional −0.8 for replaceability and ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The polished basalt worry stone with dent appears in three beats: opening (turned in palm), middle (pressed to forehead), and close (tucked into robe). It is handled on the page and its "familiar weight and imperfection" is tied to his emotional state. However, the stone does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; it functions as mood anchor rather than causal element. The final tucking gesture does not reweight prior material with new meaning, and the stone could be replaced with any comfort object, capping at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The eclipsed covenant is signaled early, developed through backstory (fractured relationship with the queen), and echoed in the final image ("eclipses ended"). It shapes the thematic stake but does not alter on-page tactics or options. The concept remains metaphorical rather than actionable, and the ending reprises it without reweighting meaning through action or choice. Present across all three gates but ornamental in each, scoring functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully precise" is signaled early, woven into his perceptual filter ("the attribute of being thoughtfully precise had not abandoned him"), and reflected in his syntax and metaphor choices. However, it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait colors narration but remains label-level rather than dramatized through a trade-off or mistake. Present in setup and development but absent from closure participation, capping at ~4.6, lifted slightly by consistent voice texture.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Correlate" appears once in the middle ("reading the unspoken currents," "magnetic forces correlated and canceled") as part of the magnetic metaphor. It does not drive a turn or redefine options; the tutor's reflective stance remains unchanged. The action could be swapped for "interpret," "discern," or similar synonym without altering structure. Late arrival (second third) and ornamental use cap the score at ~3.4, with slight lift for thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Translating silence" is signaled in the middle ("The method by which he survived was translating silence") and echoed at the close ("what was understood in silence"). It frames his survival strategy but does not shape a specific attempt or choice under pressure. The method is told rather than dramatized, and no scene shows him actively translating silence to alter an outcome. Present in setup and closure thematically but absent from actionable development, scoring functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus at twilight is signaled immediately, developed through vivid sensory detail and metaphor, and returns in the final image ("magnetic currents shift beneath his feet like an exhalation finally released"). It constrains his ritual presence ("he had arrived at this place before each phase") and charges the closing beat. However, it does not alter an on-page choice or tactic; it functions as atmospheric crucible rather than active pressure. All three gates present with strong closure linkage but no causal pressure on tactics, placing it in the 6.5–7.0 range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Before the next phase" is mentioned twice (opening and middle: "Before the next phase, he sat"). It establishes a loose deadline but does not tighten decisions or shape tactics—the tutor's actions remain leisurely and reflective. No clock pressure is dramatized, and the phase arrives off-page without consequence. Present in setup and development but not closure, and the timeframe could be removed without altering structure, capping at ~3.4 for ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To discover beauty in the difficult" is stated explicitly in the middle ("his motivation—to discover beauty in the difficult—was not diminished") and echoed in the close ("find beauty in the difficult and call it home"). However, it is told rather than dramatized through a choice that tests the desire against cost. No on-page friction between this want and another pulls his stance. Present across all three gates but as thematic claim rather than embodied conflict, scoring functional but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Hopeful melancholy" is signaled in the close ("The hopeful melancholy that had sustained him") and coheres with the twilight, eclipse, and reflective cadence throughout. Tone modulates subtly with the eclipse's retreat, charging the final image. However, it is stated late rather than demonstrated through rhythm and diction from the opening, and the label itself feels declarative. Strong closure linkage and coherent modulation lift it into mid-band despite late explicit mention.</comment>
