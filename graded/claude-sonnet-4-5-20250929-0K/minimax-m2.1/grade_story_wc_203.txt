<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus's gift is established through concrete, embodied perception (dust patterns, temperature drop, peripheral vision work) rather than label-only exposition. His choice to climb toward the hatch demonstrates agency under pressure, though the "weightless burden" framing occasionally drifts toward poetic abstraction. The internal contradiction between professional assessment and supernatural sensitivity creates authentic tension. Minor slip: "the echoes never guided him falsely" tells rather than showing earned trust through prior cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise: Marcus reaches for the hatch with the mainspring humming, crystallizing his dual role (repair/medium) and the story unwinds into its next phase with visible commitment. The causal lens holds—lights fail, dust analysis leads to the barrel, presence guides him to the hatch—with one meaningful tightening when the echo "pressed closer" and transmitted urgency. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. Cost is felt as Marcus accepts the inevitability of engagement ("he always did") and physically commits by climbing, foreclosing the option to walk away.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office supplies vivid, selective detail (faded posters, collapsed shelf, cracked plaster) that constrains Marcus's investigation and charges the closure image—the hidden hatch becomes legible only through dust-pattern analysis. The mainspring barrel functions as micro-setting, a tactile object whose "stored energy" mirrors narrative tension. Spatial choreography remains clear (counter, back office, ceiling) and the fluorescent failure creates urgency. Sensory hierarchy reflects Marcus's professional lens: structural wear, air movement, particulate evidence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discover what the ceiling hides—is signaled early and tightens when the presence "pressed closer" and Marcus climbs toward the hatch, narrowing options from passive observation to active engagement. The tightening is meaningful: his dual gift (elevator expert + echo-reader) forces the choice to pursue the mystery despite professional boundaries. Cost is visible in his commitment ("he always did") and the physical act of climbing, foreclosing the option to complete the paperwork and leave. One minor friction: the echo's infallibility ("never guided him falsely") slightly undercuts tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: stored potential energy (mainspring, wound tight; echo, waiting decades; Marcus's gift, never released into casual conversation) reweights at closure when Marcus reaches for the hatch and the barrel "hums," all coiled forces about to unwind. The "cracks in the façade" concept integrates as both literal plaster damage and the hidden hatch, plus the circus's false front. No overt moralizing; the final image offers resonance without stating a thesis. The "weightless burden" phrase, repeated, risks becoming a thematic echo but stays grounded in Marcus's embodied experience of the gift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Marcus reads "stories" in cables, dust, and echoes, filtering all detail through professional + supernatural lenses. Diction stays controlled ("particulate matter settling in asymmetrical waves") and voice-consistent even under pressure. The single elision—what waits above—is purposeful and paid off when the echo transmits "images of a night long ago." Distance modulates appropriately: closer during the temperature drop, pulling back for spatial choreography. No head-hopping; Marcus's certainty about the echo's reliability reads as earned inference rather than omniscience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (dust → air movement → hatch outline compressed into one paragraph). Clarity holds throughout with strong verbs ("sputtered," "transmit," "unwind") and specific nouns. Two frictions lower the score: "weightless burdens he carried without complaint" and "the particular silence that follows mechanical surrender" drift toward elevated register at the opening, and the phrase "echoes—impressions left behind by intense human emotion, replaying themselves endlessly like a scratched record" reads as scaffold exposition rather than dramatized discovery. The closing image ("ready to discover what ceilings hid when no one was looking") recharges prior material cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The combination of elevator technician + ghost-seer + abandoned circus + horologist's tool offers fresh synthesis, and the dust-pattern investigation grounds the supernatural in procedural specificity. The "echoes" rather than "ghosts" framing and Marcus's matter-of-fact acceptance create a distinct tonal angle. However, the core premise—sensitive protagonist guided by benevolent presence to hidden secret—follows a recognizable template, and the resolution (reaching toward discovery) stops short of transformation. The mainspring as metaphor for stored narrative energy verges on overt symbolism. Specificity (circus, mainspring, dust forensics) rescues the piece from full derivativeness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marcus is introduced early, his dual skill (elevator tech + echo-reader) shapes the investigation across multiple beats (dust analysis, barrel discovery, ceiling examination), and his decision to climb and reach for the hatch drives closure. The trait is not merely labeled; his professional lens and supernatural sensitivity actively narrow options and guide tactics. Cost is visible in his acceptance of the "weightless burden" and physical commitment to climb. Minor friction: his observation dominates until the final beat, where decision arrives late but decisively.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mainspring barrel appears mid-story when Marcus discovers it beneath debris, becomes a tactile focus ("turned the object over in his hands"), and returns at closure with charged meaning ("hummed faintly... its stored energy sensing a narrative about to unwind"). It functions across three beats: discovery, examination, and closure reprise. The object's core property—stored potential energy—mirrors the narrative's coiled tension and Marcus's gift. Swappability test: another tool or talisman could replace it with minor edits, capping the score below 7.5, but the horologist specificity (precision, wound tight, never released) integrates tightly with theme and Marcus's dual expertise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept "cracks in the façade" operates both literally (plaster damage revealing the hidden hatch) and thematically (the circus's false front, Marcus's dual identity). It shapes Marcus's investigation in the middle beat: the branching cracks guide his attention and enable discovery of the hatch outline. At closure, the hidden hatch—legible only through those cracks—crystallizes the concept's stakes. The concept constrains choice (he must look up, climb, engage) and charges the final image. However, it remains more thematic accent than active driver; removing "façade" language would not break the plot, only soften resonance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Skillfully observant" is established early and demonstrated across multiple beats: dust-pattern analysis, recognizing the mainspring barrel, inferring the hatch from plaster cracks. The trait enables tactics (crouching to catch angles, using peripheral vision for the presence) and drives the investigation forward. Cost appears when observation compels engagement—his gift ensures he "always did" pursue the mystery, foreclosing the option to walk away. The trait is shown through action rather than label-only assertion. Minor friction: while the trait enables discovery, it does not visibly constrain or force a difficult trade-off until the final climb.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Engage" operates as both the inciting condition (Marcus engages with the dust, the barrel, the presence) and the closure commitment ("He would engage with the mystery, of course"). The action is signaled early ("a presence engaging with his attention") and shapes multiple beats: examining the barrel, interpreting the echo's pressure, climbing toward the hatch. At closure, Marcus's decision to reach for the hatch embodies full engagement, altering his role from passive assessor to active participant. The action redefines options and forecloses the professional-only path. Swappability test: "investigate" or "pursue" could replace it with minor tonal loss, capping the score below 7.5, but "engage" specifically captures the reciprocal, supernatural dimension.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dust analysis is introduced early ("dust here told him something interesting") and used actively in the middle beat: Marcus crouches, catalogs asymmetrical waves, infers air movement, and traces the hatch outline through accumulated patterns. The method shapes his investigation and enables the key discovery. At closure, the dust patterns "below" confirm what he now sees above, validating the method's reliability. However, the mechanics remain slightly abstract—"particulate matter settling in asymmetrical waves" lacks the procedural granularity that would make the method feel indispensable. A less specialized observer could notice the cracks without dust forensics, capping the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office anchors the entire story spatially (ticket counter, back office, elevator shaft door, ceiling) and supplies key resources: the collapsed shelf hides the mainspring, the cracked plaster conceals the hatch, the dust accumulation enables Marcus's analysis. The setting pressures Marcus's investigation—darkness after the lights fail, verticality requiring the climb, the office's history (ticket agent, hidden treasure) charging the mystery. At closure, the office's ceiling becomes the active constraint Marcus must engage. The circus element (faded posters, "façade") enriches atmosphere and theme without feeling ornamental. The setting is indispensable; no other location would preserve the investigation's logic or the closure's stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The fluorescent failure ("sputtered their last and died") occurs in the opening line, creating urgency and darkness that force Marcus to use his flashlight, altering his investigative method. The timeframe tightens decisions: dusk gathers, demolition arrives "next week," and the lights' death ensures he cannot defer engagement. However, time does not actively pressure tactics in the middle beats—Marcus's investigation proceeds without a visible clock. At closure, the timeframe's pressure is implied (he must act now, before leaving) but not dramatized through countdown or competing demands. The element shapes atmosphere and initial constraint more than sustained escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marcus's desire "to discover what ceilings hide" is dramatized through his choices: he bypasses the elevator shaft (his official job) to investigate the back office, examines the mainspring, climbs toward the hatch. The motivation is conflicted—professional duty versus supernatural compulsion—and that friction drives the narrative. At closure, his decision to reach for the hatch embodies full commitment to discovery with visible cost (physical risk, foreclosed exit). Minor friction: the phrase "he always did" tells rather than shows the friction between wants and costs, and the echo's infallibility slightly reduces tension. The motivation is shown through action across beats but could carry more on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Weightless burden" is introduced early as Marcus's relationship to his gift and recurs at the middle beat ("settled around him like a familiar coat"). The tone—matter-of-fact acceptance of the uncanny—remains coherent through turns and modulates subtly as pressure rises (temperature drop, echo pressing closer). At closure, the tone charges the final image: the mainspring "hummed faintly" and Marcus reaches upward, both actions carrying stored potential without overt dread or triumph. However, the phrase "weightless burden" risks becoming a static label rather than evolving with pressure. The tone supports the ending's Charged Poise but does not decisively reweight prior material.</comment>
