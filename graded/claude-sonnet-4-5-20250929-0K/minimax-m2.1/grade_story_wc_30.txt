<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Asa is given embodied texture (bronze hands, gears, lamplight eyes) and her motives are clear, but she executes ancient duties without internal contradiction or choice under pressure. The identities she tends remain abstract—thoughts of self seeking shelter—never dramatized as entities that resist or complicate her work. No on-page decision alters her stance or forecloses a path with visible cost; she welcomes, catalogs, and smelts in serene repetition. The final paragraph reiterates her welcome script without deviation, offering no earned change or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The piece orients who (Asa), where (tidal atrium), and what (preserving migrating identities) within the opening paragraphs. However, no on-page closure unit—Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing—is legible. The ending repeats the opening's premise ("here, you may rest") without narrowing options, paying a cost, or reweighting the stakes. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern break or cadence shift reconfigures meaning; the narrative simply circles back to its beginning with identical serenity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is rendered with consistent, evocative detail: brass candelabras, marble channels, wintersun through skylights, seawater rising with lunar devotion. Sensory texture is distributed across senses (salt air, soft whir of gears, shifting light patterns) and filtered through the librarian's patient gaze. The bamboo creel is handled across beats, but the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page. The foundry chamber appears late and functions as backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving identities and wonder in routine—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or internal friction. Asa performs her duties "without fear of vanishing," and the identities arrive "as they always did with each tide" with no complication. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options; smelting days arrive "as reliably as the tide itself" without cost or consequence. The resolution is not earned by protagonist agency but by the repetition of an unchanging ritual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges clearly: wonder survives by accepting routine, contradiction, and migration without forcing continuity. The piece avoids overt moralizing and builds its question through concrete images (the creel, the smelted leaves, the moon-phase fluctuations). However, the ending offers no resonant reconfiguration or non-literal answer; it restates the premise in near-identical language ("here, you may rest; here, you may change"). The final image—Asa continuing her work under unchanging wintersun—does not reweight prior material or impose conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single-POV with stable third-person limited focalization; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent, deliberate rhythm—elevated, meditative diction matched to a timeless librarian perspective. Sentence openings vary purposefully, and the lexicon (titan-gear, wintersun, lunar devotion) feels voice-motivated. However, under peak moments (smelting, the foundry chamber), the voice does not modulate or compress; it maintains the same stately cadence throughout, flattening urgency. Psychic distance remains fixed rather than shifting to serve emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent (water as migration metaphor, gears as continuity, wintersun as permanence), but it pervades nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, risking overwriting. Several lines loop conceptually: "migrating identities" vs. "identities that came seeking preservation," "accepting contradictions" vs. "your contradictions will be accepted." Template cadence appears in the welcoming script ("here, you may rest; here, you may change; here, your contradictions...") which repeats verbatim across paragraphs. The final third recycles the opening's phrasing without tightening, dulling momentum. No clarity break at closure, but pervasive synonym churn and paraphrase loops lower density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of tidal library, mechanical librarian, and migrating identities is specific and non-generic; the bamboo creel holding non-fish selves is a fresh detail. The concept of smelting contradictions into book covers offers a tangible transformation of the abstract. However, the emotional arc and ritualistic structure echo familiar myth-cycle templates (eternal guardian, cyclical acceptance, unchanging serenity) without subversion or trade-off. The wintersun that "held no intention of setting" and the repeated assurance that "everything that migrated here found, at last, a permanent shore" land as reassurance rather than risk, privileging comfort over tension.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Asa is present throughout and performs all key actions (retrieves creel, catalogs identities, carries to foundry, smelts, welcomes new arrivals). However, her decisions do not create turns; she executes ancient duties in unvarying sequence without opposition or internal conflict. Her role is custodial observation rather than choice under pressure. She appears in the closure but repeats her welcoming script without alteration, offering no reweighted stance or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The bamboo creel is handled in multiple beats: retrieved each morning, carried to the foundry, and opened to welcome new identities. Its weave and worn straps are described concretely. However, its function remains static—vessel for identities—without evolving use or charged reprise. The creel does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure; it is present but replaceable with any container.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Migrating identities are the story's premise and shape the librarian's daily work: cataloging, shelving by tide-level, smelting contradictions, welcoming new arrivals. They fluctuate with moon phases and define the atrium's function. The concept appears in the opening, middle (smelting), and closure (new identities arrive with each tide). However, the identities remain abstract and do not force a tactical choice or impose visible cost; they arrive reliably and are accepted without friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Moon-phase fluctuation is mentioned twice: identities grow "bright and articulate during full moons, retreating to near-silence in the dark weeks" and smelting days arrive "with the new moon as reliably as the tide itself." The trait establishes rhythm but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. No choice hinges on moon phase; the cycle is backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Smelting occupies one sustained beat (the foundry chamber paragraph) and is thematically central: Asa smelts "the accumulated contradictions that each identity carried" into leaf-shaped book covers. The action dramatizes the story's method of preserving wonder by accepting and transforming friction. However, it does not create a turn or redefine options; it is ritual execution without complication or cost. The ending does not return to smelting, and the action could be replaced with another craft (binding, inscribing) without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Accepting contradictions is signaled in the opening ("by accepting contradictions, by understanding that a person could be both themselves and another") and restated at closure ("here, your contradictions will be accepted"). The method shapes the library's function and Asa's welcoming words. However, it is never tested or dramatized through conflict; no identity resists or complicates acceptance. The mechanics remain declarative rather than shaping on-page attempts or choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is established early with concrete, recurring detail: channels carved through marble, seawater rising and falling with lunar devotion, brass candelabras, arched skylights, wintersun filtering through water. The setting's tidal rhythm structures the librarian's work (retrieval, cataloging by tide-level, smelting at new moon). It pressures the identities' fluctuations and supplies the foundry's symbolism of preservation. However, the atrium does not constrain a tactical choice or alter outcome; it is atmospheric infrastructure rather than obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After tomorrow disappears" appears once in the opening paragraph as metaphoric framing—"a place after tomorrow disappears, where time pooled in shallow places before draining away." It establishes tone but does not tighten decisions or track as a live clock. No on-page action depends on this temporal condition; it functions as lyric setting detail rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Asa's desire to preserve wonder in routine is stated explicitly in the smelting paragraph: "This was how wonder survived: not by remaining frozen and perfect, but by accepting that routine could hold wonder too." She feels "deep serenity" and "the peace that comes from knowing one's purpose." The motivation anchors her actions (retrieving, cataloging, smelting, welcoming) but is never conflicted or tested; no choice forces a trade-off between wonder and routine, or between preservation and release. The friction the motivation promises does not materialize on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Wintersun serenity is sustained throughout: "steady golden sheets," "patient glow," "deep serenity," "hush of the library," "serene light of a sun that belonged to winter and held no intention of setting." The tone is coherent and consistent with the mechanical librarian's timeless perspective. However, it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image; the ending repeats the opening's calm without intensification or break. The single static mood fits the piece's vision but trends mid-band for lack of tonal arc.</comment>
