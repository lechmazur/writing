<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's jitteriness is established early and embodied through tremors and nervous pieces, but her interior life remains thin—most reflection orbits Mira rather than present contradictory impulses. The final turn (accepting the pendant's lesson) arrives via exposition from Mira rather than Elara's on-page struggle between grief and agency. The "something new underneath the nerves, something steady and certain" is told flatly without micro-choices that dramatize the shift. Mira's spectral presence bypasses earned interiority; Elara reacts but does not wrestle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural (aurora imagery, pendant vibration, memory-to-myth frame accumulate toward a resonant reconfiguration). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara accepts her role as "a courier not just of objects but of possibilities," crystallizing her stance with undeniable thematic pressure. Cost is felt—three years of grief and scattered confidence reconfigured into mission—but the price is abstract; no on-page forfeiture or tactical constraint accompanies the shift. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by paragraph one). The accumulative design coheres, but the final image leans heavily on Mira's monologue rather than Elara's enacted choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ridgeway, aurora, and pendant anchor setting vividly; frost-dusted pines and patchwork valley provide spatial grounding. The aurora actively constrains the encounter—Mira steps "out of the northern lights themselves"—charging the closure image with visual specificity. Sensory detail is selective (wind tugging cloak, cold seeping through gloves) and filtered through Elara's courier eye. Minor: the overlook functions as stage rather than tactical constraint; no physical choice (climb higher, retreat, handle the pendant differently) is shaped by the environment's affordances.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding the pendant's purpose and Mira's absence. Pressure tightens when the pendant vibrates and Mira appears, deepening Elara's grasp of her mentor's lesson. However, escalation is dialogue-driven—Mira explains rather than Elara discovering through action—so agency is diluted. The "fade from memory to myth" frame accumulates atmospheric weight, but no on-page trade-off or reversal forces Elara to choose between grief and mission; acceptance arrives as realization rather than enacted cost. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens is present, but the protagonist remains reactive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: brief encounters extend through vibration, memory germinates into potential, routine becomes legendary. The pendant's shift from inert relic to active symbol is purposeful, and the aurora-as-presence image charges the ending without overt moralizing. Weakness: Mira's monologue ("The pendant germinates what matters") verges on thesis statement, and the final paragraph's "already thinking about who she would meet next" dilutes ambiguity with programmatic certainty. The concept of "coaxing wonder from the routine" resonates but is stated more than dramatized through Elara's choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyric, with strong perceptual signature ("the cold seeping through her bones—but it didn't hurt. It felt right, the way a key feels right in a lock"). Psychic distance modulates effectively between close interiority and atmospheric sweep. Minor slips: "across the fade from memory to myth" is repeated as both frame and phrase without evolving meaning, and Mira's dialogue ("Everything I taught you is still in there") edges toward workshop-speak rather than voice-specific idiom. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The final paragraph's syntactic uniformity (three "was still" clauses in succession) creates template cadence at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmic with strong figurative work ("the aurora painted everything in ghostly greens," "roots of something waiting to break through soil"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or theme. Template cadence surfaces in the final paragraph: three successive clauses using "was still" and "keep [verb]ing" create a drumbeat that flattens propulsion. Minor paraphrase loop: "The pendant doesn't preserve encounters. It extends them" immediately restated as "brief encounters were never meant to end. They were meant to keep echoing." Stock metaphor: "seeds," "germinate," "roots" cluster without fresh specificity. No major clarity issues; the closure image is legible despite these slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dragonfly-wing pendant and sympathetic vibration offer fresh specificity within the mentor-loss frame, and the aurora-as-portal image is vivid. Core emotional arc (grief transformed into mission) is familiar but executed with lyric control. Weakness: the mentor-returns-as-vision to deliver wisdom is a well-worn template, and Mira's monologue rehearses the prompt's thematic language ("extends brief encounters," "germinate," "coax wonder") without transformation. The ending's programmatic certainty ("already thinking about who she would meet next") substitutes mission statement for surprising resonance. Risk-taking is modest; the piece opts for atmospheric elegance over structural or moral challenge.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara the jittery courier is present in all three beats (climbing, encountering Mira, descending) and her trait (jitteriness) frames the opening and closing. Her decision to hold the pendant up to the aurora triggers the encounter. However, the climactic turn is reactive—she listens to Mira's explanation and accepts it—rather than a choice that alters tactics. The "jittery" trait persists unchanged ("some things didn't change") with only an additive layer ("something steady underneath"), so no visible cost or foreclosed path. Setup early +0.5, beats +0.9, causal pressure (triggers encounter) +0.5, closure linkage (descending with new purpose) +0.5, but reactive at peak and no visible trade-off cap gains: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The pendant appears in four distinct beats: opening (bouncing against chest), ridgeway examination (tilting to light), vibration/Mira encounter (humming, singing), and closing (warm against palm, still vibrating). Its "translucent wings veined with gold that pulse" and sympathetic vibration are specific and irreplaceable. It enables the encounter (middle) and charges the final image (ending). Setup +0.6, beats (four) +1.4, causal pressure (triggers vision) +0.8, closure linkage (warm, vibrating, teaching/learning) +1.0, specificity +0.6, cost connection (Mira's teaching germinates) +0.4 = strong integration across all gates. Minor cap: the pendant's mechanics ("vibrating sympathetically") are explained by Mira rather than discovered through Elara's trial, slightly reducing irreplaceability. 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Absent mentor Mira is signaled in paragraph one ("vanishing into the Thornwood," "three years since") and dominates Elara's interiority throughout. Mira's spectral return shapes the middle encounter and delivers the thematic lesson that reweights Elara's mission. The absence creates Elara's grief and scattered confidence (stakes), and the encounter resolves it into purpose (closure). Setup +0.7, beats (memory, vision, closure) +1.1, causal pressure (absence = grief = need for resolution) +1.0, closure linkage (Mira's lesson germinates Elara's future) +1.2, cost connection (three years of grief) +0.5. Friction: the vision undercuts "absence"—Mira is present on the page for a third of the story, diluting the concept's constraint. −0.8 for resolving the absence by making Mira present. 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Extends brief encounters" is the pendant's function, explained by Mira: "The pendant doesn't preserve encounters. It extends them, by vibrating sympathetically with what's real." It enables the Mira encounter (middle) and reframes Elara's courier work (ending). Setup: implied early (pendant carried "a hundred deliveries"), explicit at midpoint +0.4, beats (encounter, realization) +0.6, causal pressure (enables vision) +0.7, closure linkage (Elara will "extend" future encounters) +0.8, cost connection (grief extended into mission) +0.4. Friction: the attribute is told by Mira rather than demonstrated through Elara's on-page trial, so the trait feels label-only until explained. −0.5 ornamental. 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Germinate" surfaces explicitly in Mira's dialogue ("The pendant germinates what matters") and Elara's closing mission ("Germinate something. Make people wonder"). The metaphor seeds earlier ("As potential. As seeds") and roots the final image ("roots of something waiting to break through soil"). It reweights the pendant's function from preservation to growth. Setup (seeds metaphor) +0.5, beats (Mira's speech, closing mission) +0.6, closure linkage (Elara will "germinate something") +1.0, specificity (organic growth vs. static memory) +0.5. Friction: "germinate" is stated three times in the final third without enacted demonstration—Elara does not germinate anything on the page, only resolves to do so. −0.5 summary-only. Late first explicit mention (final third) −0.5. 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sympathetic vibration is signaled midpoint ("vibration traveled up her arms"), explained by Mira ("by vibrating sympathetically with what's real"), and charges the ending ("the pendant warm...its wings still vibrating"). The mechanism enables Mira's appearance and reframes the pendant's function. Setup (vibration at aurora) +0.5, beats (trigger, explanation, closure) +0.9, causal pressure (enables encounter) +0.8, closure linkage (vibration continues, teaching) +0.9, specificity (physical resonance with truth/memory) +0.6. Friction: the method is told by Mira rather than discovered; Elara does not test or learn its mechanics through trial. −0.4 ornamental discovery. 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway is anchored in paragraph one and sustained throughout: sparse pines, frost glitter, overlook, patchwork valley, aurora as "green fire." The aurora supplies Mira's entrance ("stepping out of the northern lights") and charges the ending image ("The aurora danced overhead"). The climb pressures Elara's decision to examine the pendant. Setup +0.7, beats (climb, encounter, descent) +1.1, causal pressure (isolation enables private ritual) +0.7, closure linkage (aurora as teaching medium) +1.3, specificity (aurora as threshold, not postcard) +0.7. Minor: the ridgeway itself (as opposed to the aurora) does not alter tactics—Elara could have this encounter elsewhere. Still, the visual environment is indispensable to the encounter's texture. 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across the fade from memory to myth" is the framing phrase, repeated in opening and closing. It describes the thematic arc but does not tighten decisions—no clock, no urgency, no trade-off between waiting and acting. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than tactical. Setup (opening phrase) +0.4, closure linkage (repeated in final paragraph) +0.6, thematic charge (memory → myth reweights the pendant's meaning) +0.5. Friction: the phrase is label-only; the "fade" does not constrain Elara's choices or alter the encounter's timing. −0.7 ornamental. Swappable with "journey" or "shift" without structural loss. −0.5. 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "coax wonder from the routine" is implied early (she carries the pendant through "a hundred ordinary handoffs that somehow felt incomplete") and made explicit by Mira ("keep coaxing wonder from the routine of ordinary things"). It drives the closing mission ("Make people wonder"). Setup +0.6, beats (incomplete deliveries, Mira's lesson, closing resolve) +0.9, causal pressure (grief over incomplete work fuels the ridgeway vigil) +0.8, closure linkage (becomes explicit mission) +1.0, cost connection (three years of scattered confidence) +0.5. Friction: the motivation is told by Mira rather than demonstrated through Elara's on-page friction between safety and risk. −0.5 label-only. Still, it coheres with the dominant stake. 6.9.</comment>
