<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior texture is consistent—artist's perception shapes her noticing throughout. The shift from fragmentation-as-curse to fragmentation-as-gift is dramatized through her hands-on work with the cards, and the final stance (redesigning herself) carries cost in that she abandons her prior insistence on singular truths. However, the epiphany "they had always been multitudes" edges toward diagnostic clarity that feels unearned mid-crisis, and the noblewoman backstory remains ornamental rather than driving a present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The lighthouse anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph (waiving Orientation penalty). Pressure builds through the cards' dispersal, the thread-untangling action, and the descent into the chamber; the final image (complete box, perception redesigned) reconfigures Mira's artist identity with felt cost—she forfeits the portraitist's need for single truths. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "the images were not broken—they were waiting to be seen differently," which narrows her options toward acceptance. Cost is legible in the line "rethreading her perception until fragmentation became gift rather than curse," though the conceptual price could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse interior—spiraling shelves, floating books, breathing walls—constrains Mira's descent and pressures her choices; the walls' contraction teaches the pattern early and is paid off when she realizes "they had simply required her to go somewhere smaller to find something larger." The central table and the box function as micro-setting that anchors the untangling action. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "salt and time," "luminescence," "light became something softer." The space evolves causally as she descends, and the "chamber where the walls curved inward" directly supports the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Mira's need to understand and reclaim her fractured artistic vision. The discovery of the scattered cards tightens the problem, and the untangling action deepens when she follows threads downward, narrowing her options toward acceptance rather than repair. The resolution is protagonist-driven—her hands work where her eyes cannot—and the cost is legible: she forecloses the path of singular portraiture. One meaningful turn occurs when she realizes the cards are "waiting to be seen differently." The stakes remain coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the escalation is quiet and the visible price (abandoning her former method) could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—fragmentation as redesign rather than ruin—emerges from the cards, threads, and Mira's hands-on work without overt statement. The final image (complete box, perception rewoven) offers a resonant answer to the central question: "What if multiplicity is not failure?" The lighthouse descent and the "necessary darkness" work thematically without becoming allegorical. Subtext operates in the shifting card images and the walls' contraction. The penultimate insight "When the walls close in, what remains is only what cannot be hidden" risks abstraction, but the closure grounds it in Mira's tactile redesign. No moralizing mars the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices via artist's eyes ("tracking the patterns," "muscle memory of someone who had spent years reading faces"). Diction fits her profession and the lyric register throughout. The rhetorical questions ("or had she?" / "How long had this place existed?") are consistent and purposeful, teaching the pattern early. However, elevated constructions like "the answer kept shifting like watercolors bleeding into one another" and "luminescence of her aching clarity" in peak beats edge toward overwriting that slightly obscures urgency. No head-hopping; focalization remains clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse; no major loops. Information density is strong in the card-untangling sequence. However, the piece carries figurative language in nearly every high-pressure beat without teaching a lyric pattern that would justify the density: "ghost prints," "watercolors bleeding," "threads woven from light and memory," "luminescence of her aching clarity." The final paragraph's "somewhere smaller to find something larger" and "no longer needed fixing" feel slightly scaffolded. Register is consistent with the mystical-realist frame, but the accumulation of metaphor in the descent scene (light "softer," darkness "necessary, not empty but full") slightly dulls propulsion. Proofreading is clean; no grammar errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse-library-tarot synthesis is specific and the ending's reframing (fragmentation as gift) feels earned in hindsight. The artist-who-sees-multiplicity premise is not wholly novel but is executed with lived detail in the card-untangling action. Risk-taking in the mystical-realist frame and the descent structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the "forgotten place between the world's attention" and "walls that breathed" lean on familiar liminal-space tropes, and the emotional arc (crestfallen → enlightened) follows a recognizable template without a sharp counter-pressure that would mark it as bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira (crestfallen portrait artist) is present throughout and her choices drive key turns: she gathers the cards, untangles threads, descends into the chamber, and redesigns her perception. Her artist identity shapes her noticing and her final stance. The "crestfallen" attribute is established early ("hollow where her confidence had been") and directly motivates her search for understanding. She appears in setup, middle, and closure with causal pressure at each beat. Cost is legible: she forecloses the path of singular portraiture. Strong integration, though the noblewoman backstory is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken tarot card box is introduced early ("clasp hanging by a single brass thread, its velvet interior exposed like an wound") and returns transformed at closure ("rested complete in her hands, its threads now woven into a pattern"). It appears in at least three beats: discovery, the untangling process, and the final image. The box's broken state mirrors Mira's fragmented perception and its completion charges the ending. Causal pressure: the box's dispersal creates the problem Mira solves. High integration, though the middle beats focus more on the cards and threads than the box itself, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fragmented reality is signaled early (noblewoman's face "kept fracturing into geometries") and shapes stakes: Mira's inability to hold singular truths drove her here. The concept narrows options in the middle (the cards' imagery "kept shifting") and is directly reweighted at closure ("fragmentation became gift rather than curse"). It appears in setup, pressures the untangling action, and is conceptually repriced in the ending. Causal role is strong. However, the concept functions more as thematic frame than a discrete object or constraint that alters physical tactics, slightly lowering score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rhetorical questions appear three times: "or had she?" (setup), "How long had this place existed?" (early middle), and "The question was rhetorical; she already knew the answer" (middle). The pattern is taught early and marks Mira's self-interrogating voice. However, the attribute does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost; it colors interiority without altering tactics. Present in setup and middle but absent from closure. Functional voice trait but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Redesign" is the action that resolves the story: Mira redesigns not the cards but herself, "rethreading her perception until fragmentation became gift." The verb is seeded early ("This was a redesign waiting to happen") and drives the climax. It is irreplaceable—swapping it for "repair" or "fix" would contradict the thematic turn. Causal pressure: the redesign forecloses her prior method and enables the closure image (complete box). Present in middle and ending with strong integration, though the setup mention is brief.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" is introduced early ("began to untangle the threads") and occupies multiple middle beats: her fingers work, each knot releases luminescence, threads lead her downward. The method is specific and its mechanics matter—muscle memory, not sight, guides her. It shapes her descent and the cards' stabilization. However, the method is partially swappable with similar tactile actions (reweaving, sorting) without breaking logic. Present in setup, middle, and implied at closure (threads now woven), but the ending emphasizes the redesigned perception more than the untangling itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside a lighthouse is introduced in the first paragraph and pressures every beat: the spiraling shelves, floating books, contracting walls, and the descent chamber. The setting enables the card discovery, constrains Mira's movement (she must descend to follow threads), and charges the final image ("walls had not closed in after all"). It supplies the "necessary darkness" that frames the closure. Environment alters tactics and is irreplaceable. Present in setup, multiple middle beats, and closure with strong causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"When the walls close in" is invoked once in the middle ("The walls of the library seemed to contract slightly with each breath she took") and reprised at closure ("the walls had not closed in after all"). The timeframe establishes urgency and is reweighted in the ending. However, the temporal pressure is more metaphorical than clock-driven; no live ticking constraint alters her moves beat-by-beat. The phrase functions as thematic frame rather than a tracked, tightening deadline. Lyric reprise with cost at closure, but limited causal pressure in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To descend into necessary darkness" is dramatized on the page: Mira follows threads downward into a chamber where "darkness here was necessary, not empty but full of the kind of silence where lost things could be heard." The motivation is established ("She understood now why she had come") and drives the middle action. However, the desire is more realized than conflicted—no on-page friction between wanting descent and fearing it. Present in middle and closure, with thematic charge, but the lack of visible internal conflict or cost during the descent lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" (or close variants) appears throughout: "luminescence" (cards glowing), "aching clarity," "light became something softer." The tone is coherent, modulates with pressure (brighter as she untangles, softer in the chamber), and charges the final image (the box complete, her perception redesigned). The pairing of light and loss is sustained without becoming static. However, the phrase "luminescent ache" itself does not appear verbatim, and the tone risks purple saturation in high-pressure beats. Strong tonal integration with minor overwriting.</comment>
