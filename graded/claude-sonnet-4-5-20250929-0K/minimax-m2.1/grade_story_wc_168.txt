<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied in places—the weight of the box, the tracing of scars—but her interior journey toward "translating pain into something others could carry" arrives too cleanly without ambivalence or competing impulses. The final paragraphs lean on abstract self-awareness ("the hard softness she had learned to inhabit," "letting the slow dance of stars witness her quiet vigil") that reads as diagnosis rather than lived contradiction. Emotional progression toward earned wisdom feels assured rather than wrestling with doubt, capping the score before the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers memory, reflection, and sensory detail to reweight Mira's relationship with loss by the ending. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first ~100 words. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira's final decision to return to the station and carry her experience forward is signaled as Earned Stasis with visible cost (the ongoing vigil, the acceptance of her altered self). However, the cost is felt more than dramatized; the piece tells us she has "learned to carry what Elena could not" without a discrete on-page moment where that capacity is tested or priced this night, which keeps it shy of high 8s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ridge path, blackened stumps, new saplings, and moonlight create coherent atmosphere and filter through Mira's professional/survivor lens. The cracked box functions as micro-setting, constraining her ritual and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Sensory detail remains mostly visual; other senses are underutilized, and the environment's constraint on tonight's choice is implied rather than acute, preventing entry to the 8-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring the bargain with loss and translating survival into mentorship—is signaled early and carried through. Yet the piece is essentially a memorial ritual without live opposition or a meaningful tightening tonight; Mira arrives resolved and departs reaffirmed. The only pressure is internal reflection deepening her prior stance. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful intensification suffices, but here the cost (returning to the station tomorrow) is preordained rather than forged on-page, keeping escalation in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—transformation of personal trauma into collective light—emerges through image and ritual rather than thesis. The pressed flower, spiderwebbed mirror, and "hard softness" motif support this resonance. However, the final two paragraphs drift toward explicit moralizing: "The fire doesn't care… But we do. That's what makes us necessary and what makes us break" and "to transform her burning into someone else's light" state the theme rather than trusting the enacted ritual. This lowers the score per the anti-pattern guidance on sermonizing endings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Mira's professional-survivor perceptual signature: she notices fire scars, training language, the mechanics of controlled burns. Diction is mostly consistent, though phrases like "the slow dance of celestial bodies" and "hard softness" edge toward elevated abstraction that slightly exceeds a firefighter's plausible idiom under emotional pressure. No dialogue on the page, so those bullets do not apply. The piece maintains psychic distance and narrative confidence throughout, supporting a solid mid-7 score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is generally high, but the piece suffers from figurative density and register drift in key beats. "The landscape of her survival mapping itself," "slow dance of celestial bodies," "hard softness," "gently skilled fingers," and "translate the pain" stack metaphorical and abstract language across adjacent lines, especially in the opening and closing paragraphs, without pattern-teaching or payoff that justifies the load. Template cadence appears in the final third: "not to punish herself, but because…," "not to speak to Elena but to speak for her." These artifacts dull immediacy and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack (−0.6 baseline, touching closure raises it to −0.9). Starting mid-7s, deduct ~0.9 total.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—firefighter returns annually to the ridge where her mentor died, using ritual to convert trauma into teaching wisdom—follows a familiar template (survivor's pilgrimage, mentor's death, lesson learned). The cracked porcelain box and spiderwebbed mirror offer concrete anchors, and the firefighter's professional lens adds some specificity. However, the emotional arc (guilt → acceptance → mentorship resolve) and the thematic moral (loss transformed into collective strength) proceed along well-worn grooves without a non-obvious turn or synthesis. No moment surprises in hindsight; the ending affirms what the opening foreshadowed. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −0.8 in Q8 for template adherence without transformative risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira (scarred forest firefighter) is present throughout and her professional identity frames her perception and final resolve to return to training recruits. She makes one meaningful choice tonight—to close the box and return to the station—shaped by her scars and training role. However, that decision feels preordained rather than tested by live opposition; she arrives resolved and departs reaffirmed. Setup gate met (first paragraph), closure gate met (final paragraph decision), but middle development is reflection without a discrete turn. Two gates allow eligibility to ~6.0; the choice is subtle rather than decisive, and cost is implied rather than acute. Score mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cracked porcelain box appears in beat one (carried against her chest), beat two (moonlight catches it at the fire line), beat three (opened to reveal flower and mirror), and beat four (closed and tucked against her heart). It anchors the ritual and charges the final image. Setup, development, and closure gates all met; three-gate eligibility allows ≥6.1. Beat involvement (+0.9 for two distinct beats), closure linkage (+0.7), and specificity (the crack and sharp-worn edges matter) support mid-to-high 6s. However, the box does not constrain a choice under pressure tonight—it holds symbols but does not alter Mira's options—capping causal pressure and preventing entry to 7+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Bargained innocence is stated twice: "she had traded her innocence about the world's indifference for something harder" and "innocence exchanged for understanding." It frames the backstory but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics tonight; Mira has already completed the bargain seven years ago. Setup gate met (first third mention), but no middle development or closure participation where the concept alters her present choice. Missing middle and closure gates cap at 2.8; theme-only echo without present pressure keeps it low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Gently skilled" appears twice: Elena's "careful, gently skilled fingers that had painted constellations" and Mira's own "gently skilled hands that could now reach into burning buildings without trembling." It is a transferred trait, label-only, with no on-page action constrained or enabled by gentleness paired with skill tonight. Setup gate met (early mention of Elena), closure gate met (Mira's hands), but middle development absent and no visible cost tied to the attribute. Missing middle cap at 3.4; swappable phrasing and label-only use hold it there.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Enlighten" appears once explicitly: "when she enlightened them about the terrible beauty of controlled burns and the mercy of hard choices." The action (teaching/enlightening firefighters) motivates her return to the station and frames her resolve, but it occurs off-page (tomorrow) rather than dramatized tonight. Setup gate missed (not present in first third), closure gate met (final paragraph resolve), middle development absent. Missing setup and middle caps at lower band; the action shapes future intent but does not turn on-page events. Score mid-5s for future-facing significance without present dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Reflecting deeply" operates throughout: Mira traces scars, remembers Elena, opens the box, examines the mirror's fractured surface, and speaks aloud her training cadence. The method is signaled early and sustained across beats. Setup, development, and closure gates all met (reflection anchors the entire ritual). Three-gate eligibility allows ≥6.1. Beat involvement across four moments (+1.4), closure linkage (final spoken reflection +0.7), and causal pressure (reflection primes her return decision +0.5) support mid-6s. However, the mechanics of reflection do not impose cost or friction tonight—she arrives ready to reflect and departs affirmed—capping it just above the lyric-resonance allowance ceiling at 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge path is present from the opening ("climbed the moonlit ridge path") through the fire line midpoint ("the place where the fire line had held") to the final image ("sat on the ridge where everything had changed"). Setup, development, and closure gates met. Beat involvement across three moments (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.7), and specificity (the exact fire-line location matters) support low-6s. However, the path does not constrain her choice tonight—it is a stage for reflection rather than an obstacle or resource that alters tactics. Micro-setting allowance applies but causal pressure is minimal, placing it just above the two-gate threshold.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Slow dance of celestial bodies" appears twice: opening line ("traced ancient patterns across the sky") and closing line ("letting the slow dance of stars witness her quiet vigil"). The timeframe is poetic but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed duration; the ritual unfolds in a vague "tonight" without a live clock. Setup and closure gates met (early and final mentions), but middle development absent and no pressure from time. Missing middle cap at 3.4; swappable with "under the stars" or "at night" without structural loss. Ornamental use (−0.5) and label-only celestial phrasing lower it to mid-2s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Motivation to "translate pain into a universal language" is stated explicitly in the box-opening beat ("to translate the pain of that day into something others could carry") and the closing resolve ("to transform her burning into someone else's light"). It shapes her training role and tonight's vigil purpose. Setup gate met (midpoint articulation), closure gate met (final paragraph), but middle development is reflection rather than a choice where competing desires create friction. Missing middle cap at 3.4; however, the motivation drives her return decision with implied cost (ongoing burden of mentorship), lifting it to mid-5s under lyric-resonance allowance. Told-only phrasing and lack of on-page conflict between want and cost prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Hard softness" is named explicitly ("This was the hard softness she had learned to inhabit—the unyielding truth of loss paired with the gentle persistence of growth") and enacted through contrasts: scars/moonlight, cracked box/careful handling, fire's indifference/Mira's care. Setup, development, and closure gates met through sustained tonal pairing. Beat involvement across four moments (+0.9), closure linkage (final image juxtaposes "hard edge beneath her" and "soft moonlight" +0.7), and coherence under pressure support mid-6s. However, the tone does not modulate—it remains static "hard softness" throughout without tension or shift, capping it below 7.0 per the static-mood guidance.</comment>
