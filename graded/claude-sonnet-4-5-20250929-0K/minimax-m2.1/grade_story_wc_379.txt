<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and her curatorial eye shapes her approach to objects and stories. However, her internal journey is largely observation rather than struggle—she doesn't face meaningful internal contradiction or pay a visible cost for her choices. The grandmother and Mrs. Okonkwo's conflict carries more emotional weight than Elena's arc. Mrs. Okonkwo's revelation and the sister's reunion are told rather than dramatized, flattening what should be peak emotional beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode, building from courtyard stillness through layered revelations to a final image of continued listening. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. However, the closure arrives as summary rather than on-page discovery—"the story spread," "more people brought," "Elena proved"—telling us about transformation rather than showing a decisive moment. The cost (what Elena gives up or risks) remains abstract; we see no forfeited path or visible price paid at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The courtyard at dawn is vividly rendered with "sandstorm calm" and "worn stone tiles," creating a coherent spatial anchor. The mailbox with its scratched lock provides tactile detail that matters to the mystery. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint—the courtyard never pressures Elena's choices or supplies resources that alter her tactics. The body and tools remain underutilized; Elena's physical interaction with objects is mostly observational.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the mailbox mystery and understanding its healing power—is signaled early. The piece offers one meaningful deepening when the locket reveals the grandmother-sister rift. However, escalation is mostly expository: Mrs. Okonkwo explains, Elena learns "through neighborhood storytelling," the sister reads and weeps—all told rather than dramatized. Elena faces no obstacles, makes no difficult trade-offs, and her agency is passive reception rather than active choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of listening as healing emerges from concrete particulars—unsent letters, the locked mailbox, the estranged sisters. The "sandstorm calm" motif recurs purposefully. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme rather than trusting the image: "listening was not passive but generative," "hearing another person's history could close wounds." This moralizing replaces scene pressure and undercuts what could have been a resonant ending. The conceptual cost of witnessing others' pain is implied but never embodied on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtered through Elena's curatorial sensibility. The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with purposeful rhythm: "that paradoxical quality of intense quiet where everything feels suspended between moments." However, psychic distance occasionally slips into summary omniscience—"Through neighborhood storytelling, Elena learned"—that tells rather than dramatizes discovery. Mrs. Okonkwo's brief dialogue feels natural, though her exposition-heavy speech borders on convenient information delivery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The prose is clean and rhythmically varied with strong opening and atmospheric sentences. However, the piece accumulates visible loops and scaffold: "stories hidden within objects" / "objects carried the most valuable cargo," "healing required witness" / "listening was not passive but generative." The final third summary-tells multiple beats that warrant scene—the sister's reunion, the neighborhood's response, Elena's subsequent weeks. Template phrasing appears: "she understood finally," "she proved something to herself," "through her tears she thanked." These artifacts dull the closure's impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—thrift curator discovers a locked mailbox holding unsent letters that reconcile estranged sisters—synthesizes familiar elements (found objects, family rifts, healing through witness) into a coherent whole. The "sandstorm calm" image offers fresh texture. However, the execution follows a predictable arc: mystery discovered, backstory explained, reconciliation achieved, lesson learned. The grandmother's elaborate setup (locking the mailbox, hiding the key, leaving breadcrumbs) strains credibility as a healing mechanism. The piece gestures toward originality but settles into template resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elena appears throughout and her curatorial eye frames the narrative, but her choices don't create turns—she observes, listens, and facilitates rather than decides under pressure. Her agency is receptive; the story happens to her through Mrs. Okonkwo's revelations and the neighborhood's subsequent engagement. Present in setup, development, and ending, but without causal pressure or visible cost tied to her decisions.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locket appears in the middle third ("wedged in the lock mechanism") and contains the photograph that reveals the grandmother-sister rift, enabling the final reconciliation. It's handled once on-page and its contents drive the resolution. However, it arrives as explanation rather than through Elena's discovery, and we never see Elena interact with it physically. Present in development and shaping closure, but its use is largely expository.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The locked mailbox mystery is established early (scratched lock, jammed with paper), drives the middle investigation, and its contents enable the ending reconciliation. The mystery shapes Elena's curiosity and Mrs. Okonkwo's revelation, then the unlocking metaphorically concludes the arc ("mailbox now unlocked and empty, its purpose fulfilled"). Present across all three gates with causal involvement, though the actual unlocking and letter-reading happen off-page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Leads through following" is gestured at ("Following curiosity like a thread," "not by searching but by standing still") but never constrains or enables a specific choice with visible cost. The attribute is asserted thematically rather than dramatized through tactical decisions. Elena's passive observation is labeled as a method but doesn't create friction or trade-offs—she simply waits and receives information.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Hearing/listening appears throughout: Elena hears Mrs. Okonkwo's story, the sister is heard through letters, "stories needed to be heard before they could be released." However, the action is largely passive reception rather than active choice. The climactic moment—the sister reading the letters—is summarized ("she wept") rather than dramatized. Present across beats but swappable with "discover" or "witness" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Through neighborhood storytelling" appears once in the middle as pure exposition to deliver backstory about the women in the photograph. The method is mentioned but not shown—we never see Elena engaging with neighbors, gathering fragments, or piecing together the narrative. It enables information transfer but doesn't shape tactics or create obstacles. Summary-only use without dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The courtyard at dawn is established immediately with vivid sensory detail ("worn stone tiles," "sandstorm calm," "dawn-chilled stones") and frames both opening and closing. The mailbox cluster provides a concrete focal point for the mystery. However, the setting functions primarily as atmosphere rather than constraint—it doesn't pressure Elena's choices or supply resources that alter tactics. Strong lyric reprise from first to final paragraph with thematic reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"When the outside world intrudes" appears once as a transitional marker ("delivery truck rumbled to life... the outside world began its inevitable intrusion") but doesn't tighten decisions or create urgency. The timeframe is vague—"weeks ago," "that afternoon," "following weeks"—with no pressure from temporal constraint. The element is present but ornamental, not shaping tactics or escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elena's desire "to prove that listening heals" is stated explicitly near the end ("Elena proved something to herself") but never dramatized through conflicted choices. She believes in curation-as-witness from the start and faces no friction or cost in pursuing it. The motivation drives her attention but not her decisions under pressure—she makes no trade-offs, encounters no obstacles. Told rather than shown through choices with stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Sandstorm calm" is introduced early ("that paradoxical quality of intense quiet") and returns in the final paragraph ("the sandstorm calm still settled there each morning"), creating a purposeful tonal frame. The tone remains consistent—contemplative, lyric, suspended—throughout. However, it doesn't modulate with pressure or charge the closure with new meaning; the final reprise reaffirms rather than reweights. Lyric coherence without dynamic escalation.</comment>
