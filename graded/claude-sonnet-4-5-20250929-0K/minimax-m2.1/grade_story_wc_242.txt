<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior is concretely rendered through specific perceptual habits (knowing tunnel rhythms "the way sailors know tide charts") and her cultivated practice of witnessing strangers. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between connection and estrangement, but her choices remain observational rather than tested under pressure—she waits, listens, answers, but no on-page decision alters her stance or forecloses a path. The final beat ("The phone rang") promises agency but delivers none within the text, leaving motivation articulated but not dramatized with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by ~80 words (Mira, utility corridor, phone operator role). The piece accumulates density through layered reflection on her eleven-year practice, the harmonica disc, and the loop of wrong-number calls, but no on-page event narrows options or reweights the stake with felt cost—the final line sets up a call but does not deliver a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing. Closure remains promissory rather than executed; the story stops at threshold without crossing it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The utility corridor is vividly anchored with concrete, copper, fluorescent light, and ventilation shifts that trigger the harmonica's resonance. Sensory detail is filtered through Mira's eleven-year familiarity and professional lens. The harmonica disc functions as a charged recurring object whose singing marks the threshold hour and primes the ending, constraining the temporal rhythm and charging the final image with atmospheric pressure even though it does not alter a present choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Mira's practice of witnessing strangers through wrong numbers and teaching endings how to begin. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows her options—she describes her method and waits, but the story delivers exposition of past loops rather than a live escalation. The final beat ("The phone rang") promises pressure but does not show her tested or altered within the text, leaving escalation potential rather than realized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of cultivated estrangement and the gift of anonymous witness emerges organically from Mira's practice, the harmonica's resonance as loss-made-frequency, and the metaphor of copper arteries beneath the city. The piece resists overt moralizing and offers nuanced ambiguity about connection through distance. However, the final image does not reweight or reprice prior material—it repeats the pattern (waiting for the next call) without a non-literal answer to the central question, capping thematic closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira's eleven-year intimacy with tunnel rhythms, her metaphoric register (arteries, frequencies, thresholds), and her precise occupational lens. Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose texture is literary and assured, with purposeful compression in phrases like "melodically haunted" and "loss sounds when you have lived with it long enough that it became the air itself," though minor elevation in register ("cultivated estrangement") borders on authorial rather than character-native phrasing under peak reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; lines frequently do double work (e.g., "a artery of concrete and copper beneath the city's veins" anchors setting and metaphor). Minor article error ("a artery") and one instance of near-paraphrase loop (harmonica described as "not quite music and not quite memory" echoes "neither quite glass nor crystal" structurally) create small drag. No major scaffold or template cadence, and figurative language is controlled and coherent, though density in the reflective middle risks slight momentum loss given the lack of on-page action to interleave.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of underground phone operator + glass harmonica + wrong-number witness is fresh and non-obvious, and the metaphor of loss-as-frequency is memorable. However, the emotional arc and thematic closure (Mira waiting, again, for the next call) follows a familiar meditative pattern without a decisive transformation or risk-taking structural move. The piece commits fully to its lyric, accumulative mode but stops at threshold rather than crossing into a turn that would elevate ingenuity into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; her role frames the entire narrative. However, no on-page choice or decision alters tactics or forecloses a path—she describes her practice and waits. The final beat ("The phone rang") sets up agency but does not dramatize it. Swappable with another observer role with minor edits. Late penalty mitigated by continuous presence, but lack of causal decision caps score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Introduced early (second paragraph) with vivid specificity. Appears in two beats: initial description and the moment it "began to sing" as ventilation shifts, cueing the threshold hour. Its resonance charges the final image and links to the theme of loss-as-frequency, but it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—its function is atmospheric and symbolic rather than causally active in a decision. Strong lyric reprise, but no middle development involving character action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Signaled early ("cultivated estrangement at the heart of her practice") and shapes her method: remaining a voice strangers project upon. The concept governs her stance across the piece and constrains how she engages with callers (never correcting, never meeting). However, it is articulated more than tested—no on-page moment where estrangement is threatened or deepened with visible cost. Strong thematic integration but limited causal pressure in live action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Applied to the harmonica disc ("melodically haunted") and expanded metaphorically to describe Mira's practice and the tunnel's acoustics. The trait is vividly described but functions as atmospheric texture rather than enabling or constraining an on-page action. No cost or tradeoff dramatized; label enriches tone without altering tactics. Ornamental use with strong thematic resonance but no beat-level causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The loop is central: Mira's eleven-year practice of answering wrong numbers, listening, and repeating. It shapes her entire method and the piece's reflective structure. However, no on-page turn or escalation dramatizes the loop being broken, deepened, or tested—the final beat ("The phone rang") prepares to repeat the loop rather than transform it. Strong conceptual presence but no major turn traced to this action within the text; easily maintainable with a different recurring practice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Signaled early and explained: wrong numbers reach Mira because signals cross in the tunnel. The method governs her role and the stakes (strangers pour their endings into her ear). However, it is exposition-heavy and not dramatized in a live call within the text—we learn *about* the friendships but do not witness one forming or tested. Setup and thematic integration strong; middle development and closure participation absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Introduced immediately and anchored throughout with vivid, functional detail: concrete, copper, fluorescent light, ventilation shifts, emergency phone boxes. The tunnel's acoustics enable the wrong-number crossings, and the space's pressure (threshold hour, hum of streetlamps) governs the temporal rhythm. The setting constrains Mira's access and shapes the piece's atmospheric stakes. Strong presence across all three gates; modest causal pressure but clear closure linkage via the threshold image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Signaled early ("that threshold hour when the surface world transitioned from day to electric dusk") and returned at closure ("somewhere above, the streetlamps had settled into their hum"). The timeframe governs when calls begin and structures the piece's rhythm. However, it does not tighten a decision or alter tactics within the text—it sets atmospheric pressure rather than imposing a live clock. Strong framing and lyric reprise; moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Articulated explicitly in the penultimate paragraph and implied throughout her practice of witnessing strangers hesitate on thresholds. The desire shapes her entire stance and method. However, it is told rather than dramatized in a conflicted choice—no on-page friction between this want and a competing cost or fear tests the motivation. Strong thematic presence and closure linkage; weak middle dramatization with visible cost.</comment>
