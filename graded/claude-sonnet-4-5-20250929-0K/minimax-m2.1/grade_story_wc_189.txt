<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is character-particular and embodied ("pressed the jade cicada to her lips, tasting its mineral coolness"), with micro-choices that reflect her chronicler's sensibility. The sister remains present but passive, providing pressure without agency; status dynamics exist but don't evolve. The closure choice (placing the cicada between them) feels somewhat abstract—a gesture rather than a decision with immediate foreclosed cost. Internal contradiction is present (the desire to document vs. the difficulty of being present in pain) but underplayed in the final beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered images (tide, transition, grotto, cicada) that converge at closure. Orientation is established early (grotto, sisters, pause in conversation). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira's gesture and the sister's softened reply signal a shift in their relational state. The cost is felt but oblique: the three-year silence and the effort required to stay present. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira places the cicada as offering, reweighting the conversation from stalemate to tentative return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto setting is vivid and multi-sensory ("ancient water had carved these walls," "stars through the entrance," "mineral coolness"), with the jade cicada functioning as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (two people, tidal pools outside, grotto interior, stars above). The cicada constrains Mira's gesture at closure—she places it between them as a physical bridge—meeting the 9+ gate test. Sensory detail is filtered through Mira's chronicler lens (texture, transition, mineral) rather than generic catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rebuilding connection after three years of silence—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when Mira chooses to stay present despite discomfort, then places the cicada between them, a micro-reversal that shifts the sister's tone. The cost is relational: risking further rejection, exposing vulnerability. Agency is present in Mira's choice to offer rather than retreat, though the sister's agency remains minimal. One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens; the final beat reweights their relational options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (transition, liminality, the texture of time) emerges organically from Mira's chronicler work and the specific grotto setting, avoiding explicit thesis statements until the sister's question naturalizes it. The cicada as transition-creature motif is purposeful and charged by the closure gesture. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the pause itself is the transition period, and staying present is the work. Subtext operates in silence, gesture, and the sister's softened voice. The piece resists tidy resolution—"something shifted" without claiming full repair.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited through Mira's perceptual signature (chronicler's selective attention to transitions, textures, thresholds). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during cicada-handling, wider during reflection on the grotto's formation. The two lines of dialogue feel natural and carry subtext—"You still collect things" as both observation and tentative bridge. Diction remains consistent (mineral, liminal, threshold, patient) and voice-particular. No head-hopping; the sister's interiority is inferred through externals only.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid with strong specificity ("jade cicada," "mineral coolness," "cathedral"), but several passages loop conceptually: the transition-period theme is restated across multiple paragraphs without adding new pressure. Template cadence appears in the reflection-heavy middle ("She saw… saw… saw…"). Figurative density is high throughout, occasionally slowing momentum ("silence stretched… like the surface of a pool waiting for a stone" followed by more metaphor). Information density is strong in the opening and closing beats; the middle sags slightly under the weight of backstory and thematic assertion. No filter-verb stacks or grammatical errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The chronicler-of-liminal-spaces premise is fresh and the grotto setting apt, but the execution leans on familiar reconciliation beats (silence, pause, tentative speech, softened tone). The cicada as heirloom/transition-symbol is purposeful but not irreplaceable—other objects could serve. Emotional specificity is present (the three-year silence, the texture of anticipation) but the arc follows a predictable trajectory. The tangential-foresight method is mentioned but not demonstrated with distinct mechanics. One fresh inflection: the idea that the pause itself is a tidal zone.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira (tidal-pool chronicler) is present throughout and makes two key choices: staying in the grotto despite discomfort, and placing the cicada as offering. These choices shape the ending but feel contemplative rather than high-stakes. Her observation is warm but does not materially alter tactics mid-scene. The profession frames her lens (transitions, liminality) but doesn't constrain options with visible cost. Present in closure; causal role moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The jade cicada appears in four beats: resting in palm (opening), pressed to lips (middle reflection), placed between them (climax gesture), and implicitly in the sister's response. It returns with reweighted meaning—from personal heirloom to relational bridge. The object's properties (coolness, summer song frozen, grandmother's gift) charge the closure gesture. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability; removing it would weaken the final beat's specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Transition periods" shapes Mira's lens and the story's structure (the pause as liminal zone). The concept is signaled early, drives Mira's reflection, and reweights the closure: the pause itself becomes the transition being chronicled. However, it functions more as thematic framing than a tactical constraint—it doesn't narrow options or alter her sister's behavior directly. Strong thematic integration; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is asserted ("She was warmly observant of the water's rhythm") but not dramatized through a choice with visible cost. Mira's observation style is present (noticing stars, her sister's profile, silence as full), but the trait doesn't constrain her actions—she could act identically if she were coolly observant. Label-only mention without enabling or foreclosing a path.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Foresee" appears once: "She could foresee, not through direct looking but through tangential approach…" The sentence describes an act of understanding (seeing her sister's tension, the fullness of silence) rather than predicting future outcomes. The action is summary-only and swappable with "understand" or "perceive." Does not drive a turn or redefine options; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Through tangential approach" is mentioned in one sentence ("looking not at the argument itself but at its edges") but the mechanics are not demonstrated. Mira's reflection follows a direct progression (cicada → transitions → grotto → memory) without showing how indirection yields insight that direct thought could not. The method is told, not enacted; swappable with "reflection" or "contemplation."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "ancient grotto under stars" is established early, anchors the scene, and provides atmosphere (carved walls, shallow pool catching starlight). It constrains the setting (enclosed, intimate, away from the tidal pools) and contributes mood. The grotto's formation by patient water parallels the theme. However, the setting does not materially alter tactics—the conversation could occur elsewhere with minor edits. Purposeful atmospheric work; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Across the pause in a difficult conversation" frames the entire narrative window—the story unfolds within the silence before the sister speaks again. Time is tracked ("hours ago" for the notes, "three years" for the silence) and tightens the emotional pressure: how long can Mira endure the pause before retreating? The timeframe constrains her choice and charges the sister's eventual reply. Strong integration; the pause is both container and stake.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is asserted as Mira's life work ("Her life's work had been documenting these liminal moments") but not dramatized as a conflicted desire in this scene. The motivation frames her reflection but doesn't create friction—there's no cost to pursuing it here, no competing want. It informs her lens but doesn't force a choice. Thematic presence; minimal causal pressure.</comment>
