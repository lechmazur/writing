<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Miriam's interiority is concrete and specific ("the physics of letting go," her "weary familiarity" with death), and her decision to deliver Eleanor's message reads as earned by the story's causality. However, the piece leans heavily on summary and reflection rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure; the snow-globe discovery and decision to find the daughter are described more than enacted. Internal contradiction is minimal—her dedication to lost things is consistent—but the final turn lacks visible struggle or foreclosed options that would elevate the characterization into higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure arrives on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Miriam's realization that "loss was not an ending but a transition" crystallizes her commitment to deliver Eleanor's message and perhaps release herself from the ocean. The cost is conceptual and felt—she will finally understand how to let go—but not sharply visible in forfeited action. Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the snow globe's discovery deepens the thematic stake. One slip: the closure unit relies on reflection more than dramatized choice, which keeps it out of the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Montserrat library and submersible setting are vivid and purposeful: bookshelves "softened by decades of gentle decay," pages "fluttering in slow motion." The snow globe as micro-setting constrains Miriam's choice to unseal it and charges the final image. However, the setting does not meaningfully narrow options during the descent or discovery—Miriam's actions would read nearly the same in any wreck. The deep-ocean specifics are rendered with care but function more as atmosphere than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the physics of letting go—is signaled early and deepens when Miriam discovers Eleanor's note. The tightening is conceptual rather than plot-driven: Eleanor's message reweights Miriam's career-long search. However, escalation is minimal; Miriam faces no on-page obstacle or trade-off during the descent, and the decision to find the daughter costs nothing visible in the moment. One meaningful deepening (the note's revelation) is sufficient for this length under an Accumulative lens, but the lack of visible price or narrowed options keeps the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically from Eleanor's sealed note and Miriam's recognition: "loss was not an ending but a transition." The snow globe's return with reweighted meaning (artificial snow settling around the windmill) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The piece avoids moralizing; instead, Eleanor's "I didn't let go—I changed form" articulates the thematic question through character voice. One slip: the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("she would finally understand how to let go") rather than trusting the image alone, which nudges the score just below the 8.5 threshold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable (limited third, Miriam), and the voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: "the amber silence of the ocean floor," "the sophisticated melancholy of the message." Diction remains within Miriam's scholarly, introspective register throughout. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the accumulated mass of every search, every hypothesis") that reads more authorial than character-particular under peak pressure. The final image is clean, but the line "the physics of letting go was not about abandonment but about trust" feels slightly expository for the POV's immersed state.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; the opening establishes voice and stakes efficiently. However, the piece carries scattered template artifacts: "After the Earhart discovery, after the world celebrated" uses parallel structure without tension, and "she understood, finally" is a common epiphany opener. The phrase "the sophisticated melancholy of the message" reads slightly elevated for mid-crisis diction. One paraphrase loop: "She would find the daughter. She would deliver the transmission" restates the same commitment without added pressure. These minor slips, none touching closure directly, accumulate to −0.7 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise—a deep-sea researcher discovers a sealed note in a snow globe inside a sunken library—offers a fresh synthesis of familiar elegiac elements. Eleanor's final transmission ("I didn't let go—I changed form") feels inevitable in hindsight and specific to the ocean-researcher milieu. However, the emotional arc (solitary expert finds meaning in a relic and resolves to honor it) follows a recognizable template without bold structural risk. The snow globe as preservation vessel is inventive, but the thematic resolution is signaled rather than transformed by an unexpected choice. Solid execution with one fresh inflection, not a reinvention.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Miriam's "first name basis with death" ("an old colleague in these waters") appears early and colors her interiority throughout. However, this familiarity does not constrain or enable a key on-page choice—it remains atmospheric rather than causal. The decision to unseal the globe and find Eleanor's daughter arises from curiosity and thematic alignment, not from Miriam's relationship with mortality. Two beats (opener, mid-descent reflection), but no visible cost tied to this trait.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The snow globe appears at discovery, is unsealed mid-scene, and returns in the final image ("the snow began to settle...and Miriam smiled"). It shapes two key beats: the revelation of Eleanor's note and the thematic closure. The globe's sealed mechanics matter—Miriam must untangle seaweed to access the message—and its artificial snow charges the ending. However, the globe does not constrain an earlier choice or narrow options; it functions more as a revelatory object than a tactical tool. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement push it into the 7+ range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Last transmission" frames the story (Eleanor's personal broadcast that no receiver captured; the note as a different kind of transmission) and shapes Miriam's final commitment to deliver it. The concept appears in setup (Eleanor's lost broadcast), middle (the note's discovery), and payoff (Miriam's vow to find the daughter). However, the transmission does not alter on-page tactics or narrow options during the descent—it functions thematically rather than causally. Solid three-gate presence with conceptual cost at closure, but swappable with "final message" or similar without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Quietly analytic" appears once as direct description ("quiet analytic hand that mirrored her own") and is implied in Miriam's methodical descent and careful unsealing. The trait enables her patience and precision but does not visibly constrain a choice or create a trade-off. The note's handwriting matching Miriam's style is a thematic grace note, not a causal pressure point. Present and consistent, but label-heavy and replaceable with "methodical" or "careful" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "note" drives the story's revelation and Miriam's final vow, appearing at the climax and shaping closure. However, it arrives late (past the 40% mark) and does not create a problem it helped complicate—it resolves Miriam's thematic search cleanly. The note is handled (unsealed, read), but its mechanics are minimal. Closure participation is strong, but late introduction and lack of middle development cap the score at 4.6 per the rubric.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"By untangling threads" (seaweed around the globe) appears in setup (implied ocean environment), enactment (Miriam works the seal free), and pays off (access to the note). The method is specific and visualized, and the untangling matters to the plot—without it, no note. However, the mechanics are described in one sentence without struggle or cost, and the method could be replaced with "prying" or "breaking" without major structural change. Solid three-gate presence but minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "forgotten sunken ship library" (Montserrat) is established early, provides the discovery environment, and supplies the snow globe through its unique preservation context. The library's exposed hull and sediment-buried corner enable the find, and the wreck's unreported status motivates Miriam's solitary descent. Setting shapes two beats (descent, discovery) and charges the closure with its "gentle decay" imagery. However, the library does not constrain tactics beyond providing access—Miriam's actions would read similarly in any wreck. Strong presence and closure linkage, but limited tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After finding Amelia Earhart's plane" frames Miriam's emotional state (post-celebration emptiness, the "ache she couldn't name") and motivates her solo Montserrat dive. The timeframe appears in setup and colors her reflections, but it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. The Earhart discovery functions as backstory context rather than a live temporal constraint. Two-gate presence (setup, thematic echo) with conceptual linkage to closure (understanding why some things stay lost), but no middle development or time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To understand the physics of letting go" is signaled early ("that loss was not an ending but a transition"), tested at the discovery (Eleanor's note reframes the question), and crystallizes at closure (Miriam's vow to deliver the message and perhaps let go herself). The motivation drives Miriam's career-long search and shapes her reaction to Eleanor's note. However, the desire is more thematic than conflicted—Miriam faces no on-page friction between wants and costs. Three-gate presence with closure participation, but the lack of visible trade-off or struggle keeps it below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Sophisticated melancholy" is coherent throughout: "the amber silence," "weary familiarity," "the sophisticated melancholy of the message." Tone modulates subtly—calm during descent, charged at discovery, reflective at closure—without breaking register. The final image (snow settling, Miriam smiling in darkness) charges the tone with quiet resolve. However, one phrase ("the sophisticated melancholy of the message") labels the tone overtly rather than embodying it, nudging the score just below 8.0. Strong coherence and closure linkage.</comment>
