<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and specific—her belief that silence carries memory, her methodical charting—but she remains oddly static across the entire piece. No internal contradiction pressures her choices; she simply continues the work she's done for seven years without friction, renunciation, or cost. The "earnest studious pursuit" is asserted repeatedly but never tested by a competing desire or doubt that would make her final gesture feel like a choice rather than continuation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Elara records a hum-shift, reflects on seven years of silence-mapping, and ends watching fractured light on her notepad. Orientation is established cleanly (who, where, when by the second paragraph). However, no on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs—the final image ("the fluorescent hum continued its song, and Elara listened, as she always had") affirms continuity rather than reconfiguring it. The hum's change is noted but produces no tightening of options, no visible cost, no foreclosed path. Without closure under the chosen lens, the piece cannot enter higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bonsai forest, mountain workshop, gilded-leaf emblem, and fluorescent lamp anchor the setting with vivid, selective detail. The lamp's "faint tremor" and the prism scattering light are sensory and purposeful. The bonsai forest functions as both atmosphere and constraint (providing "perfect quiet"), and the prism charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconstructing the town's lost history via frequency-mapping—is signaled early and remains coherent. Yet no escalation or tightening occurs: today's hum-shift is recorded exactly as prior shifts were, with no complication, reversal, or cost. The piece describes Elara's ongoing practice without a single moment where her agency narrows options or forecloses a path. Pressure does not accumulate toward the ending; the final line restates her patience rather than testing it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme—silence as full rather than empty, history as texture—emerges organically from the bonsai rings, refracted light, and layered frequencies. The prism's scatter and the phrase "time is not a river but a forest" offer resonant images without overt moralizing. However, the ending does not reweight prior material; it restates the premise. The line "every silence contains a thousand voices waiting to be heard" borders on thematic echo, though it stays within the meditative register.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; perceptual signature is strong (Elara notices frequencies, textures, the tremor in glass). Diction is controlled and lyric, with purposeful compression ("component lies and truths," "glowing restraint"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose modulates naturally from sensory observation to reflection. However, runs of similar syntactic openings ("She had inherited," "She believed," "She did not invent") and the repeated "earnest studious pursuit" phrase create mild template cadence in the second paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentences advance atmosphere and character. Information density is high in the opening paragraphs. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the second paragraph's "She believed these sounds carried memory" is restated as "silence was not empty but full, that it held the compressed histories"; "earnest studious pursuit" recurs verbatim twice; "gilded-leaf标志" appears identically in two beats. The phrase "charting the faint hum in a fluorescent lamp at dawn" is repeated exactly. These loops and scaffold reduce propulsion in a piece already light on pressure. Apply baseline artifact penalty (−0.6 in Q7) for paraphrase and template stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—mapping silence's frequencies to reconstruct lost time—offers a fresh angle on memory and solitude. The bonsai-as-time-rings metaphor and "time is not a river but a forest" are specific and memorable. However, the overall arc is familiar: solitary artisan pursues esoteric work in an abandoned place. The piece does not transform this template through bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus; Elara's pursuit remains uncontested, reducing ingenuity at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara (gilded-leaf stationer) is the focalizer and her identity as inheritor of the guild frames the setting, but her choices do not create key turns. She continues charting as she has for seven years; no decision alters tactics or options. Present throughout but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The battered notepad appears in three beats: on the workbench (setup), receiving the wavelength notation (middle), and catching scattered light in the final image (closure). Its "corners soft from years of handling" signals history. However, it functions as a passive surface rather than constraining choice or being reweighted; any journal would serve the same role.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Invented histories" is named early ("She did not invent histories out of fancy but from evidence") and echoed at closure ("histories that had never been written but had always been true"). It shapes her motivation and frames the thematic question. However, it does not narrow tactics or options on the page; the concept remains a thematic claim rather than an engine of pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Earnestly studious" is asserted twice verbatim ("earnest studious pursuit") and enacted through her methodical charting. It colors her voice and patience. Yet no on-page cost is tied to this trait—no moment where earnestness constrains a faster or riskier path, no tradeoff. Label-heavy, action-light.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Refract" appears in setup (grandmother's method), middle (Elara raises her prism), and closure (light scatters "like seeds"). The prism's refraction charges the final image and connects to the core concept (truth/lies, component colors). Removing it would weaken the ending's visual anchor, though the story's static arc limits its causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Charting the faint hum in a fluorescent lamp at dawn" is named as the grandmother's method in paragraph two and enacted when Elara records the wavelength shift. The mechanics (copper wires, glass tubes) are gestured toward. However, the charting produces no consequence or complication; it is a repeated practice, not a decisive action. Present and functional but not transformative.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests" on the mountaintop anchors every beat: dawn light through the trees, their whispers, their rings as metaphor for layered time. The setting provides "perfect quiet" that enables Elara's work—a functional constraint. The forests charge the final image ("time is not a river but a forest"). Strong atmospheric integration, though the setting does not force a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the town goes silent" is established in paragraph one and anchored to "three seasons past," then deepened ("seven years now, since the day the last merchant left"). The timeframe motivates Elara's solitary work and her belief in compressed histories. The phrase "today, the hum had changed" signals a shift within this ongoing frame. However, no live ticking clock tightens decisions; the timeframe contextualizes rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To collect the textures of different times" is dramatized through Elara's daily calibration, her notepad notations, her belief that frequencies carry memory. The motivation shapes every beat and the thematic question. Yet it is never conflicted or tested—no competing want, no moment where the cost of collecting makes her hesitate. Present and coherent but uncontested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Incandescent restraint" coheres across the piece: the lamp's "glowing restraint," Elara's patient listening, the controlled lyric diction. Tone modulates subtly (sensory observation, reflection, the final image's charged quiet). The phrase "glowing restraint of the lamp's light, warm and golden" directly names the tone and ties it to the visual anchor. However, tone remains static rather than shifting under pressure, as no pressure escalates.</comment>
