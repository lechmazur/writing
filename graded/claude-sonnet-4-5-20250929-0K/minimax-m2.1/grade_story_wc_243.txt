<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archivist's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied moments like tasting sea air on the locket and breathing in fragrance "until it became part of her." Internal conflict exists but mostly operates through reflective contradiction rather than simultaneous impulses in scene. The final choice to "continue to preserve" reads as affirmation rather than a decision that forecloses a live path with visible cost; the covenant is regenerated through acceptance, not through a struggle that narrows options on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered reflection and sensory accumulation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—the archivist accepts preservation as breathing rather than freezing, extending the covenant forward. Orientation anchors cleanly (archivist, jetty, twilight, locket). One meaningful deepening occurs when she examines the photo closely and finds it "only grew richer, more layered, more true," reweighting her fear of proximity. Cost is conceptual (accepting temporality, releasing "impossible expectations") but felt in the final shawl image of "haunted euphoria." The accumulative pattern holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: blossoms close "against the coming dark" as the archivist makes her new promise, physically mirroring the act of preservation. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through archival consciousness ("walnut ink," "mineral tang," tea-steeping metaphor). The purple light "bleeding into the water like an old photograph developing" integrates setting with professional lens. The grandmother's historical presence on this same jetty creates spatial constraint that shapes the ritual return and resonates at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: accepting that preservation means allowing change rather than freezing moments. One meaningful deepening occurs when the archivist overcomes her fear that "looking too closely would diminish the image" and finds the photo enriched instead—this shifts her understanding and enables the final promise. Agency is renunciation (releasing impossible expectations) with conceptual cost legible in the metaphor shift from amber to breathing. No on-page antagonist; pressure accumulates through internal conflict and the liminal timeframe. The tightening is modest but present; a sharper trade-off would elevate this further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tea-steeping metaphor, the locket's changing meaning, and the grandmother's "haunted euphoria"—the cost of embracing temporary joy. The final image of feeling "stitched together from photographs and memories" offers a resonant answer to preservation's paradox without stating a moral. Subtext operates in "gentle pressure of what had been lost and the quiet hope of what might be recovered." The piece resists tidy resolution by accepting temporality as the condition of preservation. One minor slip: "only true currency the future possessed" edges toward abstraction in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable single third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is archival and profession-specific: "walnut-ink archivist," "cataloging not just what could be written down," "approaching memory the way one steeps tea." Diction stays within character ("proximate causes," "haunted euphoria") without unmotivated register shifts. Two slips lower the score: "currency the future possessed" and "stitched together from photographs and memories" in the final paragraph both drift toward elevated abstraction that slightly exceeds the established texture under peak emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high and figurative language is purposeful early on ("purple light bleed into the water like an old photograph developing"). However, the final two paragraphs accumulate metaphor density without clear escalation: "currency," "bridge," "shawl," "stitched together" crowd the closure beat, creating mild figurative muddle. Minor paraphrase loop: "preserve the weight of small moments" appears in paragraphs 2, 6, and 7 without material reweighting each time. Template cadence: "She had come," "She was gently," "She had learned," "She had been" creates repetitive sentence openings across paragraphs 1–5. Apply −0.6 for density at closure, −0.4 for loops and stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The archivist character and walnut-ink detail offer specificity, and the tea-steeping metaphor for memory work is fresh. However, the core premise—returning to a meaningful place to honor a deceased relative and accept impermanence—is a widely used template. The piece personalizes it through archival lens and sensory ritual, but the emotional arc (fear of examining closely → acceptance through closer look → extended promise) follows a familiar structure. The "haunted euphoria" phrase and the jetty blossoms closing at night provide memorable images, but transformation of the premise is modest.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Walnut-ink archivist: present throughout, frames perception and metaphor (tea steeping, photo developing). The archival lens shapes how she processes memory. Mid-range: the character observes and reflects extensively, but the only on-page decision is to "continue to preserve"—an affirmation rather than a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a competing path with visible cost. Two gates met (setup, payoff); development as active choice is thin.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Locket photo: appears in paragraphs 1, 3, 5, and 6. Early setup (pressed against chest), examined closely in paragraph 5 (overcoming fear of proximity), and present in the final promise (pressed to lips, tasting sea air). The photo's meaning reweights from fragile relic to "richer, more layered, more true." Three gates met with causal and closure participation. Visible cost: accepting that proximity deepens rather than destroys.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Regenerated covenant: explicitly named in paragraph 1 ("regenerated after years of neglect") and extended in the final promise (paragraph 6). Shapes the dominant stake: how to honor the grandmother's memory without "impossible expectations." The covenant provides the thematic frame and motivates the ritual return. However, the regeneration itself is told rather than dramatized in a specific prior beat, and the mechanics of what was neglected versus what is now understood remain abstract. Two gates (setup, closure); middle development is summary.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Gently thorough: named in paragraph 2 ("gently thorough in her methods") and recalled in paragraph 5 ("being gently thorough: the willingness to examine everything closely") and the final paragraph ("gently thorough acts of keeping"). The trait enables the close examination of the photo without fear. However, it does not constrain an on-page action or create a visible trade-off—it describes an approach rather than forcing a choice with cost. Present across beats but largely label-level; functional but replaceable with "patient" or "careful."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Steep: the tea-steeping metaphor appears in paragraph 2 ("approaching memory the way one steeps tea") and paragraph 3 ("letting the scent steep in her lungs") and paragraph 5 ("tea that had been steeping just long enough"). It provides the central method for preservation—allowing time to do its work. The metaphor shapes the protagonist's realization that proximity and patience deepen rather than destroy. Three touches across setup, development, and closure. However, "steep" as a physical action is metaphorical throughout; a more literal enactment would raise the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Through proximate causes: appears once explicitly in paragraph 2 ("patient attention to proximate causes: the real reasons people held onto certain objects"). The concept frames her archival philosophy and informs her willingness to look closely at the locket. However, the method is mentioned rather than enacted in a specific investigative beat—she reflects on causes rather than tracing them on the page. Setup gate met; middle development and closure participation are thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Blooming jetty at twilight: present throughout, anchors all reflection and action. The jetty is the grandmother's historical location (paragraph 3), and its blossoms release fragrance (paragraph 3) and close at night (paragraph 6), creating a physical rhythm that mirrors the archivist's act of preservation. The twilight timing and "purple light" charge the liminal mood. The setting constrains the ritual return and the blossoms' closing directly shapes the final image of tucking in "against the coming dark." Three gates met with strong closure participation and environmental specificity that could not be swapped.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>When context changes: named in paragraph 1 ("liminal hours between seasons, between one version of herself and another") and implicitly present in the twilight timeframe and the shift from fear to acceptance. The liminal timing motivates the ritual return and frames the internal transformation. However, the timeframe does not create urgency or tighten a decision—it provides mood and thematic resonance rather than a live clock that alters tactics. Two gates (setup, thematic closure); pressure application is conceptual rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>To preserve the weight of small moments: explicitly stated in paragraphs 2, 6, and final. The desire motivates the ritual return, the close examination of the photo, and the extended covenant. Internal friction exists: she fears that "looking too closely would diminish the image," creating tension between preservation and proximity. The final promise dramatizes the commitment by accepting temporality as a condition rather than obstacle. Three gates met with visible cost (releasing impossible expectations, accepting that joy is temporary). The motivation is told more than shown in conflicted micro-choices, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Haunted euphoria: named explicitly in paragraph 3 (grandmother's "particular haunted euphoria") and the final paragraph ("that familiar haunted euphoria settle over her like a shawl"). The tone is coherent—melancholy joy threaded throughout the twilight setting, blooming flowers, and bittersweet memory work. It modulates as the archivist moves from fear to acceptance and charges the final image of belonging to something larger "stitched together from photographs and memories." The tone is felt in image and rhythm, not just declared, and intensifies at closure.</comment>
