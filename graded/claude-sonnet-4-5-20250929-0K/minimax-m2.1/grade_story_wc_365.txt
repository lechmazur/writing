<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kira's interior work is specific and embodied—her sensory mapping ability shapes how she perceives and moves through space. The motivation to find her mentor's truth drives the narrative, though the final "redirection" feels more asserted than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The cyclical dissociation is label-only; it never constrains a present choice with visible cost. The climactic realization that "the truth she sought was not something withheld by another person but something she had been withholding from herself" lands as therapy-speak epiphany rather than dramatized collision of wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive within the opening paragraph (who, where, what). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure: Kira reweights her ability from gift to wound and finds purpose in that acceptance. However, the closure cost is conceptual and told rather than felt on the page—"she was no longer the same person" asserts transformation without showing the forfeited path or visible price. The causal chain from climbing the catwalk to pressing the shard to seeing the parallel self to lowering her hand relies on convenience: the shimmer delivers the exact epiphany she needs without resistance or trade-off. One meaningful deepening occurs, but the cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The repair bay is rendered with strong sensory specificity: "residual vibrations," "grief embedded in a corridor," the crane's empty cradle. Spatial choreography is clear through Kira's ascent of the catwalk. The green shard pressed against the control panel becomes a micro-setting element that enables the membrane-thinning, directly shaping the closure beat. The setting constrains choice and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but the murmur of half-remembered dreams as timeframe/setting overlay remains abstract and ornamental in most beats, capping the score in the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering her mentor's withheld truth—is signaled early and drives the catwalk climb. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kira sees her parallel self and realizes she has cycled through this junction many times. However, the escalation is cognitive rather than tactical; no option is foreclosed with on-page cost. The final act (lowering her hand, letting the shimmer fade) reads as acceptance rather than a forced choice under pressure. The coincidence that the shimmer delivers the exact realization she needs without complication or resistance undercuts agency. Cost is asserted ("no longer the same person") but not visibly paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from image and event: the wound/gift paradox, the seam in consciousness, the idea that truth is carried rather than discovered. The green shard's shift from guide to symbol of self-driven desperation is elegant. The final image—slipping the shard back into her pocket and feeling the pull of the next junction—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the line "the knowledge that her ability was not a gift but a wound, a seam in her consciousness that had opened when she touched the shard and would never fully close" edges toward thematic echo, stating the thesis rather than trusting the image. Strong thematic work overall, with one moment of over-articulation in the climax.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyric, and textured with a distinct perceptual signature: Kira notices "the particular quality of longing that accumulated in spaces where many had passed through without looking back." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the shimmer encounter. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The prose carries a contemplative, archaeological texture that matches the sensory mapper's lens. One slip: the climactic sentence beginning "The shimmer deepened, and the air filled with the murmur of half-remembered dreams—her dreams, his dreams, the dreams of all the travelers..." shifts into slightly elevated register that strains the established voice under peak pressure, but the effect is minor and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening and middle sections. The prose is mostly clean with strong verbs and specific nouns. However, three paraphrase loops appear: "The truth she had been chasing" / "the truth that her mentor had been trying to tell her" / "the withheld truth" / "the truth she sought" recur across adjacent paragraphs without adding pressure. The climactic paragraph stacks three "the truth/knowledge that..." constructions in close succession, creating template cadence at the story's peak beat. The phrase "the weight of a truth finally set down after years of carrying it without knowing" is abstract and contradicts the prior claim that she had been withholding it from herself. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence touching closure; the final image recovers momentum but the damage to the climax is visible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sensory map maker premise is fresh and the parallel-universe junction mechanics offer a non-obvious angle on multiverse tropes. The twist—that Kira has been leading the shard rather than following it—is elegant and earned in hindsight. However, the emotional core (cyclical return to a trauma junction, the wound/gift paradox, acceptance as purpose) echoes common SFF introspection templates. The ending's pull toward "the next junction, the next place where the membrane thinned" restores the cycle without transformation, which is thematically intentional but limits the sense of fresh consequence. The synthesis of map-making, sensory perception, and multiverse travel is specific enough to avoid full derivative status, landing the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kira's role as sensory map maker shapes her perception throughout and drives the climb to the control panel. Her choice to "redirect the flow" and then to lower her hand and accept the wound (rather than escape) creates the closure turn. Present in setup, middle choice, and ending—all three gates met with causal pressure and closure linkage. The specificity of mapping "impressions—the grief embedded in a corridor, the hope that still lingered near the loading docks" is irreplaceable. Cost is conceptual but legible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The green shard appears in the opening paragraph, is pressed against the control panel to open the membrane (beat two), and is slipped back into her pocket in the final paragraph with reweighted meaning (she now understands she led it, not vice versa). All three gates met; two distinct functional beats plus closure reprise. The shard enables the membrane-thinning and its symbolic shift charges the ending. Causal pressure is present but the shard's use feels somewhat passive—it glows when pressed, but Kira's agency with it is thin. Strong integration overall.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds frames the premise and the shimmer encounter demonstrates it on the page. The concept shapes the dominant stake (reaching through to pull back understanding) and the final realization (she will "forever weave between worlds"). Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is present via the membrane-thinning attempt. However, the mechanics remain abstract—no tactical cost or constraint from the weaving itself. The concept is more thematic backdrop than on-page pressure lever. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Cyclically spontaneous dissociation is mentioned in the opening as "the cost of seeing" and labeled with diagnostic language ("The doctors called it cyclically spontaneous dissociation"). The trait is present in theme (she has cycled through this junction many times) but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost. No beat shows her forgetting something crucial or mistaking one memory for another in a way that alters tactics. Label-only trait without dramatized tradeoff. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The action "redirect" is declared as Kira's goal ("She had come to redirect the flow") and appears again in the penultimate paragraph ("She had redirected something, not the flow between worlds but her own understanding"). The redirection from external search to internal acceptance is the story's conceptual hinge. However, the action itself is abstract—she presses the shard, sees the shimmer, then lowers her hand. The physical gesture is minimal; the "redirection" is cognitive. Setup and payoff gates met, causal role present, but swappable with "reframe" or "reweight" with minor edits. Functional with thematic weight but not irreplaceable in physical terms.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Parallel universes are signaled early ("mapping not just this world but the spaces between, the vast architecture of parallel universes") and the shimmer reveals "the repair bay on the other side" with a version of herself. The method shapes the middle beat (seeing the parallel self) and the final realization (she has cycled through many universes). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. However, the mechanics are vague—pressing the shard opens the membrane, but no cost or constraint from the method itself alters tactics. The parallel-universe frame is thematic scaffolding more than a pressure lever. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The abandoned Kepler-7 spaceport repair bay is introduced in the opening and supplies the crane/control panel that Kira uses to press the shard. The catwalk ascent structures the middle and the bay's "abandoned silence" returns in the final beat. All three gates met. The setting enables the membrane-thinning attempt and its emptiness mirrors Kira's search. However, the repair bay could be swapped for any junction site with similar symbolic weight (observatory, docking ring) without structural loss. The micro-setting (control panel, catwalk) does more causal work than the larger location. Strong presence, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"In the murmur of half-remembered dreams" appears as a poetic phrase in the opening, recurs when the shimmer deepens ("the air filled with the murmur of half-remembered dreams"), and is mentioned again in the final line. The phrase functions as atmospheric motif but does not tighten decisions or create a time constraint. The timeframe is durational and reflective, not a live clock. Setup and payoff present but no middle development; ornamental reprise without tactical pressure. Present but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover the weight of a withheld truth" is stated early ("the truth that her mentor...had been trying to tell her") and drives the catwalk climb and membrane attempt. The climactic realization reframes the motivation: the truth was self-withheld, not externally hidden. All three gates met with causal and thematic pressure. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—Kira's internal conflict between wanting the truth and fearing it is asserted but not shown in contradictory micro-choices. The final "weight of a truth finally set down" charges the ending but the friction between want and cost remains abstract. Strong thematic integration, moderate dramatization.</comment>
