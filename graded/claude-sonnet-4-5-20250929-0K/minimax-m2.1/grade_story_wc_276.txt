<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Morwen's cool-headedness is established through thirty years of experience and demonstrated in his patient approach, but his interior life remains somewhat distant—we see actions (zigzag movement, raising the spike) without much embodied contradiction or struggle. The transliteration of emotions into the spike's weight/color is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final moment of "voicing silence" feels more like fulfilling a prophecy than a choice earned by visible internal conflict, though the renunciation of noise over grasping is a credible stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with layered imagery (sound waves, constellations, echo) building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Morwen becomes vessel for the goddess's song with visible cost (he now carries this burden). Orientation anchors appear early (fisher, storm, garden, rocky coast). The escalation reads as density increase and pattern convergence rather than causal turns, fitting the chosen lens. Cost is present but somewhat abstract: "a weight lifted, a connection made" tells more than it shows, and the final image of "fishing for echoes" reconfigures his identity but the felt price could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly realized through concrete details (crystalline spires, concentric rings of light, humming ground) and constrains Morwen's choices—he must find spots where ground hums most purely, move in zigzag patterns. The rail spike functions as micro-setting, its changing weight and temperature guiding action. Sensory hierarchy is strong: sound becomes visible, emotions transliterate to metal. The garden's disappearance by morning and return to rocky coast charges the closure image with the contrast between magical and mundane.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—catching the goddess's echo—is signaled clearly and drives the piece. One meaningful tightening occurs when Morwen realizes others' noise scatters the echo, forcing him to "voice silence itself" as counter-tactic. The zigzag movement and choice to receive rather than strike narrow the approach. Cost is present (he becomes permanent vessel, isolation implied by "only he could hear") but the escalation feels more like progressive revelation than pressure that tests commitment; the garden essentially guides him to success rather than forcing hard trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of silence as power emerges organically through Morwen's contrast with "shouting and grasping" others, and the final image of fishing for inaudible echoes offers a resonant non-literal answer. The rail spike's transliteration mechanic and sleepwalking constellations layer meaning without overt statement. "A cool-headed fisher who had spent his life mastering stillness now carrying the final song of a god" risks summarizing the theme but stays grounded in the specific image of iron and memory. The "feral lullaby" and broken patterns invite reflection on loss and continuity without resolving into neat binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct elevated register ("transliterate," "voice silence itself") that fits a mythic frame. The perceptual signature—Morwen seeing sound as ripples, feeling emotion as weight—is consistent and character-specific. Some diction feels slightly over-wrought in peak beats ("purpose fractured and timing askew," "grief that was also a bell") where compression might serve better, but the voice remains coherent. No dialogue to judge. The final paragraph's summary mode ("a cool-headed fisher who had spent his life mastering stillness") tells what has been shown, diluting immediacy slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated description. In the climax, "sound that was also a color, a grief that was also a bell" and "absence of every sound that had ever hurt him" pile abstractions where a single concrete image might land harder. Some template patterns: "He would have to... He would have to..." and repeated "The [noun] [verbed]" constructions. Information density is strong, with most lines advancing atmosphere and stakes. Clarity holds, but the prose works hard for its effects rather than achieving effortless propulsion, and some phrases ("visible vibrations," "transliterate") repeat their core idea.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination of sound-made-visible garden, sleepwalking constellations, and emotion-transliterating spike creates a specific mythopoetic synthesis that avoids pure template fantasy. The inversion—catching an echo by voicing silence rather than making noise—offers a fresh angle on quest structure. Risk-taking in the elevated register and conceptual density is evident. However, the "dying goddess leaves fragmentary song" premise and "patient fisher solves mystical puzzle" arc follow recognizable patterns, and the piece leans heavily on its ornate surface rather than surprising character choices or emotional specificity to distinguish itself.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Morwen is present throughout and makes key decisions: approaching with patience, realizing he must voice silence, moving in zigzag patterns, choosing to receive rather than strike. His cool-headedness shapes tactics in the middle (rejecting the grasping approach of others) and at closure (opening his mouth to voice silence). Setup is early, development clear, and payoff direct—the trait enables the solution. However, the trait is more stated than tested; we don't see a moment where he's tempted to grasp or shout, so the cool-headedness reads as competence rather than a choice under pressure. Solid integration across all three gates with moderate causal work, but the lack of visible friction or cost tied specifically to maintaining composure keeps this from higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rail spike appears in setup (inherited from father, kept for unknown reason), is handled actively in the middle (grows warm, transliterates emotions into weight/color, guides his understanding), and is raised at closure to receive the echo, becoming luminous and housing the goddess's song. It's used in at least three distinct beats with evolving function: mysterious keepsake, emotional translator, and final vessel. The spike's specific properties (three pounds cold-forged steel, emotional transliteration) matter and aren't easily swapped. Strong integration across all gates with clear causal and closure participation. Slight swappability concern—another inherited object with symbolic weight could serve similarly—and the mechanics of transliteration are asserted rather than dramatically constrained, preventing top-band score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sleepwalking constellations appear in setup (moving in stumbling arcs, purpose fractured) and frame the garden's mystery, signaling a cosmic brokenness that matches the fragmented goddess-song. They return at closure, completing broken patterns and settling into new configurations "as if thanking him" after he captures the echo. This creates a purposeful early-to-final reprise that reweights the opening image with resolution. However, the constellations don't constrain Morwen's middle choices—his tactics (zigzag, voicing silence) respond to the garden and echo, not the sky. They function more as atmospheric parallel and thematic mirror than active plot pressure. Present in two gates (setup, payoff) with lyric resonance but limited causal work, landing solidly mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emotion-transliteration appears when the rail spike grows warm and converts feeling into weight and color, enabling Morwen to understand why he was drawn to the garden. This realization occurs in the middle section and directly shapes his approach: he grasps that he must catch an echo, which requires a different method than others used. At closure, "something transliterate within himself—a weight lifted, a connection made" signals transformation, though this is more summary than dramatized cost. The attribute is seeded, enables a key understanding, and returns thematically at the end. However, it doesn't impose a visible constraint or trade-off—the transliteration helps rather than costs him. Present in setup and development with moderate enabling work and closure echo, but limited friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The zigzag movement appears in the middle as Morwen's active strategy: "move in a zigzag pattern between the spires, his bare feet finding the spots where the ground hummed most purely. Each turn he made created a new resonance, and the garden answered with growing complexity." This action directly creates the conditions for closure—the garden's response and the echo's approach. It's specific, deliberate, and causally linked to the resolution. The zigzag is seeded by implication (patient, methodical approach vs. others' grasping) and executed in one sustained beat that leads to the climax. However, it's introduced fairly late (second half) and we don't see him discover this method through trial; it appears as the solution he implements. Present in two gates (development, indirectly enabling payoff) with strong causal work but late signal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Voicing silence is seeded when Morwen learns "silence had weight" and realizes he must "do the opposite" of the shouting others—"voice silence itself." This method is foreshadowed and its logic explained before deployment. At closure, "he opened his mouth to voice the deepest silence he had ever known," and "the sound that followed was not a sound at all. It was the absence of every sound that had ever hurt him." The method is essential to the ending and causally prepared. However, the mechanics remain abstract—what does it mean to voice silence?—and the method is stated more than demonstrated through failed attempts or calibration. Present in setup (implicit in learning silence has weight), development (explicit realization), and payoff (enacted), with solid causal connection but limited dramatized friction over technique.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is introduced immediately ("appeared after the great storm") and dominates the piece: its crystalline spires, visible vibrations, and sound-wave language teach Morwen how to perceive the echo. The garden constrains his movement (finding humming spots, zigzag pattern), provides the medium for the goddess's echo, and responds to his actions ("the garden answered with growing complexity"). At closure, the garden disappears, leaving only Morwen on the rocky coast—its absence reweights the experience as visionary or transformative. The garden is irreplaceable; its specific properties (sound made visible, boundary between hearing/seeing torn open) enable the entire quest. Present across all three gates with sustained causal pressure, multiple beat involvement, and closure participation. Exemplary integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "when patterns break themselves" is established early through the sleepwalking constellations dragging across the sky with "purpose fractured and timing askew" and the goddess having died "three moons past." This frames cosmic disruption and explains the echo's presence. At closure, the constellations "completed their broken patterns and settled into new configurations," signaling temporal resolution—the breaking is complete or repaired. However, the timeframe doesn't create urgency or narrow Morwen's window; he has "the first night" of learning and then the successful attempt, but no ticking clock or escalating decay. The concept is more atmospheric than tactical. Present in setup and payoff with thematic resonance, but doesn't constrain middle choices or create pressure through scarcity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to catch the goddess's echo is established mid-story when the garden whispers its history and Morwen understands "why he had been drawn here. There was an echo to catch." This drives all subsequent action: observing how others fail, choosing the opposite approach, zigzag movement, voicing silence. At closure, he succeeds, becoming the vessel—"carrying the final song of a god within a piece of iron and memory"—and continues "fishing for echoes that only he could hear." The motivation is clear, causally linked to tactics, and shapes the ending. However, it's not conflicted or tested—we don't see competing desires or costs that tempt him away. He wants to catch the echo, devises the method, and succeeds. Strong setup (mid-early), development, and payoff with solid causal chain, but limited friction or visible sacrifice tied to pursuit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The "feral lullaby" tone is invoked when the constellations' movement swells "into something that was both beautiful and terrible, a lullaby sung by wild things who had forgotten why they sang." This captures the piece's blend of mythic gentleness and cosmic wrongness—sleep (lullaby) made dangerous (feral). The tone holds through the garden's strangeness, the goddess's death, and Morwen's quiet approach to capturing violence-in-softness. The elevated, slightly archaic diction ("lived experience," "transliterate," "refrain") sustains a dreamlike register. At closure, tone shifts slightly toward resolution and calm ("in the morning, the garden was gone"), losing some feral edge. The tone is coherent and purposeful but named more than enacted—actual menace or wildness in Morwen's stakes or the garden's behavior is understated. Present as consistent atmospheric choice with one explicit anchor and implicit modulation, but doesn't intensify pressure at peak beats.</comment>
