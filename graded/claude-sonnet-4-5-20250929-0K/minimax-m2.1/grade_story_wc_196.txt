<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is specific and embodied through her archival practice, but she remains largely observational rather than decisional—the story delivers extended reflection on her broken-heartedness and philosophy without a present choice that costs her something on the page. The button discovery prompts contemplation rather than a dilemma that narrows options. Internal contradiction is present (wanting to honor grief while maintaining distance as "not the person who decided"), but it never crystallizes into a micro-choice under pressure. The final act of documentation feels like continuation rather than transformation or renunciation with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers detail and reflection to reweigh the button's significance. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when). However, closure lacks a decisive on-page change or a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost—Mara begins documenting "with a reverence that bordered on prayer," but this is the same posture she held at the start; no option is foreclosed, no stance crystallized. The ending image deepens thematic weight but does not impose felt cost or alter her situation. Cost proof test fails: no sentence makes a price legible in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The file room, plantation house history, and the button itself supply vivid, purposeful detail filtered through Mara's archival lens. The button constrains her interpretation and charges the final documentation beat, satisfying the 9+ gate mechanically, but the environment does not force a tactical choice—it enables reflection rather than pressure. Sensory hierarchy (dust, light through windows, button's weight and worn edges) is selective and voice-consistent. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring small kindnesses lost to bureaucratic record—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal: Mara examines the button, imagines its history, and begins documentation without a tightening that narrows options or a trade-off that costs her something. No reversal or deepening changes her knowledge or forecloses a path. The piece accumulates texture but does not deliver the "one meaningful tightening" that would register under the Accumulative lens as pressure increase; instead it sustains a single reflective posture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the button, the emancipation context, and Mara's archival philosophy: small human connections persist across systemic violence. Subtext operates effectively in the silence around Pearl's photograph and the button's unrecorded transfer. The final image reweights prior material by framing documentation as prayer, offering a non-literal answer to "what survives official history?" However, the ending stops short of a felt thematic cost or a conceptual repricing that would elevate further—no moral calculus is tested on the page, only honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and the prose carries a distinct literary texture—"whispered histories," "button...as though it were a compass needle"—that is consistently elevated yet voice-motivated. Perceptual signature (archival attention, reverence for small artifacts) is clear. However, two issues lower the score: repeated syntactic stems ("she had become...she had come...she had learned") create template cadence in the opening, and diction occasionally drifts toward abstract elevation ("examining unknown the evidence of systems") that strains clarity without clear payoff. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Information density is high and most lines advance character or atmosphere, but several prose artifacts harm momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: the opening paragraph restates Mara's archival philosophy three ways without adding pressure. Template cadence runs in "she had become...she had come...she had learned." The phrase "examining unknown" (used twice, opening and closing) reads as syntactic error or forced motif without clear meaning. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; one mixed vehicle: "the button...like a pressed flower...like a compass needle" stacks competing metaphors. Apply baseline artifact penalty −0.6 in Q7 for loops and template cadence; the closure beat is not directly touched but momentum drags in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The pairing of post-emancipation foster care with an infantry button offers a fresh historical angle, and Mara's archival reverence for "small kindnesses" is specific rather than generic. However, the emotional arc and the protagonist's contemplative stance echo familiar "archivist discovers meaning in artifact" templates without a bold structural or perspectival transformation. The piece commits to its premise but does not take a risk that heightens stakes—Mara's final action (documentation as prayer) is thematically apt yet predictable. Specificity in setting and object prevent lower scores, but the lack of a non-obvious turn or trade-off limits originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her broken-heartedness is signaled early and linked to her archival motivation, satisfying setup and development. However, she makes no key choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path—her final act of documentation continues her established practice rather than creating a turn. The character is functional but does not drive escalation or closure with a decision under pressure. Mid-band: one causal beat (choosing reverence) without cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The button appears in three beats: discovery, examination through light, and placement back in the file. It is handled on the page, accumulates meaning (soldier's kindness → Pearl's survival → archival reverence), and charges the final documentation image. However, it does not constrain a choice or narrow options—it enables reflection rather than forcing a trade-off. Strong closure linkage and specificity (brass, infantry insignia, worn edges) elevate the score, but the object remains more symbol than tactical pressure. High 7-band: essential to ending charge, yet no cost is tied to its handling.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Unknown histories" shapes Mara's stake and is present in the opening ("whispered histories") and closing ("examining unknown") as a framing concept. It informs her motivation but does not create a tactical choice or alter her approach mid-scene—she seeks to preserve what is unknown, and does so, without friction. The concept is more thematic backdrop than active pressure. Mid 5-band: shapes one key turn (the decision to document with reverence) but does not narrow options with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Tactfully hopeful" is labeled early ("The work required a tactfully hopeful temperament") but never dramatized as a constraint or enabler of an on-page action. It describes Mara's general stance without creating a visible trade-off or complication. The trait is ornamental—swappable with "patient" or "reverent" without structural impact. Low functional band: present but does not shape a beat with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unfurl" is used once in the opening ("Mara unfurl each folder") and establishes her archival method, priming the button's discovery. However, the action is not revisited or used to create a turn—Mara opens Pearl's file, but the unfolding is physical convenience rather than a narrative pivot. The verb could be replaced with "opened" or "examined" with minimal edit. Mid-6 band: shapes setup and connects to closure thematically (unfolding hidden kindness), but does not redefine options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Through accumulated dust patterns" appears once in the examination beat ("She examined it through accumulated dust patterns") but the mechanics are vague and do not shape Mara's interpretation or tactics—dust is atmospheric detail rather than a method that constrains or enables. The phrase reads as ornamental. Low functional band: present in one beat without affecting outcome.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The foster care file room is established early, anchors all action, and supplies the button, the files, and the high windows that provide examination light. The plantation house history and the shelves of records pressure Mara's reflections and frame her final documentation choice. The setting is indispensable to the story's logic and thematic weight (bureaucracy versus small kindness, post-emancipation context). High 8-band: essential across beats and ending, with specific resources (light, file, button) that enable closure, though the room does not force a tactical dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"After the emancipation" is signaled early and frames the historical context (orphaned children, Pearl's 1868 intake, infantry button from the war). It deepens thematic stakes (liberation's hidden costs) and charges the button's meaning. However, the timeframe does not tighten Mara's present-day decisions or create a live clock—it is historical backdrop rather than active pressure. Mid-6 band: shapes one key turn (understanding the button's significance) and contributes to closure resonance, but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To magnify small kindnesses" is stated explicitly in Mara's reflection and dramatized in her final documentation of the button. The motivation is present and shapes her ending choice, but it is not conflicted or tested—no want opposes this desire, no cost is paid to pursue it. The motivation is consistent and closure-linked but uncomplicated. Mid-6 band: shapes the ending image and one causal beat, yet lacks friction that would elevate it further.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Examined unknown" appears as a phrase twice (opening and closing) and colors the tone: reverent, archaeological, valuing the unrecorded. However, the tone is static—it does not modulate with pressure because pressure remains low throughout. The phrase itself is syntactically unclear ("examining unknown the evidence"), which weakens coherence. Mid-5 band: coherent and present in closure, but does not charge or shift under escalation.</comment>
