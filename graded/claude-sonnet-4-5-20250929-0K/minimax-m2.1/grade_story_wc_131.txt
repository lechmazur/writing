<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren's methodical kindness reads as consistent essence, but interiority relies heavily on abstract assertion ("the only form of love she has ever known") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The character lacks genuine internal conflict—her discovery proceeds smoothly without competing impulses or visible mistakes. The final "smile in the sapphire dark" and fulfillment claim feel unearned; no on-page micro-choice forecloses a path with visible cost. Her competence is never balanced by struggle that compounds before resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a situational lens (Maren moves through the building under emergency conditions) and delivers a resonant reconfiguration at closure: she finds a message meant for transmission and recognizes her purpose. However, the Orientation Test penalty applies: who, where, and when anchor past ~120 words with excessive layering ("shadowed library," "pipe chases beneath the stacks," "emergency lights," "sapphire hush," "liminal and holy") that obscures immediate grounding. Cost at closure is conceptual but thin—the "student who has been struggling" resolution occurs off-page and reads as convenience rather than dramatized consequence. The tape fragment discovery lacks prior constraint or tactical friction; it simply appears and Maren immediately understands its purpose without complication.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting detail is vivid and sustained (pipe chases, emergency lights, sapphire hush, infrastructure language), but most description ornaments rather than constrains choice. The "floorboards creak to warn away those who need solitude" and heating failure details establish expertise without affecting the present action. The tape fragment's location in "deeper pipe chases, where the infrastructure converges" does not alter Maren's tactics or create spatial friction—she simply moves there and finds it. The micro-setting (body, tool, or recurring object) does not shape the closure image with constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Maren's desire to be visible through transmission—is signaled early but faces no meaningful opposition or tightening. The outage grants "unusual freedom" rather than restricting options, and the tape fragment discovery is serendipitous rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure. No reversal or complication narrows her path; the cascade of sense memory delivers understanding without friction, and the student's success occurs off-page as narrative gift. The resolution lacks visible cost: Maren's "purpose fulfilled" reads as satisfaction without trade-off or foreclosed alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of unseen work and transmission emerges clearly from particulars (crawl space dwelling, cache keeping, ferromagnetic tape as covenant). The tape fragment functions as a resonant object that shifts meaning from debris to message. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic statement ("she exists not to be seen but to help the lost find their way—and that this, too, is a kind of visibility") that replaces image with assertion. The student's off-page answer feels like symbolic convenience rather than earned consequence, weakening the thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature (vibration reading, airflow whispers, infrastructure language as braille) is character-specific. However, diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a maintenance worker's immediate perception: "liminal and holy," "ferromagnetic tape reel fragment," "colonized its substance," "cascade of sense memory not her own." The phrase "not遗言 but a message" includes an untranslated character that breaks voice and reads as generation artifact. Psychic distance collapses at closure when narration asserts off-page events ("somewhere above, a student...finds the answer") without Maren's causal knowledge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Density is uneven: the opening paragraph layers metaphors and abstractions ("shadowed library," "building's hidden arteries," "sapphire hush," "liminal and holy," "crawl space dwelling is not exile but calling") that slow momentum without advancing plot. Paraphrase loops appear: "methodical kindness is not performance but essence" restates what prior lines establish. Template cadence runs through the middle: "She stops...She lifts...She understands." The final two sentences form a loop, restating fulfillment and visibility without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("building's veins," "infrastructure's depths") and filter-verb stacks ("she hears, as if through water and years") dull immediacy in a peak beat. The untranslated character遗言 is a generation artifact that obscures meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The combination of maintenance worker, hidden recording, and infrastructural intimacy offers a moderately fresh synthesis. However, the core emotional arc—invisible caretaker finds validation through discovered object—follows a familiar template without bold transformation. The tape fragment's purpose is immediately legible to Maren without complication, and the student's off-page success resolves without friction or non-obvious moral calculus. The piece hedges risk by granting Maren perfect competence and understanding, avoiding genuine stakes or mistakes that would deepen originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maren as crawl space dweller is present in setup (first paragraph establishes her habitat and methods) and development (she navigates pipe chases during the outage). However, her dwelling status does not constrain a key choice or create visible cost. She moves freely through the building's "hidden arteries" without spatial friction, and the outage grants "unusual freedom" rather than restricting access. At closure, her dwelling enables discovery but does not force a trade-off or tactical shift. The character's decisions proceed smoothly without the dwelling creating on-page pressure or foreclosing an option.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ferromagnetic tape reel fragment appears in development (she finds it in the pipe chase) and shapes closure (she recognizes its purpose and commits to transmission). It is handled in two distinct beats: discovery with physical description ("worn smooth by countless hands") and sensory cascade ("triggers a cascade of sense memory"). The fragment's magnetic properties and hidden placement matter to the plot. However, it does not return with reweighted meaning or constrain Maren's response—she immediately understands its purpose without complication. The object enables the ending but does not create visible cost or tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Sense memory is functional when Maren "hears, as if through water and years, a woman's voice" from the tape fragment, triggering understanding. This single beat enables her recognition of the recording's purpose. However, the concept does not shape tactics or create stakes—it delivers understanding without friction or competing interpretations. Setup is absent (no prior sense memory establishes the pattern), and the concept does not reappear or constrain the closure action. The element is present in one beat but swappable with any revelation mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "kindly methodical" attribute is asserted early ("kindly methodical patience," "her methodical kindness is not performance but essence," "her methodical habits demanding understanding before action") but functions as label rather than constraint. It does not force a visible trade-off—Maren's investigation of the tape fragment proceeds smoothly without her kindness or method creating friction or cost. At closure, "her kindly purpose fulfilled, her methodical work complete" summarizes rather than dramatizes how these traits shaped the outcome. The attribute is ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Cache appears in setup ("She is a cache keeper of small mercies") and motivates Maren's attention to hidden systems. However, the action does not drive a major turn—she discovers the tape fragment through exploration rather than through cache-keeping tactics, and the recording itself is a covenant, not a cache she actively maintains. At closure, she commits to transmission rather than caching. The element is present and thematically relevant but not causally indispensable; her discovery could proceed without the cache-keeper framing with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Uncovering in pipe chases is signaled in setup ("She navigates the pipe chases beneath the stacks") and executed in development ("In one of the deeper pipe chases, where the infrastructure converges...something glints"). The method matters to the discovery—the tape fragment is hidden in infrastructure depths accessible through her exploration. However, the mechanics do not create friction or constrain her approach; she simply moves through the space and finds the object without tactical complication. The method enables one key beat but does not shape multiple attempts or return at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn is established early and sustained (emergency lights, sapphire hush, stacks, pipe chases). The outage grants "unusual freedom" and transforms the space into "something liminal and holy," pressuring Maren's movement slightly by altering conditions. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome—Maren's access is unimpeded, and the discovery location (pipe chase junction) is described but not dramatized as difficult to reach. The setting ornaments more than it pressures, though it does contribute to tone and closure atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "while the city's lights flicker after an unexpected outage" is present in setup and supplies the emergency-light conditions. However, the outage grants freedom rather than tightening decisions, and no live clock tracks elapsed time or narrows options. The city lights "flicker again" near closure, but this does not alter Maren's tactics or create urgency. Time is vague and untethered; the piece does not dramatize how long she has or how the outage's duration affects her choices. The element is atmospheric but does not function as a constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The motivation to become visible to those who need her is asserted throughout ("her visibility comes not from being seen but from being present," "a way to be visible to those who need her," "she exists not to be seen but to help the lost find their way"). It drives Maren's attention to the tape fragment and her decision to transmit it. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no friction exists between her want for visibility and a competing cost. At closure, fulfillment is declared ("her kindly purpose fulfilled") without showing what she sacrifices or forecloses to achieve it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The tone "sapphire hush" is introduced early ("emergency lights cast everything in sapphire hush") and sustained through imagery ("sapphire dark" at closure). The tone is coherent and purposeful, establishing the liminal, reverent atmosphere. It modulates slightly when the tape fragment triggers "sense memory not her own," intensifying emotional texture. At closure, "Maren smiles in the sapphire dark" charges the final image with the established tone. However, the tone remains static rather than responding to pressure; it ornaments more than it constrains or reweights stakes. The element is present and integrated but does not drive a turn.</comment>
