<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The warden's interiority is specific and grounded in her nineteen-autumn tenure, but her micro-choices remain observational rather than conflicted under pressure. The astronomer's gift frames her stance, yet we never see her weigh competing impulses or pay a visible price for her work—she simply "begins" at the end. Embodied emotion is largely absent; her climb and sextant use read as reportage. The final descent suggests intent but no foreclosed path or visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes who, where, and when cleanly by the second paragraph. Closure reads as Charged Poise—she descends "knowing that to maintain a labyrinth is sometimes to unmake it"—but the cost remains asserted rather than felt in a specific forfeiture or image. The escalation is a density increase (storm, sextant use, unfolding vision) without a narrowing choice or causal turn, which is acceptable under Accumulative, but the final line tells us the reweighting rather than showing it through a concrete sacrifice or altered tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tower parapet, sextant, and moonlight constrain her method and charge the middle beat when the labyrinth "comes apart in her vision." Storm, scent of wet earth, and the treeline anchor mood and guide her attention. The sextant's transformation under moonlight enables the key action. However, the final descent is untethered to spatial or environmental friction—no locked door, no weather cost—so setting does not constrain the closure choice as tightly as it could.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the labyrinth's sorrow—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through storm, moonlight, and vision, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows her options. The astronomer's gift and her nineteen autumns set up her competence, yet the final descent is intent without visible cost: no resource spent, no path foreclosed, no tactic altered by prior moves. Under Accumulative, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the cost here is conceptual only and not legible in a specific sacrifice or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—sorrow as measurable, the act of witnessing as healing—emerges organically from the sextant, trees, and the labyrinth's history. The final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "to heal by first understanding the full weight of what has been broken." Subtext operates in "dreams scattered like seeds" and "neither lost nor seeking but simply witnessing." The piece avoids moralizing and sustains ambiguity. However, "mundane miracles" is named in the penultimate paragraph, a slight Thematic Echo that nudges toward statement rather than pure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, perceptual signature is consistent ("weather had carved rivers," "trees remember"), and diction matches the warden's professional lens. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider vista. However, elevated register occasionally intrudes: "repository of human sorrow," "hourglass that stretches back to the first wall" read more essayistic than embodied. No dialogue to evaluate. Under stress, the prose remains poised rather than fragmenting, which fits the warden's calm but slightly dulls urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, information density is high, and figurative language is vivid ("prayer," "cobwebs of memory," "stormlit tower"). Minor template stems recur: "She had learned… she had discovered…" and "The method is precise: she maps…" reads like scaffold. "At the moment a pin is heard" (the timeframe element) appears mid-story with no anchor or payoff, a clarity gap. The final paragraph stacks abstract nouns—"sorrow made bearable by the act of counting it"—where concrete image would sharpen. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts, but the closure leans toward tell.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The sextant that "measures sorrow now" and dreams clinging to walls like cobwebs are fresh images, and the premise—labyrinth maintenance as grief archaeology—offers a non-obvious angle. However, the emotional arc and structure are familiar: solitary keeper, inherited tool, patient understanding, descent to enact insight. The astronomer's vanishing and the warden's acceptance feel archetypal without personalization through lived friction. Transformation is present but incremental; swapping sextant for another measuring device would require only modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The warden is present throughout and frames the narrative, but her choices are observational until the final line, where she "descends… to begin the physical work." No on-page decision alters tactics; she lifts the sextant and watches the labyrinth unfold. The closure is intent, not enacted choice. Setup: strong. Development: passive. Payoff: declared but not dramatized. Swappable with another observer role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sextant appears in paragraph two (backstory), is used on the parapet ("lifts the sextant to her eye"), and implicitly shapes the descent. It heals in moonlight, enabling the vision. Setup and middle use are present; closure linkage is indirect—she follows "what her sextant has shown her." It constrains method and charges one beat, but the final image does not reprise it. Two beats, causal role, but swappable with another mystical tool without major rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Quantified sorrow" shapes the warden's method and is named explicitly: "each grief a grain of sand in an hourglass." It appears early and returns in the penultimate paragraph as "sorrow made bearable by the act of counting it." The concept does not narrow on-page options or impose a trade-off, but it frames the stake and charges the thematic closure. Setup, thematic payoff, minimal causal pressure. Lyric reprise without middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Heals in moonlight" enables the key action: "under moonlight the broken lens showed her things that daylight obscured… its cracks filling with soft luminescence." It constrains timing (she must work at night) and method. Setup in paragraph two, enacted on the parapet. No visible cost tied to moonlight specifically—she simply waits for night. One functional beat, causal role, but the constraint does not force a sacrifice or trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Deconstruct" is named once: "she lifts the sextant to her eye and begins to deconstruct the labyrinth's pattern." The labyrinth "comes apart in her vision, not collapsing but unfolding." This is the turning action, but it occurs passively—she watches rather than actively dismantles. It shapes the middle beat and primes closure, but the verb itself is swappable with "unravel" or "decode." Present in two beats, functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Mapping scattered dreams" appears in paragraph three ("she maps scattered dreams") and again on the parapet: "she maps scattered dreams by following the threads of their making." The method frames her action and reappears in the closure line: "following what her sextant has shown her." It constrains how she works, appears in three beats, and charges the ending phrase. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown in a specific tactic or cost. Setup, development, payoff; functional but abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The tower parapet under storm and moonlight provides the vantage and conditions for her sextant work: "the stormlit tower by moonlight becomes her observatory." Storm scent and wind anchor mood; moonlight enables the sextant. The setting pressures her by timing (night required) and enables the vision. It appears in setup, middle, and closure ("when dawn breaks"), shaping two beats and the ending transition. Functional across the arc, but the final descent does not exploit tower friction.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"At the moment a pin is heard in a silent corridor far below" appears once, mid-story, with no prior setup or subsequent payoff. The pin is not heard by anyone on the page, and the corridor plays no role. Time is tracked loosely (night to dawn), but the "moment" does not tighten a decision or impose a deadline. The phrase reads like an unfired prompt element. Ornamental single mention, no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To discover what trees witness" is stated in paragraph six and returns in "she wants to discover what trees witness." The trees frame the labyrinth's history and anchor the theme of accumulated grief, but the warden's desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice. She does not weigh tree-knowledge against another want or pay a cost to pursue it. Setup and thematic presence, but no friction or trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Mundane miracles" is named once in the penultimate paragraph: "The mundane miracles of her trade reveal themselves in the doing." The tone—calm, patient wonder at small transformations—is coherent throughout: sextant healing, labyrinth unfolding, sorrow counted. It modulates with the storm's pressure and softens at dawn. The label is slightly on-the-nose, but the tone charges the final image of descent as enactment. Coherent across beats, named but not forced, supports closure.</comment>
