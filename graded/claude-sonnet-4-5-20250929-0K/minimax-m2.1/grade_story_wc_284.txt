<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to deliver the pillbox and find her dormant courage is clear, but her interior often slips into abstract reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The burned-face detail and basement convalescence are concrete, yet the moment of extending the pillbox feels more summary than earned decision-making under visible pressure. The "unused courage" motif remains conceptual rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with lyric inflections; the piece anchors who/where/when early (Elena, Zephyr Bluff, spring threshold). The closure—Elena extending the pillbox to the ally—functions as Charged Poise: options crystallize and the cost (trust, exposure) is felt even if not yet paid. One tightening occurs when the second spy arrives and Elena must choose whether to hand over the evidence. The "salvation mechanism" setup and snow-code beat link causally to the final gesture, though the middle relies heavily on reflection rather than on-page complication.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff's mist, cold stone, and snow drifts anchor the scene with sensory specificity. The snow codes constrain Elena's knowledge and the bluff's exposure pressures her choice to come into the open. The pillbox is handled twice (examination, extension) and the environment charges the final image of spring thaw. Spatial choreography is clean: Elena against stone, ally three feet away, mist enveloping both.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver proof and reclaim courage—is signaled early. The arrival of the second spy provides one tightening that forces Elena to decide whether to trust. However, the piece leans on Elena's internal conviction rather than external resistance; no credible loss or visible cost alters tactics before the handoff. The tightening narrows options but the price remains more felt than demonstrated on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—fixing what's broken through reclaimed courage—emerges organically from the pillbox cipher and Elena's scarred identity. The "codes in snow" and spring-thaw imagery support rather than state the premise. The final gesture of extending the pillbox offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the "unused courage" phrase borders on thematic echo, and the phrase "something ancient and vital stir within her chest" edges toward abstraction rather than concrete realization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Elena's perceptual signature (spy training, pattern-reading) is consistent. The prose texture—elevated diction ("silver hush," "vouchsafe")—matches the spy-thriller register without register drift. The ally's dialogue ("I vouchsafe you my word") carries distinct formality and advances plot by offering partnership. Purposeful compression in the snow-code description works without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and paragraph lengths create visual pacing, but several metaphors stack without clear vehicle logic: "silver and silent" mist, courage "folded into itself like a letter never opened," mist that "brightens" as if "acknowledging spring." The phrase "during her convalescence in a basement that smelled of mold and regret" mixes concrete and abstract registers. The pillbox is described as "engraved" and "etched" in adjacent sentences (paraphrase loop). Filter verbs ("felt something ancient and vital stir") dull immediacy at a peak beat. Minor artifacts reduce density but do not obscure closure. Apply −0.6 for stacked figurative language and paraphrase loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The burned-spy premise and "codes in snow" signal freshness, but the arc—scarred operative finds courage to trust ally and hand over evidence—follows a familiar template. The pillbox as "salvation mechanism" and the snow-drift cipher add specificity, yet the final gesture (extending the box, feeling courage stir) resolves without a bold turn that reweights prior material. The "silver hush" and spring-thaw imagery are evocative but not transformed through character choice in a way that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elena (burned spy) is present throughout and her choice to extend the pillbox creates the closure turn. She reads snow codes, examines the pillbox, and decides to trust the ally—three distinct beats. However, much of her arc is reflected rather than dramatized; the "unused courage" question sustains her but does not constrain tactics under visible cost until the final gesture. Early signal strong; beat involvement moderate; closure linkage present but the decision feels more declared than forced.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The engraved pillbox appears in three beats: Elena examines it (first third), reflects on its "salvation mechanism" function (middle), and extends it to the ally (closure). Its cipher-key pattern matters causally—it is the proof that can "fix what's broken." The object's physical handling and reweighted meaning (from evidence to trust-token) drive the final image. Specific properties (walnut-size, flower cipher) matter. Strong beat involvement, closure linkage, and causal pressure; cost is implied in the act of handing it over.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Fixing what's broken" is stated overtly ("begin fixing what had been broken by corruption") and shapes the pillbox's thematic weight, but the concept does not constrain Elena's on-page tactics. The story demonstrates courage-reclamation more than repair; the conspiracy proof is a means, not a dramatized "fix" with visible consequence. The concept echoes as theme but does not alter options mid-scene. Functional but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Prudently daring" is illustrated when Elena climbs into the open, trusting that her enemy expects her to cower—one action enabled by the trait. However, the label appears late (paragraph five) and the on-page cost is minimal: no visible consequence tests the daring choice. The trait is told more than shown through a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Present in one beat but ornamental; swappable with "calculated risk" already used in the same paragraph.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" appears once when the ally offers her word and help. The word signals formality and spy protocol, but the major turn (Elena's decision to trust) would function identically if the ally said "I promise" or "I swear." The action does not redefine options; it is a polite verbal gesture that introduces the ally's stance. Functional but easily swappable; no closure participation beyond tone.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Codes in accumulated snow" are signaled early (paragraph three), where Elena reads spiral/cross/line drifts to confirm extraction and path. The method's mechanics matter: she applies her training to decode a message from the dead handler. However, the codes do not constrain her next choice or return at closure; they inform but do not pressure the pillbox decision. Two beats (teaching the method, applying it); middle development present but no closure linkage. Lyric reprise absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff in mist is established in the opening line and pressures Elena's choice to climb into the open rather than hide. The setting's exposure and "boundary between earth and sky" charge the meeting's stakes. The cold stone Elena presses against and the sheltered alcoves that hold snow drifts supply concrete resources. The mist "brightens" at closure, reweighting the spring-thaw motif. Early signal, middle use (snow codes), and closure participation; the setting alters tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"The tilt of the earth toward spring" appears in the opening line and recurs as thaw imagery at closure ("spring was coming, that even the coldest… places could warm again"). The timeframe colors tone but does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline. No live clock; Elena's convalescence is recounted in past-tense summary. The seasonal metaphor enriches theme but does not alter tactics. Functional lyric reprise but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"To find where unused courage waits" is articulated in paragraph four and sustained through Elena's reflection during convalescence. The motivation frames her internal question but is not dramatized through conflicted micro-choices on the page. The final gesture (extending the pillbox) answers the question yet the courage remains abstract—"something ancient and vital stir"—rather than embodied in a visible cost or tradeoff. Told more than shown; no friction between wants dramatized in scene. Functional but mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Silver hush" is established in the opening ("mist wrapped around her… silver and silent, muting even the sound of her breathing") and recurs ("her burned face unreadable beneath the mist's silver hush"). The tone modulates subtly as pressure rises—quiet becomes charged when the ally arrives and the mist "brightens" at closure. Coherent through turns; the hush charges the final image of warming. Strong early signal, consistent modulation, closure participation. Diction ("silver," "hush," "muted wind") maintains the tone without static repetition.</comment>
