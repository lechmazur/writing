<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Eleanor is presented through abstract qualities ("teaching children how to think in silence," "cultivated patience") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her motivation remains declarative rather than dramatized through pressure; the text tells us she "simply smiled" when questioned but never shows her struggling with competing desires or blind spots that force a visible choice. The ability to "hear what others only thought" functions as a label without clear cost or constraint shaping her decisions. No on-page choice forecloses a path with felt consequence—the ending summarizes growth ("something was growing") without anchoring it in Eleanor's personal renunciation or alteration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who and what are anchored early, but when ("three winters ago," "first night of each month," "between one starlit evening and the next") remains vague and does not tighten decisions, triggering a −0.4 penalty in Q2 and capping Q3 at 7.0. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of quiet rebellion via window displays, no causal linkage between beats), but the closure offers only summary ("something was growing") rather than a decisive image or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost. The final paragraph describes effects without a crystallized moment where Eleanor's stance or the town's options visibly reconfigure; closure form (RR or CR) is not legible on the page, only narrated in abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cobalt library and magnetic grotto are introduced with vivid sensory detail ("emerged from the mist," "under starlight") but remain postcard backdrops; neither location constrains Eleanor's choices or supplies a resource that alters tactics. The window displays across town are described (teacup, door ajar, compass with two norths) but spatial choreography is absent—no bodies, distances, or movement track across the scenes. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) does not charge the final image; the ending invokes "the amplified quiet between one starlit evening and the next" without grounding it in a concrete place or object that matters to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—planting "forests of second thoughts"—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page moment shows Eleanor facing a trade-off or forfeiting a live option. The window displays and chess teaching are described as effects (mother reconsidering college, teenager asking father) but these are narrated outcomes, not dramatized pressure that Eleanor navigates with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required; the text offers only repeated assertions ("not grand gestures but humble rebellions") without tightening Eleanor's tactics or reweighting her risk. Escalation is absent—each paragraph restates the same idea (quiet rebellion spreads) without narrowing options or raising stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme (the power of silence, patient subversion) emerges from the window displays and chess coaching, avoiding overt statements until the final paragraph. The compass with two norths and the child's drawing of a tree with branches in two directions function as purposeful images that invite ambiguity. However, the ending slips into thematic summary ("not a revolution, but a forest of new possibilities") that articulates the premise rather than allowing it to resonate through a final image. The penultimate beat (elderly man writing the letter) offers a concrete particular but is immediately absorbed into generalization, reducing specificity at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering perception through Eleanor's professional lens (chess coaching, teaching patience). Diction is elevated and consistent ("cobalt library," "magnetic grotto," "amplified quiet") but occasionally drifts into abstract register ("the hush where past meets prophecy") that feels external to Eleanor's idiom. No dialogue appears; perceptual signature is present (she "catches whispers that never escaped minds") but not tested under pressure. The final paragraph modulates into a more declarative, summarizing tone that distances from Eleanor's lived experience, flattening voice at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the text: "When parents asked... When teachers noticed... When they couldn't articulate..." (identical stems across three beats), "The point was the mother who... The teenager who... The elderly man who..." (parallel construction without pressure variation). Stock metaphors cluster without transformation: "forests of second thoughts," "seeds of wondering," "armor of certainty." Filter verbs stack in reflective passages ("She learned to cradle," "She taught them to cradle") without adding pressure. These artifacts reduce information density and dull momentum, particularly in the final third where closure should land. Applying patterned-artifact penalty: −1.2 in Q7 for loops, stems, and stock phrasing that touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The premise (chess coach as quiet revolutionary organizing symbolic window displays) reads as a synthesis of familiar tropes: the patient teacher, the subliminal message campaign, the town slowly awakening. The magnetic grotto and "hears unspoken words" attribute add surface novelty but function ornamentally rather than constraining Eleanor's choices with fresh consequences. The window displays (teacup beside unwritten letter, door ajar, compass with two norths) are aesthetically pleasing but lack the specificity that would anchor them in Eleanor's lived experience or the town's particular geography and social fabric. No turn or reweighting feels inevitable in hindsight; the narrative progression is additive (one example after another) rather than transformative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's role as chess coach is present throughout and frames her teaching philosophy, but no specific chess decision or board scenario drives a key turn. She "taught children to listen" and "organized the synchronized window displays," yet these are narrated effects rather than on-page choices that narrow options. The element appears in setup and is invoked at closure ("Eleanor continued her work at the chess board") but does not causally enable or constrain the middle beats; her coaching is context, not lever.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto is introduced in paragraph two ("in its deepest chamber, a magnetic grotto under starlight drew things together") and mentioned again in the final paragraph ("The magnetic grotto waited beneath the cobalt library, drawing together all the unspoken words"). Both instances describe its function abstractly without showing Eleanor using it or making a choice contingent on its properties. The grotto does not evolve across beats or charge the closure with reweighted meaning; it remains decorative.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"A humble rebellion" is explicitly named in paragraph four and again in paragraph five ("quiet rebellions"). The concept shapes the narrative's thematic claim but does not constrain Eleanor's on-page options—no moment shows her choosing subtlety over overt action because of resource limits, risk, or personal conviction tested under pressure. The window displays exemplify the concept yet are described in summary rather than dramatized as tactical choices with visible cost. Functional but largely thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Eleanor's ability to hear unspoken words is introduced in paragraph two ("Eleanor had always possessed this attribute—catching whispers that never escaped minds") and referenced in paragraph four ("children had learned to hear the unspoken"). The attribute is label-only; no scene shows Eleanor navigating a dilemma where hearing a thought creates friction, forces a moral choice, or incurs a cost. The grotto "amplified it," but the mechanics and consequences remain abstract. Present in setup and middle theme but no visible trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Cradle" appears multiple times: Eleanor "learned to cradle those fragmented feelings like wounded birds" (paragraph two), children "cradle doubt until it became comfortable" (paragraph four), Eleanor teaches them "to cradle their doubts until they became strengths" (final paragraph). The action is metaphorical and repeated but does not drive a concrete turn—no moment where Eleanor physically or mentally cradles something and that act narrows her options or changes the outcome. Thematic recurrence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The synchronized window displays are introduced in paragraph four with specificity ("On the first night of each month, shops across town would arrange their windows") and examples follow (teacup, door ajar, child's drawing). The method is signaled early and shapes the middle beat by illustrating the rebellion's mechanics. However, no scene shows Eleanor negotiating with shopkeepers, facing resistance, or choosing which images to deploy under constraint. The displays produce effects (mother reconsidering college, teenager asking father) but Eleanor's organizing work is narrated, not dramatized. Present in setup and development; contributes to thematic closure but lacks on-page causal friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The cobalt library is introduced in paragraph two ("emerged from the mist only at certain hours") and returns in the final paragraph ("The magnetic grotto waited beneath the cobalt library"). Vivid description but no scene shows Eleanor entering it, retrieving something, or making a choice because of what she finds there. The library holds "books that had never been written and letters that had never been sent," a poetic detail that does not constrain tactics or alter the stakes. Setup and closure presence without middle development or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"The hush where past meets prophecy" appears once in paragraph two as an atmospheric phrase describing when the library appears, and "between one starlit evening and the next" closes the story. Neither instance functions as a ticking clock or decision window that tightens Eleanor's choices. The "first night of each month" timing for window displays is mentioned but not dramatized as a constraint. Time remains vague and does not escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to plant forests of second thoughts" is explicit in paragraph four and echoed in the final paragraph ("a forest of new possibilities"). The desire is declared and illustrated through examples (mother reconsidering college, teenager asking father, elderly man writing letter), showing its effects. However, no scene dramatizes Eleanor experiencing friction between this want and a competing need or cost—her commitment is asserted rather than tested. The motivation shapes the story's thematic claim and middle examples but lacks visible internal conflict or renunciation at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Tone of "amplified quiet" is established in the opening ("teaching children how to think in silence") and reinforced throughout: "the amplified quiet between one starlit evening and the next," "quiet rebellions," "humble rebellions." The tone is coherent and modulates in the window-display paragraphs where specificity increases (teacup, door ajar). However, the final paragraph shifts into a more declarative, summarizing register ("something was growing—not a revolution, but a forest") that dilutes the quiet restraint. Tone is consistent through most beats but does not charge the final image with additional pressure; it remains a static mood rather than a tool that tightens stakes.</comment>
