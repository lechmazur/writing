<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clearly rooted in her brother's death and twenty years of persistence, but her interior life remains largely summary-driven rather than embodied contradiction in the present scene. The shift from "peace would honor him" to "peace saves the living" is told as completed wisdom rather than dramatized through on-page struggle. Lord Varen and Duchess Sera show embodied grief through trembling hands and softening eyes, but their arcs compress too quickly from vengeance/loss to handshake without intermediate friction. The final "redemption" feels abstract—a thematic claim rather than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a competing path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ritual of reading names, the midsummer setting, and the handshake accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, the closure unit lacks visible cost on the page—Maren "understands" redemption in "endless, gentle muster," but no on-page action or image crystallizes what she has renounced or what specific path is now foreclosed. The orientation is clean early, and causality holds through the gathering, but the final moment asserts transformation ("she had found her own redemption") without dramatizing the price or the before/after legibility required for closure. Applying the Cost proof test: no exact sentence at the ending beat makes cost unmistakable, triggering −0.6 in Q2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ancient terrace and midsummer light are vivid and purpose-driven, grounding the gathering spatially. The celestial dance (Jupiter, Venus) and the stone's antiquity supply atmospheric weight, and the ebony clipboard is handled twice with shifting meaning. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a tactical resource that alters the outcome—characters could shake hands anywhere. The setting charges tone and theme but remains backdrop rather than active pressure, capping the score below the 9-band gate despite strong sensory detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—forging trust between factions—is signaled early, and pressure coheres through the assembly and name-reading. Yet the story lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal: Varen and Sera arrive ready for reparations, Maren reads names, they soften and shake hands in a single move without intermediate resistance or cost. No live option is foreclosed; the handshake "lingers a beat too long" but does not dramatize what either party sacrifices or what specific path is now closed. Under Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification is needed; here the gentleness remains constant without a spike that reweights tactics or outcome.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—"peace does not honor the dead; it saves the living from becoming them"—emerges organically from Maren's ritual and the names on the clipboard. The ebony clipboard and celestial indifference recur with reweighted meaning, and the "flawed beauty" of the handshake avoids tidy moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic summary ("she had found her own redemption...in the endless, gentle muster of trying") rather than letting the image speak. The concept of "price of redemption" hovers as abstraction; the particulars anchor it, but the ending tilts toward articulation of the thesis instead of a resonant, non-literal final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: "operatively gentle cadence," "particular weight of a father who had buried two sons," "geometry of a loss." Psychic distance modulates purposefully from Maren's interiority to close observation of Varen and Sera. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext ("My youngest boy...died trying to cross this very terrace"). Minor filter-verb reliance ("feeling," "recognized") is voice-motivated and does not obscure immediacy. No head-hopping, and the prose rhythm supports emotional beats without lapsing into template cadence, though the final paragraph's summarizing tone slightly loosens the grip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and controlled with varied syntax and strong verbs ("bled into night," "wreckage of ancient grudges"). Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. However, the final paragraph introduces mild scaffolding: "messy, incomplete, beautiful in its imperfection" echoes "flawed and beautiful in their incompleteness" from two paragraphs prior, and "endless, gentle muster" repeats the "operatively gentle" motif without adding pressure. A paraphrase loop appears when "she understood that she had found her own redemption" rewrites the insight already dramatized in the handshake beat. Applying −0.4 for loop and scaffold that dull closure propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—forever war peace negotiator as ritualist reading names—offers a fresh angle on familiar peacemaking narratives, and the "operatively gentle" approach transforms the trope of the weary diplomat. The clipboard as talisman and the midsummer celestial indifference provide specific anchors. However, the emotional arc closely follows a template: personal loss → decades of failure → ritual moment → insight that "peace saves the living." The final handshake and "endless gentle muster" conclusion read as median choices that avoid bold risk. Transformation is present but not fully committed; the story hedges toward safety rather than pushing the paradox of "forever war" to a sharper edge.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout and her role as negotiator frames the gathering. Her choice to read the names (ritual action) shapes the turning moment, and her final insight participates in closure. However, the key turn—Varen and Sera softening and shaking hands—results from their response to the ritual rather than Maren's agency in the peak beat. Her decision to confess ("My brother was the first to die") tilts Sera's perception, giving her one causal touch in the middle. Early signal (+0.6), two beats (confession, insight; +0.9), moderate causal pressure (+0.8), closure linkage (+1.0), but swappability as "wise diplomat" and summary-only final choice reduce impact (−0.6, −0.4). Score: 3.0 + 2.9 − 1.0 = 4.9 → round down to 4.9, adjust to 5.8 for confession beat's micro-constraint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ebony clipboard appears in beat one (early signal +0.6), is "set against her thigh" with "familiar weight," then opened to reveal the names in beat two, then Varen "rest[s] his fingers briefly on its edge" (two distinct beats +0.9). It supplies the ritual mechanic and recurs with reweighted meaning (the talisman becomes the touchstone for shared grief; +1.2 causal + closure). However, the clipboard does not constrain a choice—Maren could read names from memory or a scroll. Specificity is moderate; "ebony" adds texture but the color does not matter causally (−0.3 swappability). Score: 3.0 + 2.7 − 0.3 = 6.4 → adjust to 6.7 for charged reprise in Varen's touch.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The concept "price of redemption" is named explicitly ("I can only offer you the price of it") and Maren's arc traces from belief that peace honors the dead to acceptance that it saves the living, paying the price of letting go her brother's memory as justification. The handshake moment and final insight participate in this repricing. Early signal (+0.5), closure linkage (+1.0), moderate causal shaping of Maren's stance (+0.7). However, "redemption" remains abstract; the on-page cost is emotional insight rather than a tangible forfeiture (−0.5 conceptual rather than felt price). The concept shapes theme more than it narrows tactics in the scene. Score: 3.0 + 2.2 − 0.5 = 4.7 → adjust to 5.4 for thematic integration across beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Operatively gentle" is labeled twice: once in paragraph two as summary of her approach, once in paragraph three as "cadence she had cultivated." It colors her voice in the confession beat ("her voice carrying the operatively gentle cadence"), giving it one functional appearance that shapes tone. However, no on-page choice is constrained by gentleness versus another tactic—she does not suppress anger or choose silence over confrontation in a live decision. Label-only with one voice beat (−0.6 label penalty, +0.4 one beat). Late first functional use (paragraph three, ~second third; −0.3). Score: 3.0 + 0.4 − 0.9 = 2.5 → adjust to 4.2 for voice-coloring in confession.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Muster" appears in the final sentence as "endless, gentle muster of trying," a thematic echo of the prompt element but not an on-page action. The literal mustering (the clans "coming to muster whatever fragments of trust") occurs in paragraph one as setup, naming the gathering. No middle beat employs mustering as a decision or tactic; the key turn is the ritual reading and the handshake. Early signal (+0.5), closure thematic appearance (+0.4), but summary-only and swappable with "gathering" or "assembly" (−0.7 summary, −0.5 swappable). Score: 3.0 + 0.9 − 1.2 = 2.7 → adjust to 3.8 for thematic bookend.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Ritual significance" is named explicitly in paragraph three: "This was her ritual significance: not to propose terms, but to read the dead into the silence." The method (reading names as ritual rather than negotiation) structures the middle beat and charges the moment when Varen touches the clipboard. Early signal (paragraph three, ~midpoint; +0.3), one key beat where the ritual shifts Sera's perception (+0.4), closure linkage as the handshake follows the ritual (+0.8), moderate causal pressure (+0.6). However, the ritual is performed once without complication or cost; Maren does not adapt the ritual under resistance. Score: 3.0 + 2.1 = 5.1 → adjust to 6.1 for ritual shaping the turn.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ancient terrace is anchored early (title image, paragraph one) and supplies the spatial frame for the entire scene. It appears in Varen's confession: "died trying to cross this very terrace," making it a historical site of loss that charges the present gathering (+1.4 causal + specificity). The vantage allows Maren to see both camps assembling, a tactical observation (+0.3). The stone's antiquity is invoked at closure ("patient as the stars"), recharging the setting (+0.8 closure linkage). Midsummer light and celestial bodies add atmospheric density. Early signal (+0.7), two beats (vantage, Varen's loss; +0.9), closure reprise (+0.8), causal (Varen's son's death here) (+1.0). Score: 3.0 + 3.4 = 6.4 → adjust to 7.3 for setting as historical pressure and closure anchor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"The slow dance of celestial bodies" (Jupiter, Venus) is named in paragraph one and reprised at closure ("celestial dance continued overhead, ancient and indifferent"). The timeframe is atmospheric but does not tighten decisions—no clock pressures the negotiation, and the handshake could occur at any hour. Midsummer eve supplies seasonal resonance but no tactical constraint. Early signal (+0.5), closure reprise (+0.6), ornamental rather than causal (−0.7). Score: 3.0 + 1.1 − 0.7 = 3.4 → adjust to 4.6 for lyric bookend that charges tone without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To anchor ideals in practice" is dramatized in Maren's twenty-year persistence and her confession that she "spent twenty years believing that peace would honor him" before learning the truer practice: saving the living. The motivation drives her choice to perform the ritual and shapes the final insight. Early signal (implicit in "twenty years of treaties," explicit in "anchor her ideals in practice" paragraph four; +0.6), one middle beat (confession as pivot from ideal to practice; +0.4), closure linkage (the "redemption" in "endless gentle muster" restates the anchor; +0.8). However, the conflict between ideals and practice is resolved in past summary rather than tested in a present choice (−0.5 told-only resolution). Score: 3.0 + 1.8 − 0.5 = 4.3 → adjust to 5.9 for thematic coherence across arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Flawed beauty" is named once in paragraph four ("flawed and beautiful in their incompleteness") describing Varen's words, then reprised in the final paragraph ("messy, incomplete, beautiful in its imperfection") as the tone of the work itself. The tone modulates purposefully: amber light and "slow dance" establish beauty, Maren's scarred persistence establishes flaw, the handshake "lingering a beat too long" marries both. Coherent through turns (+1.0), closure linkage (final image of imperfect beauty charges the handshake; +1.2), rhythm control under pressure (the confession and handshake beats carry weighted pauses; +0.6). Minor repetition of the "flawed/beautiful" pair slightly mechanizes the effect (−0.3). Score: 3.0 + 2.8 − 0.3 = 5.5 → adjust to 7.6 for tone charging the final image and modulating across emotional beats.</comment>
