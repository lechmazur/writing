<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The traveler's profession and motivations are established through vivid interiority—"made a profession of farewells," "writing obituaries for the living"—but remain largely reflective. Internal contradiction exists (haunting a place she never meant to stay vs. choosing to remain), yet choices are limited to sitting, touching the thread, and writing; no competing pressures force a difficult micro-choice that alters tactics. The final realization that she will "become part of the explained absences" reads as epiphany rather than a decision with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present in the gesture of touching the thread and the "particular reverence," but the lack of on-page conflict limits the character work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The piece accumulates density through layered images (garden, thread, light, silence) and the final paragraph offers a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise—the traveler understands her staying as "the beginning of healing" and the "first stroke of the map." However, the cost is implied rather than concretely legible; no on-page sentence shows what she forfeits by missing the ship or what price accompanies her decision to stay. The ending reconfigures her stance but lacks a felt sacrifice that would charge the closure image under the chosen lens. The accumulative design is clear, but the closure moment remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The shadowed garden is vividly rendered—dry fountain, birch bark peeling like pages, flagstone patterns like writing—and the autumn light creates a temporally specific atmosphere. The weft thread in her pocket is handled twice (purchase backstory, tactile anchor) and carries thematic weight. However, neither the setting nor the thread constrains a choice or alters tactics; they function as evocative backdrop rather than active pressure. The garden's role as "a place designed for departures" frames the conceptual stakes but does not supply a resource or obstacle that changes the protagonist's options on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding "the geography of healing"—is signaled early and remains coherent. The piece accumulates pressure through the traveler's reflections and the charged final image of staying, but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options with visible cost. The missed ship is established as inciting lateness, yet the protagonist does not grapple with a trade-off or make a decision that forecloses a path; she arrives at a realization that "felt like the beginning of healing" without a dramatized price. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the lack of a legible cost or a turn that changes tactics keeps the escalation in mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: absence, documentation, the act of staying as self-inscription into loss. The weft thread as "evidence of beauty that no longer existed" and the garden as "a place designed for departures" are non-literal carriers. The final image—"the first stroke of the map she had come here to draw"—reweights the opening's sense of accidental haunting into intentional witness. No overt moralizing mars the ending. However, the thematic resonance relies heavily on abstract language ("geography of healing," "explained absences") that, while poetic, edges toward conceptual assertion rather than earned from scene pressure. The lack of a concrete choice that dramatizes the theme's friction limits entry to high-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct, elevated register: "the particular reverence of someone who had made a profession of farewells," "silence left behind." Perceptual signature is consistent—filtering through a narrator attuned to absences, light, and documentation. Free indirect style is clean. Diction remains controlled and literary throughout. Under peak reflection (the final paragraph), the voice modulates slightly but stays coherent. No dialogue is present. The prose carries a singular texture that fits the character's occupation and stance. Minor slip: the phrase "lonesome splendor" in the final sentence reads as a callback to the generation prompt rather than voice-motivated language, creating a hairline register bump.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Clarity is generally strong. However, multiple figurative clusters appear without pattern-teaching: "leaves fell like whispered confessions," "dry as old bone," "bark peeled like pages," "sorrow moved through a person like water through a delta," "light dying beautifully," "holding its breath," "lonesome splendor like a breath about to be released." The final third layers metaphor densely ("holding its leaves and its silence and its lonesome splendor like a breath") without a prior pattern that teaches the reader to expect this cadence. Template stems recur: "She wrote about X… She wrote about Y… She wrote about Z" in one paragraph. Paraphrase loop: "explained absences" is repeated across beats without evolving function. Deductions: figurative density −0.5, template cadence −0.4, paraphrase loop −0.2 = baseline ~7.0, capped at 6.9 due to closure-beat metaphor stack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—writing obituaries for the living, carrying a palace thread as evidence—offers a fresh angle on witness and documentation. The garden as a site for "understanding the geography of healing" is specific. However, the emotional arc (lateness → acceptance → self-inscription into loss) follows a familiar contemplative template without a non-obvious turn. The thread and the garden remain symbolic rather than forcing an unexpected choice. The final realization that staying is "the beginning of healing" risks abstraction. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the material. The synthesis is competent and lyrical but does not feel inevitable in hindsight; swapping the thread for another relic or the garden for another ruin would leave the arc largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The traveler is present throughout and her profession shapes thematic framing. However, her choices are limited to observation, touching the thread, and writing; no on-page decision alters tactics or creates a key turn. The final realization—that she will stay and "become part of the explained absences"—is a conceptual shift rather than a choice with visible cost. Setup and closure participation are present, but middle development (a choice that constrains options) is absent. Functional but replaceable; the role could be filled by any contemplative witness without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The weft thread appears in setup (backstory of purchase) and is touched mid-scene ("warm against her thigh," "warm against her skin"). It carries thematic weight as "evidence of beauty that no longer existed." However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it remains a symbolic touchstone. Closure participation is weak—mentioned once in the final third but not visibly reweighted or causally active in the ending image. Two-beat presence without causal pressure or closure charge places it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Explained absences" is signaled early, frames the traveler's work, and recurs in the final paragraph: "she would become part of the explained absences that would one day need their own documentation." It shapes the thematic stakes throughout. However, it does not alter on-page tactics or force a choice; it functions as conceptual scaffolding rather than a dramatized pressure. Setup, thematic development, and closure reprise are all present, meeting all three gates, but the concept remains abstract rather than causal. Eligible for mid-6s under lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Vividly descriptive" is enacted in the prose itself—garden imagery, light patterns, sensory detail—but as an attribute it does not constrain or enable a choice. It flavors the narrative texture without altering options or tactics. Present throughout but ornamental to the story's logic; the same arc could occur with less description. Functional atmospheric layer, mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Intimate" describes the traveler's writing method: "not observation from a distance, but projection of presence." It is defined mid-scene and enacted in her act of writing about the garden as if inhabiting its silence. However, the method is shown as reflection rather than a choice that turns the plot; she writes, but the writing does not alter her situation or force a cost. Setup and thematic presence are clear, but no major turn traces to this action. Functional but swappable with "reflective documentation" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Projecting presence" is introduced mid-scene ("she could inhabit the space she was documenting and speak from within its silence") and governs her writing act. It appears in the final paragraph's framing of her future documentation. Setup arrives late (~40%); middle beat (the writing passage) enacts it; closure alludes to it. However, the mechanics do not shape a decision or create pressure; the method remains descriptive. Late signal and lack of causal pressure cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden is established immediately and anchors every beat. It is described with high specificity (dry fountain, birch, flagstones, hedges) and tied thematically to "a place designed for departures." The final paragraph charges the garden as the site where she will "stay" and "become part of the explained absences." Setup, atmospheric development, and closure participation are all present. However, the garden does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it functions as evocative container. Lyric reprise reweights the stake at closure, allowing entry to low-6s under the resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"After the last ship sailed" is signaled in the opening sentence, establishing lateness as the inciting condition. The timeframe recurs in the final third when the traveler "understood that she had arrived too late to catch the ship, and that this lateness was itself a kind of absence." It frames the stakes but does not function as a ticking clock that alters tactics; the ship is already gone, removing urgency. Setup and closure acknowledgment are present; middle pressure is absent. One causal turn (lateness forces the decision to stay) elevates slightly, but the lack of live tightening caps the score in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To understand the geography of healing" is stated early ("she had come to this garden because she had heard…") and returns in the final line ("the beginning of healing—the first stroke of the map"). It governs the traveler's purpose throughout. However, the desire is not dramatized through conflicting choices or visible friction; she reflects on healing's shape without facing a cost. Setup, thematic thread, and closure reprise meet all three gates, but the motivation remains told and abstract rather than enacted under pressure. Eligible for mid-5s under lyric allowance; lack of friction prevents higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is enacted consistently in the prose: the isolated garden, autumn beauty, the traveler's solitary presence, elegiac diction. The tone modulates slightly—quiet reverence rising to a charged final image—without breaking coherence. The phrase "lonesome splendor" appears explicitly in the final sentence, charging the closure image. Setup (atmosphere from line one), sustained modulation, and explicit closure charge are all present. However, the tone does not pressure a choice; it functions as consistent mood rather than a force that alters tactics. All three gates met, tone charges the final image, low-6s placement fits.</comment>
