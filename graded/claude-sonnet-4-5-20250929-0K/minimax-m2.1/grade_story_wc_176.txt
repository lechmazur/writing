<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Yara's interiority is concrete and particular—guilt as "a stone in her chest," forgiveness "forged" through hammering at locked doors. Her technical gentleness constrains her night-long work and the final choice to return to the world she fled is earned by five winters of isolation. Minor slip: the epiphany structure ("After forgiving yourself, the world looks different") edges toward therapy-speak, though the subsequent imagery grounds it. Internal conflict between guilt and duty operates clearly, and the protagonist's arc integrates with her craft.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (sanctum, Yara, keeper of names), and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the night as the rope begins to glow and hum with retained memory. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—Yara creates "space for what remained" and rises to walk toward the door; the cost is visible in aching joints and five winters of isolation, the rope now a living archive. One tightening suffices at this length. Small penalty: the final paragraph moralizes slightly ("not a monument to the past but a living archive") where image alone would have charged harder.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum and aurora are vivid and purposeful: frost-laced floor, cracked dome, prisms of light at dawn. The ceremonial rope functions as micro-setting—its braids constrain Yara's technique and the punched card scrap guides frequency. Sensory detail is filtered through craft attention (breath fogging, numb fingers, fibers' tension). The setting charges the final image (ice remains, aurora circles, rope waits). No occupational depth issues; the lost-wax casting background integrates without excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve forgotten names and finish unfinished work. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as the rope glows and names rise through the night. One meaningful deepening occurs: the rope hums with memory by dawn, and Yara's decision to walk toward the door forecloses isolation. Cost is visible (aching joints, five winters, numb fingers). Small gap: the escalation is textural density rather than a sharp reversal, which fits the lens but lands gently; a more visceral price at the threshold would tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: forgiveness as self-forging, memory as burden and vessel, the rope as living archive. The punched card scrap and reconfigured braids offer concrete anchors; the final image ("forgetting was a heavier burden than remembrance") is earned rather than stated. No overt moralizing in the climax beat itself, though the penultimate paragraph edges toward summary. The protagonist's arc is inextricable from the thematic question. Subtext operates in the rope's quiet hum and Yara's walk toward the door.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during craft work, slightly elevated in reflection). Perceptual signature is clear: Yara notices fibers, tension, structure. Diction matches her technical background without register drift. No dialogue present. Minor slip: some phrases edge toward elevated diction ("sanctum," "pooled like water frozen mid-collapse") that occasionally float above grounded perception, though the craft vocabulary anchors voice overall. Free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the craft beats. No major loops or scaffold. Small deductions: "After forgiving yourself, the world looks different" is a stock opener for that paragraph; the final paragraph summary ("not a monument to the past but a living archive") slightly over-explains where image would suffice. Figurative language is controlled ("guilt sat like a stone," "names rose in the air like breath"). Sentence openings vary and clarity holds. Propulsion is solid through the night sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost-wax caster, punched card scrap, and ceremonial rope braiding is specific and non-obvious. The timeframe "after forgiving yourself" offers a fresh stake. Transformation test passes: the particulars (aurora, rope braids, bronze transcription) are load-bearing. Small penalty: the forgiveness-to-craft-redemption arc is a familiar template in literary short fiction; the specificity of method elevates but does not fully transform the underlying structure. Emotional truth is present; no close echoes of famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Yara's identity as lost wax caster is established early and informs her technical gentleness and understanding of permanence. Her choice to reconfigure the rope and then walk toward the door are key turns. The craft background primes both the method and the thematic weight of transcription. Present across setup, middle craft work, and closure decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The punched card scrap appears mid-story, serves as guide for frequency patterns in the rope braiding, and is mentioned in hindsight at the ending ("served as her guide"). Two beats: discovery in lower chambers, use during reconfiguration. Its hole pattern teaches which frequencies to carry. Swappability is moderate—another encoded memory artifact could substitute with edits. Closure linkage is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Transcribed memory is the story's spine: Yara transcribed dying words into bronze, the rope carries retained voice-memory, the punched card encodes lullaby, the rope hums with names at closure. Shapes stakes (preserve sound of forgotten names) and method (reconfiguration to extend memory). Present in setup (her prior role), development (punched card and braiding), and payoff (rope hums, living archive). High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" is introduced early ("her gift since childhood"), constrains the night's careful reconfiguration work ("gentle lifting," "careful weaving"), and enables the rope's transformation without destruction. Visible in at least two beats: examination of the rope and the night-long braiding. Cost is implicit (patience, numb fingers, extended focus). Label is somewhat overt but the trait visibly alters her method.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Illuminate" is present via the aurora's green and violet ribbons, the faint glow of the rope, and dawn's prisms of light. The rope's glow is tied to memory retention. However, illumination does not create a major turn—it accompanies rather than drives the reconfiguration. The action is functional but replaceable; "restore," "encode," or "amplify" could substitute with minor edits. Mid-range functional presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Reconfiguring the braids is signaled early (Yara examines the rope's structure), detailed through the night sequence (lifting strands, weaving, shifting tension), and directly produces the closure effect (rope hums with memory). Mechanics matter: each braid carries burden, tension creates pathways, structure extends history. The method is causally active across setup, development, and payoff. High specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum with cracked dome and aurora is established early and pressures Yara through cold (numb fingers, fogging breath) and isolation (no pilgrims, silence). The setting's abandonment motivates her five-winter solitude and frames the closure choice (door leading back to the world). Aurora and ice bookend the story. The setting enables and constrains but does not supply a tactical resource that alters outcome mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After forgiving yourself" frames the opening reflection and marks the threshold that enables Yara's return to her work. It anchors the backstory (five winters to reach forgiveness) and primes the closure decision (walking toward the door). However, the timeframe is conceptual rather than urgent; no live clock tightens tactics during the night's work. Lyric resonance is present but pressure is diffuse.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Preserving the sound of forgotten names is dramatized through Yara's transcription role, her guilt over abandoning the duty, and the night's rope work to create a living archive. The motivation is conflicted (grief versus duty, guilt versus acceptance) and tested on the page (numb fingers, aching joints, five winters of isolation). It drives the core choice to reconfigure the rope and shapes the closure walk. High friction and cost visibility.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" reads as patient, cold-edged warmth emerging through sustained effort. Tone is coherent: measured reflection, careful craft description, quiet intensity at the rope's glow, and restrained hope at the door. Modulates subtly from frozen grief to living archive without rupture. The final image (rope waiting, door open) carries the tone's charge. Slight penalty: the term itself does not appear and must be inferred; explicitation would anchor more firmly.</comment>
