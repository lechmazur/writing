<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority relies heavily on abstract sensory claims ("emotional residue," "heat signatures") that are asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The final realization "she was not documenting the unknown. She was becoming its voice" reads as a declared epiphany without dramatized internal conflict or visible cost that forecloses a prior path. No secondary character pressure tests her stance; the piece tracks a single observer moving through reflection without genuine struggle or foreclosed options. Motivation remains Tell-heavy and lacks the embodied contradiction required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory detail and reflective density toward a final realization, but the closure unit—Maren's decision to "map not just the sensory landscape but the emotional geography"—lacks visible or felt cost on the page. The orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. However, the ending articulates purpose without demonstrating a trade-off, foreclosed path, or dramatized price; the algae "pulsing brighter" and the fossil "watching" are decorative rather than causal or costly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is vividly rendered with bioluminescent algae, tidal pools, and mineral signatures, establishing atmosphere and voice early. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics at closure; Maren floats and reflects without spatial obstacles or resource pressures that shape her final stance. The elm leaf fossil is described in exquisite detail but remains a static object of contemplation rather than a tool or constraint that charges the final image with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Maren's search for purpose as a sensory cartographer—is signaled early but never faces on-page pressure that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The piece offers a deepening of understanding (theoretical work → active voice) but this shift is declared in reflection rather than dramatized through a choice with visible cost. No reversal, renunciation, or endurance forecloses a prior path; the algae's brightened pulse and the fossil's "ancient permanence" are atmospheric rather than stakes-altering.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of post-Sleep cartography and the paradox of the coastal elm fossil, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image attempts a resonant answer—voice for the unknown—but the thematic payoff is undercut by thesis-like phrasing: "She had found her voice, and it spoke for everything that had waited patiently." The piece gestures toward complexity (mystery predating human memory) without genuine ambiguity or counter-reading; the ending resolves neatly into declared purpose rather than felt ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; voice carries a distinct lyric texture with elevated diction ("maritime anachronism," "factually mystical") that fits the post-Sleep world-building. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("a fact that had become legend, a legend that was actually memory") that dilates the perceptual signature without advancing pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression and patterned diction are present, but the final paragraph's thesis-like articulation ("she was not documenting the unknown. She was becoming its voice") breaks the established perceptual filter with over-articulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and sensory detail is vivid, but the piece exhibits template cadence in the final paragraph: parallel declarations ("a fact that had become legend, a legend that was actually memory, a memory that Maren would carry forward") that loop conceptually without advancing pressure. The opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor figurative muddle: "the bioluminescent algae pulsing soft green along the cavern walls like a living map指引她前行" includes an untranslated Chinese phrase that reads as a generation artifact. Paraphrase loop in the final beat: "float in its hidden waters" echoes the earlier tidal-pool float without added detail or cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The post-Sleep awakening premise and sensory cartographer role offer a fresh synthesis, and the coastal elm fossil is a striking anomaly. However, the emotional arc—passive observer finds purpose through reflection—follows a familiar template without bold risk or non-obvious turn. The piece commits fully to its lyric, meditative mode but retreats into thesis-like declarations at closure rather than earning transformation through dramatized cost. Specificity in world-building (Long Sleep, heat-mapping, maritime anachronism) elevates but does not overcome the stock epiphany structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maren appears in every beat and her occupation frames the premise, but her choices are observational and reflective rather than decision-driven. She moves through the cave, studies the fossil, and floats in the pool—actions that advance knowledge but do not alter tactics or foreclose options with visible cost. The final realization is declared, not enacted through a turn. Present throughout; middle use is observational; closure participation is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The elm leaf fossil is introduced early, studied in the middle beat, and invoked in the final image ("watched her with its ancient permanence"). However, its role remains symbolic and descriptive; Maren does not handle, use, or interact with it in ways that constrain choice or alter tactics. The object's "impossible presence" is contemplated rather than causally active. Two-beat involvement with charged reprise, but no cost tied to the object itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Transitional objects" is named explicitly in the text ("a transitional object in the truest sense, helping her transition from sleeper to witness"), but this remains a thematic label rather than a concept that shapes stakes or alters tactics on the page. The fossil serves as a symbol of transition, not a tool or constraint that drives choices. Label-only use without causal pressure or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" is articulated mid-story ("not mystical in the superstitious sense—it was factually mystical") and describes the paradox of the elm fossil, but the attribute does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. It flavors Maren's perception without altering her tactics or final choice. Present in one beat; label-only trait without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Maren floats in the tidal pool at the story's emotional center, and this physical act ("letting the saltwater support her weight as she floated upward, arms outstretched") is linked to her sensory mapping and the final realization. The action appears in the middle and is reprised thematically in the ending ("float in its hidden waters"), reweighting the earlier beat. However, the float does not drive a turn or alter options; it is a posture for reflection. Lyric reprise with thematic charge but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Heat-mapping is introduced early ("the heat-mapping came naturally to her") and invoked in the tidal-pool beat ("bringing her heat-mapping senses into full contact"), but the mechanics remain vague and the method does not shape attempts or constrain tactics. Maren perceives "emotional residue" and "heat signatures," but these perceptions do not alter her choices or cost. Present in two beats; functional but mechanics are abstract and do not drive turns.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is established in the opening line, detailed with bioluminescent algae and tidal pools, and referenced in the final image. The setting provides atmosphere and micro-geography (chambers, tidal pool, fossil display) but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics at closure. Maren moves freely; no spatial obstacle or resource pressure shapes her final stance. Three-beat presence with vivid specificity but no causal pressure on closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The Long Sleep and post-awakening context are established early and frame Maren's purpose ("the newly awakened human settlements spread inland"), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. Seventeen years is a static fact; no live clock or deadline shapes tactics. The "after humans hibernate" premise enriches setting and motivation but does not constrain the final choice. Present in setup and development; no closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To become the voice of the unknown" is articulated explicitly in the final paragraph ("She was not documenting the unknown. She was becoming its voice") and signaled earlier through her cartographer role and search for purpose. However, the desire is declared rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or visible cost. The motivation frames the arc but does not face friction between wants and costs on the page. Setup and closure participation; told-only at the ending beat.</comment>
