<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vael's interiority is consistently otherworldly and textured through sonar-perception and translucency, avoiding stock human gestures. The emotional arc—from ritual custodianship to recognition of the gear's awakening—tracks clearly, though the final choice (leaving the gear "exactly where it needed to be") feels more declared than earned through on-page micro-decisions under pressure. Interior contradictions exist (burden vs. promise, serenity vs. troubling) but remain abstract; no moment crystallizes competing impulses into a visible tradeoff. Embodiment is strong (sonar pings, translucent hand, organic rhythms) but the climax lacks a concrete action that forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who (Vael, otherworldly custodian), where (nebula garden center), and when (annual shedding cycle) within the first third. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (sonar, petals, gear's ticking) and the gear's awakening deepens the dominant stake (custodianship's meaning). Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final sonar ping and the knowledge that "the next custodian would find the gear exactly where it needed to be" reweights the ritual with undeniable pressure. Cost is conceptual—Vael's comprehension shifts—but the exact on-page sentence proving felt cost is elusive, weakening the closure's bite. The ticking gear moment is a strong turn, but the resolution pivot feels slightly asserted rather than bodied forth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nebula garden is vividly particular: bioluminescent petals that fall despite zero-gravity, crystalline trees drinking diffuse matter, violet haze with sonar-permeable texture. Spatial choreography is clear (outer rim → center clearing across seven breath-cycles). The garden constrains choice subtly—fire cannot kindle here, pressing Vael's mission to "share light without using fire"—and the final image (sonar rippling through petals, trees, machine heart) charges the closure by integrating environment into the resolution. Sensory detail is selective and anchored to Vael's non-human perception (sonar, translucency, proximity warmth). The micro-setting (gear against chest) and recurring petals meet the 9+ gate by constraining stakes and charging the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—faithful custodianship versus the gear's unexpected awakening—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates through the gear's ticking (a reversal: dormant object stirs) and Vael's recognition that "some part of its original purpose had slept within its teeth all along." One meaningful tightening occurs when the gear begins to solve for an unnamed variable, forcing Vael to reinterpret the mission. However, the final act ("knew that the next custodian would find the gear exactly where it needed to be") reads as realization without on-page agency or visible tradeoff; Vael does not choose between competing paths or forfeit an option. Cost is conceptual (mission redefined) but lacks the felt price or foreclosed alternative that would elevate this to 7.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—transmission of purpose across generations, memory embedded in objects, light-sharing without consumption—emerges organically from the gear's mechanics and Vael's ritual transit. The gear's awakening reweights the premise: what seemed obsolete holds dormant intention, and Vael's "cold flame of pure intention" redefines illumination through shadow and equation rather than fire. The final image (sonar ping rippling through all elements) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in "troubling serenity," the gear "remembering," and the petals' indifference. No thematic echo or explicit thesis statement mars the closure. The piece earns its quiet wisdom through the calculating machine's conceptual repricing of custodianship.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and textured with Vael's otherworldly perceptual signature: sonar pings, translucent hands, organic rhythms felt against brass. Diction is consistently elevated and voice-specific ("approximation itself, the infinite regression of calculation chasing its own tail") without register drift. No head-hopping; all knowledge stays character-bound. The prose modulates appropriately—lyric in transit, tightening when the gear ticks. One blemish: "唤醒" (a Chinese character meaning "awaken") appears mid-sentence ("waiting for the right pattern of attention to唤醒 it"), reading as a generation artifact or untranslated fragment that disrupts voice coherence. Otherwise, psychic distance and free indirect style are clean, and the perceptual bias (sentimentalist lens on mechanical object) is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift, and paragraph lengths create visual breath. Information density is high (each line advances atmosphere, character perception, or thematic weight). However, several passages loop conceptually: "the calculating machine gear" is named in full five times across eight paragraphs, and "the gear" appears in nearly every beat without functional variation. The phrase "approximates infinity's vast looping" and "infinite regression of calculation" restate the same abstraction within three paragraphs. "Troubling serenity" appears twice in adjacent sections. The prose is often luminous ("cold flame of pure intention," "small machine heart beating against flesh") but occasional filter-verb stacks ("Vael understood," "Vael stopped moving," "Vael reached out") and the untranslated "唤醒" artifact lower momentum. No major clarity breaks, but the cumulative scaffold and synonym churn ("calculating machine gear" vs. "small machine heart" vs. "gear") prevent entry to 7.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of sonar-based sentience, generational ritual, and a calculating gear awakening in a zero-gravity garden is specific and non-obvious. The "share light without using fire" mission and the gear's dormant consciousness offer fresh angles on custodianship and memory. Emotional specificity (sentimentality as burden and connection) avoids generic templates. However, the core structure—custodian carrying artifact, artifact awakens, custodian gains new understanding—follows a recognizable transformation arc without bold risk at closure. The otherworldly setting and non-human POV provide surface originality, but the final beat (knowledge that the next custodian will find it) feels more assured than inevitable, lacking a hinge moment that could only resolve this way. Proximity check passes; no close echoes detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vael (otherworldly sentimentalist) is present throughout and makes two key moves: catching a petal (ritual gesture) and sending the final sonar ping. The "sentimentalist" trait is demonstrated through accumulated longing, the weight of generational patterns, and the troubled response to the gear's awakening. However, these are largely perceptual and emotional; no on-page choice alters tactics or forecloses a path. The final realization ("knew that the next custodian would find the gear exactly where it needed to be") is insight, not decision. The character shapes tone and theme but does not create a turn through agency. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage (ping) +0.5, but swappability (any custodian could have this arc) −0.6, no causal pressure −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The calculating machine gear appears in six distinct beats: pressed into hands (backstory anchor), resting against chest (embodied), catching light, growing heavier, beginning to tick, and beating in the final sonar image. It constrains Vael's understanding of the mission and enables the story's central turn (dormant mechanisms stirring). The gear's "remembering" reweights custodianship and charges the closure image where it is felt rippling with the sonar ping. Early signal (first paragraph) +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (awakening narrows Vael's interpretation) +1.2, closure linkage (final ping through "small machine heart") +1.5. Minor swappability (another artifact could serve) −0.4. Strong integration across setup, development, payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Generational patterns appear early ("pressed into small hands as a promise and a burden," "passed down through generations") and shape the dominant stake: Vael inherits custodianship and must interpret the gear's new behavior within that frame. The concept constrains tactics (Vael carries different memories each time, accumulating sediment) and reweights at closure when the gear's dormant purpose surfaces, implying the pattern was never static. It is not merely thematic decoration but a live pressure on Vael's choices. Early signal +0.6, two beats (inheritance, accumulated weight) +0.9, causal pressure (frames Vael's mission) +0.8, closure linkage (pattern bends inward, next custodian) +0.9. Mild abstraction (told more than dramatized in mid-beats) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Approximates infinity" appears once as description ("patterns that approximated infinity's vast looping") and once as abstract attribute ("approximation itself, the infinite regression of calculation"). It characterizes the gear's mechanics but does not constrain or enable a concrete on-page action. The trait is label-only and does not create a tradeoff or limit a tactic. Late first appearance (second half) −0.5, ornamental (no beat involvement) −1.0, swappable (any recursive-metaphor adjective could replace it) −0.7, no closure participation −0.8. Reads as thematic flourish without mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Transit structures the entire piece: "The transit from the outer rim to the garden's center had taken seven cycles of breath." It creates the frame for Vael's reflections, the gear's weight accumulation, and the approach to the clearing where the gear awakens. The action is present in at least three beats (departure, passage description, arrival at center) and enables the closure image (final sonar ping sent after transit completes). However, transit is not the hinge of the turn—the gear's ticking is. Easily swappable with another ritual journey (pilgrimage, descent) without major edits. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, enables closure setup +0.5, but swappability −0.8, not the decisive moment −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sonar pinging appears in four beats: "sending out soft sonar pings" (opening), "sonar pings fading into the ambient chorus," implicit sensing through the garden, and "sent out a final sonar ping" (closure). The method shapes Vael's perception and integrates into the final image where the ping ripples through all elements. However, its mechanics are not tested or constrained; sonar does not fail, adapt, or create friction. It is method-as-texture rather than method-under-pressure. Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, closure linkage (final ping charges the image) +1.0, but no mechanical constraint or cost −1.0, swappable (any sensory broadcast could replace it) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The nebula garden is setup (first paragraph), developed (violet haze, falling petals, crystalline trees), and charged at closure (sonar rippling through petals, trees, machine heart). It constrains the mission ("no fire would ever kindle, for fire required consumption") and pressures Vael's tactics (must share light without destruction). The garden's indifference to the gear's crisis creates "troubling serenity." Spatial choreography (outer rim → center clearing) is clear. The petals, trees, and diffuse matter all return in the final image, reweighting the environment as participant rather than backdrop. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (no-fire rule shapes mission) +1.3, closure linkage (final ping through environment) +1.6, specificity (bioluminescent petals defy gravity) +0.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across the quiet sigh of falling petals" marks the timeframe; "seven cycles of breath" measures transit; "annual shedding" anchors the ritual. The time element is poetic and present but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. Vael's reflection unfolds at a contemplative pace without a live clock that alters moves. The falling petals recur in three beats and charge the final image, but as motif rather than pressure mechanism. Setup present +0.4, three beats (petals falling throughout) +1.4, closure linkage (petals in final ping) +0.7, but no causal tightening (time does not narrow options) −1.2, vague tracking (cycles metaphorical, not counted) −0.6. Reads as atmosphere more than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To share light without using fire" is stated explicitly in the fourth paragraph and reprised at closure ("It was not fire, but it burned in its own way, a cold flame of pure intention"). The motivation frames Vael's mission and is tested when the gear awakens with its own light. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through friction or choice. Vael does not face a temptation to use fire or a competing want; the mission is accepted without visible cost or internal conflict. Setup (stated early) +0.5, closure linkage (cold flame reprises the rule) +1.0, thematic coherence +0.4, but no on-page friction (want vs. obstacle) −0.9, told-only (not enacted in a choice beat) −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Troubling serenity" appears twice as phrase and pervades the tone: the garden's indifference, Vael's slow transit, the petals' falling, the quiet crisis. Tone is coherent through the gear's awakening (serenity troubles, then settles) and modulates subtly as pressure accumulates. The final image integrates both troubling (gear's cold flame, shadows, equations) and serenity (petals, ancient trees, sonar ripple). The tone charges the closure by making the reweighting feel inevitable rather than dramatic. Early signal (title-like use in opening third) +0.6, coherent across turns +1.0, modulates with gear's ticking +0.7, charges final image (troubling+serenity fused) +1.4, specificity (oxymoron sustained without contradiction) +0.5. Minor: slight repetition of the exact phrase −0.3.</comment>
