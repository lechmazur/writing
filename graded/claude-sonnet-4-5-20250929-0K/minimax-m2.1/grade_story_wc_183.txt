<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is established through concrete backstory (chimera twin consciousness, brother's death, her search), but her choices on the page are largely observational. The "curse of blissful aberration" is named rather than dramatically embodied in contradictory impulses during the present action. The final step forward into fog reads as acceptance rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Interiority leans toward lyric summary rather than micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: fog lifts, memories clarify, card intensifies—a pattern of deepening rather than causal reversal. Orientation anchors (Mira, prow, carnival ship, fog) arrive early. Closure effect is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira steps forward, "both trapped...and impossibly free," crystallizing her stance toward her brother's absence. Cost is felt but oblique—she accepts the search will continue without resolution, which reweights the opening obsession.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The carnival ship, fog, emerald card, and bay create a coherent liminal atmosphere. The card's rippling surface and green glow function as micro-setting that charges each beat and the final image. Spatial choreography (prow, fog thinning, step forward) tracks cleanly. The ship's "drifting monument to abandoned joy" motif recurs with purpose, and the fog's lifting pressures Mira's stance at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recapturing something memories cannot hold—is signaled early and sustained. The piece accumulates density (card intensifies, fog thins, brother's voice clarifies) but lacks a discrete on-page tightening or decision that narrows options before the final step. The step forward reads as acceptance of an open-ended quest rather than a choice with visible trade-off. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but the cost remains atmospheric rather than embodied in a concrete forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—identity fragmentation, the paradox of shared consciousness, mourning as recapture—emerges from particulars (palimpsest memories, double-exposure childhood, emerald card as conduit). "Blissful aberration" and "unkindled solace" risk label-speak but are anchored by the card's function and the brother's voice becoming "conversation." The final image—"both trapped...and impossibly free"—reweights the opening curse without stating a moral. No late thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited with controlled psychic distance. Diction is lyric and elevated ("palimpsest," "calliope," "unkindled solace") but stays consistent with the narrative voice and Mira's educated, grief-soaked perspective. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature—gardens she "recognized," memories that "alter"—is specific and biased. The card's rippling surface and the brother's voice as "harmony" and "conversation" carry purposeful compression without opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening long sentence ("The fog had swallowed...") contrasts with shorter beats at closure. One minor paraphrase loop: "recapture something that memories alone could not hold" echoes the opening "phantom passengers who remembered" without added pressure (−0.2). "Blissful aberration" and "unkindled solace" are high-register phrases that fit voice but border on ornamental in peak beats. Information density is high; no scaffold or template cadence. Figurative language (rivers beneath ice, veil lifting) remains coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The chimera twin consciousness and carnival ship as grief-monument offer a fresh synthesis. The emerald card as sensory conduit to "the garden of forgotten names" is specific and non-obvious. Risk: lyric compression and accumulative structure without a hard causal turn. Execution avoids stock ghost-ship tropes by grounding the fantastical in Mira's embodied perception. "Narrative threads that stitched reality together" gestures toward metafiction but remains anchored in her brother's journals.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira (chimera twin discoverer) is present throughout and her dual consciousness frames the story. She observes, remembers, and steps forward at the end—one choice. Her discovery role is more thematic (she has discovered/become her brother's consciousness) than causal-active. Setup present, middle use thematic, closure participation via the final step. Two gates met; causal pressure modest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Emerald swatch card appears in the opening beat (found two days ago), intensifies when Mira thinks of the garden (middle), and is pressed against her chest at closure. Three distinct beats; early signal; closure linkage clear. The card's rippling surface and green glow are specific. It enables her stance (she can step forward because the card "seemed to understand") but does not constrain a prior choice with visible cost. Strong integration, modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Unkindled solace" is named once in the brother's journals as something "found by following narrative threads." It does not shape an on-page choice or alter tactics. Present in setup via journals; no middle development; no closure participation. One gate met; ornamental. Label-only use (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Blissfully aberrant" is named once as "the curse of blissful aberration." It describes Mira's condition (chimera consciousness) but does not constrain or enable a discrete on-page action with cost. The trait is thematically present throughout but never forces a trade-off. Setup present; middle implicit; closure participation thematic only. Two gates met; label-only use (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Recapture" is the stated motivation ("not to honor his memory, but to recapture something") and drives the search. It appears in setup and shapes the final step forward. The action is present across beats but does not narrow options or force a mid-story reversal. Two gates met; causal pressure modest. The word itself could be swapped for "recover" or "retrieve" without structural loss (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Through narrative threads" is mentioned once in the brother's journals as the method for finding solace. It does not shape Mira's on-page tactics or appear in the closure. Setup via journals; no middle use; no closure participation. One gate met; swappable phrasing (−0.4). Late-story mention in reflection (−0.2).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival ship drifting in foggy bay is present in every beat: Mira stands at the prow, the ship turns, fog thins, she steps forward. The ship's "phantom passengers" and "drifting monument" charge the trapped-freedom paradox. Setup immediate; middle beats involve ship's motion and the fog's retreat; closure occurs aboard. Three gates met; strong causal presence; the ship is the spatial frame for all action. High specificity and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"As memories alter" is the story's present continuous action: the brother's voice becomes clearer, shared history is rewoven. The timeframe is signaled early (card found "two days ago," fever "took him" in past) and the alteration accelerates as the ship turns and fog thins. Setup present; middle development clear; closure participation via "memories alter within her." Three gates met. The time progression is felt but does not create a ticking-clock urgency that forces a choice; it accumulates rather than tightens.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To find the garden of forgotten names" is Mira's stated goal, mentioned twice (card shows glimpses, she thinks of the garden). It drives her presence on the ship and the final step. Setup present; middle via card's glow; closure implicit in "names waited to be remembered." Three gates met. The desire is told and thematic rather than tested by a concrete obstacle that forces her to choose between the garden and another want. Modest friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Trapped freedom" is embodied throughout: phantom passengers, ship drifts yet continues, Mira bound to brother's consciousness yet searching, final line "both trapped...and impossibly free." Setup immediate; middle maintained via fog as veil and ship as monument; closure crystallized in the exact phrase. Three gates met; strong closure linkage. Tone modulates purposefully (grief → liminal hope) and charges the final image. High coherence and specificity.</comment>
