<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and职业-specific, with embodied tension in the white-knuckled parachute buckle grip. However, the characterization remains largely static—observing, calculating, waiting—without meaningful internal contradiction or stakes that test competing impulses. The "watcher's burden" is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through a choice where the narrator must sacrifice one value for another. Muscle memory and ritual are told more than shown altering a present decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean and early. The piece follows a causal track: static clears → Elena reports position → storm shifts → narrator revises → Elena emerges safely. However, the closure lacks visible cost; the narrator releases the buckle and returns to watching, a return to equilibrium rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration. The "watcher's burden carried one more night" reads as Earned Stasis, but no path is foreclosed and no price paid on the page—the narrator will watch again tomorrow exactly as before.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The noctilucent observatory is vivid and specific: "no walls, only a railing of weathered wood and a roof of open night." The arbor anchors the narrator's isolation and the cold front's visibility. The parachute buckle functions as micro-setting, handled twice with evolving charge. The setting pressures the narrator's helplessness (can see but not reach) and the storm cell's position drives the heading revision, meeting the 9+ gate test for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elena's safe passage—is clear early, and the cold front shift provides one meaningful tightening that forces a revised heading. However, the narrator's agency is entirely observational until the single radio call; no choice trades one value against another, and the revision itself carries no visible cost (no competing option is foreclosed). The ending resolves through Elena's skill, not the narrator's sacrifice or transformation, undermining protagonist-driven escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "watcher's burden" is stated overtly multiple times rather than emerging from image and action: "This was the weight of my profession," "the watcher's burden made manifest," "the watcher's burden carried one more night." The parachute buckle and "soundless echo" recur but function as motifs, not dramatic ironies that reweight the premise. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "to watch is sometimes the greatest gift of all," violating the non-literal answer test and triggering the thematic-echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct professional idiom: "noctilucent observatory," "midnight pattern seeker," wind vectors and pressure systems. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close (white knuckles) to distant (observing cloud formations). However, diction occasionally drifts into essayistic register—"the watcher's burden made manifest," "acknowledgment of duty fulfilled"—that reads more like retrospective narration than present perception under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and several images are sharp: "sunlight through breaking fog," "anvil lit by moonlight on one side and dark as coal on the other." However, paraphrase loops accumulate: "could observe… could track… could see… but could not reach… could not warn… could not do anything" and later "could see… could track… could guide… but could not fly… could not share… could only observe." Template cadence ("This was my domain," "This was the weight," "This was how I preserved") and the repetitive "watcher's burden" phrasing flatten momentum. The loops touch the closure paragraph, triggering the artifact penalty and 9+ disqualification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The arbor-above-clouds setting and noctilucent observatory offer fresh spatial positioning. However, the core premise—ground controller guides pilot through weather—is familiar, and the story does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or specific lived contradiction. The "watcher's burden" is asserted as theme rather than discovered through incompatible goods forced into collision. The ending's "to watch is sometimes the greatest gift" reads as a thesis statement rather than an earned synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The midnight pattern seeker is present throughout and makes one key decision (heading revision at two-seven-zero). However, most beats involve observation without choice. The character watches, waits, calculates, but does not face a trade-off where watching competes with another value. Late appearance of decisive action and swappability (any weather observer could make the call) cap the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The parachute buckle appears in two distinct beats: inspected "a hundred times before each of her flights" and gripped "throughout the night" until released after Elena emerges. The release marks emotional closure but does not alter tactics or reweight prior meaning—it signals relief, not transformation. The buckle is specific but does not constrain a choice or participate causally in the heading revision.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The watcher's burden is named explicitly five times and described thematically but does not shape on-page tactics. The narrator's helplessness (can see but not act) is asserted rather than tested through a choice where watching conflicts with intervening. The concept frames the emotional texture but does not narrow options or create visible cost at a decision point.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Attentively inventive" is mentioned once in Elena's implied trust and demonstrated in the heading revision, but the trait does not constrain or enable with visible cost. The revision itself is portrayed as muscle memory and pattern recognition, not inventive problem-solving under pressure. The attribute is more label than dramatized capability that trades off against another value.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Revise" appears explicitly when the cold front shifts and the narrator pulls charts closer, traces new wind vectors, and changes Elena's heading. This action drives the story's sole turn and shapes the safe emergence. However, the revision is portrayed as straightforward—"The numbers aligned through practice more than thought"—without competing options or visible cost, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Muscle memory is invoked twice: inspecting the parachute buckle "through pure muscle memory" and tracing wind vectors where "my hands remembered patterns my conscious mind had long since forgotten." The method is signaled and contributes to the revision beat, but it does not create friction or cost—competence is assured rather than tested. The means could be replaced with "experience" or "training" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor is established early with specific detail (weathered wood railing, open night roof, positioned where air thins) and pressures the narrator's isolation—can see Elena's lights below but cannot reach her. The elevation enables storm-cell observation that drives the heading revision. The setting supplies both the resource (visibility) and the constraint (distance), meeting the micro-setting test and participating in closure imagery.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the radio static clears" anchors the middle section when Elena's voice returns. However, the three hours of silence are retrospective summary, and no live clock tightens decisions during the revision sequence. The storm's movement creates urgency in概念 but not as a countdown that alters tactics. Time is tracked but does not constrain the narrator's moves with felt pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Preserving trust is declared as motive—"Elena trusted me," "this was how I preserved trust"—and the narrator fulfills the duty by providing the corrected heading. However, trust is never conflicted; no choice forces the narrator to risk Elena's faith by withholding information or acting against her expectation. The motivation is stated and demonstrated but not tested under pressure where preserving it would cost something else.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Soundless echo" appears only in the final paragraph as a descriptive phrase for the ending mood. The tone throughout is elegiac and controlled, consistent but static—no modulation that reflects escalating pressure during the storm-cell observation or heading revision. The phrase does not recharge prior material or participate in closure logic; it decorates rather than deepens the final image.</comment>
