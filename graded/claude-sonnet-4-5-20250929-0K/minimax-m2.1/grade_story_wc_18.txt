<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is distinct and embodied through her sensory relationship to materials ("breath and the glass becoming a single system"), with her mirror-making philosophy showing consistent character logic. The work suffers from a lack of internal contradiction or competing impulses; her certainty about boundaries and thresholds remains untroubled throughout, reducing tension. The woman who brings the sextant exists only as a delivery mechanism, applying no meaningful interpersonal pressure. Mira's final realization involves no visible cost or foreclosed path—she simply waits and sees the mountains, making the character arc feel more like skilled execution than transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with its emphasis on fog, boundaries, and the gradual assembly of the mirror, holding that lens through closure. Orientation anchors arrive late: who/where/when coalesce only after ~180 words, though the atmospheric cohesion partially mitigates confusion. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the mirror capturing the glass mountains), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no clear before/after in Mira's options or stance is legible on the page. The narrative relies heavily on thematic assertion ("erasing boundaries") rather than dramatized pressure that forces a choice or renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district is vividly realized through selective, purpose-driven detail: "gnarled branches holding the mist in permanent embrace," "twilight frost...lattice of tiny crystals." The fog functions as both atmosphere and conceptual anchor, consistently filtering perception and shaping the work's texture. The broken sextant and the conservatory wall serve as micro-settings that constrain Mira's process and charge the final image. Spatial choreography (shed, workbench, conservatory wall, window) remains coherent throughout, and sensory selection reflects the protagonist's professional priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recreating the astronomer's lost dream through mirror-making—is signaled early and remains legible. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is minimal: Mira encounters no meaningful resistance, technical failure, or deepening difficulty. The synchronized breathing method succeeds on first attempt, and the mirror simply works. No credible loss or trade-off shapes tactics; the astronomer's death and the woman's request apply no pressure that Mira must navigate. The final image suggests success without visible cost, reading more as confirmation than earned transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The boundary-erasing theme emerges organically through concrete images: fog as "halfway between solid and absent," reflection "ceased to be separate from the thing reflected," glass mountains existing "only in the moment of erasing." The piece resists overt moralizing, allowing particulars to accumulate meaning. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic statement ("a place that existed only in the moment of erasing"), and the astronomer's dream-loss functions more as symbolic setup than lived complexity. The ending offers resonance through the glass-mountain image, though the conceptual answer arrives without the friction of a difficult choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and distinct, with a consistent elevated register suited to the material: "membranes, thin places where the dreamed and the real could press against each other like breath against glass." POV distance remains stable throughout, and the perceptual signature (selective focus on materiality, thresholds, breath) reflects Mira's professional worldview. The single brief exchange with the woman carries purpose, though her voice lacks distinctness from the narration. Under peak stress (the night of mirror-making), diction compresses appropriately while maintaining texture, and no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping occur.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high, with most sentences advancing atmosphere or concept. However, several template-cadence runs appear: three consecutive sentences in paragraph three begin with variations of "She had/took/began," and the final paragraph uses parallel "the [noun] [verb-ing]" constructions four times. Mixed metaphor in "breath against glass...pressed against each other" conflates breath-on-surface with two solids pressing. Stock phrasing includes "rising sharp and clear against a sky" and "perpetual half-light." These artifacts cluster but do not obscure the closure image, warranting moderate penalty in Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of mirror-making, fog, and dream-capture through broken instruments offers a specific premise, and the "boundaries erasing" frame is developed with consistent particulars. However, the core emotional arc—artisan fulfills commission through expertise—follows a familiar template without transformation. The astronomer's "runaway dream" and the woman's request function as convenient prompts rather than lived complications. The glass mountains arrive as confirmation rather than surprise, and Mira's mastery encounters no genuine obstacle. Risk-aversion is evident in the safe resolution where skill simply succeeds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira examines the sextant, decides to incorporate it, works through the night, mounts the mirror, and waits—functional involvement across beats but her choices do not create key turns or face resistance. She moves through a predetermined skillset without friction, and the final waiting posture is passive observation rather than decision. Present in setup, development, and closure, but causal pressure and cost linkage are minimal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The broken sextant appears in three beats: the woman's delivery with backstory, Mira's examination at the workbench, and its integration into the completed mirror where "the fragmented lens...shot through" the surface charges the final image. It enables Mira's method and its brass framework "like arms...reaching" adds specificity. However, it could be replaced with any broken optical instrument without altering story logic, and its unique properties (celestial measurement) do not constrain choices.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Boundary-erasing shapes the thematic stakes and Mira's philosophy ("mirrors were not merely surfaces but membranes"), appearing in the fog description, breath-synchronization method, and the final image of dawn-and-dusk simultaneity. It structures tactics (matching breath to glass expansion) and the closure's conceptual charge. However, it functions primarily as interpretive lens rather than forcing on-page choices with visible cost; Mira never confronts a moment where boundaries refuse to dissolve or exact a price.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Firmly grounded" is asserted in paragraph one ("moved with the certainty of someone firmly grounded in her purpose") and implicit in her mastery, but it never constrains or enables a specific action with visible tradeoff. The attribute remains label-level; no scene tests whether her groundedness limits vision or costs her flexibility. Present in setup, absent from development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Recreation drives the central action: Mira's examination, night-long work, and mirror completion all serve the goal of recreating the astronomer's lost dream. The method (synchronized breathing, sextant incorporation) is specific to this action, and the closure image directly depicts the recreated glass mountains. The turn from measuring-instrument to dream-capture depends on this action. However, the recreation succeeds without complication, and a similar restorative action (repair, translate, reconstruct) could serve the same structural role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Synchronized breathing is introduced at the timeframe paragraph ("matching the rhythm of her inhalations to the subtle expansion and contraction of the glass"), explicitly shapes the night's work ("her breath and the glass becoming a single system"), and implicitly underlies the boundary-erasing at closure. It appears in setup (as twenty-year practice), development (active use), and closure (conceptual payoff). However, the mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized with resistance, and another artisan method could replace it without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district provides persistent atmosphere (fog, perpetual half-light, gnarled trees), supplies the conservatory wall where the mirror is mounted, and its "boundary between cultivated order and wild return" mirrors the thematic work. The fog enables Mira's boundary practice and shapes perception throughout. Present in all three gates and the setting constrains where she works and charges the final image. Strong specificity (centuries of fog, collapsed conservatory, uneven stones) makes replacement difficult, though the work could occur in another liminal ruin.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Upon the shimmer of twilight frost" signals when Mira begins work, and "by morning" marks completion, bracketing the mirror-making sequence. However, the timeframe applies no pressure—no deadline tightens choices, and the night's duration is summarized rather than tracked. Time serves atmospheric function (frost turning mist to crystals) but does not alter tactics or narrow options. Present in development only; absent from setup and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The motivation to capture the astronomer's runaway dream is articulated by the woman, accepted by Mira, and fulfilled at closure when glass mountains appear. It frames the entire action and closure directly answers it. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through Mira's choices, and she experiences no friction between this want and competing costs. The astronomer's loss provides thematic resonance but remains secondhand; Mira's own investment is professional obligation without visible personal stake.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Glass mountains" as tone directive manifests in the sharp, crystalline imagery (frost lattice, fragmented lens, mountains "rising sharp and clear"), the sense of something ephemeral made momentarily solid, and the cool, precise diction throughout. The tone remains coherent across beats and modulates subtly from description to active work to the final vision. The closing image of glass mountains against a dawn-dusk sky directly embodies the tone and charges the ending. However, "glass mountains" could describe several tonal registers; the piece privileges atmosphere over emotional pressure.</comment>
