<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal life is embodied through the anchor-link ritual and her meditative approach to the work, showing "balancedly curious" through action rather than label. Her motivation to navigate by starlight is clear and consistent, but the ending choice—continuing her journey home after learning the visitors are departing—lacks a visible cost or tradeoff that would elevate the stakes. The grandmother's wisdom about chains is thematically rich, yet Mira's decision at closure feels like continuation rather than alteration or renunciation with foreclosed paths. Minor register drift into elevated philosophical diction ("invisible threads," "patient journey") sits slightly above a working instructor's plausible mid-crisis lexicon.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately within the opening paragraphs (underwater instructor descending to a research lab). The dominant stake—learning to navigate by starlight underwater—is signaled early and pursued through the calculation scene. However, the closure unit is weak: Mira's realization that "the cosmos was a sea of its own, navigable by anyone willing to learn its currents" reads as thematic summary rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. The news of the visitors' departure arrives off-stage via screen message, and Mira's response is to "hold steady" and continue—an assertion of persistence without a dramatized tradeoff or foreclosed option that would constitute Earned Stasis or Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The benthic city setting is vivid and purposeful: bioluminescent haze, crystalline research tower, amber laboratory light, miles of filtering ocean. Spatial choreography is clear (descent → lab entrance → calculation chamber → journey home), and the environment pressures Mira's project by transforming starlight into scattered, edge-softened photons. The anchor-link object recurs with tactile grounding (cold metal against ribs, secured to belt, taken in hand), charging the final image. The setting's constraint on navigation—dense water folding stars into distant memory—directly shapes the central conflict and method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (learning edge-geometry navigation by starlight) is clear and tightens through Mira's hours of calculation. However, escalation is minimal: the work proceeds in "slow and meditative" rhythm without reversal or complication until the off-stage news arrives. The visitors' departure adds conceptual weight but does not force Mira into a visible tradeoff or narrow her tactical options on the page. The resolution—continuing her journey home with renewed understanding—is more thematic deepening than a choice that forecloses a live path with felt cost. Agency at closure is present but the price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the anchor-link motif (holding steady vs. pulling forward), the edge-geometry method (light transformed, not lost), and the visitors' pedagogy (showing rather than solving). The final image—Mira holding the link and pledging to follow patient, ancient stars—resonates without overt moralizing, reweighting her grandmother's surface wisdom as applicable to cosmic navigation. The story resists tidy binaries and invites reflection on continuity across unfathomable change. However, the phrase "unfolded horizons" recurs as a thematic label rather than a dramatized pressure point, and the ending leans slightly toward assertion ("she would learn to follow them") instead of a charged particular that speaks for itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira throughout, with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Voice carries a meditative, specific texture ("balancedly curious," "somber marvel") that modulates appropriately across the descent, dialogue with Dr. Chen, and calculation scene. The single exchange with Dr. Chen is natural and purposeful, revealing character through what is said and unsaid about the anchor link. Minor elevation into philosophical register ("invisible threads," "the infinite") reads slightly above a working instructor's mid-scene lexicon under stress, but the perceptual signature—Mira filtering setting and event through navigation metaphors—is consistent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high: most lines advance character, setting, or stake without padding. However, several phrases loop or restate without added pressure: "the universe had suddenly grown so much larger" echoes the opening's "horizons that no human calculation had ever predicted," and "invisible threads" / "invisible pathways" / "patient journey" form a cluster of near-synonyms. The phrase "the technique involved understanding" slips into expository scaffolding. The final paragraph's "hold steady against the infinite, to expand into the unfolded horizons" stacks abstractions where a concrete image would sharpen closure. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template phrasing in non-closure beats; no artifact touches the final image directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—underwater city learning alien star-navigation after first contact—is inventive and the edge-geometry concept adds specificity. The anchor-link inheritance provides a fresh particular that grounds the cosmic scale in family continuity. However, the emotional arc (solitary specialist receives knowledge, continues work after aliens depart) follows a familiar template of contemplative perseverance without a non-obvious inflection. The visitors' pedagogy (showing rather than solving, departing after sharing knowledge) is conceptually elegant but not surprising in hindsight. Transformation is present but incremental; swapping "edge geometry" for another alien method or "benthic city" for another isolated setting would leave the character journey largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira's role as navigation instructor frames her motivation and expertise, appearing in the opening ("teach navigation") and implied in her methodical calculation work. However, her professional identity does not constrain a key choice or create a tradeoff; she acts more as a solitary researcher than an instructor under pressure. The role is functional but largely replaceable—she could be a general scientist with similar access. Present in setup and middle development, but closure participation is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The anchor chain link appears in three distinct beats: descent (cold against ribs), laboratory (secured to belt, Dr. Chen observes it), and departure (taken in hand one last time). It carries thematic weight (grandmother's surface wisdom, holding vs. pulling) and charges the final image, but does not constrain a tactical choice or enable a specific action. The reprise reweights meaning without altering options. Satisfies early signal, beat involvement, and closure linkage; lacks causal pressure or irreplaceability (another heirloom could serve).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Unfolded horizons" appears as a thematic phrase in the opening ("unfold-ed horizons that no human calculation had ever predicted") and returns in the final paragraph ("expand into the unfolded horizons"). It echoes the story's central conceit—alien knowledge expanding humanity's cosmos—but remains abstract and does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. The concept is told rather than dramatized through specific choices. Present in setup and closure, but ornamental; easily swappable with "new frontiers" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Balancedly curious" is introduced early as a label Mira appreciates, describing her approach to old ocean wisdom and new astronomy. It informs her methodical, meditative work style but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait is illustrated through her patient calculations and respect for both grandmother's knowledge and alien insight, yet no moment requires this exact balance as a tradeoff. Functional but replaceable; "thoughtful" or "integrative" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Mira expands her calculations using edge geometry, and the work is described as meditative and purposeful. The action shapes the middle beat (hours of quiet concentration) and frames her realization at the end. However, "expand" is not irreplaceable—"refine," "trace," or "complete" could serve similar narrative function. The action enables progress but does not create a reversal or narrow options. Present in setup (intention), middle (execution), and thematically at closure ("expand into the unfolded horizons"), but causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Edge geometry is introduced in the second paragraph as a method demonstrated by the visitors, described in the third paragraph (understanding light's bent edges at media boundaries), and referenced during Mira's calculation work. Its mechanics—tracing photon edges through ocean layers—are signaled and shape her attempt, but the method does not face a complication or enable a breakthrough that alters tactics. It functions as the means to the stake but is not tested or reweighted at closure. Present in setup, development, and closure framing; lacks causal pressure or specificity that would make it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The benthic city is established early (outer ring, research tower, crystalline windows, amber light) and provides spatial anchors throughout (descent, laboratory entrance, calculation chamber, silent streets). The setting pressures the central conflict by filtering starlight through miles of water, making navigation the story's puzzle. The environment shapes Mira's method and final understanding. Present in setup, middle choreography, and closure (journey home through silent streets). The city's constraint on starlight is essential, but "underwater metropolis" could substitute with similar effect; specificity is strong but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after discovering aliens" is anchored in the opening ("eighteen months ago") and frames the entire story—Mira's new astronomy, the edge-geometry method, and the visitors' imminent departure. However, time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics within the scene itself. The departure "in the morning" arrives via message without urgency forcing Mira's hand. The timeframe provides context but does not function as a live clock. Present in setup and closure context; lacks middle pressure or escalation tied to elapsed time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to learn starlight navigation is declared early ("she burned with a different question") and drives her descent to the lab, hours of calculation, and final resolve to help humanity follow the stars. The desire is dramatized through her purposeful actions and meditative work. However, no on-page friction tests this want against a competing cost or fear—she proceeds methodically without obstacle or tradeoff. The visitors' departure adds thematic weight but does not force Mira to choose between conflicting goods. Present in setup, middle, and closure; causal role is strong but lacks visible cost or internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Somber marvel is coherent throughout: the opening's "distant memory" stars, Dr. Chen's "somber marvel" observation, the meditative calculation rhythm, and the final image of patient, ancient stars. Tone modulates appropriately—calm purposefulness in the lab, quiet recognition at the news, resolve in the departure. The tone charges the final image without static repetition or tonal break. Diction and cadence sustain the mood across turns. Present in setup, middle modulation, and closure charge; the tone is indispensable to the story's emotional signature and thematic resonance.</comment>
