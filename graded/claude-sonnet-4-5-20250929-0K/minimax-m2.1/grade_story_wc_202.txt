<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and particular—"reader of the in-between" feels earned through seventeen years of carrying the fragment. The motivation to honor overlooked histories drives present choices, though the final acceptance feels slightly rushed. Internal contradiction is present (thought she was honoring vs. being prepared to become), but the grandmother's deathbed scene and the alchemist encounter could show more embodied tension. The shift from keeper-of-memory to continuation-of-work lands with conceptual weight but minimal visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Conceptual Repricing at closure. The piece accumulates understanding through the market encounter, painting revelation, and alchemist's explanation, culminating in the protagonist's realization that they are becoming a bridge. Orientation is clear by the market description (~15% mark). The closure—"I was being prepared to become one"—reweights the premise with conceptual cost (forfeiting mere preservation for active transmission), though the felt price could be sharper. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lens fragment's true nature as relay is revealed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's market "strung high above the city rooftops" in "liminal hours" creates vivid spatial and temporal grounding. The painting hung sideways, the lens fragment's light refraction, and the stall's position between map-seller and musician provide concrete sensory anchors. The micro-setting of the fragment itself—pocket, palm, chest—tracks cleanly and constrains the final choice to let it hang free. The market's elevation above an "unaware" city charges the closure image with vertical and social distance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding the fragment's purpose and the protagonist's role. Pressure accumulates through the market discovery, alchemist's explanation, and painting revelation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator realizes they're not honoring histories but becoming one. Agency is present in the final choice to unfasten the clasp and let the fragment hang free, though this feels more acceptance than struggle. The tightening is clean but the visible cost—what path is foreclosed—remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of continuity and transmission emerges through concrete particulars: the lighthouse, the grandmother's torch-passing, the relay metaphor. The painting's hidden details and the beam as "corridor of visible intuition" avoid abstract philosophizing. The final image—fragment hanging free, refracting light at "nothing and everything at once"—offers resonant ambiguity without moralizing. The grandmother's face in the painting and the phrase "anchored, at last, in the only history that mattered: the one we choose to carry forward" edges toward thematic echo but stays rooted in the protagonist's earned understanding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV with stable focalization throughout. The voice carries distinct texture: "elusively tangible," "unobvious trades," "vague years between childhood and now." Perceptual signature is consistent—the narrator notices translation, weight, intuition. The alchemist's dialogue feels purposeful though brief. Register occasionally drifts slightly elevated ("practitioners of unobvious trades") but remains voice-motivated. Psychic distance is controlled; the narrator's knowledge limitations are respected until the reveal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high in the market and alchemist scenes. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "I had thought I was honoring...Now I understood: I was being prepared" restates the same realization. "Between-worlds translator" is explained twice (practitioner paragraph, then alchemist's label). Template cadence in the middle: "She had given...She led...She examined" runs filter-verb stacks. These artifacts don't obscure closure but dull momentum in key beats, warranting −0.6 to −0.8 in this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse-as-intuition and translator-of-silences concepts offer fresh angles on guidance/legacy themes. The market "strung high above the city" and visual artifacts ("視料") show specific world-building. However, the core arc—discovering inherited purpose through mystical mentor—follows recognizable template structure. The "lens fragment as relay" turn feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and metaphysical market elevates slightly, but the emotional journey stays within familiar discover-your-calling territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Present from opening, shapes the protagonist's ability to find and interpret the market and painting. The translation talent enables the climactic understanding but doesn't constrain earlier choices with visible friction. Appears in setup, middle (market navigation), and closure (becoming the bridge), satisfying all three gates. Causal role is solid but the specific between-worlds mechanics could create more tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Introduced in opening paragraph, handled across multiple beats (pocket, grandmother's deathbed, alchemist examination, hanging free at chest), and central to closure image where it refracts light. Early signal is strong. The fragment's "elusively tangible" nature and its revelation as relay drive the central turn. Final image depends on it. Slight deduction because its specific properties (lens focusing the invisible) could constrain middle choices more actively before the reveal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse beam as "corridor of visible intuition" and the fragment focusing "what is otherwise invisible" embody the concept on the page. Shapes the protagonist's realization and final stance. Present in setup (grandmother's role), developed through painting revelation, and active at closure (refraction outward). However, the concept functions more as thematic frame than tactical constraint—it doesn't narrow options or impose costs during the market encounter itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Elusively tangible" is established early and returned to at closure ("its elusively tangible nature finally making sense"). However, it functions more as descriptive motif than active constraint. The attribute doesn't enable or prevent specific actions with visible cost—the protagonist carries it successfully for seventeen years without friction. Label-only in middle beats; the tangibility paradox could create more on-page tactical trouble.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Appears at closure when protagonist "unfastened the clasp" to let fragment hang free. The painting also must be unfastened and rotated to reveal its true face—both instances drive revelation and final stance. The action redefines the protagonist's relationship to the fragment from possession to transmission. Could be signaled earlier to create anticipation, but the double usage (painting and clasp) makes it weight-bearing rather than ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Signaled at market arrival (alchemist "dealt in visual史料—historical artifacts disguised as art"). The method is used once (painting revelation) to deliver the key information about Keeper and grandmother. Mechanics matter—the sideways hanging conceals truth from "casual browsers." Present in setup (stall description), active in middle revelation, and the hidden details shape closure understanding. Single-use limits score despite clear causal role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Introduced early (~15% mark) with vivid spatial detail: "strung high above the city rooftops," "liminal hours," between map-seller and musician. The market's elevation and timing enable the encounter. The market's "suspended" nature mirrors the protagonist's in-between role and charges the final contrast with the "unaware" city below. Constrains access (must arrive at right time) and provides the alchemist resource. All three gates satisfied with thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mentioned as "vague years between childhood and now" and "bridge-years," establishing long duration of carrying the fragment. However, the timeframe remains abstract—no ticking clock or temporal pressure shapes choices in the market scene. The seventeen years function as backstory weight rather than present constraint. Missing development gate (no middle choice altered by time) and weak closure participation (span is acknowledged but doesn't tighten the ending beat).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stated explicitly: "I had thought I was honoring overlooked histories by preserving the fragment." Drives the protagonist to the market and underlies the climactic realization. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized through friction—no scene shows the protagonist actively struggling to honor histories in conflicting ways. Present in setup and closure but lacks middle development where this desire creates visible cost or tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Eternal instant" appears once explicitly when "everything aligned." The tone of suspension and threshold is consistent throughout: "liminal hours," market existing "between," protagonist as bridge. The prose maintains contemplative register under revelation without rushing. However, the tone is relatively static—no modulation between pressure and release. The final image ("fragment caught the dying light") sustains the suspended quality but doesn't shift cadence to mark the crossing-over moment.</comment>
