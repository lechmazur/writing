<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cora's interiority is present—"curiosity was simply another form of hunger"—and her decision to leave the artifact shows agency with visible cost. However, the characterization leans heavily on contemplative observation rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice feels somewhat predetermined by the chorus of echoes rather than earned through internal conflict. Embodied emotion is thin; most processing occurs as reflective summary rather than visceral response under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure: Cora's Earned Stasis (leaving the arrow tip, carrying only knowledge) forecloses exploitation with felt cost. Orientation anchors early (orchard pilot, vessel, planet). The gravity inversion provides a meaningful tightening that reweights the dominant stake. One weakness: the echoes' "warning" conveniently delivers the moral calculus rather than forcing Cora to earn the insight through dramatized friction, slightly softening the cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating rock arches, water spirals, and porous stone create vivid, selective detail filtered through Cora's professional attention. The arrow tip embedded in ironwood constrains her physical choice (reaching through viewport) and charges the closure. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the inversion sequence. The "whirling silence" and sensory hierarchy—ache in inner ears, pressure in teeth—ground the surreal in body and urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering resilience's source—is signaled early and tightens through the inversion hour. Cora's agency at closure (leaving the artifact) forecloses exploitation with visible cost: she carries knowledge but renounces profit. However, escalation is somewhat muted; the echoes hand her the moral framework rather than forcing a hard trade-off. The gravitational window provides time pressure, but no live tactical dilemma tests her commitment before the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the broken arrow as distributed resilience, transformation through upheaval, and the ethics of secret-keeping. The final image—"orchard planet kept its secrets"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "responsibility settle around her shoulders like a second skin" edges toward direct thematic statement. The echoes' "reverence for resilience" leans slightly abstract, though grounded in the artifact's effect on growth cycles.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is present in technical filters ("resonance signature," "moorings") and selective attention to water flow and arches. Voice modulates appropriately from analytic observation to wonder. One weakness: some diction edges into elevated register during peak moments—"gathering of echoes began then, voices rising from the artifact like steam from heated stone"—that slightly distances from immediate perception. No dialogue present; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several artifact patterns lower the score. Paraphrase loops appear: "watched the viewport...and the world outside shifted" closely echoes "watched the tree's branches extend...watched flowers burst." Template cadence runs through multiple "she had" and "the [noun] began" constructions. "Whirling silence that filled the spaces between phenomena" is figuratively muddy (silence doesn't fill; phenomena is abstract). The closure beat remains clear, capping deductions at mid-range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The gravity-inversion orchard and distributed-artifact resilience offer fresh angles on discovery narratives. Cora's choice to preserve secrecy rather than exploit transforms the treasure-hunter trope. However, the core frame—lone pilot discovers ancient wisdom and honors prior guardians—follows a familiar template. The "echoes of previous explorers" delivers convenient moral alignment without forcing Cora to earn the insight through conflicted choice. Emotional specificity in the ending ("smiled at the ordinary miracle") feels somewhat generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cora is present throughout and her professional expertise (recognizing resonance signatures, trusting water currents) frames the journey. Her final decision to leave the artifact is a clear turn. However, much of her role is observational; the echoes provide the key insight rather than her active problem-solving. "Intrepid" is more label than dramatized trait—she follows predicted phenomena without significant personal risk or obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The arrow tip appears in three beats: discovery in the tree (middle), contact triggering accelerated growth (middle-late), and the decision to return it (closure). It drives the central revelation (not weapon but key/fountain) and Cora's final choice. The luminescence pulsing with the planet's heartbeat and its growth-acceleration effect are specific, irreplaceable properties. Strong closure linkage and causal pressure elevate the score; one additional earlier seed would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "gathering of echoes" appears only once, mid-story, delivering convenient exposition about prior explorers. It shapes Cora's understanding but does not constrain her tactics or create friction; she receives rather than discovers the truth. The concept is more thematic ornament than active stake—removing it would require rewriting the insight delivery but would not break the discovery-and-renunciation structure. Late appearance and summary-only use limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plant-growth acceleration is demonstrated on-page when Cora touches the arrow: "branches extend and bloom in compressed time...flowers burst open and fruit swell and seeds scatter in the span of a single breath." This specific, visible effect reveals the arrow's function and reweights its meaning from weapon to renewal tool. It enables the thematic turn but does not constrain a tactical choice with cost. Present in setup (hinted via thriving orchards) and payoff (the growth burst), but not developed in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Discovery structures the entire arc: Cora's goal drives her landing, the inversion enables her find, and the arrow's revelation triggers her final choice. The action is present in setup (sensors mapping, seeking secrets), development (following water to the artifact), and closure (understanding and renunccing exploitation). However, "discover" is broad enough that alternative verbs (retrieve, protect, study) could substitute with minor edits. The mechanics of discovery—navigating by water, touching the artifact—do the heavier causal work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Navigating by water flow" is signaled early ("guided the small craft by the ascending water flows") and used in one key middle beat: Cora trusts the braided currents to carry her upward through the hanging gardens to the ironwood tree. The method enables the discovery but is not tested or refined under pressure—it works as predicted without friction. Present in setup (predicted gravity inversion) and development (active navigation), but absent from closure. Functional but somewhat replaceable; she could follow the arches or light with similar effect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches is present throughout: sensors map it (setup), the inversion choreographs the discovery sequence (development), and the return to normal gravity frames closure. The arches "grinding against each other with sounds like distant bells" and the porous stone anchor spatial choices. The setting's unique gravitational cycle enables the hour-window pressure and the tree's accessibility. Strong across all three gates; slightly shy of indispensable because the core discovery could occur in a different extreme environment with moderate rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The one-hour inversion window is established early and brackets the discovery sequence. "The hour of inversion was nearly complete" tightens Cora's final decision, adding urgency to her choice to return the artifact before gravity reasserts. Time is tracked and used to modulate pacing ("the moment she touched it," "the gathering of echoes began then"). However, the clock does not create hard tactical trade-offs—Cora completes her investigation comfortably within the window. Present in all three gates but without sharp cost pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Finding "the source of resilience" is Cora's stated motivation and drives her across three star systems to land. The goal shapes her choices: following water currents, reaching for the arrow, interpreting the echoes. At closure she achieves partial satisfaction—she learns the source but renounces material gain. However, the motivation is declared more than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices; no visible friction between her curiosity and cost until the very end. Present in setup and closure, lighter in middle development.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Whirling silence" appears twice: mid-story as "a whirling silence that filled the spaces between phenomena with a pressure she could feel in her teeth," and at closure when it "faded as normal gravity asserted itself, replaced by the ordinary sounds." The tone modulates appropriately—surreal and pressurized during inversion, settling to mundane at the end—and charges the final contrast between extraordinary and ordinary. Coherent through turns. The phrasing is slightly abstract ("spaces between phenomena") but the embodied pressure (teeth, inner ears) grounds it.</comment>
