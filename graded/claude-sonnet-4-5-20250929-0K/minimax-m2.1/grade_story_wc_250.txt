<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The guardian's nineteen-year silence and dental-mirror work are concrete and purpose-driven, though her interiority relies heavily on summary ("she had learned," "she understood") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The boy's suicidal ideation is conveyed through physical markers (slope of shoulders, edge of secret) with restraint, but his interior remains opaque—we observe him through her lens without friction. The final shared gaze offers a moment of witnessed connection, yet no on-page micro-choice by either party forecloses a path with visible cost; the transformation is asserted through atmosphere rather than dramatized decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around a single continuous scene at the dock with clear spatial anchors (cobalt dock, canal, warehouse shutters) and accumulates pressure through the guardian's patterned light-work and the boy's gradual noticing. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the boy looks at her, "really look," and they sit in "stillwater tension…filled with stars that had learned to wait"—reconfiguring options without a decisive act. The cost is conceptual (the boy's half-spoken secret meeting its limit) but legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy's attention shifts from internal despair to external pattern, reweighting his stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, canal water collecting fading light, and warehouse shutters with partially closed slats provide vivid, purpose-driven anchors. The dental mirror functions as micro-setting, constraining the guardian's method and charging the final reflection of emerging stars. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric (rain-slicked surface, streetlight flicker, spiraling illumination on brick) without catalog excess. The shutters enable the light-weaving action and directly shape the boy's perceptual shift, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether the boy will remain "drowning in his own shadows" or find a reason to stay. The guardian's patient presence and light patterns create one meaningful tightening when the boy notices and lifts his head, narrowing his despair into attention. No second reversal occurs; the escalation is subtle—a shift from isolation to witnessed solitude. The cost is felt in "stillwater tension" and the boy's unspoken acknowledgment, but agency remains ambiguous; the boy does not make an on-page choice that forecloses suicide, only observes. The guardian's action drives the turn, yet the boy's passivity limits the felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—that light and patient witness can interrupt despair—emerges organically from the guardian's mirror work and the boy's perceptual shift without overt moralizing. The spiraling star patterns and the phrase "to teach darkness the value of stars" risk thematic echo, but the particulars (dental mirror, shutter slats, half-spoken secret) ground the concept. The final image of stars "that had learned to wait" reweights prior material with quiet resonance, offering a non-literal answer to the central question. The piece resists tidy resolution; the boy's survival is implied but not guaranteed, embracing meaningful ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single third-person POV filtered through the guardian is stable and controlled; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—she hears "what others missed" and reads weight in body language—though register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("spiralingly calm," "mathematics of pain") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Purposeful compression ("the frequency of unspoken longing") and lyric rhythm support the accumulative lens. The boy's interiority is withheld by design, maintaining distance, but his silence and gaze carry subtext. No dialogue appears; evaluation skips those bullets.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates purposefully, with longer reflective passages yielding to tight action beats ("The boy noticed. His head lifted"). Some scaffold persists: "She had learned" and "She understood" appear multiple times, creating template cadence in the opening third. Figurative language ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "stars that moved in spirals") is pattern-taught and pays off at closure, though density in early paragraphs occasionally slows momentum. No loops touch the closure beat; the final image is clean and propulsive. Information density is high in action beats, lower in exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The silent guardian who uses reflected light to interrupt suicidal despair is a specific synthesis, elevated by the dental mirror's occupational detail and the shutter-weaving method. The "half-spoken secret" timeframe and spiraling star motifs add texture. However, the core arc—mentor figure who survived similar despair now helps another—follows a familiar template, and the revelation that "she was the girl from that night years ago" is foreshadowed heavily, reducing surprise. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise and avoids hedging, but the turn feels predetermined rather than earned through character friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The guardian is present throughout and her mirror work drives the boy's perceptual shift, a key middle turn. Her choice to "settle nearby without invading his grief" and to weave light patterns shapes the ending's charge. However, her role is largely observational and patient; she does not face a dilemma or pay a visible cost on the page. Setup clear, development functional, payoff present but passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dental mirror appears in three beats: introduction with backstory anchor, methodical use to catch streetlight and create patterns, and final reflection of emerging stars. Its angled glass designed to "reveal what remained hidden" is specific and irreplaceable; a generic mirror would lack occupational resonance. The mirror enables the light-weaving action and charges the closure image. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, though it could deepen further if the mirror's medical origin created friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Silent empathy shapes the guardian's tactics (settling nearby, giving "witnessed solitude") and the story's accumulative pressure. The concept is dramatized through her patient presence and light patterns rather than stated overtly. It constrains her method—she cannot speak—and enables the boy's shift from isolation to connection. Present in setup, development, and payoff, though the cost of silence (her voice "taken" by fever) is backstory rather than on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Spiralingly calm" is introduced early and described through metaphor ("water finding its level, each moment a patient circle returning to center"). It enables her to wait without rushing, shaping her tactic of stillness. However, the trait is more label than dramatized constraint; we do not see her struggle against impatience or pay a cost for her calm. Setup and thematic echo present; middle development and closure linkage weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Weave" appears in three beats: "weave the light through the partially closed slats," "weave light through shutters," and implicitly in the final star reflection. The action drives the boy's noticing and the ending's visual charge. Specific and irreplaceable—no other verb captures the deliberate, patterned light-work. However, the mechanics are repeated rather than evolved; the second mention nearly paraphrases the first. Strong closure linkage, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Creating patterns with shutters is signaled early (warehouse shutters across the canal), developed in the middle beat (weaving light through partially closed slats to create spirals), and charges the final image (stars traced across brick). The method is specific and shapes the boy's perceptual turn. Mechanics matter: the angled slats enable pattern-making that a blank wall would not. Setup, development, and payoff all present with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt dock after rain anchors the scene spatially and tonally (water collecting last light, rain-slicked surface). The canal and warehouse shutters enable the light-weaving action; the dock's edge is where the boy sits and the guardian joins him. The setting supplies resources (shutters, streetlight) that shape outcome. However, the "after rain" detail is atmospheric rather than constraining; the story would function similarly on a dry night. Setup and development strong, closure linkage moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Within the edge of a half-spoken secret" is evoked thematically (the boy carries secrets, his hopelessness meets its limit) but does not function as a ticking clock. Time is vague—"Tonight she waited," "The night stretched above them"—and does not tighten decisions. The "edge" is spatial metaphor rather than temporal pressure. The timeframe is ornamental; removing it would not alter the story's logic or pacing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach darkness the value of stars" is stated explicitly and dramatized through the guardian's light patterns and patient witness. It drives her choice to remain at the dock and her method of pattern-weaving. However, the motivation is not conflicted—she faces no friction or cost in pursuing it—and is told more than shown. Setup present, development functional, payoff clear but frictionless.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Stillwater tension" is established early through the guardian's calm and the boy's quiet despair, modulates during the light-weaving beats (transfixed attention, spiral motion), and charges the final image ("Together they sat in stillwater tension…suspended like breath before speech"). The tone coheres through turns and heightens at closure without breaking into overt resolution. Strong coherence and closure linkage; the final line reweights the tone with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
