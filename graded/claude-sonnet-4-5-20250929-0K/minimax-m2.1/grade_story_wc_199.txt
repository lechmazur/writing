<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Seraphina's interiority relies heavily on abstract spiritual language ("tingle at the base of her skull," "mossy delight") rather than embodied contradiction. The forty-season backstory and grandmother's moonstone establish motive, but the protagonist never faces a choice with visible cost—she simply descends, retrieves the seed, and "emerges transformed" by declaration. The phrase "she always emerged transformed always" is a tell, not a dramatized struggle. No conflicting impulses act in scene; the discovery unfolds without friction or foreclosed paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece signals Causal lens early (leaf carries prophecy → Seraphina decodes → finds seed), but the closure lacks visible cost: she retrieves the forgotten seed and "knows" she'll be different by morning without on-page consequence or forfeited option. The Hush frame and "transformation" are asserted rather than enacted. Orientation is delayed—arbor location and Seraphina's role take ~180 words to anchor, earning a −0.4 penalty here and capping Q3 at 7.0 per the Orientation Test. The seed vault discovery reads as convenient fulfillment rather than a turn that narrows her stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor, whispering birch, and seed vault supply atmospheric texture, but no environmental feature constrains a choice—Seraphina moves freely from table to vault without spatial friction. The moonstone speck and antler tool are described vividly yet remain inert props; neither alters tactics at a decisive beat. Sensory detail ("woodsmoke and ember," "spiral staircase") is selective and voice-filtered, lifting the category above placeholder description, but the micro-setting does not charge the final image or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the prophecy to save her people—is signaled early, but pressure remains flat: Seraphina encounters no resistance, competing goal, or moment where decoding fails or costs her something tangible. The drought prophecy and seed discovery arrive as fulfillment rather than escalation. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the Hush simply "reaches its peak" while she "feels herself shifting" by authorial fiat. Agency is absent; the plot unfolds as revelation rather than decision under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of forgotten things and cyclical survival emerges from the seed vault and tiny monuments, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image—"tiny monuments… seemed to hum with quiet affirmation"—offers a lyric reconfiguration, though it lacks the weight of earlier particulars and reads as belated validation rather than earned insight. The piece gestures toward liminal time and ancestral connection but stops short of interrogating the cost of preservation or the protagonist's isolation. Subtext in the leaf's "fingers grasping for memory" is vivid, elevating above pure exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable, and diction ("ashen skyborne arbor," "mossy delight," "tectonic plates beneath her certainty") carries a consistent lyric-mystical register. Perceptual signature is character-specific—seeds, dust specks, veins as language—but emotional peaks rely on stock metaphors ("fingers of an old woman grasping for memory") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("understanding shifting like tectonic plates"). The phrase "emerges transformed always" is an awkward absolute that strains voice. No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("patience of stone," "boundary… thin as spider silk," "genetic memory of a thousand harvests"), creating texture but occasionally blurring propulsion—multiple metaphors cluster without pressure linkage. The phrase "she always emerged transformed always" is a template artifact; "mossy delight swelling in her chest" mixes registers awkwardly. Sentence openings vary and paragraph rhythm modulates, avoiding monotony. No paraphrase loops or severe clarity breaks, but the prose leans toward ornament over momentum in peak beats, earning a −0.5 deduction for pattern density without escalation payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The skyborne arbor and seed-sorter mystic premise offer atmospheric specificity, yet the plot arc—prophecy decoded, forgotten seed retrieved—follows a predictable fulfillment template without friction or subversion. The Hush and tiny monuments add world texture but do not twist expectation; transformation is declared rather than enacted through irrevocable choice. The piece commits fully to its mystical register and avoids hedging, but emotional and causal particulars remain abstract ("she had been preparing for this moment, though she had not known it") rather than grounded in lived contradiction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Seraphina appears throughout but makes no key choice under pressure—she observes, descends, retrieves. Decisions that would alter tactics or foreclose a path are absent; the arc is revelation, not contested agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The moonstone speck is lifted with tweezers in paragraph 2, illuminates veins in paragraph 4, and grows warm in paragraph 7—three distinct beats. Its use enables decoding (causal) and it reappears at closure with reweighted warmth. However, no visible cost ties to the speck itself; it functions as magical magnifying glass without constraint. Early signal and beat involvement lift it into mid-band; lack of cost and swappability (any mystical lens could serve) prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Regional folklore (the Hush, ancestral leaf messages, whispering birch prophecies) frames stakes and supplies the arbor's ritual context. The concept shapes Seraphina's role and the vault's existence, appearing in all three story thirds. It does not, however, constrain a tactical choice or create visible friction—no competing interpretation, no risk of misreading. Setup, development (leaf decoding), and payoff (Hush peak, transformation claim) are present, earning all three gates and eligibility above 6.0, but the concept remains atmospheric rather than pressure-generating.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Emerges transformed always" is stated twice as trait but never dramatized with on-page cost or constraint. The claim "she always emerged transformed always" is a label; the ending asserts future change ("by morning, she would be a different woman") without showing a choice or forfeiture that enacts it. Ornamental mention trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Prod" appears twice: paragraph 2 (learning to prod with antler tool) and paragraph 4 (prodding the leaf to reveal veins). The action enables the prophecy decoding—causal link to a key turn. However, it could be replaced with "examine," "touch," or "scan" with minor edits; the specificity of "prod" does not generate unique friction or cost. Setup and development gates met; closure participation weak (not mentioned in vault or final beats). Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Building tiny monuments is mentioned in paragraph 5 ("why she had been drawn to build tiny monuments") and paragraph 7 ("the tiny monuments… seemed to hum"). Setup is late (past midpoint); development is summary ("she had been preparing… creating small shrines") rather than on-page demonstration. The method does not shape a middle choice or constrain the seed retrieval. Payoff is a lyric callback (humming affirmation) that reweights thematically but lacks mechanical or causal work. Two-gate presence (development as backstory, payoff as resonance) allows eligibility near 5.0; late signal and summary-only use cap at 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor anchors who/where by paragraph 1, supplies the seed vault beneath (paragraph 6), and brackets the ending (ashen sky lightens, paragraph 7). Setup, development (vault access), and payoff (final sky image) all present, earning three-gate eligibility above 6.0. However, the arbor does not constrain a choice—Seraphina moves freely, no lock or climb impedes her, no rival sorter competes. The spiral staircase and vault location enable the retrieval but any storage structure would serve; swappability and lack of pressure friction lower the score within band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The Hush is introduced in paragraph 3, drives the atmospheric peak in paragraph 7 ("the Hush was reaching its peak"), and frames the transformation claim. Setup, development (mounting mystical intensity), and payoff (closure coincides with Hush peak) meet all three gates. However, the timeframe does not tighten tactics—no countdown, no risk that the window will close and strand her effort. The Hush amplifies mood but remains ornamental to decision-making; Seraphina's moves (descend, retrieve, ascend) unfold at her own pace without temporal constraint or cost. Three-gate presence and closure linkage allow low-6s; lack of pressure friction prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Seraphina's duty to decode leaf messages is stated in paragraph 1, demonstrated in paragraph 4 (prodding the whispering birch leaf), and drives the seed discovery in paragraphs 5–6. Setup, development (decoding act), and payoff (prophecy shared, final paragraph) meet all three gates. The motivation is clear and sustained but never conflicted—no competing want, no doubt about the message's truth, no cost to decoding. Friction between duty and personal desire is absent; she pursues the goal without trade-off. Three gates plus causal linkage to closure allow entry above 6.0; lack of dramatized friction or visible cost caps at 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Mossy delight appears once explicitly ("mossy delight swelling in her chest," paragraph 6) and the prose sustains a lyric-mystical register (patient sorting, quiet affirmation) throughout. However, the tone does not modulate under pressure—no shift at discovery, no intensification at the Hush peak—and the single "mossy delight" phrase is a curious diction choice that jars slightly against the otherwise solemn voice. Tone is coherent but static; it does not charge the final image with felt urgency or cost. Setup implicit, development weak, payoff present but flat; two-gate presence allows ~4.6–5.0 range; register oddity and lack of modulation place it at 4.7.</comment>
