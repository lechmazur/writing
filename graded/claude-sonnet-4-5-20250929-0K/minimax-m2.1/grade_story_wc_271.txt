<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's embodied trauma response is well-executed through concrete somatic detail: soil beneath fingernails, stem resistance, temperature against cheek. The freeze moments show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("her body threw itself toward ground without her permission") and the final choice with the cereus demonstrates earned endurance. Interiority occasionally slips toward therapeutic language ("somatic markers," "nervous system doing what it needed") that feels diagnosis-adjacent rather than lived experience, though the embodiment usually anchors it. The renunciation of healing-as-destination with visible cost (years of isolation, photograph kept crumpled) meets the change/endurance requirement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early (lighthouse property, three years post-wedding, greenhouse work). The accumulative lens is taught and held: daily rituals deepen, trauma responses persist, small victories accumulate toward the cereus moment. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): "Not escape, not forgetting, but a place" with visible cost (crumpled photograph never smoothed, years of chosen isolation, grief that "arrived like weather"). The four-year nursing of the night-blooming cereus directly enables the final realization and forecloses the path of seeking conventional healing, meeting the cost requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse and cliff-edge setting constrain multiple choices: salt-crusted isolation enables her retreat, the workbench anchors daily ritual, ceramic pots and misting tools are handled across beats. The night-blooming cereus in her palms at closure charges the final image with its ephemeral properties (one-night bloom after four years). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through trauma-aware perception (grey quiet, sea rhythm, soil resistance). The arbutus and sea thrift left wild versus the managed greenhouse wilderness creates meaningful spatial contrast that mirrors her stance toward grief.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—building survivable relation to trauma—is clear from paragraph two and tightens through the four-year cereus arc. Pressure accumulates through the accumulative lens: daily greenhouse work, freeze episodes, photograph handling, until the bloom forces crystallization. The protagonist's agency appears in micro-choices (never smoothing the photograph, letting wild plants be, waiting out freeze responses) and the final choice to recognize the space she's built. Cost is legible: years of solitude, permanent distance from conventional healing, acceptance of grief as weather. One meaningful deepening (cereus realization) suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the cereus's four-year arc and one-night bloom: "optimism could grow not from denial but from the realistic soil of what could actually, measurably, wither and survive." The crumpled photograph motif (never smoothed, fire-damaged, water-warped, faces melted) returns with shifted weight at closure, constraining the choice to keep building rather than seeking erasure. Subtext operates through physical markers: soil under nails, unsmoothed wrinkles, managed versus wild plants. The ending offers non-literal answer to the trauma-recovery question without moralizing, meeting the resonance test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled distance; perceptual signature is trauma-filtered (sound that was "louder than sound," sky that "opened and took everything except her hands"). Diction stays character-particular ("gift felt too simple a word," "phantom limbs") with purposeful elevation that matches her plant expertise. Two brief therapy-adjacent phrases ("somatic markers," "nervous system") risk register drift but are contextualized through embodied action. Psychic distance modulates effectively between close sensory work and reflective passages, with the final cereus moment tightening to immediate tactile focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines serve multiple functions (greenhouse repair = character trait + setting + stake). Rhythm varies naturally, and the opening anchors voice and frame effectively. Minor pattern emerges in mid-story with repeated "she" + past-tense verb stems across several paragraphs, creating brief template cadence. The phrase "somatic markers of the present" and "nervous system doing what it needed to do" edge toward clinical register that slightly flattens immediacy in peak trauma beats. No loops or major scaffold; figurative language (phantom limbs, pearl of stillness) is coherent and sparse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of trauma recovery through horticulture avoids therapy-narrative templates by grounding insight in the cereus's four-year growth cycle and ephemeral bloom. The combination of drone-strike wedding survivor + lighthouse property + night-blooming flower feels purposeful rather than quirky. Risk shows in refusing tidy healing arc and keeping the photograph crumpled with visible cost. The "pearl of stillness" phrase and "somatic markers" occasionally drift toward self-help idiom, slightly reducing freshness. Transformation test passes: the specific botanical detail (arbutus, sea thrift, night-blooming cereus properties) and cliff-edge isolation are load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drone strike wedding survivor anchors every major choice: property selection (lighthouse isolation), photograph handling (never smoothed, fire/water damage from the event), freeze responses, refusal of conventional healing. Present in opening ("wedding that wasn't, sky opened"), middle (freeze episodes, "sound that was louder than sound"), and closure (recognizing what she's built). Drives the dominant stake and forecloses paths with visible cost (years alone, crumpled photo kept). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Photograph appears in three beats: kept in botanical text, described (fire/water damage, crumpling from her fall), and implicit at closure when she recognizes building "a place." Setup early, development shows never smoothing it as micro-choice, payoff indirect (recognition grows from contrast between ephemeral bloom and permanent damage). Carries cost (she "had never smoothed it") and specificity (wrinkles "held something true"). Not causally active in final image; the cereus does that work. Swappable with another keepsake without breaking structure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Pearl of stillness" titled in final paragraph and dramatized through the cereus moment: holding the one-night bloom produces understanding. The concept shapes tactics across the story (waiting out freeze, managed wilderness, accepting grief as weather) and redefines options at closure (not escape/forgetting but anchored optimism). Setup indirect (stillness in freeze responses), development (learning to wait), payoff explicit and causal. Cost visible: years building this understanding, renouncing conventional recovery. Strong closure linkage though the phrase itself arrives late.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Quietly talented" established early (childhood gift with plants, feeling seedling pulse) and enables on-page actions: greenhouse resurrection, transplanting, misting, four-year cereus nurturing. The quietness constrains: "needed no audience," "never spoke of it," builds solitude with cost. Appears in setup, drives middle choices (daily plant care), and enables closure (cereus bloom). Visible tradeoff between talent expression and human connection. One attributive phrase but the talent itself does causal work across beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Freeze action appears in middle ("would freeze mid-motion, a trowel in her hand") and is reframed as nervous system response rather than failure, shaping her stance. Setup through "phantom limbs" reference, development when she learns to wait it out, payoff in stillness concept. Cost: accepting disruption, time lost to episodes. Drives one key choice (waiting versus fighting) and informs closure realization. Could be replaced with another trauma response (dissociation, hypervigilance) with moderate structural edits; not fully indispensable but does meaningful work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Somatic markers method signaled early ("pulse of a dying seedling," hands knowing plants by touch) and shapes attempts throughout: soil under fingernails, stem resistance, temperature against cheek anchor her during memory surges. Setup paragraph two, development across freeze episodes ("these somatic markers of the present anchored her"), payoff in cereus moment (cupped in palms). Mechanics matter: physical sensation interrupts rumination. Drives two beats (freeze recovery, final recognition) and charges closure. Strong causal pressure and specificity; removing this exact method breaks the ending's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse on cliff edge provides spatial anchor and isolation that enables her work; salt-crusted state drives repair project. Setup early (broken, wind-scoured), development (ceramic pots, misting, adjusting slats supply micro-choices), payoff (cereus blooms there). Setting pressures choice by offering managed space distinct from wild arbutus/sea thrift. The prompt specified "arboretum perched on a seaside cliff"; the text delivers "greenhouse...on the cliff's edge" which reads as near-match but not exact. Functional setting work but the arboretum/greenhouse swap slightly reduces specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the last lighthouse keeper died" frames abandonment and isolation but doesn't create live temporal pressure. Three years post-wedding and four years nursing the cereus provide duration but no ticking clock. Setup (automated lighthouse, decades dark), minimal development (timeframe mentioned not tracked), payoff indirect (four-year arc culminates). Time deepens context but doesn't tighten decisions beat-to-beat. Swappable with other isolation frames; the keeper detail adds flavor but isn't load-bearing for choices or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Anchoring optimism in realism is the story's spine: greenhouse work tests "what could actually, measurably, wither and survive." Setup (resurrection of neglected plants), development (accepting grief as weather, waiting out freeze, managed wilderness), payoff explicit in final lines ("optimism could grow...from the realistic soil"). Desire dramatized through concrete choices (never smoothing photo, letting wild plants be, four-year cereus care) with friction (isolation cost, renouncing conventional healing). Strong causal pressure, closure-defining, visible cost. Drives three beats and the ending image; indispensable.</comment>
