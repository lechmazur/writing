<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The widow's interiority is concrete and embodied through her carving practice, with consistent grief-driven motivation. Internal contradiction appears in her simultaneous holding and releasing ("the work was love, and the work was letting go"), though the final paragraph overarticulates this insight in therapy-adjacent language ("grief holds the living and the dead in its patient, practical, haunting hands"). The character's micro-choices—ignoring the kettle, touching the mane—are present but the cumulative emotional progression feels somewhat smoothed rather than contradictory in action. No visible cost forecloses a path; she continues carving without renunciation or decisive change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates reflective density around the carving act, with a cadence shift in the final paragraph that attempts to crystallize "here and gone" as unified. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the lion's glass eyes signal completion, a form of Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or alteration of tactics on the page, only the assertion that "the work was keeping hold." Orientation anchors (widow, loft, afternoon) arrive early. One meaningful deepening occurs when she touches the mane and the lion "emerged from the grain," though the final lines drift into thematic summary rather than a charged image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight, ash wood, and loft are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (wood dust, arena sawdust ghost, rain's "patient conversation"). The carving blank constrains her hands and charges the final image when she picks up the chisel again. However, spatial choreography is minimal—no clear layout of the loft, and the kettle's position is never established. The skylight functions more as atmospheric backdrop than a constraint that alters choice; it provides light but does not pressure her decision to continue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transforming loss into form through the carving. The piece shows one deepening when she touches the mane and recognizes "his face and not his face," but no visible tightening or reversal that narrows options. She ignores the kettle twice, continues carving, and picks up the chisel again—a loop rather than escalation. The cost of this containment practice is asserted ("the work was letting go") but not demonstrated through a forfeited alternative or altered tactic. Accumulative lens allows for pressure through density, yet the final paragraph's repetitive phrasing flattens rather than intensifies.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of "here and gone" as unified rather than opposed emerges through the carving and the husband's absence-as-presence. The final paragraph, however, devolves into thematic echo: "the work was love, and the work was letting go, and the work was keeping hold, and there was no difference, and there was all the difference" explicitly states the thesis in prompt-like language. This thematic articulation in the ending paragraph triggers the stated penalty. Earlier passages achieve resonance through particulars (the mane's grain, the glass eyes waiting), but the closure summary replaces scene pressure with philosophical assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV interiority maintains consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (wood shavings as "whispers," rain's "crystallized" light). Diction is controlled and rhythmically varied in earlier paragraphs. The final paragraph, however, shows syntactic monotony—a drumbeat of "and" chains—and the narrator's voice converges into abstract philosophizing that feels less character-particular. Free indirect style is clean throughout, and the widow's way of noticing (arena sawdust scent, the husband's window-standing) is selective and memory-biased. Compression under emotional weight is acceptable, but the ending's elevated register drifts from the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Early paragraphs show strong information density and varied rhythm. The final paragraph, however, exhibits paraphrase loops: "the work was love, and the work was letting go, and the work was keeping hold" restates the same content without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the "and there was no difference, and there was all the difference, and the rain kept falling, and the light kept fading" run. Figurative language is dense ("whispers," "crystallized time," "rust-hued peace") but mostly coherent; "the cage and the embrace were not opposites but companions" is abstraction rather than image. These artifacts cluster in the closure beat, triggering the stated deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—widow carving a lion from ash wood as grief practice—offers a fresh synthesis of tactile craft and emotional processing. Specific details (ash wood grain, glass-bead eyes, arena sawdust) anchor the material. However, the "lessons from loss" framing and the final paragraph's explicit thesis ("love does not disappear but transforms") echo widely used grief-narrative templates without sufficient transformation through lived, non-obvious detail. The ending's risk-averse summary hedges rather than commits to a bold image, and the "here and gone" duality resolves into tidy philosophical balance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The widow appears throughout; her choices to ignore the kettle (twice) and to continue carving shape two beats. She touches the mane in the third paragraph, a micro-choice that advances her recognition. The final action—picking up the chisel again—closes the piece but does not decisively alter tactics or foreclose a path; it continues the established loop. Setup early, involved in multiple beats, present at closure, but her decisions do not create a key turn or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ash wood carving blank is handled across all three major beats: she holds it in paragraph one, carves the mane in paragraph two, touches the mane and sets down the chisel in paragraph three, and picks up the chisel again at closure. Its grain and weight are specific; the lion's face "emerged from the grain" marks a key recognition. The blank enables her containment practice and charges the final image. Removing it would break the story's material logic. Strong integration, though the object does not constrain a choice with visible cost—she never considers stopping.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Here and gone" is introduced in paragraph one ("He had been here and gone"), developed in paragraph three ("here and gone are not opposites but a single breath"), and summarized at closure ("there was no difference, and there was all the difference"). The concept shapes her grief practice—holding the hollow places—but does not alter her on-page tactics; she carves throughout without the concept forcing a choice. It reweights the theme rather than changing options, fitting lyric-resonance allowance but remaining primarily thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Hauntingly practical" appears once in paragraph two: "the haunting practicality of grief." The phrase labels her practice—transforming loss into form, ignoring the kettle to keep working—but does not constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost. Her practicality is shown (carving methodically, planning to press glass beads), yet the "haunting" dimension remains atmospheric rather than a trait that forces a tradeoff. Label-only with demonstrated support but no on-page constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Contain" is the action driving her practice: "containment through crystallized time" (paragraph one), "wild things could be held gently" (paragraph one), "the lion's face emerged" (paragraph three), and "It would contain him now—not imprisoned, not gone, but held" (paragraph four). The carving is an act of containment that enables her grief work and charges the final image. Removing this action would break the story's emotional and material logic. Strongly integrated, though the final articulation drifts into summary rather than dramatized choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Crystallized time" appears in paragraph one ("containment through crystallized time") and is echoed in "the rain on the skylight caught the dying light and held it, crystallized" (paragraph three). The method is signaled but its mechanics remain metaphorical rather than operational—how does she crystallize time through carving? The phrase charges atmosphere and recurs with reweighted meaning, but it does not shape her attempts or tactics on the page. Lyric reprise without middle development or visible cost tied to the method itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is established in the opening line and recurs: rain on glass, dying light through the skylight, and the final break in clouds that lets through "a blade of light." The setting supplies the closing atmosphere and the rust-hued glow that charges the final image. However, the loft does not pressure her choices—she could carve anywhere. The skylight provides light for her work, a functional constraint, and the rain's presence mirrors her patience, but the setting does not alter her tactics or force a decision.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The kettle's boiling is mentioned in the opening and its whistle stretches in paragraph two, then "had gone quiet" by paragraph four. The timeframe is present but functions as backdrop rather than constraint—she ignores the kettle twice without consequence, and the cooling kettle does not tighten her decisions or create urgency. The carving could take minutes or hours; elapsed time is not tracked. Ornamental use without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Harvesting lessons from loss" is stated in paragraph four and demonstrated throughout: she transforms grief into the carved lion, learning that "love does not disappear but transforms." Her motivation drives the carving action across all beats and is present at closure ("the work was love, and the work was letting go"). However, the motivation is told and summarized more than dramatized through conflicted choices. She never hesitates, considers stopping, or faces friction between competing wants. Desire is clear and consistent but not pressured by visible cost or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Rust-hued peace" appears in paragraph four ("the particular rust-hued peace of a room where grief has done its slow work") and charges the final image when "the whole loft glowed the color of autumn, the color of rust, the color of peace." The tone is coherent and elegiac throughout, with consistent diction (patient, slow, crystallized). It modulates subtly—early restraint, final glow—and the rust color ties to the closing atmosphere. The tone charges the final image and recurs with layered meaning. Strong integration, though the final articulation becomes summary rather than sustained pressure.</comment>
