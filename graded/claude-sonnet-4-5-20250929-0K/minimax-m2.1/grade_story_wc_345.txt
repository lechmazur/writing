<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to guide the settlement toward the garden is present but abstract; her spectral nature shields her from embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The community members (Eli, Lena) receive one-line personality notes ("hoarded resources," "frightened child") that are told rather than dramatized through contradictory micro-choices under pressure. The final moment—ringing the bell and standing in rain—feels declared rather than earned by prior internal conflict with visible cost. Reflection dominates without anchoring in present micro-choices that alter stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: messages accumulate, the garden emerges, restoration proceeds, the bell rings, and the ending reweights the community's identity. Orientation anchors arrive late (Outpost Seventeen, orchard planet, floating arches) but are legible by ~15% without causing confusion at closure, so the Orientation Test penalty is waived. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the community becomes "family by choice" through collective effort), but the cost is asserted ("strangers no longer") rather than shown through a visible forfeiture or trade-off on the page. No meaningful tightening or narrowing of options occurs; the garden simply awaits their labor and blooms without friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating arches, silver-leafed canopy, and mist-shrouded valley edges create a vivid, alien orchard world with purposeful sensory detail (tarnished brass bell, chapped lips, broken stone paths). The bell tower and garden constrain the community's final action—ringing the bell summons clouds—satisfying the 9+ gate for setting pressure. However, spatial choreography during the restoration montage remains vague (who carries water from where, which paths are cleared), and the setting feels more postcard than lived-in toolkit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rediscovering communal purpose through the garden—is signaled early via Mira's messages and the whispered legend. Pressure accumulates (messages, maps, gathering, restoration) but never tightens into a trade-off or foreclosed option; the garden waits, the community labors, the bell rings, rain falls. No reversal, escalation under pressure, or visible cost appears: no resource scarcity, no dissent, no failure that alters tactics. The final act (ringing the bell) is enabled by collective faith, but the price paid is abstract ("loss of isolation") rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of collective healing and rediscovered purpose emerges from the garden restoration and the shift from "strangers" to "family by choice." The butterfly garden and watering bell function as motifs that recur with shifting meaning (neglect → tended bloom → summoning rain). However, the ending delivers an explicit thematic summary ("strangers no longer, family by choice") rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The nebula of respite and floating arches remain ornamental rather than thematically integrated into the closure cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient POV maintains stable distance and a lyric, fairy-tale register ("gentle giants of gnarled trunk," "something ineffable kept watch"). Focalization is controlled; no head-hopping mid-paragraph. Diction is consistent and purpose-driven, though occasionally elevated ("ineffable," "nebula of respite") in ways that feel authorial rather than character-filtered. Dialogue is absent. The narrative voice is distinct and rhythmically controlled, modulating from mystery (opening) to warmth (ending) without jarring shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths that support momentum. Information density is high in the opening (orchard planet, floating arches, crash landings compressed efficiently) and thins during the restoration montage. Minor scaffold appears: "patient and persistent," "kind eyes and perpetually chapped lips," "curious and close" patterns echo across beats. The final image ("wings unfurl in the garden they had built together") is clean and propulsive, but the preceding paragraph stacks abstraction ("collective faith," "blessing," "nebula of respite") without concrete anchors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating arches and the ghost-guide premise offer fresh visual specificity. The butterfly garden watering bell—a summoning device for moisture—transforms the familiar "community restoration" trope through world-specific detail. However, the emotional arc (isolated survivors → collective healing via shared labor) follows a well-worn template without bold structural or perspectival risk. Mira's ineffable nature and the nebula remain under-explored; the story retreats into safe, affirming closure rather than testing its premise's implications.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira (altruistic ghost) appears in the opening, middle (chalked messages guiding the community), and closure (flickers into visibility at the bell's base). She orchestrates the discovery but does not face a choice with cost; her decisions are narrated summary rather than dramatized turns. Present in all three gates but her agency is backdrop orchestration, not on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The butterfly garden watering bell is introduced at mid-story (bell tower discovery), its purpose explained (summons moisture), and Eli rings it at closure, summoning clouds. It appears in two beats (discovery, ringing) and charges the final image. However, it resolves a problem (garden needs water) it did not help create earlier, capping score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Nebula of respite is mentioned in the opening ("according to whispered legend") and closing ("seemed to brighten"), but never constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page. It functions as thematic decoration rather than a rule or resource that shapes the restoration effort.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" is applied to Mira in the opening and enables the community's willingness to follow her messages without friction. It appears early and shapes one key turn (the community gathers at the clearing), but the trait is label-only—never tested through a moment where her trustworthiness costs her or them something visible.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Reexamine" appears explicitly ("too occupied... to pause and reexamine their priorities") and drives the turn from survival-mode farming to garden restoration. It is present in setup and middle development, shaping the gathering at the clearing. However, the reexamination itself is told rather than dramatized through a specific choice with cost, and does not reappear in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks at dawn appear early ("Mira's chalked messages"), accumulate ("patient and persistent, spelling out coordinates and timings"), and drive the community's gathering. The method is signaled, repeated, and its mechanics (dawn appearance, maps, coordinates) matter to the middle turn. It does not appear in the closure beat, capping participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Orchard planet with floating rock arches is introduced in the opening, providing vivid visual specificity (arches drift, cast shadows, lean closer during restoration). The setting frames the community's peripheral existence and the heart-of-orchard destination. However, the arches and orchard logistics do not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; they function as backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After strangers become family" is the timeframe stated in the prompt. The story opens after this transformation has already occurred ("long stopped counting the years," "strangers into family") and the ending reaffirms it ("strangers no longer, family by choice"). The timeframe bookends thematically but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to orchestrate collective effort is present throughout: she sends messages, draws maps, guides the community to the garden. The motivation is dramatized through her persistent chalked guidance and final visible appearance. However, it is never conflicted—no cost to her ghostly endurance, no friction between her goal and the community's resistance. Present in all three gates but lacks visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" (thorny optimism, beauty amid difficulty) is legible in the tone: Mira as "gentle invitation," the garden "emerged from neglect like a miracle recalled," residents "sweated and laughed and argued," and the ending's "gentle rain" and "wings unfurl." Tone modulates from mystery and neglect to collective warmth without flattening, and the final image charges hope with the bramble of prior isolation overcome. Coherent across turns and charges closure.</comment>
