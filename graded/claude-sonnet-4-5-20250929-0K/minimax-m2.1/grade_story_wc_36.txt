<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kira's interiority is specific and embodied ("three heartbeats haunted her more than the council's judgment"), and her contradictory impulses—grief, self-blame, and emerging understanding—operate simultaneously in scene. The shift from "desperate intervention" to "witness the Weaving… with humble attention" is earned by prior causality and forecloses the guardian path with visible emotional cost. However, Kira's motivation and arc remain largely reflective; the only on-page micro-choice is raising the flute without playing it, which reads as observation rather than a decision that alters tactics. The final realization feels slightly over-articulated for someone mid-crisis, verging on diagnostic clarity ("failure was not a single moment but a long process of small surrenders").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through reflection, spatial movement, and the flute's recurring presence, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Kira "carried the flute with a different understanding." The cost—accepting witness over action, foreclosing the guardian role—is felt and legible in the final beat. One meaningful deepening occurs when the flute shifts from "reminder of everything she had failed" to symbol of continuity and witness. The single-scene, single-POV structure and one transition fit scope defaults cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Thunder-echo range actively constrains Kira's choices: the "constant reverberation made ordinary speech impossible," forcing solitude and reflection. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("dust motes that floated… like tiny suspended worlds"), filtered through Kira's grief-laden attention. The driftwood markers, canyon convergence, and "filtered light" create a micro-setting that charges the final image when Kira arranges markers "in a pattern that mirrored the constellation." Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. The environment earns high marks by shaping both tactics (silence, marker placement) and the closure beat (constellation pattern as orientation act).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Kira's reckoning with failure and her role as keeper—is signaled early and sustained through the vigil. Pressure tightens when she reaches the Listener's Crossing, the site of her original failure, and the flute shifts from weight of failure to symbol of witness. The final insight forecloses the guardian-as-intervener path with felt cost: she must accept witness over action. Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening is sufficient. However, the escalation is entirely internal and reflective; no external opposition or secondary pressure tests her new understanding, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the flute, canyon hush, and Kira's journey: the tension between action and witness, intervention and attention. The final insight—"witness the Weaving between worlds with humble attention rather than desperate intervention"—reweights prior material (the three heartbeats, the council's judgment, the driftwood markers) without stating a moral. The constellation pattern at the end offers a quiet, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates through silence, gesture (raising the flute without playing), and the canyon's enforced stillness. Minor deduction: the phrase "Relic Keeper's true task" edges toward explicit thematic statement in the final beat, though it remains tied to image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable single-third with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is consistent: Kira notices relics, lineages, and patterns with a cataloger's precision ("selecting them with the same care she had once used when cataloging artifacts"). Diction remains character-specific and voice-motivated throughout. However, two issues lower the score: the phrase "avalanchingly quiet determination" in the opening line is awkward and self-consciously literary, breaking naturalism; and the narration occasionally over-explains what has been shown ("This was where the Weaving had first manifested… where Kira had stood frozen for three heartbeats too long"). Free indirect style is otherwise clean, and no filter-verb stacks appear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is generally high, with lines doing double duty (the flute as both relic and symbol; the canyon as both setting and metaphor). Rhythm varies purposefully, and the final sentence modulates well. However, three artifacts lower the score: "avalanchingly quiet" is strained metaphor mixing register; "dust motes that floated in the still air like tiny suspended worlds waiting to be born" is purple and self-indulgent in a grief beat; and the long explanatory sentence beginning "This was where the Weaving had first manifested" loops through paraphrase without advancing pressure. The artifacts do not obscure causality but dull immediacy in key moments. No template cadence or scaffold loops appear elsewhere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The Thunder-echo range as a site for enforced reflection is a fresh angle on the "guardian's redemption" template, and the distinction between witness and intervention offers a non-obvious moral calculus. The driftwood markers as acts of orientation ("small act of organization in a world that had grown chaotic") feel specific to this character. However, the core premise—guardian fails, walks alone, gains insight—closely matches widely used writing templates, and the emotional arc (self-blame → acceptance) follows a familiar trajectory. The flute's lineage and the Weaving backstory add texture but do not transform the underlying structure. The story executes its design competently but does not take bold structural or perspectival risks.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kira is present throughout and her grief drives the reflective arc, but her only on-page decision is raising the flute without playing it—a gesture that observes rather than alters tactics. The final understanding forecloses the guardian-as-intervener path, which is meaningful, but it arrives through reflection rather than a choice under pressure. She is setup, developed through reflection, and present at closure, but lacks beat involvement via concrete decisions. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; development is weak. Functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gilded reed flute appears in beat one (carried against chest as "reminder of everything she had failed"), beat two (uncased at Listener's Crossing, raised to lips but not played), and beat three (carried "with a different understanding" at closure). Its meaning shifts from burden to continuity symbol, charging the final image. Early signal, three beats, closure linkage, and reweighted meaning all present. However, it is never used in a way that constrains a choice or alters tactics; Kira holds it but does not play, test, or interact with it beyond contemplation. High functional integration but not indispensable—a near-synonym (a scroll, a ring) could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The Weaving between worlds is mentioned as backstory (the barrier grew thin, corruption seeped through, Kira failed to act) and echoed thematically in the final line ("witness the Weaving between worlds"). It frames Kira's failure and the stakes of her role, but it does not shape on-page tactics or choices. The concept remains abstract and past-tense; no present choice hinges on Weaving mechanics. Setup and payoff (thematic echo) are present, but development is absent. Functional context, not a driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Avalanchingly quiet" is signaled in the opening line and sustained as "canyon hush" and "solitude" throughout. It constrains Kira's actions (the canyon's reverberation "made ordinary speech impossible"), forcing her into reflection. However, the trait itself is more setting effect than character attribute, and the awkward metaphor ("avalanchingly") reads as ornamental rather than integral. The hush enables the vigil but could be replaced by "enforced silence" or similar with minor edits. Two gates (setup, development via constraint), but swappability and decorative language limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Uncasing the flute occurs at the Listener's Crossing, the story's emotional center and site of Kira's original failure. The act frames the middle reflection and leads to her raising the flute without playing—a pivotal gesture of witness over action. It is signaled, dramatized, and tied to the closure insight. However, the action itself is low-stakes; uncasing a carried object does not narrow options or create visible cost. It is purposeful and well-placed but not indispensable—Kira could achieve the same reflection by simply holding the flute. Lyric reprise (first paragraph mentions the case; middle beat opens it; final beat carries it differently) lifts the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Arranging driftwood markers is signaled early ("arranging driftwood as directional markers wherever the path forked"), shown in the middle ("she selected them with the same care she had once used when cataloging artifacts"), and appears at closure ("her final set of driftwood markers in a pattern that mirrored the constellation"). The method reflects Kira's need for order and orientation, and the constellation pattern charges the final image. However, the markers do not alter tactics or constrain a choice; they are symbolic acts rather than plot drivers. Two gates (setup, payoff) with lyric resonance, but no middle complication. Score benefits from the constellation callback but remains mid-band due to ornamental function.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Thunder-echo range is introduced early, its acoustics explained ("constant reverberation made ordinary speech impossible"), and it actively constrains Kira's choices by forcing silence and solitude. The Listener's Crossing—where three canyons converge—supplies the spatial anchor for the flute gesture and reflection. The setting is not merely backdrop; it shapes the vigil's form and the final act of arranging markers. Early signal, middle constraint (enforced hush), and closure participation (constellation pattern at the crossing) are all present. The setting is integral to both tactics and the final image, meeting the high-band test for environment shaping choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the guardianship" is established in the opening ("Three moons had passed since the council had relieved her") and colors every beat: Kira walks in the aftermath of failure, and the vigil is explicitly post-crisis. The temporal anchor explains her solitude and reflection. However, the timeframe does not create urgency or constrain tactics; no clock tightens her decisions. It frames the stakes (aftermath, not crisis) but remains static. Setup and thematic consistency are strong; development via pressure is absent. Functional frame, not a driver.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Kira's motivation to "harvest insights from failure" is stated early and dramatized through her journey: the driftwood markers as acts of order, the vigil at the Crossing, the flute gesture as witness. The insight—"failure was not a single moment but a long process of small surrenders"—is earned by on-page reflection and the final understanding forecloses the guardian-as-intervener path. Friction between desire (to understand) and cost (accepting witness over action) is present. Early signal, multiple beats, closure linkage, and visible cost all met. The motivation drives the arc and shapes the ending, though the lack of external opposition keeps it from indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Canyon hush is established early ("canyon hush that now surrounded her felt earned"), sustained through the vigil ("the tone instructed her to maintain canyon hush"), and modulates with pressure: the opening hush is penance, the middle hush enforces solitude, the closing hush becomes acceptance. The tone coheres through turns and charges the final image ("the constant echo of sound and memory intertwining"). Diction, pacing, and sensory selection all support the hushed atmosphere. Early signal, consistent modulation, and closure charge are all present. The tone is integral to the story's texture and final effect, meeting the high-band test.</comment>
