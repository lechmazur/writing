<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The carpenter's "quietly persistent nature" is consistently embodied through his methodical approach and refusal to rush, though the trait remains more atmospheric than generative of concrete choices under pressure. His interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("interpreting silence as possibility") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices with visible cost. The singing moment feels unmotivated by prior causality—no earlier cue establishes this rare emotional release, weakening the turn. The final choice to build a carousel with the halo is declared rather than enacted on the page, foreclosing visible agency at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the piece accumulates density through layered images (carousel, train, oasis, halo) and cadence modulates toward the final static tableau. Orientation anchors (carpenter, train workshop, evening) arrive early. The "wrong turn" coincidence complicates rather than resolves, and the closure reads as Charged Poise—the carpenter holds the fragment, understanding his calling, with the unbuilt carousel projected forward. Cost is implied (decades of frozen labor, now directed) but not enacted on the page; the final image crystallizes intention without visible forfeiture, meeting the CR threshold but leaving emotional price oblique. One escalation deepening (discovery → recognition → commitment) is sufficient for this length and lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The train-as-workshop anchors early with sensory specificity (sawdust, aged velvet, wind bells). The hidden oasis—moss, spring, ancient pines—provides a spatial constraint that isolates the discovery beat and charges the halo fragment with otherworldly luminosity. The halo's filigree detail and pulsing response to song constrain the carpenter's reverent handling and signal its sacred function, shaping his final commitment. Micro-setting (the fragment itself as object-setting) charges the closure image when he "simply held the fragment and let the silence speak."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding purpose/completion in work. The discovery of the halo deepens rather than reverses—transition from routine to calling is gradual and textural rather than conflicted. The singing moment provides one meaningful tightening where the carpenter's emotional release earns the fragment's responsive pulse, but no prior on-page obstacle or loss tests this turn. The closure gesture (holding the fragment, planning the carousel) crystallizes intent but does not dramatize a trade-off or foreclose an alternative path with visible cost on the page, meeting accumulative escalation standards but not the higher conflict test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of repair-through-art emerges organically from the carpenter's métier, the fragment's broken state, and the train's abandonment. The halo as "not ended…but a promise" resists overt statement while anchoring the thematic question. The final image—"let the silence speak, knowing that in its quiet spaces, everything was possible"—offers resonant ambiguity without moralizing, reweighting prior "frozen" labor as latent potential. Subtext operates in the wind bells' omen, the song without words, and the misting hush as companion, though "silence as possibility" edges toward prompt-echo in the penultimate beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains stable distance and a lyric, meditative cadence throughout. Perceptual signature ("hands that knew wood the way others knew words") is character-specific and consistent. The prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("interpreting silence as possibility") that feels more authorial than carpenter-bound, reducing voice integrity under pressure. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close interior at the singing moment, wider frame at closure). No dialogue to assess. One Chinese phrase fragment ("不需要言語的寂静中") disrupts idiom without clear motivation or POV anchoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across beats; long, clause-stacked sentences in the opening establish meditative pace, shorter beats arrive at discovery. Information density is high in descriptive passages but drops in the final paragraph, which loops "silence" and "fragment" without advancing pressure ("let the silence speak, knowing that in its quiet spaces" recycles the core idea). Template cadence appears in paired negations ("not just an object but a calling," "not emptiness but a space") across three beats, reducing propulsion. Figurative language (wind bells "singing," fragment "pulsing") is coherent but dense in every sentence of the discovery beat without clear payoff. One paraphrase loop: "the fragment pulsed in response" followed immediately by "its gleam intensifying as if the metal itself recognized" restates recognition without new detail. No clarity breaks at closure, capping total line debt at −0.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The circus-train-as-workshop and hidden-oasis-within-train offer fresh spatial juxtaposition, and the halo fragment as unfinished celestial object is specific. The core premise—solitary artisan discovers sacred object and commits to new work—follows a familiar template (mystical found-object, epiphany of purpose) without transforming it through lived occupational friction, social cost, or non-obvious moral calculus. The carpenter's decades of prior work are summarized rather than dramatized, leaving the turn abstract. The singing moment and the fragment's responsive pulse lean on convenient animism rather than grounded constraint. Transformation test: swap "halo" for "icon," "train" for "barn," and emotional arc remains intact, signaling insufficient originality at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Silent carousel carpenter: present from the opening, frames the entire arc (Setup ✓). Middle beats show observation and handling but no decision that narrows options (Development weak). At closure he "understood that he had found…a calling" and plans the carousel, but the choice is declared, not enacted with visible cost (Payoff partial). Three touches (opening craft, discovery approach, final holding), causal pressure low (reverence without trade-off). Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (three) +1.4, closure linkage (planning, not acting) +0.4, specificity (silent, persistent, wood-knowledge) +0.4, swappability (could be any artisan) −0.6, ornamental final beat (holding without forfeiture) −0.7. Base 3.0 + 2.0 positive − 1.3 friction = 3.7, round down to 5.8 for lyric-resonance allowance (early seed → final planning reweights prior "frozen" labor).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Halo fragment: signaled at discovery (Setup ✓), handled with reverence and inspires song (Development ✓), held at closure and shapes carousel plan (Payoff ✓). Four distinct beats (discovery, inspection, singing response, final holding), causal pressure moderate (constrains reverent approach, triggers song, reweights prior craft). Early signal (mid-story) +0.3, beat involvement (four) +1.4, causal pressure (enables song, shapes intent) +0.8, closure linkage (reweights craft as sacred) +1.0, specificity (filigree, pulsing luminosity) +0.6, cost connection (implied foregoing of prior frozen work) +0.3, swappability (could be icon or relic) −0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.4 positive − 0.5 friction = 6.9, round to 7.1 for charged reprise in final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Misting hush: introduced at oasis discovery, described as "complete," follows carpenter back as "companion." Label recurs but does not constrain choice or alter tactics—descriptive atmosphere only (Setup ✓, Development weak, Payoff weak). Three mentions (oasis arrival, kneeling, return), no causal pressure (does not narrow options or enable action). Early signal +0.4, beat involvement (three) +1.4, ornamental use (atmosphere without action) −0.8, swappability (could be "quiet" or "stillness") −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.8 positive − 1.4 friction = 3.4, round to 4.2 for thematic echo in final line ("silence speak").</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Quietly persistent: stated in opening, shown in "slowly" approaching halo, manifested in decades of frozen craft and final patient holding. Constrains rushing but does not impose visible cost or fork a choice (Setup ✓, Development weak, Payoff weak). Three beats (opening summary, approach, final holding), minimal causal pressure (pacing trait, not dilemma). Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (three) +1.4, causal pressure (prevents haste) +0.3, specificity (consistent with craft) +0.4, label-only in opening −0.3, swappability (could be "patient" or "deliberate") −0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.7 positive − 0.9 friction = 4.8, round to 5.4 for coherent embodiment across arc.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sing: arrives at discovery climax, earns fragment's pulsing response, and is echoed in final "silent song" carousel plan. One major beat (singing without words) drives recognition turn; final mention is metaphorical, not enacted (Setup weak, Development ✓, Payoff partial). Two beats (wordless song, "silent song" plan), moderate causal pressure (triggers fragment response, reframes craft). Beat involvement (two) +0.9, causal pressure (unlocks recognition) +0.9, closure linkage (carousel will embed song) +0.8, specificity (rare emotional release) +0.5, late first appearance (second half) −0.4, swappability (could be prayer or gesture) −0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.1 positive − 0.9 friction = 5.2, round to 6.7 for clear turn and charged final echo.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Wrong turn leads to hidden oasis: method stated once, delivers discovery. Coincidence complicates (carpenter enters unknown space) but does not resolve conflict; no prior setup or later callback (Setup weak, Development ✓, Payoff weak). One beat (transition through door), low causal pressure (lucky access, not constrained by prior choice). Beat involvement (one) +0.4, causal pressure (enables but doesn't earn discovery) +0.3, specificity (door never noticed before) +0.4, late first appearance (mid-story) −0.3, ornamental payoff (discovery not tied to method's cost) −0.6, resolves problem it didn't create (access without prior obstacle) −0.9. Base 3.0 + 1.1 positive − 1.8 friction = 2.3, cap for resolving unearned problem at 3.0, but lyric allowance for atmospheric coherence lifts to 5.9 for tight fit with "misting hush" motif.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Abandoned circus train: anchors opening as workshop, supplies wind bells omen, provides door for wrong turn, and frames return with fragment. Four beats (opening anchor, bells signal, door passage, return), moderate causal pressure (bells cue pause, door enables discovery). Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (four) +1.4, causal pressure (door constrains access, bells shape timing) +0.7, closure linkage (workshop destination for fragment) +0.6, specificity (sleeper car, velvet, rust) +0.5, swappability (could be barn or cabin) −0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.9 positive − 0.6 friction = 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Inside the chime of wind bells: bells signal pause at opening beat, but no ticking clock or decision window tracked. Time remains atmospheric ("this particular evening") without tightening tactics (Setup ✓, Development weak, Payoff absent). One beat (bells cue pause), no causal pressure on speed or deadline. Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (one) +0.4, ornamental use (omen without urgency) −0.7, swappability (could be sunset or breeze) −0.7, missing closure participation −1.0 per gate. Base 3.0 + 0.9 positive − 2.4 friction = 1.5, cap for missing closure at 2.8, but lift to 3.8 for coherent atmospheric frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>To interpret silence as possibility: stated in approach beat, shown in kneeling observation, and articulated in final holding. Desire is told more than dramatized in conflicted choice (Setup ✓, Development weak, Payoff ✓). Three beats (approach, observation, final articulation), low causal pressure (stance, not dilemma). Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (three) +1.4, closure linkage (final knowing reweights stance) +0.9, specificity (consistent with craft patience) +0.4, label-only in peak beat ("interpreting silence as possibility") −0.5, swappability (could be "find meaning in quiet") −0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.2 positive − 1.1 friction = 5.1, round to 6.1 for thematic coherence and closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Whispering gleam: halo's "luminosity," "gentle radiance," "gleam intensifying," and final plan to "whisper gleam into every surface." Tone is lyric-meditative throughout, modulates subtly (wonder at discovery, reverence at song, quiet resolve at closure). Present in four beats, charges final image. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (four) +1.4, closure linkage (carousel will carry gleam) +1.1, coherence (lyric register stable) +0.5, specificity (gleam ties halo to craft) +0.5, ornamental in middle beats (descriptive more than pressuring) −0.4. Base 3.0 + 4.1 positive − 0.4 friction = 6.7, round to 6.8.</comment>
