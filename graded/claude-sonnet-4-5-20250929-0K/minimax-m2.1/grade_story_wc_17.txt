<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior world is richly textured through her perceptual signature—she reads walls and traces emotional residue—but her agency remains largely observational until the final paragraph. The climactic decision to "sketch what she heard" arrives quickly after discovering Ashworth's partial chart, without visible on-page conflict or cost that forecloses a competing path. Embodiment is strong (breath clouding, boots finding worn stones), yet the stakes feel inherited rather than tested through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Mira moves through the ruined university, layering discoveries (ivy, diaries, negative strip, Ashworth's echo chart) toward a final image that reweights her isolation into continuity. Orientation anchors quickly (corridor echo cartographer, flooded university, three years post-grandmother's death). The closure—Mira begins sketching, no longer alone in her work—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing her legacy burden with felt companionship across time. Cost is conceptual and emotional (accepting the burden as continuation) but could be sharper on the page; the final beat tells us she "did not feel alone" rather than showing a decisive forfeit or visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passages and ruined office function as micro-setting that constrains Mira's choices: she must work carefully around shattered windows, half-filled fireplaces, and encroaching green. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (leaves "like curious animals," ivy rustling "like audience members"), and the building's dreaming becomes a recurring anchor that charges the final image. The setting participates actively in the closure by embodying the legacy she maps, meeting the 9+ gate test for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—chart the building's dreams before they dissolve—is signaled early and sustained through Mira's methodical work. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers Ashworth's incomplete echo chart, connecting her solitary labor to a predecessor's parallel effort. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or tactical narrowing; Mira encounters no resistance, competing urgency, or renunciation that tests her commitment. The resolution feels meditative rather than pressured, with agency expressed through continuation rather than a forced choice with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of legacy as burden-turned-continuation emerges organically through concrete particulars: the brass lenses, half-burned diaries, Ashworth's question about what walls dream. The final image—Mira sketching in darkness, ivy joining the chorus—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. Minor drag from the phrase "legacy's burden" appearing twice as a near-label, and Ashworth's climactic question ("what do walls dream about, after everyone who gave them meaning has gone?") borders on thematic echo by articulating the premise directly, though it is mediated through recovered text rather than authorial voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinctive and controlled, with a lyric-textural register ("corridor echo cartographer," "sensitively perceptive eye," "记录的 of students") that sustains Mira's perceptual signature. POV distance remains stable in third-limited with consistent psychic proximity. Two Chinese characters (现代, 记录的) appear mid-sentence without translation or pattern-teaching, breaking legibility and reading as untranslated scaffold rather than voice-motivated code-switching; this is a clear artifact that dulls immediacy in two beats and triggers the filter/artifact penalty. Diction otherwise fits Mira's contemplative, archival idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is often luminous ("ivy pressing against shattered windows like curious animals seeking warmth") with high information density and varied syntax. However, multipleparaphrase loops appear: the building "dreamed" is restated across three paragraphs without added pressure; "legacy's burden" recurs as near-synonym; and the phrase "half-burned diaries" is used twice in adjacent beats. The untranslated Chinese insertions (现代, 记录的) are generation artifacts that obscure sense and break rhythm. Template cadence in several expository transitions ("The problem, as always," "But more than disaster") flattens momentum. Apply −0.6 for loops and artifacts, with an additional −0.3 for the untranslated tokens that touch a key discovery beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The corridor echo cartographer premise is fresh and the post-climate-shift university setting offers specific, grounded detail. The synthesis of physical ruin, memory-mapping, and intergenerational continuity feels coherent and non-obvious. Risk-taking in the lyric-textural mode and the quiet, meditative closure elevate the piece. Minor deduction for the half-burned diary discovery, which echoes familiar archival-mystery beats, and for the resolution's safety: Mira's final sketching is transformative in tone but does not fundamentally alter her initial goal or method.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira appears in setup (opening), development (retrieves diaries, uses negatives), and payoff (sketches in the final image). Her choices—entering the building, using the film negative, beginning to sketch—shape two beats and the closure. However, her decisions feel processual rather than conflicted; she observes and continues rather than narrowing options under pressure. Causal involvement is steady but lacks a visible trade-off tied specifically to her role as cartographer.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The film negative strip is introduced in setup (Mira withdraws it from her satchel), used actively in development (pressed against faded text to reveal Ashworth's diagram), and participates in closure by enabling the discovery that connects Mira to Ashworth's legacy. It appears in three distinct beats with evolving function and charges the final recognition. The object's unique property (chemical revelation of hidden text) matters causally and irreplaceably, though its presence in the final paragraph is implied continuation rather than on-page reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Legacy's burden" is seeded early (grandmother's bequest "with the weight of a thousand unremembered names"), developed through Ashworth's parallel obsession, and reweighted in closure as "not a weight but a continuation—a thread connecting those who listened." The concept shapes Mira's motivation and the final emotional turn from isolation to companionship. It appears in three beats and drives thematic stakes, though it is articulated twice as a near-label, reducing specificity slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" is referenced once ("her sensitively perceptive eye caught the edges of paper") as a trait-label enabling discovery of the diaries. It does not constrain a later choice, impose a visible cost, or recur with reweighted meaning. The attribute is functional but replaceable with "careful observation" or similar; no tactical tradeoff or price is tied to this specific sensitivity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Glimpse" is the engine of discovery: Mira glimpses Ashworth's terror and tenderness through the diaries, then glimpses the hidden diagram via the negative strip in the climactic beat. The action appears in two key moments and enables the closure revelation. However, "glimpse" is a common perceptual verb; the story would function with "discern," "perceive," or "see" with minor edits, capping irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries are discovered in setup (fireplace in the history professor's office), examined and interpreted in development (Mira uses the film negative to reveal hidden text), and their content—Ashworth's incomplete echo chart—directly shapes closure by connecting Mira to a predecessor's work. The method appears in three beats, drives the central discovery, and is causally indispensable; removing the diaries collapses the narrative arc. Slight deduction for the discovery feeling somewhat convenientâ€"the diaries survive just enough to be legible.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage frames the setting from the opening and recurs in closure ("the ivy's whispers joining the chorus"). The ivy presses against windows, creating sensory atmosphere and a mild constraint (Mira must navigate carefully), and charges the final image by embodying the building's living dream. It appears in setup and payoff with reweighted meaning, though it does not alter a middle tactic or impose a visible cost on Mira's choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The post-climate-shift timeframe is established early (coastal cities drowned, growing seasons shifted north, three years since grandmother's death) and provides world context. However, it does not create urgency, tighten a decision, or alter tactics within the scene. The flooded university is a static backdrop rather than a live temporal pressure; the climate shifts could be replaced with war, plague, or economic collapse without restructuring the narrative.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's desire to "chart [the building's dreams] before it dissolves entirely into the new atmosphere" is dramatized through her careful work with the diaries and film negative, and the final sketching enacts her motivation. The want is tested against the friction of illegible text and encroaching decay, though the conflict is external (fading ink) rather than internal (competing desires). The motivation drives three beats and closure, with modest cost (solitary labor, acceptance of an endless task).</comment>
