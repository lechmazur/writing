<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The keeper is characterized entirely through abstract attributes ("patience," "reverence," "loose grip") without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. No on-page micro-choices under pressure demonstrate hierarchy of values; the piece narrates philosophical stances rather than dramatizing them. Interior experience reads as timeless meditation, never degrading under stress or confronting a trade-off with visible cost. The final paragraph's "loosening" is asserted rather than earned through causal struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: Who, where, and when anchor by ~120 words without penalty, but the Drive Lens remains ambiguous—neither Causal linkage nor Accumulative pattern-break nor Situational crystallization is taught or held through closure. No on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs; the ending restates the opening rhythm ("the work continued—quietly, endlessly") without reweighting options or imposing felt cost. Causality is absent; the keeper moves between spaces in a loop with no tightening or consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vivid, purpose-driven sensory detail in the overgrown library (vines, dripping water, ecosystems from decayed texts) and obsidian refuge (volcanic glass absorbing light, "moment before dawn"). However, no environment, body, tool, or recurring object constrains a choice or charges the final image, capping the score at 8.8 per the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the origami swan is handled tactilely, but the swan does not alter tactics—it is a static transport device.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>No dominant stake is signaled or tested on the page. The keeper's motivation "to witness change without judgment" is label-only and never faces a concrete test or trade-off. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options; the piece loops between library and refuge without escalation. Agency is absent: the keeper observes, does not decide, and the ending restates the opening without cost or consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing and transformation emerges from concrete images (composting knowledge, regenerative silence), avoiding direct statement. However, the ending merely restates the premise ("the work continued") without a non-literal answer or reweighted particulars. Subtext operates in "loose grip" and "crumbling peace," but epiphanies are asserted ("had learned," "had become") rather than earned through specific struggle. The final paragraph's thematic echo ("without beginning or end") reads as summary rather than earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature: "vines threaded," "small ecosystems," "breathing thing." Diction is controlled and purposeful, syntax varies ("Along the river… there existed"; "To reach… the keeper did not walk"). However, register drifts into elevated abstraction at peak moments ("methodical grace," "the settling of things that had held tension"), and the POV maintains perfect certainty ("had never been," "had learned") without inference or doubt, violating modesty calibration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied rhythm and vivid specificity ("volcanic glass, black and unyielding," "soft rustle of turning pages"). However, paraphrase loops appear: para 1 and para 5 both describe the keeper's patient witnessing across seasons; para 2 and para 5 both describe the silence's regenerative work with near-identical phrasing ("mended the fractures," "regenerated what noise had worn away"). Template cadence in para 3 ("had learned," "had become") and final para ("had become," "had held"). Apply −0.6 for loops and stems per Q7 artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The overgrown library and obsidian refuge offer fresh sensory texture, but the premise (patient archivist witnesses change across eons in dual sanctuaries) is a stock literary template without transformation through specific lived cost or non-obvious moral calculus. The origami swan as transport device is a clever detail but remains ornamental. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece retreats into abstraction ("more feeling than form") rather than committing to concrete consequences. Transformation test: plot and emotional arc work unchanged with different setting names.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper is present throughout but makes no choices that create turns. Observation without decision: the keeper "tended," "moved," "had discovered," "sat"—all passive witnessing. No agency at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The obsidian refuge is described in para 2, revisited in para 4 (burrow-via-swan passage), and present at closure (para 5: "the obsidian refuge where silence waited"). Meets setup and closure gates. However, it does not constrain a choice or change tactics; it is a static destination. Lyric reprise with thematic reweighting lifts the score to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Regenerative silence is introduced in para 2 and elaborated in para 5 ("constantly breaking and reforming," "lift from their shoulders"). Present in two beats and the ending, meeting setup and closure gates. However, it remains a thematic backdrop, not a force that shapes stakes or alters options on the page. No cost or decision tied to it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is introduced in para 3, elaborated with metaphor ("clutching water," "impressions rather than... conclusions"), and echoed at closure ("grip on reality so loose"). Meets all three gates. However, it is label-only; no on-page action is constrained or enabled by this trait, and no visible trade-off occurs. Swappable with "observes without attachment."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Burrow" appears once in para 4: "the air within the library's deepest chamber would begin to burrow through the paper's memories." Functional in one beat (transport to refuge), but not signaled early and not present at closure. Missing setup and closure gates; cap at 4.6 per late-intro rule. Could be replaced with "fold," "cut," or "weave" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The origami swan is introduced early (para 4), its mechanics detailed (cryptic folds, air burrows through), and it is present at closure ("paper swan resting in their lap"). Meets all three gates. However, it functions as a transport device without constraint—no choice depends on its use, no cost attends its deployment. Causal role in one beat (passage to refuge) lifts it to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The overgrown library is introduced in para 1 with vivid micro-setting (vines, water, ecosystems), anchors the keeper's work, supplies the point of departure in para 4, and is present at closure (para 6: "overgrown library where knowledge composted"). Meets all three gates and is present across multiple beats. However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it is setting-as-backdrop. Strong setup and reprise lift the score to low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Across the drift of untold seasons" appears in para 3 and again in para 6, framing the keeper's existence. Present at setup and closure but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time within the narrative window. No live clock alters tactics; the timeframe is vague atmosphere. Missing middle development gate; cap at 4.6, but vagueness lowers further to mid-3s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"To witness change without judgment" is stated in para 5 and echoed in para 6 ("simply to witness"). Present at middle and closure, meeting two gates. However, motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices; no on-page friction between this desire and a cost. The keeper's witnessing is never tested or constrained. Functional label, replaceable with "observe" or "record."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Crumbling peace" is introduced in para 6 and elaborated: "not a failure but a completion—the settling of things that had held tension." Tone is coherent through the piece (quiet, meditative decay) and modulates subtly with each setting (library's composting, refuge's stillness). Present in the final image, charging the closure with thematic weight. Meets closure gate strongly; missing early setup lowers the score, but the tone's coherence and final-image charge lift it to mid-6s.</comment>
