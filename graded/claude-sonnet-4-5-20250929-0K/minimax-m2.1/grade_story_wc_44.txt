<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is abstract and moves through label-speak ("shiver," "desperate") rather than embodied contradiction. The discovery and circle-walking show her solving the problem competently, but no internal conflict constrains her choices—she pursues the key → walks circles → succeeds without visible cost or foreclosed path. The final "knowledge settled into her bones" reads as an unearned epiphany rather than dramatized change. No micro-choices under pressure that reveal competing values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pattern accumulation via circles and shadow layering). Orientation is established early (observatory, post-Bend world). The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing—noon shadows are "light folded back upon itself"—but the cost is conceptual assertion rather than felt or visible on the page. The seven-circle sequence deepens pattern but lacks a tangible trade-off or consequence that makes before/after legible with stakes. No persistent constraint shaped tactics; the key and circles simply work when performed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating isle, nocturnal tower, and meridian telescope anchor vividly. The clockwork automaton key with shifting runes is handled twice (discovery, circle-walking) and its warmth signals progression. Sensory selection is strong: "phosphorescent fish," "soft click," "warm in her grip." The key constrains the closure choice (she must use it to close loops), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography (archive → platform → window) tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—find where shadows go at noon—is clear early. Escalation reads as pattern accumulation (one loop → seven loops) under the Accumulative lens, but no visible price is paid; each circle "clicks" without resistance or cost. Agency is present (she chooses to walk circles) but no live option is foreclosed. The "sealed awakening" unlocks smoothly without a trade-off or complication that forces tactical adjustment. Pressure coheres but does not tighten with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—relearning through embodied practice vs. study—emerges from Elara's circle-walking and the key's response to her thoughts. The final image ("rose like breath returning") attempts resonance but leans on metaphor assertion rather than concrete particulars that reweight the premise. The "sealed awakenings" concept remains abstract; no dramatic irony or counter-reading complicates the resolution. Avoids moralizing but also avoids complexity—shadow theory is solved cleanly without ambiguity or conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV, third-limited, stable distance. Perceptual signature: "her fingers brushed," "she realized with a shiver," filters align with a deliberate scholar's attention. Diction is elevated and consistent ("residual magic," "adjacent reality") without register breaks. No dialogue to assess. The key phrase "sealed awakenings" recurs purposefully. Psychic distance remains controlled. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she understood," "she saw," "she realized") in the final third slightly dull immediacy but do not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is adequate but some lines paraphrase: "began to relearn everything she thought she knew" → "shadows were absences of light, but the Bend had taught her that nothing was so simple" restates without new pressure. The circle sequence uses template cadence: "continued moving... completed seven circles... last circle closed" without variation. One filter-verb stack (realized/understood/saw) in the climax. Stock metaphor "rose like breath" at closure. No major loops but moderate scaffold lowers propulsion. Clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The observatory-on-floating-isle and post-Bend world offer vivid specifics, but the core arc—scholar solves magical riddle through ritual action—is familiar. "Sealed awakenings" and "closing loops" remain abstract labels rather than unique mechanics. The seven-circle ritual and layered-shadow reveal feel ornamental rather than inevitable. The Bend (spoons curving reality) is a fresh image but does not constrain Elara's tactics. Emotional truth is low; no struggle or misstep complicates the solution. Freshness in setting, derivative in plot structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara (budding rune scholar) appears throughout and makes decisions: descend to archive, pick up key, walk circles. Setup clear, beats involved (archive descent, circle-walking). Her scholar role informs perception ("runes could almost read") but does not constrain a choice with visible cost—she succeeds smoothly. No foreclosed path or trade-off tied to her being a *budding* scholar vs. master. Functional but her inexperience does not complicate the solution. Two beats, closure participation, but swappable with "any scholar" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clockwork automaton key introduced early (archive), handled in two beats (discovery, circle-walking), and present at closure ("key had grown warm"). Its shifting runes and starlight charge are specific. It enables the loop-closing method. However, the key's mechanics are asserted ("pulsed with captured starlight," "gears began to turn") rather than constrained—Elara never struggles with it or adjusts tactics based on its limits. Removal would break the loop-closing, but the key could swap for any "magical tool that responds to thought" with minor edits. Strong setup and closure linkage; moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Sealed awakenings" is named repeatedly and frames the task ("tool for closing loops," "every sealed awakening seemed to require"). Setup clear. It shapes Elara's interpretation (shadows are sealed, need completion) but remains abstract—no dramatized rule or cost that changes her tactics. The concept is told rather than shown through resistance or specificity. Present in closure ("sealed awakening was not darkness at all but light") as explanation. Functional label but swappable with "hidden patterns" or "locked magic" without rewriting beats. Missing middle pressure; closure participation is thematic echo only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Quietly deliberate" appears in action: "moved through the observatory quietly, deliberately," "slowly, deliberately" during circles. Setup and closure beats present. The trait fits her scholar role and the measured circle-walking, but no moment shows a cost or trade-off—deliberateness never conflicts with urgency or risk. It describes her *how* without enabling or constraining a choice. Consistent texture but label-only; removing "quietly" and "deliberately" would not alter outcomes. Two beats, lyric reprise (quiet footsteps → deliberate circles), but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Relearn" is signaled ("began to relearn everything she thought she knew") and present at closure ("relearned the ancient principle through practice"). It frames the arc (study → embodied practice). However, the "relearning" is asserted in summary rather than dramatized—Elara does not discard a prior belief on-page or struggle with unlearning. The circle-walking enacts practice, but the shift from theory to practice is told ("relearn") not shown through failed study then successful action. Setup, closure, but the mechanics are swappable with "discover" or "understand anew." Thematic presence but low causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"By closing loops" is introduced early ("tool for closing loops"), shapes the middle action (walking circles: "first loop closed with a soft click," "one loop becoming two, becoming three"), and drives closure ("When the last circle closed"). Mechanics are specific: seven circles, each click, cumulative unlocking. The method could not swap easily—removal breaks the ritual structure. Setup, development (circle sequence constrains her movement), and payoff all present. Strong causal role across beats. Cost is low (no failed loop or price for closing), preventing top band, but irreplaceability and beat involvement are high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Nocturnal observatory on floating isle anchors early, supplies the meridian telescope and archive, and the perpetual twilight creates the visual for shadow observation. The floating stones hum with residual magic. Setting provides resources (key in archive, window for shadow viewing) and the observatory's own shadow participates in closure. Setup, development (archive descent, platform, window), and closure all touch the setting. However, the setting does not *constrain* tactics—Elara could solve the shadow riddle elsewhere with minor edits. Vivid but not irreplaceable; the isle's floating nature is ornamental to the shadow logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After spoons bend reality" (the Bend) frames backstory and world state. Setup clear ("since the Bend," "three seasons cataloging those cracks"). It establishes the problem (shadows behave strangely post-Bend) but does not tighten a present decision or create urgency. The timeframe is past-oriented context; no live clock pressures Elara's actions tonight. Closure references the Bend ("trapped in the curvature created when spoons had first curved") as causal origin but does not return to it as a present stake. Setup only; missing development and closure participation. Functional worldbuilding, low causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To find where shadows go at noon" is the stated task, signaled early ("task that seemed impossible: to find where shadows went at noon") and resolved at closure ("Where shadows went at noon was not nowhere"). Setup and payoff clear. The motivation frames Elara's archive search and circle-walking. However, the desire is told by her mentor's assignment rather than dramatized as Elara's own conflicted want—no friction between her goals and costs, no moment where she questions pursuing it. The motivation is external (mentor's task) and pursued smoothly. Functional but minimal internal conflict.</comment>
