<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through her hands-on work, but her actions remain largely unopposed and internally frictionless. The "esoteric realist's mind" label appears three times without dramatizing what that stance costs her or how it conflicts with other impulses. The final choice to rebuild tomorrow reads as philosophical acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses a competing path with visible cost. The monarch's descent feels more like witness than agency-driven turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens through dense imagery and pattern-building that culminates in the monarch's rest—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Elara's patient work achieves temporary success with the awareness that impermanence is the cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening paragraph. The wind-interruption provides a tightening that forces improvisation, and the seventeen-minute rest delivers a crystallized moment where the cost (transience, the knowledge "might not exist next year") charges the closure image. The closure lands cleanly under the Accumulative lens with felt cost, though the escalation itself is modest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto is vividly rendered with mineral deposits, ferns, condensation cycles, and tectonic instability that reinforce the theme of transient rootedness. The moth wing functions as a micro-setting object that constrains Elara's signal-building by providing an angle template. The cloud layer, pumice, and wind patterns shape her work spatially and temporally. The final image of the monarch vanishing into gray clouds charges the ending by mirroring the grotto's own impermanence, making environment inseparable from closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring the last monarch's passage through signal structures—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. The wind gust at midpoint provides a meaningful tightening that forces Elara to improvise a rescue signal, narrowing her options from preservation to intervention. The seventeen-minute rest delivers a visible success, though the cost (the grotto "might not exist next year") feels more thematic than tactically forfeited. Agency is present in the improvisation, and the Accumulative lens supports the ending's reweighting of transience, but the escalation stops short of forcing a trade-off between competing goods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of honoring overlooked histories through temporary, patient acts emerges organically from Elara's work and the grotto's transience. The moth wing, signal structures, and the monarch's lineage interweave without overt statement. The final image—"temporary things that spoke to overlooked histories in the only language they understood: the patient work of hands that refused to let silence have the final word"—reweights prior material with resonance, though the phrasing approaches thematic summary. The story commits to its premise fully, and the non-literal answer (impermanence as the condition of honor) avoids moralizing while charging the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual filter (Elara's esoteric realist lens, her cataloging instinct, her patience). The prose carries a heightened, lyric register that remains consistent through pressure. However, the phrase "her esoteric realist's mind" recurs three times as a label rather than enacted perspective, and diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("signals meant for no human eye," "the patient construction of small shelters") that feels authorial rather than strictly character-bound. Psychic distance is controlled, with no head-hopping, and the narrative modulates appropriately between observation and urgency during the wind interruption.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose is vivid and rhythmically varied, with strong image density ("ghost-impressions of green against the gray pumice," "orange speck against the gray"). However, the piece carries multiple paraphrase loops: "temporary structures" and "transiently rooted" recur without added pressure; "signals meant for" appears twice in proximity; "the patient work/construction" cycles near the end. The phrase "her esoteric realist's mind" functions as a filter-verb stack equivalent across three beats. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("knowing she would build… knowing that the act…"). These artifacts dull momentum and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack, preventing entry into the 8+ band despite otherwise strong line-level craft.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of cataloging forgotten histories with signal-building for a monarch's migration offers a fresh, specific premise. The grotto's transience and the moth wing as template are non-obvious choices that feel integrated. However, the emotional arc—patient work rewarded by witnessing—follows a familiar "quiet validation" template. The lyric-essay register and the protagonist's solitary, competent stance without internal friction or blind spots reduce risk. The piece commits fully to its vision and avoids cliché in execution, but the safety of a lone expert succeeding at her mission without genuine struggle or moral ambiguity caps originality in the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara as "esoteric realist" is introduced in the opening and her observational stance shapes her approach to signal-building, but the label itself does little causal work. Her improvisation during the wind gust reflects patient competence rather than a conflict between realist rigor and esoteric faith. The character is present across all beats and her choices drive the rescue signal, satisfying development and closure gates, but the specific trait "esoteric realist" could be replaced with "meticulous historian" or "patient craftsperson" without altering the plot. The element shapes tone more than it constrains options or imposes cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The moth wing appears in three beats: discovery backstory, use as angle-reference during initial construction, and use as template for the rescue signal. It provides a specific, irreplaceable tool (its "impossible angles" guide the shelter shape), and its return during the climax reweights its earlier mention. However, its mechanics remain abstract—"the precise curve" and "impossible angles" are asserted rather than shown constraining Elara's hand movements or material choices. The wing shapes the rescue signal's success, linking to closure, but the cost or tradeoff of relying on it is not legible. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Interrupted cadence" appears explicitly twice: in the wind's arrival ("The interrupted cadence came with the wind") and the monarch's wings closing "with the cadence of a heartbeat." The concept shapes the story's structure—the wind interrupts Elara's work, forcing improvisation—and aligns thematically with transience. However, it functions more as a thematic echo than a driver of on-page choices. The wind gust itself (not the label "interrupted cadence") creates the reversal. The concept is present at setup and payoff but does not impose a unique constraint that another term (disruption, turbulence) could not. Mid-band for lyric reprise without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Transiently rooted" is introduced early ("a place that was transiently rooted") and recurs in the final paragraph ("transiently rooted in this grotto"). The attribute shapes Elara's acceptance of impermanence and informs her decision to rebuild tomorrow despite the grotto's instability. It enables her patient work by framing transience as a feature, not a bug, and the cost—knowing her structures "might not exist next year"—is legible in the ending. The trait could be replaced with "impermanent" or "ephemeral" without breaking logic, but the specific phrasing charges the closure image by mirroring the grotto's own state. Setup, development (implicit in her material choices), and closure gates satisfied; modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The act of knotting appears in the opening (the structures are "tied with knots"), during the climax ("She knotted with urgency but precision, tying the rescue signal"), and implicitly in the ending (gathering "broken strands"). The knot is the physical mechanism by which Elara builds signals and executes the rescue, and her knot-knowledge (reconstructed from cave paintings and grandmother's tales) is irreplaceable. The wind breaking the "tension she had spent three days building" creates the reversal, and the rescue signal's success depends on knot-work. The action drives two major beats (initial construction, rescue improvisation) and is causally essential to closure. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The method is introduced in the opening paragraph (Elara's forty-year practice of "markings subtle enough to avoid notice yet permanent enough to outlast the forgetful") and demonstrated on the page through the signal structures she weaves in the grotto. The structures are "woven from vines," "positioned to catch light," and "tied with knots," and the rescue signal is built using this method during the climax. The mechanics matter: the wind scatters the structures, forcing Elara to improvise within the same system. However, the method's success is asserted rather than shown through sensory or spatial detail (we do not see the monarch recognize the angles or the light frequencies). Present at setup, development, and closure; decent causal pressure but modest specificity in execution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The grotto is richly detailed (ferns, condensation, volcanic stone, pumice, wind patterns) and its elevation "above the clouds" provides the vantage from which Elara intercepts the monarch. The setting's transience (tectonic instability, evaporating condensation) mirrors and reinforces the theme. The wind patterns are geographic features that create the climax by threatening the monarch, and Elara's positioning in the grotto makes the rescue possible. The grotto supplies the materials (vines) and the problem (wind turbulence at altitude), and the final image of the monarch vanishing into the cloud layer charges closure. Setup, development (wind as environmental pressure), and payoff gates satisfied; strong thematic and causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled early ("This was the last one, the final monarch of a lineage") and provides urgency: Elara is waiting for a specific, singular event. The seventeen-minute rest is precisely timed ("exactly the time Elara had calculated from her grandmother's observations"), showing that the migration window constrains her actions. However, the time pressure is more atmospheric than tactical—there is no ticking clock that forces a choice between competing options. The monarch's lateness ("The monarch was late") creates mild suspense, but the story does not dramatize what would happen if it never arrived or if the wind carried it too far. Setup, development, and payoff gates satisfied; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation is stated in the opening ("forty years cataloging forgotten names") and returns in the final paragraph ("the weight of all the overlooked histories she had spent her life honoring"). Elara's signal-building dramatizes the motivation: she creates structures "meant for whoever or whatever might need them," and the monarch rescue is framed as an act of honoring. However, the motivation is not conflicted—Elara never doubts her mission or faces a choice between honoring and another want. The cost (transience, impermanence) is thematic rather than a friction within her desire. Setup and payoff satisfied; development implicit in the rescue but without dramatized internal resistance. Mid-band for told-more-than-tested desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The phrase "blushing stillness" appears once, in the sentence after the monarch descends ("Elara held her breath in the blushing stillness that followed"). The tone throughout is meditative, patient, and lyric, with long sentences and elevated diction that maintain coherence across beats. The prose modulates appropriately during the wind interruption (shorter syntax, urgency) and returns to stillness at the ending. However, "blushing" as a descriptor is introduced only at the closure beat without earlier tonal priming, making it feel slightly ornamental. The overall atmosphere—quiet, reverent, accumulative—charges the final image effectively. Setup implicit in the lyric register; closure participation clear; modest specificity of the exact phrase.</comment>
