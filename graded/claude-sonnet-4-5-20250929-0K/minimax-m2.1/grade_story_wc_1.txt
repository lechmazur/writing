<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is vivid and embodied—"feeling the residual warmth," "loosening of the grief that had calcified"—but her arc relies heavily on reflection rather than on-page micro-choices under pressure. The transformation from survival to pursuit is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The glass-artist backstory provides rich texture but occupies substantial real estate without altering present tactics until the final turn. Internal conflict remains largely retrospective; no genuine mistake or live tradeoff emerges to test her commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early (who, where, when by opening lines). The closure unit reads as Charged Poise: Mira's shift from victim to pursuer crystallizes in the final image with felt cost (leaving sanctuary, confronting smugglers). However, the causal linkage is thin—frost patterns "reveal" routes but never constrain a choice or impose a tactical cost on the page. The ledger strip survives conveniently and the frost-mirror discovery feels more like thematic decoration than a pressure point that narrows options. One meaningful deepening is present but the cost at closure remains more asserted than legible in a specific action or forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "delicate crystalline veins," "cold sand," "thin mountain air." The canyon setting recurs across beats and the frost patterns return at closure, charging the final image. However, the environment never materially constrains a choice—Mira's sanctuary status is told, not tested by proximity or access limits. The ledger strip and frost function more as symbolic anchors than as tools that alter tactics. Micro-setting (body, recurring object) is present but does not foreclose a path, capping the high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—survival, then understanding, then pursuit—is signaled and evolves, but escalation is largely reflective rather than event-driven. No on-page reversal tightens options; the frost discovery arrives without resistance or cost, and Mira's turn to pursuer in the final paragraph is a declared stance rather than a choice that forecloses an alternative. Coincidence (frost patterns conveniently mirror the ledger) complicates but also resolves the knowledge gap. One deepening is present (survival → pursuit) but lacks visible price or tactical alteration on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—truth surviving fire, beauty through suffering—emerges organically from glass imagery and the ledger's survival. The final image ("light breaking through glass") reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the conceptual repricing leans abstract: "proof that truth survived even the hottest fires" is stated rather than enacted through a concrete choice or cost. Subtext operates in image and metaphor but the thematic turn feels more lyric summary than earned transformation. Strong thematic coherence but the ending's resonance is asserted more than built from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "patient waiting for the precise moment when resistance became flow," "learning the geography... with the same patience she had once applied to her glass." Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout. Elision is purposeful (the fire, the escape) and paid off in reflection. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with emotional beats. The prose reflects Mira's glasswork sensibility consistently, and no dialogue appears to evaluate. Minor deduction for slight elevation in the final paragraph ("the expression felt like light breaking through glass") that edges toward poetic summary rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful ("frost creep... in delicate crystalline veins"). Information density is high, with most lines doing double work. However, several phrases loop conceptually: "the pauses between events held their own meaning" echoes "patient waiting for the precise moment"; "fear had dulled... worn away" is followed immediately by "She was beginning to understand." Template stems recur in the final third: "She had discovered," "She was beginning," "She rose," "She tucked," "She smiled." Deduction −0.4 for paraphrase loops and template cadence in the closure sequence. No grammar errors; specificity is strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The glass-artist premise and frost-as-map concept offer fresh inflection, and the turn from victim to tracker is specific. However, the core arc—survivor finds evidence, decodes landscape, becomes hunter—follows a familiar template without deep transformation. The frost-mirror discovery feels convenient rather than inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity (grief "calcified around her heart," light "breaking through glass") elevates but the final turn is more lyric summary than risk-taking structural choice. Derivative premise guardrail applies: the survival-to-pursuit arc is widely used and the piece does not fully transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or world logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The glass-artist identity is present throughout and shapes her perceptual lens ("learning to read the land's quiet languages the way she had once read the flow of molten glass"). However, her glasswork choices do not create on-page turns; the backstory enriches interiority but remains retrospective. Present choices (walking, tracing, understanding) are observational. Setup and closure linkage are present (final image "light breaking through glass"), but no middle beat where her glasswork skill constrains or enables a tactical choice. Lyric resonance without mid-scene causal work places this in the mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ledger strip appears in three beats: introduction (paragraph 2), discovery of pattern match (paragraph 4), and final decision (paragraph 6). It survives the fire and provides the stake (evidence of crimes). However, its use is largely static—described, not handled in ways that alter tactics. The frost-mirror moment reweights its meaning but the ledger itself does not constrain a choice or impose a cost. Setup, development (pattern match), and closure participation are all present, meeting the three-gate threshold, but causal pressure and specificity are moderate. Swappable with any "clue" object without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Scorched testament" shapes the dominant stake (proof that truth survives fire) and anchors the final image. Setup is immediate (paragraph 2: "the scorched testament to their crimes"), and closure directly invokes it (paragraph 6: "she understood finally what the scorched testament meant"). However, the concept operates more as theme than tactical constraint—it does not narrow options or force a tradeoff on the page. Present in setup and closure; development beat shows understanding but not a choice-altering cost. Lyric resonance without middle causal pressure places this in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Steadily adaptive" is named in the opening paragraph and demonstrated through learning the canyon's "quiet languages." However, it remains label-adjacent—described rather than tested by a visible tradeoff. No on-page moment where adaptation enables a success or imposes a cost (e.g., missing a clue by adapting too quickly, or enduring discomfort to preserve flexibility). Setup is present; closure linkage is thematic (her turn to pursuer reflects adaptability) but not causal. Functional but replaceable with "resilient" or "observant" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Retrace" drives the middle third: "she walked the canyon floor each morning, retracing paths she had never traveled before." The frost discovery arises from this repeated action, and the final turn (walking "toward the eastern light") mirrors it. Setup (paragraph 3), development (retracing leads to pattern recognition), and closure participation (resuming movement with new intent) are all present. However, the action is observational rather than choice-driving—she could "explore" or "map" with similar results. Two beats and closure linkage elevate this, but swappability and lack of tactical constraint cap it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Frost patterns appear in three beats: opening image, discovery (paragraph 4: "frost revealed what dust had hidden"), and closure (paragraph 6: "patterns in the morning frost would guide her forward"). The mechanics matter (worn paths freeze predictably) and the method is signaled early. However, frost functions as revelation, not constraint—it shows the way but imposes no cost or tactical choice. Setup, development (pattern match), and closure participation meet the three-gate threshold, but causal pressure is weak. Removing frost and using "dust trails" or "weathering" would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The canyon setting is present in every beat: opening tactile detail, "sanctuary and her study" (paragraph 1), walking the canyon floor (paragraph 3), kneeling in cold sand (paragraph 5), and walking toward eastern light at closure. Setup, development, and closure participation are clear. However, the canyon supplies resources (shelter, frost) without pressuring choices—no moment where terrain limits movement, forces exposure, or imposes a tactical cost. Micro-setting (body in cold sand) is embodied but does not alter options. Strong presence and closure linkage but lacks constraint, capping below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Three weeks had passed since she survived the attempt" anchors the timeframe early. The "after surviving" framing recurs implicitly (grief "dulled in the weeks of solitude") and closure references progression ("for the first time since the fire"). However, time does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure, no deadline that alters tactics. The frame is retrospective (post-fire) rather than live. Setup is present; development and closure are thematic but not causal. Functional framing without tactical constraint places this in the mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To discover purpose in the pauses" is named in paragraph 5 ("the pauses between events held their own meaning") and implicit in her shift from survival to understanding. Setup is late (second half); closure reflects the turn ("she sought understanding"). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—no on-page friction between this desire and a competing want or cost. The stake evolves (survival → understanding → pursuit) but "purpose in the pauses" itself does not drive a choice or foreclose a path. Late signal and label-only treatment lower the score despite thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Drifting resonance" coheres across the piece: lyric pacing, sensory immersion, contemplative rhythm. Tone modulates appropriately (urgency in the fire backstory, stillness in canyon observation, resolve at closure). The final image ("light breaking through glass") charges the resonance with decision. However, the tone remains largely static—one contemplative register without sharp pressure shifts. Setup is immediate, development is consistent, and closure participation is strong. Coherent and purposeful but lacks the modulation under stress that would elevate this further.</comment>
