<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The weaver's interiority is concrete and her calcification provides embodied physical consequence. The bargain with the grotto—taking burdens into patterns in exchange for gradual transformation—creates coherent motivation. However, the piece lacks genuine internal conflict; she "does not resist" and moves through her work without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The arrival memory provides backstory but no micro-choice alters present options, and the final acceptance feels predetermined rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (shingled hush, fractal patterns, calcification creeping upward) toward a final sonic image that reweights the grotto's nature. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the bronze grotto paragraph. Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she adds the final thread, another layer settles, and the whalebone song rises—but the cost remains oblique; calcification is already underway and her acceptance was signaled early, so the ending deepens rather than decisively changes her stance. One meaningful accumulation toward the final image is present, satisfying the length requirement, though the conceptual cost could be more legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bronze grotto is vividly anchored through starlight filtering through fissures, kerosene flame oriented toward draft, and fractal patterns covering every surface. Sensory detail (metal-rich glow, shingled hush pressing against skin, calcification creeping like frost) is selective and POV-filtered. The grotto's architecture—patterns spiraling inward, burdens pooling at the heart—constrains her ritual positioning and charges the final image when the whalebone song rises "through stone and soil and root." Micro-setting (her body orientation, the lamp's flame direction) functions as setting and alters her work's mechanics, meeting the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming into the pattern to release burdens—is signaled early. The piece shows one tightening: she chooses a burden, incorporates it, completes her section, and another silence-layer settles. However, escalation is thin; no option is genuinely foreclosed because she already accepted calcification and the grotto's terms before the piece opens. The final thread and settling layer deepen the existing process but do not narrow live options or force a visible trade-off. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification occurs, but the cost at closure is atmospheric rather than viscerally felt as a forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—bearing sorrow collectively through art versus carrying it alone, the cost of becoming the archive—emerges through concrete particulars: burdens without owners, patterns spiraling inward, calcification as price. The grotto as living organism ("ancient lung exhaling," "whalebone reverie") resonates without overt statement. The final image reweights prior material by shifting the grotto from stone repository to animate, oceanic presence. However, the piece flirts with abstraction ("unnamed sorrow," "weights of human weight") and the thematic echo in "release it into the structure and feel herself grow lighter" borders on articulating the premise rather than letting image alone carry it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, distinct perceptual signature: she filters setting through craft (librarian between shelves, patterns as categories of sorrow). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("shingled hush," "whale-boned," "calcify"). No dialogue to judge. Compression ("threatening to calcify her from the inside, to turn her heart to stone") is purposeful and the doubled phrase intensifies rather than dilutes. Psychic distance modulates appropriately when remembering her arrival. One minor slip: "the weights of different burdens, those that melted down" uses "weights" and "burdens" in close echo without functional distinction, a small texture flaw that does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence length and vivid imagery. Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, setting, or the weaver's transformation. Minor loop: "a pressure behind the eyes, a stone in the stomach, a tightness in the chest" cycles through body-part phrases without variation in syntax, and "the weight of her own unnamed sorrow" / "weights of human weight" / "different weights of sorrow" recycles "weight(s)" across three adjacent paragraphs without functional distinction. These create momentary drag (−0.4 for paraphrase and template tendencies) but do not obscure causality or dull the closure image. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; figurative density (fractal, shingled, whalebone) is high but pattern-taught and coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The fractal-weaver premise and calcification-as-price offer a fresh synthesis of artist-as-archive and body-transformation. Specific detail (kerosene lamp flame orienting toward draft, burdens arriving as sensations without source) avoids generic mysticism. The whalebone-reverie final image is memorable and non-obvious. However, the core emotional arc—artist accepts transformation to hold collective pain—echoes familiar martyr-artist templates, and the protagonist's lack of resistance or genuine ambivalence reduces risk. The piece commits fully to its premise but plays the commitment smoothly rather than daringly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fractal weaver is present throughout and her action (choosing a burden, incorporating it, adding the final thread) drives the central beat. She appears early, her choices shape middle work, and her completion triggers the silence-layer and song at closure, meeting all three gates. However, her decision is foregone—she already accepted the bargain—so the final thread deepens rather than alters her path. Two beats (choosing burden, completing section) involve her agency. Causal pressure is moderate; the choice matters but does not narrow live options because resistance was never on the table. Closure linkage is strong (final thread → settling layer → song). Swappability is low (her specific role as weaver is irreplaceable). Applying +0.6 setup, +0.9 two beats, +0.8 causal moderate, +1.2 closure linkage, +0.6 specificity, minus −0.5 for foregone decision and lack of genuine turn = baseline ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kerosene lamp appears in one paragraph ("Her lamp burned kerosene with a steady hum, the flame orienting properly toward the draft"). It demonstrates the grotto's mechanics (air flow, draft) and ties to her orientation practice, but it is never handled again or reweighted. Setup gate met; middle development absent (not touched during burden-weaving); closure absent (does not appear in or shape the final image). With only setup, cap at 4.6 per missing-gate rules. One beat involvement +0.4, some causal flavor (flame orientation shows proper alignment) +0.3, specificity (kerosene, draft mechanics) +0.4, but swappable (any light source with directional cue) −0.5, ornamental single use −0.5. Total ~4.2, within the one-gate cap.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Shingled hush is seeded early ("The shingled hush of the grotto pressed against her senses—layer upon layer of silence overlapping"), recurs in the middle ("its layers wrapping around her"), and charges the closure ("she felt another layer of silence settle over her, and in that silence she heard...the distant song"). It shapes her embodied experience (silence as physical pressure) and the final reconfiguration hinges on another hush-layer settling before the whalebone song emerges. All three gates met. Early signal +0.6, three beats (opening description, middle wrapping, final settling) +1.4, causal pressure (the hush enables the song's emergence) +1.0, closure linkage (settling layer triggers song) +1.3, irreplaceability (the overlapping-scale metaphor is specific) +0.6, cost tie (the hush is the medium of her transformation) +0.4. No major frictions. Total ~6.7, comfortably in the 6.1–7.0 band for three-gate involvement with strong reprise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Boundary-lessly trapped is evoked thematically (she cannot leave, calcification binds her, the grotto holds sorrow "since before...") but never labeled or demonstrated as a specific constraint that alters an on-page choice. Setup is oblique (the grotto's "ancient lung" and her being "enveloped" suggest enclosure by mid-story). Middle development: no scene where the boundary tests her or she works around it. Closure: the final image does not hinge on boundary-trapped mechanics. With only a thematic shadow of setup and no middle or closure participation, this scores in the ornamental band. Thematic presence without action pressure −0.8, swappable (any entrapping setting) −0.5, label-only −0.3. Starting from 3.0 default, total ~3.1, capped by missing development and closure gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Calcify appears early (backstory: "threatening to calcify her from the inside"), recurs in the middle ("The calcification had begun at her fingertips...creeping upward like frost"), and defines the ending bargain ("eventually she would become the pattern itself"). The action is irreplaceable—her literal transformation into stone-pattern is the story's hinge—and it forecloses the path of remaining flesh. All three gates met. Early signal +0.7, three beats (threat, onset, inevitability) +1.4, causal pressure (calcification is the cost enabling burden-release) +1.3, closure linkage (the final layer settling advances calcification toward full transformation) +1.5, irreplaceability +0.7, cost connection (visible physical price) +0.5. No frictions. Total ~7.9, high in the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orienting properly is seeded early (lamp flame "orienting properly toward the draft"), explicitly named in the middle ("The work required perfect orientation of her body, her breath, her thoughts—all aligned toward the center"), and recalled at closure when "another layer of silence settle[s] over her" after proper completion. All three gates met. The method constrains her work (alignment is necessary) and the final settling confirms correct orientation. Early signal +0.5, two beats (lamp demonstration, explicit work description) +0.9, causal pressure (orientation enables burden-weaving) +0.9, closure linkage (final settling implies orientation succeeded) +1.0, specificity (alignment to grotto center, breath, thought) +0.5. Slight swappability (any ritual-alignment method) −0.4. Total ~6.4, solid mid-band for a method that shapes attempts and closure confirmation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Bronze grotto under starlight is anchored in the second paragraph, developed through vivid micro-detail (fissures, metal-rich glow, draft veins, fractal-covered surfaces), and charges the final image ("stars that watched over the bronze grotto with their ancient, patient light"). All three gates met. The grotto's architecture constrains her positioning and the starlight bookends the piece, reweighting the space from workroom to cosmic witness. Early signal +0.7, three beats (introduction, working description, final star-gaze) +1.4, causal pressure (grotto structure enables pattern-work and her transformation) +1.2, closure linkage (stars close the frame) +1.4, irreplaceability (bronze + starlight is specific) +0.7, cost (the grotto exacts calcification) +0.5. No major frictions. Total ~7.6, essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>After the first snowmelt is mentioned in the opening line and again in paragraph five ("burdens, those that melted down from the mountains with the first thaw"), establishing when the story occurs. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; it is a seasonal marker that explains why burdens arrive now, but no ticking clock or deadline alters her choices. Setup gate met (opening line). Middle development: the thaw is referenced but does not pressure tactics. Closure: snowmelt does not appear in or shape the ending. With only setup, cap at 4.6. One beat (thaw explanation) +0.4, slight causal link (thaw delivers burdens) +0.3, swappable (any seasonal transition would work) −0.6, ornamental (time is backdrop, not pressure) −0.5. Total ~3.8, within the one-gate functional band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>To collect the weights of different burdens is stated explicitly in paragraph five and demonstrated when "She chose a burden from the pool before her, feeling its particular gravity...and began to incorporate it." The motivation is seeded early, acted upon in the middle, and implicit at closure when she completes her section. All three gates met. However, the desire is not conflicted—she does not struggle with the choice to take burdens—so friction between wants and costs is low. Early signal +0.6, two beats (choosing burden, incorporating it) +0.9, causal pressure (motivation drives the central action) +0.8, closure linkage (final thread completes collection cycle) +1.0, told-and-shown (explicitly stated, then demonstrated) −0.3, lack of conflict (no competing want) −0.6, swappable motivation framing −0.3. Total ~6.1, just over the three-gate threshold with moderate dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Whalebone reverie appears as a recurring tonal anchor: "something vast and whale-boned" in the penultimate paragraph, and "whalebone reverie rising through stone" in the final sentence. The tone—dreamy, patient, oceanic—is coherent throughout (metal-rich glow, shingled hush, ancient rhythm) and modulates subtly from workroom focus to cosmic listening. Setup is early (metal-rich glow, breathing stone establish the reverie quality by paragraph two). Middle development: the whale-boned metaphor appears late-middle, charging the hush. Closure: the whalebone reverie crystallizes in the final image, reweighting the grotto as animate and vast. All three gates met. Early tonal establishment +0.6, two explicit beats (whale-boned embrace, final song) +0.9, causal coherence (tone enables the shift from stone-archive to living depth) +0.9, closure linkage (final image is the reverie's payoff) +1.5, specificity (whalebone is distinct) +0.6, late explicit naming (second use only in final third) −0.4. Total ~7.2, tone charges the final image and modulates with pressure.</comment>
