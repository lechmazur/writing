<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation to compile fragments is consistent and his visionary ability is well-embodied through the visions triggered by touch. However, his interiority remains largely observational rather than conflicted—he processes meaning but faces no genuine internal resistance or contradictory impulse that would complicate his choices. The final understanding of the valve's purpose arrives as epiphany rather than earned through dramatized struggle. Sera functions primarily as witness rather than applying independent pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: fragments accrue meaning through staggered visions leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the valve's purpose is understood and the archivist recognizes his ongoing work. Orientation anchors clearly (who/where/when by the opening paragraph). The closure moment—"he knew his work was only beginning"—reconfigures the archivist's stance from keeper of the past to active compiler of the returning present, but the cost remains abstract and felt rather than concretely dramatized on the page. The understanding itself does not foreclose a path or impose a visible sacrifice; it opens possibility without demonstrated price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ivory harbor after rain is vivid and recurring, framing both opening and closing images with the "ivory stones gleaming after rain" reprise that charges the final moment. Sensory details are filtered through the archivist's professional lens (salt crystals on notebooks, corroded brass). The micro-setting of the archive and the trumpet valve as object-as-setting successfully constrain the archivist's attention and shape the final recognition. Spatial choreography between harbor, archive building, and window remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why he kept the valve and what role he will play after exile—is clear and present throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when the vision rises "not from someone else's fragment, but from the object itself," tightening his connection to the returning community. However, the archivist encounters no genuine opposition or complication; Sera's arrival facilitates rather than tests him. The resolution grants understanding without requiring trade-off, renunciation, or visible cost that alters his tactics or forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory, preservation, and reconstruction emerges organically through the valve, fragments, and visions rather than stated. The final image—hand closing around the valve while watching boats arrive—offers a resonant answer to what role the past plays in rebuilding community. The "navigated absences" concept operates more as atmospheric backdrop than a force that meaningfully complicates choices on the page. The ending avoids moralizing and allows complexity: preservation is both burden and bridge, solitary and communal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and a distinctive perceptual signature: the archivist notices through the lens of preservation and vision (salt crystals, corroded brass, fragments). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during vision sequences, slightly wider during exposition of his reputation. The phrase "reactively visionary" in exposition reads slightly promotional but does not break voice. Sera's brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping; focalization remains controlled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with good rhythm variation and sensory specificity ("salt crystals still clung to his notebooks," "ivory stones gleaming after rain"). However, several phrases loop or scaffold: "fragments" appears excessively across paragraphs without functional variation; "staggered intervals" is repeated verbatim in the final sentence as a direct callback to the prompt element; "compile fragments into meaning" recurs without added pressure. The final paragraph contains minor redundancy: "watched the boats continue to arrive" after establishing arrivals earlier. These artifacts dull momentum slightly but do not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise of an archivist with object-triggered visions who stayed behind during exile offers a workable synthesis, but the emotional arc and central conflict follow familiar restoration-narrative patterns. The "herald's trumpet valve" as symbolic connector is apt but predictable. The piece commits fully to its premise and executes competently within the frame, yet lacks a surprising inflection or moral calculus that would distinguish it from similar exile-return stories. Specificity of detail (ivory harbor, ocean-spray role) adds texture without fundamentally transforming the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ocean-spray archivist is present throughout and his choice to invite Sera triggers the vision sequence. His decision at closure—to understand the valve's purpose and accept ongoing work—shifts his stance from passive keeper to active compiler. However, most beats show him receiving and processing rather than deciding under pressure. The role shapes two key beats (invitation, final recognition) but does not drive multiple reversals or constrain tactics with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Herald's trumpet valve appears in opening (salvaged, kept), middle (pocket during Sera's visit), and closure (hand closes around it with understood purpose). It returns with reweighted meaning: from silent relic to promise of restored signal. The valve's specific function—controlling the call to ships—matters causally to the archivist's epiphany. Present across three beats with evolving significance and directly shapes the final recognition. Strong integration, though the valve does not constrain an earlier choice or impose visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Navigated absences operates thematically (exile scattered life; archivist bridges gaps) but does not constrain on-page tactics or alter the archivist's options in a dramatized choice. The concept flavors atmosphere and his reputation but remains conceptual rather than mechanical. It is present and coherent but replaceable with "preservation" or "reconstruction" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Reactively visionary is demonstrated on the page: visions triggered by touching fragments (Sera's box) and finally by the valve itself. The trait enables the key turn when the vision rises from his own object. However, it imposes no visible cost or constraint—the visions clarify rather than burden. The attribute is functional and causally present in two beats but lacks friction or trade-off that would elevate integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Hearten is realized when "his presence alone seemed to hearten those who recognized him" and when he offers "small comforts" to returning exiles. The action sets up his role and motivates Sera's trust, which leads to the vision sequence. However, the action itself is summarized rather than dramatized in specific gesture, and it could be replaced with "welcomed" or "reassured" without major structural change. Present and purposeful but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Through staggered intervals is signaled early ("developed his reputation as reactively visionary over the decades") and demonstrated in the vision sequence: "visions came in staggered intervals—first the image of a mother sewing... then the memory of a garden... then the shadow of a small hand." The method shapes the middle beat and recurs in the final sentence as structural echo. The mechanics matter to how understanding builds. Present in two beats with thematic payoff, though the final-line repetition reads slightly ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Ivory harbor after rain frames opening and closing with purposeful reprise: "ivory stones gleaming after rain" charges the final image by recalling the opening scene. The setting provides the spatial anchor (harbor/archive) that organizes the archivist's dual role (watcher/compiler). The rain and mist create atmosphere that supports the tone of emergence and clarity. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Strong lyric function; moderate causal function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>After the exile ends is the inciting condition that brings exiles back and triggers the archivist's recognition of his new role. The timeframe is signaled in the title phrase and drives the dominant stake (what happens now that separation is over). It shapes two beats: the arrival of exiles and the archivist's realization that "his work was only beginning." However, it does not impose urgency or tighten tactics within the depicted window; it is a state rather than a live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>To compile fragments into meaning is stated early ("His motivation remained unchanged") and demonstrated through his archival work, the vision sequence with Sera's objects, and the final recognition of the valve's purpose. The desire drives both the invitation to Sera and the final understanding. It is dramatized in action (spreading fragments, experiencing visions) and conflicts subtly with isolation (he stayed behind, now must engage the returning). Present across three beats with visible pursuit and closure linkage.</comment>
