<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior is grounded in sensory method (heat-mapping) and embodied through careful movement, but her arc toward "understanding" arrives via epiphany rather than a choice under contradictory pressure. The tuning fork case is handled repeatedly, yet remains symbolic rather than forcing a trade-off. The final paragraph's claim that she "had succeeded" and "had become the translator they needed" reads as self-awarded rather than earned through an on-page renunciation or decision with visible cost. No secondary character is present to apply relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation (who, where, when) anchors cleanly within the first two paragraphs. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara moves through mapped spaces, building density toward the performance hall's climactic sensory revelation. However, closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration by realization alone—she "understood finally" and "realized now"—without an on-page action, refusal, or forfeiture that forecloses a live path. Cost is asserted ("translate silence into music… succeeded") but not dramatized in a micro-choice or visible trade-off at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is vividly rendered (frosted panes, frozen ferns, frost-covered windows) and its thermal properties directly enable Elara's method. The performance hall's "pulsed warmth" and layered histories constrain her sensor readings and charge the final image. Spatial choreography (corridors, eastern wing, central hall) remains clear. The conservatory qualifies as micro-setting that shapes the climactic beat, meeting the 9+ gate in principle; small lapses in economic detail (e.g., "frosted palm trees" twice, "frozen ferns and frosted palms" near the end) prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translate silence into music via heat-mapping—is signaled early and persists. Elara's approach to the avoided performance hall constitutes one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens: intensity increases when "the air pulsed with warmth in waves" and her sensor trembles. Yet the resolution is a declarative realization ("she had succeeded") rather than a decision or tactic shift that narrows options with dramatized cost. No on-page reversal forces a choice between competing goods or forecloses a path; the ending awards success without visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (art survives catastrophe; feeling can be read in residue) emerges through concrete thermal mapping and spatial layering rather than statement. The tuning fork case and conservatory architecture supply recurring images that accumulate meaning. However, the final paragraph edges toward overt summary: "had survived," "had become the translator they needed," "waiting for someone to remember how to listen" articulates the thesis rather than leaving it implicit in the closing image. The piece avoids moralizing but tilts explanatory at closure, reducing resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Elara's perceptual signature: movement as language, thermal sensor as divining rod, touch-worn brass. Diction ("capsize survivor," "unshaken marvels," "rectify the great loss") occasionally drifts into elevated register that sits at the edge of her established idiom but remains legible. No dialogue is present. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping. The final paragraph's explanatory summary ("she realized now that she had succeeded—not by recreating sound, but by learning to hear with different senses") edges toward helpful-narrator mode, slightly flattening the voice under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high in the thermal-mapping beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "spaces that had once rung with music" / "concerts and performances that had meant most" restate the same idea across adjacent paragraphs; "frosted" recurs four times in proximity without charged variation. The phrase "she had [verb]" scaffolds the final paragraph (had avoided, had encountered, had been preparing, had come, had succeeded), creating template cadence at closure. Figurative language ("like musical notation," "like insects trapped in amber," "like a divining rod") clusters densely without muddle but approaches decorative threshold. Clarity and propulsion remain solid; no causality break occurs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—heat-mapping emotional residue in a post-sound world—offers a fresh synthesis of synaesthesia and archive-recovery. The conservatory as laboratory and the tuning fork as artifact supply specific, non-generic anchors. However, the emotional arc (avoidance → approach → epiphany) follows a familiar template, and the closing realization ("she had succeeded") awards the protagonist rather than letting the image do the work. The Great Quieting and thermal cartography are inventive concept-level choices; execution at closure retreats to stock epiphany beats. Transformation is partial: stronger world-building than character surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is labeled "capsize survivor of the Great Quieting" in the opening and her careful navigation reflects that history. However, the survivor trait does not drive a key turn or constrain a choice under pressure; it functions as backstory coloring. Present in setup and thematically present at closure (her refusal to abandon the tuning fork), but the middle beats rely on her heat-mapping method rather than survivor-specific decisions. Functional but largely replaceable with "researcher" or "archivist." Two of three gates; no distinct causal pressure tied to survival itself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tuning fork case is introduced early ("tucked in the pocket of her thermal coat"), handled in the opening beat, reprised in the climactic performance-hall beat ("pressed against her chest… she could almost feel its potential vibration"), and mentioned in the final paragraph. Three distinct touches across setup, middle, and closure. Its symbolic weight (silence measured, frequency as principle) is clear, but it does not constrain a choice or shift tactics on the page. The reprise at closure reweights meaning but remains introspective rather than actionable. All three gates; purposeful recurrence; lacks causal pressure or visible cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Unshaken marvels" is coined early ("cartography of unshaken marvels—moments so emotionally potent") and returns in the final paragraph ("unshaken marvels of human emotion had survived"). The concept frames her method (mapping permanent thermal fingerprints) and the dominant stake. However, it operates as thematic labeling rather than constraining tactics or enabling a turn; Elara's heat-mapping method does the causal work. Present in setup and closure; middle development is implied but not dramatized as a choice-point. Two of three gates; primarily decorative echo rather than pressure lever.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Silently expressive" is mentioned twice: opening ("her silently expressive face softening") and near closure ("silently expressive face"). The trait reflects the post-Quieting world (motion as language) but does not enable or constrain an on-page action with cost. Elara's careful movement and sign-language fluency are shown in the opening beat, yet neither forces a trade-off nor shapes the ending. Label-only at closure; no middle choice tied to silent expression. One gate (setup); ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Rectify" appears once in the opening third ("somehow rectify the great loss by creating a new way to experience what had been lost") and implicitly at closure ("she had succeeded… by learning to hear with different senses"). The action names her overarching goal and the ending claims success, but no single on-page beat dramatizes rectification under pressure. The performance-hall revelation is observational rather than corrective; she maps rather than repairs. Present in setup and thematically at closure; no middle turn where rectification itself alters options. Two of three gates; swappable with "document," "translate," or "preserve."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Heat-mapping is introduced early ("technique she had developed… using thermal sensors"), demonstrated in the eastern-wing beat ("sensor held before her like a divining rod, reading the temperature"), drives the performance-hall climax ("thermal readings here were unlike anything… the air pulsed with warmth"), and is present in the final image ("began her work in earnest, mapping the music"). The method shapes three beats and the ending; its mechanics (sensor, thermal fingerprints, layered histories) constrain her approach and charge the closure. All three gates; irreplaceable; strong beat involvement and closure linkage. Lacks a single on-page cost tied to the method's limits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is anchored early (title, opening image), supplies the laboratory context for heat-mapping (eastern wing, performance hall), and its thermal properties ("frost covered the windows… the air pulsed with warmth") directly enable the climactic revelation. The setting is named in the final line ("In the winterglass conservatory… Elara began her work in earnest"). All three gates; the conservatory's architecture and residual warmth are causally active. Strong integration; specificity (frosted panes, frozen ferns, bay windows) enriches without overwhelming. No single moment where the conservatory constrains a difficult choice under competing pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after noise becomes impossible" (the Great Quieting) is established in the opening ("that catastrophic moment when sound had become impossible everywhere") and contextualizes Elara's method and the conservatory's silence. The post-sound world shapes every beat implicitly (tuning fork silent, sign language, thermal residue), yet time itself does not tighten a decision or impose a deadline. Present in setup and atmosphere throughout; no middle or closure beat where the timeframe's pressure narrows options. Two of three gates (setup, thematic presence); lacks escalation linkage. The world-rule is indispensable to premise but does not function as a tactical constraint on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to translate silence into music" is stated explicitly ("she had come here to translate silence into music") and demonstrated through heat-mapping across the eastern wing and performance hall. The desire drives her approach to the avoided space and the final realization ("she had succeeded—not by recreating sound, but by learning to hear with different senses"). Present in setup (implied by method), middle (avoidance overcome), and closure (claim of success). However, the motivation is more told than dramatized under friction; no on-page moment forces a choice between translation and another competing want. All three gates; declarative rather than conflicted; lacks visible trade-off cost.</comment>
