<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and her emotional trajectory follows a coherent arc from dutiful cataloguer to truth-seeker. However, the character work relies heavily on summary rather than scene-level contradiction—her "nervously confident" attribute is told rather than enacted in pressure moments, and the final stance (rising with determined stride) arrives without a visible on-page struggle between competing impulses. The great-grandmother exists only in reflection, never testing Maren's resolve through dramatized cost. Interior voice shows some specificity (the nail habit, ink-stained fingers) but emotional embodiment defaults to label-patterns ("spongey dread," "trembling hands") rather than contradictory physical states under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a causal lens: Maren gains archive access → decodes journals → discovers erasure → decides to act. Orientation anchors arrive within the first third (map librarian, climate institute basement, seventeen years). The closure unit is Charged Poise: Maren rises with intent to publish, options crystallized (expose truth vs. perpetuate silence), and the cost is felt (institutional retaliation, continuation of exile). However, the tightening occurs entirely off-page—senior researchers "exchange glances," journals "yield," predictions "validate"—so causality is recounted rather than dramatized. The Cost Proof Test shows conceptual price (career risk, institutional shame) but no on-page sentence makes that cost visceral at the ending beat; the wind "screaming" charges atmosphere but does not reweight her internal calculus in a new way.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting elements (basement archives, coastal cliffs station, shipwrecked journals) are purposefully integrated and the copper nail functions as micro-setting, returned with reweighted meaning at closure. Sensory detail is selective (verdigris smell, waterlogged pages, wind howling) and filtered through Maren's archival priorities. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The experimental weather station pressures the stakes thematically but does not constrain an on-page choice—Maren never visits it, uses its equipment, or navigates its layout under pressure. The 9+ gate (environment/object constrains choice or charges final image) is narrowly missed: the nail is held and reweighted but does not alter her tactics; the wind charges the final line but arrives as external atmosphere rather than a constraint she must work around.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (honor ancestor's erasure vs. risk career) is signaled early and coheres under a causal lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when journals reveal the predictions were correct and the exile was institutional suppression, raising the moral cost of silence. However, escalation is entirely summarized: "senior researchers exchanged glances," "journals yielded," "jet stream's shift validated." No on-page reversal tests Maren's commitment—she encounters no blocking move, no resource constraint, no conflicting loyalty that forces a trade-off in scene. Agency is present (she decides to rise and act) but the decision arrives without visible friction or a price paid on the page; the alternative (perpetuate silence) is named but not dramatized as a live temptation. The cost is conceptual (institutional shame, career risk) but not legible in a specific forfeiture or action at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (suppressed knowledge, intergenerational legacy, cost of truth-telling) emerges organically from the great-grandmother's exile and Maren's archive work. The copper nail and coded stanzas function as purposeful motifs that deepen rather than decorate. Subtext operates in the senior researchers' exchanged glances and the nail's verdigris presence. The ending offers a resonant image (wind screaming, Maren rising) that reweights the opening's tethered life without stating a moral. However, thematic language edges toward prompt-echo: "reversible exile," "palimpsest of suppressed knowledge," "intergenerational tragedy" read as thesis statements rather than discoveries. The phrase "the maps themselves were trying to tell her something she had been trained not to hear" in the opening paragraphs borders on Thematic Echo, though it precedes rather than replaces the ending's pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Maren throughout, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (cartographic shorthand, ink-stained focus) and diction mostly fits an archivist's idiom. Psychic distance modulates intentionally, pulling close for the nail's warmth and pulling back for institutional history. However, register drifts into academic abstractions ("posthumous exile," "palimpsest of suppressed knowledge," "intergenerational tragedy") that feel more like authorial thesis than Maren's interior lexicon under pressure. The final line's "nervously confident stride of someone who had finally found the map she had been searching for" tells rather than enacts the trait through syntax or gesture. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood") cluster in key beats without voice-motivated purpose. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and opening/closing images frame the arc purposefully. Grammar and tense remain consistent. However, multiple line-level patterns drain momentum: paraphrase loops recur (e.g., "the nail's presence had driven her toward maps, toward the hope that geography might explain" immediately followed by "Now, at thirty-four, she finally had access"), template cadence appears in the journal-decoding sequence ("The journals were… but Maren had… and the coded stanzas yielded"), and filter-verb stacks ("understood," "thought," "felt") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Stock metaphors populate key moments: "spongey dread," "voices deliberately silenced," "screaming through the gaps." The closure beat—"rose from her chair with the nervously confident stride"—tells rather than shows the stance shift. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −0.8 for loops and template cadence distributed across beats, escalated to −1.2 because filter verbs cluster in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of map librarian + ancestral exile + coded weather data offers a specific, non-generic premise. The copper-nail-as-vow and coded-stanzas details feel intentional rather than ornamental. However, the core arc (discover suppressed female scientist, choose truth over career safety) follows a widely used template without a transformative twist—the great-grandmother's correctness is validated externally (jet stream shift) rather than through a complicating irony or moral ambiguity. Proximity check flags "the maps themselves were trying to tell her something" as close to common phrasing about hidden meaning. The ending's stance (rise to expose truth) is earnest but predictable; no fresh inflection in the final image reweights prior particulars in an unexpected way. The story commits fully to its premise but does not subvert or deepen genre conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Maren (idealistic map librarian) is present throughout and her archive work frames the investigation. Her choice to decode journals and her final decision to rise and act are key turns. However, many pivotal beats are summarized rather than enacted: gaining permissions, decoding stanzas, deciding to publish all occur off-stage or in summary. She remains an observer in most beats; her final choice is told ("rose from her chair") rather than shown through a specific gesture or forfeiture. Early signal +0.7, two beats (journal discovery, final stance) +0.9, but heavy summary-only execution −0.8, swappability (another archivist could function similarly) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The copper nail appears in three beats: initial description/habit (first third), mentioned as family vow (middle), and held warm at closure. It carries thematic weight (proof someone remembered) and reweights meaning at the end. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Maren never uses it, risks losing it, or navigates a door/lock/conflict where its physical presence matters. The nail functions as lyric anchor rather than causal lever. Early signal +0.7, three mentions across beats +1.4, closure presence +0.7, but ornamental use (held, not wielded) −0.7, no causal pressure −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Reversible exile (erasure of contributions that can be restored through acknowledgment) is explained mid-story and shapes the thematic stakes—Maren can reverse the erasure by publishing. The concept defines her goal and the institution's opposing interest. It is signaled by the 40% mark, appears in the journal-decoding sequence, and frames the final choice. However, it functions more as thematic label than on-page constraint; the mechanics of reversal (publish findings vs. remain silent) are declared but not tested through a complication or cost. Setup present +0.6, beats (journals, final stance) +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, but late first mention (mid-story) −0.3, ornamental framing −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Nervously confident" is named twice: Maren's demeanor when seeking permissions and her stride at closure. It does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost—she gains permissions off-page, and the final stride is told rather than enacted through hesitation/push syntax or a specific gesture that shows the contradiction. The trait exists as label rather than embodied choice. Present in two mentions +0.4, but label-only execution −0.6, no causal pressure −0.5, summary-only −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The action "question" drives the inciting move: Maren questions senior researchers, their glances confirm conspiracy, she pivots to journals. It reappears thematically ("the central question") and implicitly at closure (will she speak truth?). The question redefines options by confirming records are guarded, not lost. However, the questioning scene is summarized in one sentence; the researchers' response is gesture-only. Early signal +0.7, two beats (researchers, implicit at end) +0.9, causal pressure (redirects to journals) +0.8, but summary-only execution −0.6, swappability (another inquiry method would work) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Coded stanzas in shipwrecked journals appear at the 50% mark and occupy the decoding sequence. The method is specific (coded stanzas, cartographic shorthand) and its mechanics matter: Maren's career skill (deciphering shorthand) enables success. The journals reveal the suppressed predictions, a key causal turn. However, the method is introduced late and the decoding itself is summarized ("yielded to her patient investigation"). Late introduction −0.4, one strong beat (journal revelation) +0.4, causal pressure +0.8, specificity +0.5, but summary-only execution −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The experimental weather station is named early, provides historical context (great-grandmother worked there), and returns thematically (jet stream shift validates predictions). It never constrains a choice or supplies a resource Maren uses—she remains in the basement archives throughout; the station exists in backstory and as thematic symbol. Early mention +0.6, thematic recurrence +0.3, but no on-page pressure −0.8, postcard function −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The jet stream shift is introduced in paragraph one ("six months ago") and returns at closure ("the shifted jet stream screaming"). It motivates the story (station became data hub, validates great-grandmother's predictions) and charges the final image. However, it does not tighten Maren's decisions or create a deadline—her archive work proceeds without time pressure. The timeframe is context rather than clock. Early signal +0.7, closure presence +0.7, causal motivation +0.5, but no tactical pressure −0.8, vague tracking −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation to honor the ancestor is signaled early (copper nail, family vow) and drives every major choice: seeking permissions, decoding journals, deciding to publish. It appears in three beats and frames closure. However, the motivation is more stated than conflicted—no on-page friction tests whether personal safety, career, or another loyalty might outweigh ancestral duty. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but told-only friction (institutional opposition named, not dramatized) −0.6, no visible trade-off cost −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Tone is established early ("spongey dread," "shameful anonymity") and recurs throughout (verdigris earth, waterlogged crumbling pages, wind howling/screaming). It modulates with pressure: dread "seeps through optimism" at the journal revelation and intensifies at closure (wind screaming). The final image channels tone purposefully. However, "spongey dread" itself is an unusual, somewhat forced collocation that appears twice as a label rather than emerging from scene texture. Early signal +0.7, sustained across beats +1.0, closure charge +1.0, modulation under pressure +0.5, but label-only mentions −0.6, minor forced diction −0.4.</comment>
