<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is consistent and specific—a solitary scholar driven by historical truth against official narrative. Interior contradiction appears in the tension between rational method and acknowledged obsession ("my neighbors think I am mad…but my rational rebellion is not madness, it is method"). However, the piece leans heavily on reflective interiority without embodied emotion or micro-choices that alter present tactics; the narrator describes past recovery work and future cataloging but makes no on-page decision under pressure. The final paragraph reaffirms an existing stance rather than earning a shift through dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sedimentary evidence and competing narratives but lacks a decisive on-page change or meaningful tightening. Closure reads as thematic restatement ("at least one person refused the easy story") rather than Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost—the narrator's solitary work continues unchanged, and no live option is foreclosed. Orientation is clear early (flooded harbor lab, post-plague scholar). The chronometer cog and sediment metaphor recur but do not pivot the narrator's stance or alter present options; the ending summarizes commitment rather than crystallizing new pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sunken harbor setting is vivid and purposeful: coral-encrusted streets, silt-filled plazas, water-stained walls with charcoal marks establish a concrete, post-catastrophe world. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the scholar's archaeological lens. The chronometer cog and sediment function as micro-setting elements that anchor the thematic work. However, environment does not constrain a present choice or charge the final image with new pressure—it remains atmospheric rather than tactically essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving truth against official narrative. The piece establishes intellectual opposition but lacks on-page escalation or a turn that narrows options. The chronometer discovery and sediment cataloging are ongoing work, not pressure points that force a trade-off. No reversal or deepening alters the narrator's stance; the final paragraph reaffirms existing resolve without visible cost—"someone will find these artifacts someday" reads as hope, not forfeiture. The accumulative lens permits gradual deepening, but here the ending does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—truth preservation versus convenient narrative—emerges organically from the scholar's work and the sedimentary metaphor. The chronometer and "sedimentary layers of story" image recur with purposeful weight, and the piece resists simplistic moral. Subtext operates in the phrase "rational rebellion" and the neighbors' judgment. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("truth is worth preserving") rather than letting the image speak; the resonance is earned but slightly over-articulated, reducing the non-literal charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person voice is controlled, scholarly, and distinct: formal register ("the particular kind of decay that follows when people flee"), careful syntax, and perceptual signature (noticing "charcoal marks where officials had recorded tide schedules"). Psychic distance remains stable. Diction matches the narrator's intellectual lens throughout. No dialogue present. The prose occasionally leans into abstraction ("the sedimentary layers of story…compress into a single flat stone") that edges toward over-articulation, but the voice remains consistent and purposeful under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high; sentences advance character and theme. However, the piece repeats the sedimentary-layer metaphor four times without evolving its meaning ("sedimentary layers," "sediment," "sedimentary layers of story," "sedimentary layers compress"), crossing into conceptual loop. The final paragraph contains mild scaffold: "but I work anyway, because…" and "Someone will find these artifacts someday, and when they do, they will know…" reads as summary rather than image. No major grammar issues, and the prose is clear, but the closure beat lacks propulsive concision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The flooded-city archaeologist frame and competing-narratives concept offer a fresh angle on historiography and institutional failure. The chronometer cog as a motif of precision and the sediment metaphor are specific and well-chosen. However, the broader arc—solitary scholar resisting official narrative—is familiar, and the piece does not transform it through a non-obvious turn or moral calculus. The ending reaffirms the premise rather than surprising or deepening it. Emotional specificity is present, but the frame remains within recognizable territory without bold structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "wannabe philosopher living in a sewer" (flooded harbor lab) is present throughout and frames the narrator's isolation and intellectual mission. However, no on-page choice by this character creates a key turn—reflection dominates, and the ending reaffirms rather than alters stance. The character's setup and thematic presence are clear, but the lack of decision-driven escalation limits integration. Present in closure (self-description continues), but without causal force there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The chronometer cog appears in two beats: discovery/description on the workbench and symbolic interpretation as precision instrument. It recurs in the final paragraph ("the cog will join my collection") with reweighted meaning tied to preservation. However, the object is never handled or used in a way that alters tactics—it remains illustrative rather than causal. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development as choice-driver is absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Competing narratives (official vs. sedimentary evidence) shape the dominant stake and the narrator's intellectual mission. The concept is signaled early ("official narratives…have become dangerously simple") and structures the entire reflective arc. It does not change present options on the page—no live choice between narratives occurs—but it drives the narrator's ongoing work and charges the final image of future discovery. Functional across setup, development, and closure, but without on-page tactical pivot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Rationally rebellious" is articulated explicitly ("my rational rebellion is not madness, it is method") and illustrated through the narrator's refusal of the "easy story." However, the trait remains label-level; no on-page action demonstrates a cost or tradeoff between rationality and rebellion. The attribute colors voice and theme but does not constrain a choice or enable a visible turn. Present in closure as self-description but without dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Agonize" appears twice: "I agonize over this evidence" and "Perhaps he too agonized over the competing narratives." The action frames intellectual struggle and drives the narrator's commitment to truth-seeking. However, it is told rather than dramatized—no on-page scene shows the narrator wrestling with a specific dilemma or paying a visible cost for this agonizing. The action shapes motivation and tone but does not redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Through sedimentary layers" is signaled early and operationalized throughout: the narrator descends through layers, recovers artifacts from silt, and interprets "sedimentary layers of story." The method structures both literal archaeology and metaphorical historiography. It shapes attempts (cataloging, piecing together documents) and charges the final image (future scholars finding traces). Mechanics matter, though the method does not pivot present tactics. Present in setup, development, and closure with causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The sunken city ruins are vividly established (coral-encrusted streets, silt-filled plazas, harbormaster's office lab) and provide the narrator's isolation, resource base (recovered artifacts), and thematic anchor (decay and preservation). The setting pressures the narrator's solitary stance and supplies the chronometer and documents. It does not alter tactics within this single reflective scene but shapes the entire premise and charges the closure image of future discovery. Essential across setup, development, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the plague ends" anchors the timeframe and motivates the narrator's historical investigation. The plague's aftermath (depopulation, official narrative) creates the conditions for the scholar's work. However, time does not tighten on-page decisions—no clock or urgency alters tactics within this reflective window. The timeframe is consistent and purposeful but passive, framing rather than pressuring the action. Present in setup and referenced at closure but without tactical force.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To preserve ancient methods" (precision, evidence, reason) is articulated early and structures the narrator's mission. The desire is dramatized through artifact recovery and the chronometer's symbolic weight ("trust the machinery of reason"). Friction appears between the narrator's commitment and neighbors' judgment, and between truth-seeking and institutional narrative. However, no on-page choice tests this motivation with visible cost—reflection dominates. Present in setup, development, and closure, shaping stance but not pivoting tactics.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Abrasive calm" is coherent throughout: formal, measured prose ("my name does not matter; what matters is my work") paired with pointed critique of authority ("the engineers who designed the levees that failed"). Tone modulates slightly—sharper when describing official narrative, reflective when handling the cog—but remains controlled. The final paragraph sustains this register ("I calm myself with the thought"). Tone charges theme but does not intensify under pressure or shift at closure, remaining static within its established range.</comment>
