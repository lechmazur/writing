<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aldric's gift of "borrowed memories" is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied choice under pressure. The final revelation—mother's abandonment—arrives via exposition rather than forcing a live decision with visible cost. The stranger remains a cipher whose motivations are told rather than discovered through pressure-tested inference. Interiority leans heavily on abstract phrasing ("witnessed isolation," "peculiar gift") without specific embodiment or character-particular texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The closure unit lands: Aldric recognizes the boutonnière as his mother's gesture and decides to write to the address, a Decisive Change that forecloses his prior isolation. However, the boutonnière's hidden note appears conveniently late without prior setup, and the causal chain relies on retrospective explanation rather than dramatized discovery. Orientation is clear early (lighthouse keeper, dock, twilight). The lens reads Causal but the key turn is told via memory rather than present-scene pressure, limiting cost legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The opal dock and mist establish atmosphere effectively, and the lighthouse functions as more than backdrop—it frames Aldric's role and serves thematically at closure ("gathering place for lost things"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (violet-grey trading, golden beacon eye), though the boutonnière's wax-paper preservation and hidden note are described rather than handled in action. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the stranger's gesture—is signaled early, but escalation occurs via flashback revelation rather than present-scene pressure that narrows options. No reversal tests Aldric's commitment; the solution arrives through a discovered note rather than investigative cost or trade-off. The stranger's disappearance and Aldric's investigation method ("observing gaps") are asserted without dramatized friction or failure that would raise stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of connection across absence and the language of unspoken gestures emerges organically from the Edelweiss and lighthouse imagery. The final paragraph risks overt statement ("some gestures need no words") but the transformation of "witnessed isolation" into gentler connection carries weight. The lighthouse-as-gathering-place metaphor is earned by prior particulars, though the mother's reconciliation arrives too neatly without ambiguity or moral friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature ("borrowed memories settling into his bones like tide marks"). However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a lighthouse keeper's interior lexicon ("epistemological," "hermeneutic" feel without those exact words—"resisted understanding like a puzzle missing its essential piece"). Psychic distance is controlled, though the retrospective omniscience about the mother's regret ("dying woman who had spent decades regretting") exceeds what Aldric could infer from a note alone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and opening/closing lines anchor well, but figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching: "sleeping moon," "golden eye blinking," "tide marks on stone," "sea of uncertainty" cluster without space. The boutonnière discovery—"tiny folded paper concealed among the dried petals"—strains credulity (Aldric held it multiple times before noticing). Template cadence appears in the second paragraph: "What made this visitor different was... the way his eyes... and the sudden, urgent gesture..." A paraphrase loop occurs between "borrowing memories" explanation in paragraph one and "borrowed memories" method in paragraph two, restating without advancing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse keeper with supernatural memory and the reconciliation-object premise feel familiar; the Edelweiss traveling through intermediaries to reach the abandoned son adds specificity but does not transform the core template. The "observing gaps" investigation method is asserted rather than demonstrated through specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking is minimal; the story opts for tidy emotional resolution rather than ambiguity or sustained cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Aldric's eccentricity is asserted ("considered him part of the landscape, eccentric") but his keeper role is largely passive observation. His key choice—to write to the address—occurs in the final paragraph as stated intention rather than dramatized act. Present in setup, functional in closure intention, but no middle development constrains or enables a choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The Edelweiss appears in three beats: initial receipt, texture check on dock, and revelation of hidden note. Its alpine origin contrasts with maritime setting, and it carries the mother's reconciliation gesture. The hidden note's late discovery feels convenient but reweights the stranger's visit. Shapes setup and closure, with minimal middle development; the object's specific properties (dried, preserved in wax paper) enable the plot turn.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Borrowed memories" is asserted as Aldric's gift but never demonstrated on the page through specific memory-transfer or decision shaped by it. He attempts to "trace the collector's path backward through borrowed memories" but fails, then the resolution comes via physical note rather than supernatural means. The concept is ornamental rather than causal; the story would function identically if Aldric were simply observant.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" describes the mist's advance and implicitly the mother's delayed reconciliation, but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The attribute modulates tone without tactical pressure. Present thematically but functionally replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Investigate" is stated ("Aldric had investigated strangers' behaviors before") and frames his stance on the dock, but the actual investigation—attempting borrowed-memory trace, then finding the note—occurs in summary. The stranger's footprints vanishing is observed but not explored. The action seeds the plot but major turns trace to discovery rather than investigation process.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Observing gaps" is explicitly named as Aldric's method ("by observing gaps, by studying what should have been present but was conspicuously absent"), demonstrated once with the vanished footprints, but the key revelation comes from the hidden note rather than gap-observation. The method is asserted more than it shapes attempts or alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The opal dock frames the scene spatially and provides the locus for Aldric's investigation. The mist swallowing the stranger's footprints creates mystery. The dock's crescent shape ("curved like a sleeping moon") charges imagery but does not constrain choices. Present in setup and closure, modest middle development through the footprint observation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Nautical twilight" establishes atmospheric timing at the opening and the lighthouse beacon activates, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The three-day gap since the stranger's visit is noted but not tracked as pressure. Time is more scenic than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Aldric's desire to decode the gesture is stated and frames his dock vigil, drives his attempt to trace the stranger, and culminates in recognition and intention to write. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized through conflicting impulses; no friction between wanting to know and fearing the answer. Present across setup, middle, and closure but lacks embodied cost during pursuit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Witnessed isolation" is established through Aldric's nineteen-year tenure and "familiar chill," modulates at closure to "something gentler—a connection," and the lighthouse becomes "a gathering place for lost things." The tone is coherent and charges the final image, though the transformation arrives via epiphany rather than pressure. Strong thematic payoff with modest middle development.</comment>
