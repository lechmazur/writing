<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maruk's frugality and scholarly nature are established early, but his interiority remains largely observational rather than contradictory under pressure. The discovery sequence shows methodical dedication but lacks embodied emotional conflict—his "trembling hands" at the climax arrives without prior physical manifestation of doubt or fear. The final choice to renew the covenant feels inevitable from his character but lacks a visible cost or foreclosed path; he simply continues his post with a secret, which reads more as Earned Stasis than a decision that alters his stance with felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens: Maruk's archive discovery motivates the ritual, which renews the covenant and ensures the new regime's favor. Orientation anchors (astronomer, palace, regime transition) arrive promptly. The closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (the covenant renewed, the palace at peace), but the cost remains abstract—Maruk "said nothing" and keeps the secret, yet no tactical option is visibly foreclosed and no price paid beyond continued silence. The "unexpected favor" for the new rulers is told outcome rather than dramatized consequence, weakening the felt weight of the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The palace observatory, rooftop, archives, and magic-square tile arrangement provide concrete spatial anchors. The candle arrangement mirroring the tile's pattern and the "subsonic frequency" of the tiles underfoot offer purposeful sensory detail that constrains the ritual action. The "twilight atmosphere" and "dusky accord" create consistent tonal texture. The setting does not materially constrain a difficult choice—Maruk's access to archives and observatory is uncontested—but the tile pattern and candlelight do charge the final ritual image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restore the forgotten covenant to preserve the city's prosperity) is signaled by mid-story. The discovery of the encrypted message provides one meaningful tightening: Maruk learns the covenant was real and abandoned through oversight. However, the climax lacks on-page opposition or cost—no resource scarcity, no rival claim to the observatory, no risk of failure in the ritual itself. The new regime's arrival at dawn creates a time window but never tests Maruk's commitment; he completes the ritual unopposed and continues his work unchanged, which reads as deepening knowledge without a turn that narrows his options or forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of "encrypted devotion" and the irony of scholarly oversight (astronomers who "grew so frugal with meaning" they forgot their purpose) emerges organically from Maruk's discovery. The final image—palace peace, closer stars, the tile "once more an ordinary mathematical curiosity"—offers a resonant answer to the central question of what happens when forgotten pacts are remembered. The piece resists overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph's "some devotions are best encrypted" edges toward thematic summary, and the new rulers' "unexpected favor from forces they could not name" tells the thematic payoff rather than showing a charged consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; Maruk's perceptual signature (counting supplies "as carefully as he counted the stars," finding "grim satisfaction" in frugal oil consumption) is character-specific. Diction is controlled and period-appropriate ("sky-readers," "covenant of devotion"). One artifact: "脚步声" (Chinese characters for "footsteps") disrupts the established voice and setting without explanation or pattern, likely a generation error. The prose modulates between scholarly observation and the ritual's charged atmosphere, though the final paragraph's narratorial certainty ("they would note...their reign would proceed") overreaches what Maruk can plausibly know in the moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high in the archive-discovery sequence. "Diagrams that mapped the tile's numeric patterns to star positions and palace corridors alike" carries efficient specificity. However, paraphrase loops appear: "encrypted devotion" recurs in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure; "schematic representations" is repeated within one beat. Template cadence in the opening: "The astronomer Maruk counted...for he had learned...The palace where he had served...Yet Maruk remained, for the rooftop..." cycles identical causal stems. The Chinese-character artifact "脚步声" breaks clarity. Figurative language ("whisper of deeper order," "sealed not with blood or seal but with mathematical poetry") occasionally stacks without advancing the beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—astronomer discovers that his predecessors' mathematical curio was an encrypted pact ensuring prosperity—offers a fresh synthesis of palace intrigue, ancient astronomy, and liminal-regime tension. The magic square as encryption key and the detail of "subsonic frequency" tiles add specificity. However, the emotional arc (discovery → realization → ritual renewal) follows a familiar scholar-uncovers-secret template without a bold turn. The "pattern-consciousness" contacted at the climax remains vague ("neither god nor demon but something older"), which dulls the conceptual payoff. The piece commits fully to its premise but does not transform the scholar-magician frame through lived cost or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maruk's frugality shapes his endurance (counting supplies, minimal oil use) and his methodical archive work, grounding two distinct beats. His choices—staying in the palace, researching the tile, performing the ritual—are present but largely unopposed, reducing causal pressure. He does not face a moment where frugality constrains a high-stakes decision or forces a trade-off. Present in closure (still at his post, supplies counted) but the trait does not reweight the ending image with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tile appears in three beats: initial possession (curio passed down), archive discovery (mapping tile numbers to star positions and ritual words), and ritual climax (candles arranged to mirror the tile's pattern). Its numeric structure enables the encrypted incantation and charges the final action. Removing the tile would collapse the story's central mechanism. However, the tile itself does not return with reweighted meaning in the closure—it becomes "once more an ordinary mathematical curiosity," a return to baseline rather than a charged reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Encrypted devotion is the story's conceptual spine: the love poem encrypted in the magic square, the covenant forgotten through "scholarly oversight," and Maruk's renewal of the pact. It shapes the dominant stake (restore the covenant) and the ironic theme (measurement-focused astronomers lost the meaning). Present in the climax (Maruk speaks the incantation, the presence honors the devotion) and the final image (devotions "best encrypted"). The concept constrains Maruk's tactics (he must decode the archive schematics, perform the ritual) and charges the ending, though the cost remains abstract rather than a visible on-page price.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Empirically ironic" is articulated mid-story as a realization ("the empirical irony...settled into Maruk's bones") but functions as thematic label rather than trait that constrains action. The irony (astronomers abandoned the covenant through focus on measurement alone) enriches backstory but does not alter Maruk's on-page choices—he does not face a moment where empirical rigor conflicts with mystical practice or forces a visible trade-off. Present as theme, not as attribute that enables or costs.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Uncloak" is the story's climactic action: "to uncloak what had been hidden in plain sight for centuries." The ritual (candles, incantation, subsonic tiles) dramatizes the uncloaking and brings the presence into contact. The action redefines the palace's future (peace, favor for the new regime) and Maruk's stance (keeper of the renewed covenant). However, the uncloaking itself faces no resistance or failure risk; it succeeds immediately upon execution, reducing dramatic cost. Present in closure and causally central, but the ease of success lowers irreplaceability—dramatic tension would survive if the action were delayed or complicated.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Schematic representations are discovered mid-story and enable the ritual: "diagrams that mapped the tile's numeric patterns to star positions and palace corridors alike" and "restored" the ancient incantation. Maruk "spent sleepless nights transcribing these representations," and on the final night he "follow[s] the schematic representations with trembling hands" to arrange candles and speak the words. The method shapes two beats (discovery and ritual) and is causally necessary—without the schematics, Maruk cannot decode the tile. However, the mechanics remain abstract (we never see a diagram's specific instruction or a translation challenge), limiting felt specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The palace setting (observatory rooftop, archives, uncertain guards, regime transition) provides atmospheric context and spatial anchors. The "tiles beneath his feet" resonate during the ritual, adding a charged physical detail. However, the setting does not constrain Maruk's choices—he has uncontested access to archives and observatory, and the new regime's arrival at dawn creates a time window but no on-page pressure or resource scarcity. The palace's "unexpected favor" under the new regime is told outcome rather than dramatized tactic shift. Present across all beats but functions more as backdrop than crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "between regimes" is signaled early ("uncertain twilight," guards "who no longer knew whom they served") and creates the story's urgency: Maruk works "on the final night before the new regime's representatives would arrive." The liminal moment (old order crumbled, new powers gathering) charges the ritual's stakes—renewing the covenant before the transition completes. Time tightens the climax (Maruk ascends "on the final night," the rulers arrive "at dawn") and shapes the ending (the new regime benefits from the renewed pact). However, the deadline is soft—no on-page consequence dramatizes what would happen if Maruk missed the window, reducing felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Maruk's motivation to restore the covenant is clear by mid-story ("wondered if the ancients had encoded more," realizes "the astronomers...had accidentally abandoned their duties") and drives the climax (he performs the ritual to renew the pact). However, the motivation is more intellectual curiosity and scholarly duty than conflicted desire—Maruk faces no internal friction between wants (e.g., safety under the new regime vs. loyalty to the covenant) or cost (e.g., risking his post vs. ignoring the discovery). The final image shows him continuing his work unchanged, which reads as fulfillment without visible sacrifice or foreclosed alternative.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" is embodied in the "uncertain twilight" of the opening, the "twilight atmosphere of the transitional moment" at the ritual, and the closure's "gentle harmony—a dusky accord between what is known and what remains beyond knowing." The tone modulates from initial uncertainty (regime change, guards who "no longer knew whom they served") to the ritual's charged calm to the final image's peace and secrecy. The tone charges the ending by framing the covenant's renewal as reconciliation rather than conquest. Coherent across turns and purposefully quiet, though the final paragraph's explanatory certainty ("they would note...their reign would proceed") drifts slightly toward omniscient summary.</comment>
