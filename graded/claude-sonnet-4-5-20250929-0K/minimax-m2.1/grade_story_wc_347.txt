<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied—"reluctant heart stirred against her will" feels lived rather than labeled. Her inheritance of the caretaker role through "a transfer of weight" grounds motivation in physical constraint. Internal contradiction operates cleanly: she resents the duty yet moves with practiced expertise, and the final choice to guide the travelers emerges from this tension with visible cost (accepting the burden she never wanted). Minor slip: the grandmother's teaching method ("leaving impressions without touching") reads slightly abstract in context, though it's anchored to foot-placement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (cliffside orchard, mechanical birds, labyrinth below) and the causal spine holds under a Causal lens: blueprint discovery → nut placement → path opens. The closure delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost—Mira commits to the caretaker role she resisted, opening the hidden stairs and rising to guide the travelers. The "stone floor shuddered… began to assemble" moment crystallizes the transformation with tactile immediacy. One hairline slip: the blueprint's "three winters" backstory feels slightly unmotivated (why locked away?), but it doesn't break the through-line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cliffside path, white stone labyrinth, and mechanical birds create a vivid micro-geography that constrains movement—Mira's boots find purchase "where the stone had worn smooth from generations," grounding her expertise in erosion. The nut's textured surface ("offhandedly exact in its geography") and the stone depression shape the climactic choice. Sensory selection stays sharp: brass eyes catching light, frost threat, warm darkness of the opened stairway. The orchard itself reads more symbolic than spatial, slightly reducing total integration, but the labyrinth's texture-and-temperature navigation (each stone "a different texture, a different temperature, a different age") charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue the lost travelers before frost locks the mechanism) signals early and tightens through the birds' escalating cries and Mira's descent. The nut placement is a clear protagonist-driven choice with visible cost: she accepts the inherited duty and opens herself to ongoing caretaking ("Mira rose to guide the travelers home"). One meaningful tightening occurs when she reaches the central plaza "just as the first stars appeared," narrowing the window. The travelers remain largely abstract—a woman and crying child heard but not encountered—which slightly softens emotional urgency, but the mechanical and temporal pressures cohere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of inherited burden and reluctant duty emerges organically from the orchard-as-wound opening image and Mira's embodied resistance. The heartseed functions as both key and metaphor without overt statement: unlocking the path literalizes accepting responsibility. The final image—"stairs that descended into warm darkness"—reweights the curse as generative passage rather than trap, and "guide the travelers home" extends the duty forward with quiet resonance. The "offhandedly exact" phrase recurs purposefully (nut's geography, Mira's memory of the pattern), charging specificity as both gift and constraint. No overt moralizing; the question of chosen versus inherited obligation lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mira with a distinct perceptual signature: she notices texture, weight, and the "method her grandmother had taught her" through embodied practice. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the nut examination, pulling back slightly for the labyrinth overview. Diction stays consistent ("offhandedly exact," "reluctant heart") with a slightly elevated, myth-inflected register that fits the cursed-ground premise. The prose compresses under pressure: "shuddered once, twice, then began to assemble" accelerates rhythm at the closure beat. One minor note: "flesh-and-blood intruders" in paragraph two reads slightly external to Mira's established idiom, a fleeting register bump that doesn't recur.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully—long, winding opener establishes mood, then tightens during descent and nut placement. Information density is high: most lines advance setting, character knowledge, or pressure. The "offhandedly exact" phrase recurs three times (nut, memory, initial description) within ~900 words, edging toward decorative in the second mention but justified by thematic weight. Minor template cadence in paragraph four: "She moved… her boots… The birds noticed… they did not approach. The curse had made…" runs four consecutive subject-verb stems, slightly flattening propulsion. No major loops or muddy metaphors; the "orchard clung… like a wound" opener is vivid and specific. Clarity remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cursed-orchard premise is familiar, but the story earns freshness through specific synthesis: mechanical birds as exhausting herders (not killers), the blueprint-as-forgotten-key, and the heartseed's tactile geography matching stone depressions. "Leaving impressions without touching" offers a non-obvious caretaker ability, though it remains slightly underexplored on the page. The reluctant-inheritor frame is well-worn, but Mira's embodied resistance (not wanting vs. doing with practiced expertise) and the textural navigation (each stone "a different temperature, a different age") add particularity. The closure—stone assembling "with a grinding sound that was almost music"—transforms mechanism into voice, a fresh inflection on the inanimate-world-responding trope.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's reluctant-caretaker role is signaled in the opening paragraph, drives her descent and blueprint consultation in the middle, and crystallizes at closure when she "rose to guide the travelers home," accepting the inherited duty. Her choices—studying the blueprint, placing the nut, descending despite reluctance—create all key turns. The reluctance itself provides internal friction ("reluctant heart stirred against her will") that charges the final commitment with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The nut appears in paragraph two (Mira turns it over, feeling its textured surface), paragraph three (revealed as key matching labyrinth stones), tucked into her belt in paragraph four, and placed in the depression in paragraph seven to trigger the climactic assembly. Its "offhandedly exact" geography is causal—the ridges match the interlocking stones—and the warm-despite-cold-wind detail seeds its generative function. Removing it would collapse the story's central mechanism and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The blueprint appears in paragraph three ("forgotten in a locked chest for three winters"), guides Mira's descent in paragraph five ("her hand trailing along the wall where the blueprint's markings corresponded to actual stones"), and becomes "uncertain" with gaps at the central plaza in paragraph six, forcing her to rely on memory. It shapes her tactics (texture-and-temperature navigation) and enables the closure, but the "forgotten for three winters" backstory feels slightly ornamental—its absence doesn't create prior conflict, so it solves a problem it didn't help complicate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "offhandedly exact" phrase modifies the nut's geography in paragraph two, Mira's memory of the pattern in paragraph six ("her offhandedly exact memory"), and implicitly underlies her navigation by texture in paragraph five. It enables her to place the nut correctly despite the blueprint's gaps, a clear causal role. However, it reads more as descriptive trait than visible constraint with cost—Mira doesn't struggle against or pay a price for this precision, and the phrase could be replaced with "precise" or "reliable" without altering structure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The "assemble" action is seeded in paragraph three (the orchard and labyrinth "built together," stones "responding to the same ancient mathematics"), anticipated in paragraph six ("forced to trust… the missing pieces felt… like spaces waiting to be filled"), and executed in the final paragraph when the stone floor "began to assemble itself around her." This is the story's climactic reversal—the mechanism activating, the path opening—and it would be impossible to deliver the closure (Mira guiding travelers through the hidden stairs) without this exact action. The grinding-sound-as-music detail charges it with additional resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The method is introduced in paragraph four ("leaving impressions without touching… moving through the world as silently as a thought") and explained as why the curse grants her family passage. It's thematically resonant (caretaking without ownership) and mentioned as learned skill, but it doesn't constrain a middle choice or shape her tactics on the page—Mira walks the path and places the nut through ordinary physical action. The method enables her access but remains largely decorative, not tested or varied under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth with mechanical birds is established in paragraph one, the birds' herding behavior and cry-pattern explained in paragraph two, and their escalating cries create the time pressure in paragraph six ("the frost was coming, and the birds knew"). The labyrinth's spiral structure and texture-based navigation constrain Mira's descent in paragraph five, and the central plaza's stone depression is the locus of closure. The setting supplies the core obstacle (lost travelers, exhausting birds) and the mechanism (stone assembly) that the protagonist must navigate, making it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The frost deadline is introduced in paragraph three ("before the night frost formed and froze the mechanism"), tracked through "the last light" and "dying light" in paragraphs one and four, "the first stars appeared" in paragraph six, and the birds' awareness that "frozen metal meant nothing to their programmed minds" in paragraph six. This tightens Mira's descent and quickens the final placement, altering her tactics (she must act now). The timeframe is not continuously on-page like a ticking clock, but its presence shapes urgency at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira's desire to save the travelers is dramatized through her "reluctant heart stirred against her will" in paragraph five when she hears the crying child, conflicts with her resistance to the inherited duty throughout, and crystallizes in the final line when she "rose to guide the travelers home." The motivation is framed as unwanted yet unavoidable, creating internal friction. The cost is visible: accepting this rescue commits her to ongoing caretaking. The travelers themselves remain abstract (heard, not seen), slightly softening immediacy, but the pull between reluctance and compassion charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tone blends beauty (orchard on cliffside, brass birds catching light, stone assembling "almost music") with unease (cursed ground, wound imagery, exhausting mechanical herders, "reluctant" and "dread" framing inheritance). The prose carries a slightly elevated, myth-inflected register that sustains "graceless beauty"—specific and textured but never prettified or sentimental. Under pressure (paragraph six, frost threat), the tone tightens without breaking its established texture. The final image—"warm darkness" and the grinding-as-voice moment—fuses the mechanical and the organic, reinforcing the graceless-beauty charge through the closure beat.</comment>
