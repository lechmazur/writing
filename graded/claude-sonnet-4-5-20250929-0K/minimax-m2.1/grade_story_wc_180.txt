<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation (repairing the statue, seeking reconciliation with her daughter) is clear and embodied through concrete action—grinding, fitting shards, tying the ribbon. The interiority leans heavily on abstract reflection ("accidental wisdom that arrived unbidden and unearned") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice (offering the ribbon, crossing to her daughter) is earned by prior action, but the epiphany feels declared rather than discovered through pressure. The daughter's arrival reads as coincidental rather than causally linked to Mira's work, weakening the agency test at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines. The closure—Mira crossing to her daughter with evidence of repair—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the reunion is imminent, options crystallized). Cost is legible: months of stubborn persistence, the visible brokenness she carries. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: the orchard imagery, the ribbon, the quartz eye accrue weight and shift meaning at the end. One persistent constraint (the shattered eye, the breached contract) shapes tactics throughout. The daughter's arrival at the exact moment of repair strains causality slightly but does not break the dominant lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The orchard-in-rafters setting is vivid, specific, and purposeful: fallen pears mingle with quartz shards, the decayed sweetness charges the atmosphere, and the vaulted ceiling frames the statue in the apse. The micro-setting (the bag, the tools, the shards on marble) constrains Mira's repair work concretely. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The quartz eye—both Mira's prosthetic and the statue's broken one—functions as object-as-setting, charging the final image when the repaired eye "blinks" in moonlight. The orchard recurs at closure ("constellation of leaves") to reweight the deciduous-vows motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early: repair the statue and, implicitly, the fractured relationship with her daughter. The work itself provides one meaningful tightening (fitting shard to shard, the grinding wheel's precision) that narrows options and demonstrates commitment. The daughter's arrival provides a second pressure point, crystallizing the reunion. Cost is visible: months of persistence, the physical evidence of failure she carries. Under the Accumulative lens, the intensification reads as a density increase and cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. The epiphany ("some promises could not be mended with tools alone") is told rather than dramatized, slightly weakening escalation clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (generational wisdom, persistence, repair) emerges organically from the statue work, the ribbon offering, and the orchard imagery. The deciduous-vows concept is integrated as both motif and thematic question: promises that yellow and drop away when seasons turn. The final image—Mira crossing to her daughter with "evidence of her brokenness and her repair"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. The accidental-wisdom frame is purposeful, acknowledging that insight arrives "unbidden and unearned." One small slip: the passage "by showing up, again, and again, and again" edges toward thematic echo, though it stops short of thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Mira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (quartz eye scattering light, tools as heirlooms) but the voice occasionally drifts into elevated, abstract register ("deciduous vows made manifest," "accidental wisdom that arrived unbidden") that strains the focalizer's immediate lexicon under pressure. Psychic distance shifts are intentional, moving from close sensory detail to reflective passages. Filter verbs ("she had convinced herself," "she could have sworn") are acceptable and voice-motivated. The prose rhythm modulates effectively from action (grinding, fitting) to stillness (the daughter's silhouette). Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high. Several passages show overwriting: "the space between them, carrying in her hands the evidence of her brokenness and her repair, her failures and her persistence, her accidental wisdom earned through the only way that ever mattered" stacks abstractions without fresh propulsion. The phrase "deciduous vows made manifest" and "accidental wisdom that arrived unbidden and unearned" drift into elevated register. Minor paraphrase loop: "forgotten contents" echoes "forgotten hair ribbon" within a paragraph. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. The orchard-as-constellation image is vivid and specific. Clarity remains high, but figurative density in reflective beats reduces momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard-in-rafters premise is fresh and specific, transforming the abandoned-cathedral trope through concrete physical logic (trees rooted in rafters, pears on marble). The quartz-eye doubling (Mira's prosthetic and the statue's shattered eye) is non-obvious and well-integrated. The deciduous-vows concept is particular to this story's imagery and stakes. The emotional arc (stubborn persistence leading to generational reconciliation) is familiar but grounded in verifiable craft detail (tweezers, grinding wheel). The daughter's perfectly timed arrival leans on coincidence, reducing the sense of earned inevitability. Risk-taking in imagery and setting elevates without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's choices drive all key turns: returning to the cathedral, unpacking the tools, grinding and fitting the shards, offering the ribbon, crossing to her daughter. Present in setup (first paragraph), development (repair work), and closure (the crossing). Causal pressure is strong; her persistence and skill enable the repair, and her willingness to try again makes the reunion possible. Cost is tied to her: months of carrying the ribbon, the physical labor, the vulnerability of showing up. Irreplaceability is high; the quartz-eye detail is specific to her.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ribbon appears in three distinct beats: carried "like a talisman" in paragraph one, tucked into Mira's pocket mid-repair, and tied around the statue's neck as an offering at closure. Setup is early, development involves handling and reflection, and closure repurposes it as a bridge symbol. The ribbon's meaning evolves from memory-anchor to active offering. Cost connection is present: it represents the daughter who "stopped reaching." Specificity is high (worn to "her last recital"). Drives two beats and shapes the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The deciduous-vows concept is signaled early ("promises that had burst into leaf and flower, then yellowed and dropped away") and charged at closure ("each falling leaflet a deciduous vow finally released"). It shapes stakes thematically (the breached contract, the fractured relationship) and provides a recurring image (the orchard, falling leaves). The concept constrains Mira's understanding but does not directly alter tactics on the page; its primary function is thematic resonance rather than plot pressure. Setup, lyric reprise, and closure participation are present, but the concept is more illustrative than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "feisty" trait is mentioned twice: Mira's "feisty nature refused to let the matter rest" and "her stubborn pride that made her endearingly feisty to her friends and absolutely infuriating to her enemies." It provides motivation (she persisted through three seasons) but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait is told rather than shown through dialogue or behavior under pressure. Setup is present, thematic relevance is clear, but beat involvement is minimal. Swappable with "stubborn" or "persistent" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Persist" is the engine of the story: Mira "persisted through three seasons," the daughter "persisted through her own bitter winter," and the final paragraph celebrates "showing up, again, and again, and again." Present in setup (the three-season journey), development (hours of grinding and fitting), and closure (both women's persistence converging). The action drives all major turns and defines the thematic question. Cost is tied to it: months of effort, physical labor, emotional endurance. Irreplaceability is high; the story's logic depends on sustained effort over time.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The forgotten bag contents are signaled early ("supplies for a job she had convinced herself she would never finish"), unpacked mid-story ("her father's tweezers, her own grinding wheel, the ribbon"), and used to complete the repair. Setup, development (the tools enable the work), and closure participation (the repaired eye at the ending) are all present. The mechanics matter: tweezers provide "delicate precision," the grinding wheel "still worked." Causal pressure is moderate; the tools enable the repair but could be replaced with similar instruments. One cost link: the generational heirloom (father's tweezers) ties to the wisdom theme.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The orchard-in-rafters setting is signaled in paragraph one, recurs as atmospheric detail (fallen pears, sweet decay, branches across the vaulted ceiling), and charges the closure image ("constellation of leaves against darkening sky"). It provides resources (the shards glitter "among the fallen pears") and thematic weight (deciduous imagery). The setting shapes mood and supports the vows motif but does not directly constrain a tactical choice. Setup, development, and closure participation are strong. Specificity is very high; the physical logic (trees rooted in rafters) is both fresh and purposeful.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the breach of contract" is established early and provides backstory context ("three seasons of bitter winter and stubborn spring"). The passage of hours during the repair work is noted ("Hours passed"). However, time does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the repair proceeds at Mira's pace without a live clock. The daughter's arrival is coincidentally timed rather than deadline-driven. Setup is present, thematic relevance (seasons, decay) is clear, but the timeframe does not alter tactics or escalate pressure on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "bridge generational wisdom" is dramatized through Mira's use of her father's tools, her realization that "generational wisdom could not be hoarded but must be shared," and the ribbon offering that bridges "the child who had loved her and the woman who had failed her." Present in setup (the tools as heirloom), development (the grinding and fitting work), and closure (the crossing to her daughter). Friction is visible: Mira's "stubborn pride" initially prevented her from seeking help. Cost is tied to it: months of isolation, the acknowledgment of failure. The epiphany is somewhat told, reducing dramatic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The accidental-wisdom tone is coherent throughout: Mira's insights arrive "unbidden and unearned," she "finally, imperfectly, arrived," and the ending celebrates showing up rather than mastery. The tone modulates with pressure, moving from amber-lit nostalgia to focused craft work to the charged stillness of the daughter's silhouette. The tone charges the final image by framing the reunion as imperfect but earned. Setup (opening reflection), development (repair work interspersed with realizations), and closure (the crossing as embodied wisdom) are all present. The tone is specific to this story and integral to its thematic effect.</comment>
