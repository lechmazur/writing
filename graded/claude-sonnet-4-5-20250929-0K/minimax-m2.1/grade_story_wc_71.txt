<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's characterization as a "creeping normality noticer" is well-established through specific observational behaviors (tilted photographs, residual warmth on banisters). Her interiority remains consistent throughout, with embodied sensory details like the orris root shard warming against her thigh. However, the story lacks meaningful internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—her progression toward understanding feels smooth and inevitable rather than genuinely struggled-for. The final realization arrives without visible cost or a choice that forecloses an alternate path, reading more as epiphany than earned transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode with lyric elements, building density through sensory detail and recursive observation. However, closure fails the cost test: the final "quiet blaze of recognition" offers conceptual repricing without demonstrable on-page cost—Mira arrives at understanding but forfeits nothing and alters no tactic. The grandmother's presence three nights ago (coffee cup residue) creates a temporal inconsistency since the framing suggests the grandmother is deceased ("thirty years after her grandmother stopped grinding"), yet the sensory evidence implies recent occupation. This causality slip undermines the accumulative logic at a pivotal observational beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The bay setting is rendered with strong sensory specificity: sea lavender through dune grass, orris root scent lingering in rooms, salt-worn clapboard. The streetlights function as both atmospheric anchor and temporal frame, modulating from "daydream" to "full wakefulness" in parallel with Mira's awareness. The orris root shard serves as micro-setting, recurring across beats and warming in her pocket to signal intensification. While the house interior constrains movement and supplies objects for observation (coffee cup, attic shard), the setting does not force a difficult choice or alter tactics under pressure—it supports rather than tests.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why some houses feel alive—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through displaced objects building "like sediment" toward recognition. However, escalation is atmospheric rather than causal: each observation deepens perception without narrowing options or raising tangible cost. The piece offers one tightening (attic shard discovery prompting cataloging) but no on-page reversal or trade-off. The resolution arrives through passive realization rather than protagonist agency, and no visible price is paid—Mira's understanding costs her nothing and forecloses no path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the accumulation of displaced objects and sensory inheritance, avoiding direct statement. The orris root shard functions as both literal and thematic object, linking scent-memory to the grandmother's teaching. The final image—"some truths have always been waiting to be noticed"—reweights the material without overt moralizing, though it edges toward abstraction. The concept of houses as living memory is developed through concrete particulars (coffee cup residue, window latches) rather than exposition. However, the ending offers conceptual closure without felt ambiguity or cost, trending toward tidy resolution rather than sustained complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira's attention to "minute departures" and "spaces between things" creates consistent textural filtering. Diction is elevated and lyric ("violet hour," "sanctify of careful attention") but voice-coherent throughout, maintaining a contemplative register appropriate to the accumulative mode. However, the prose occasionally slips into purple territory ("the hush of understanding that some truths have always been waiting") where compression would sharpen impact. The phrase "sanctify of careful attention" appears to be a typo or malapropism (sanctity?), creating a rare clarity slip in otherwise controlled language.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally strong with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm modulation. However, the piece suffers from template cadence in several passages: "Every chair angled... every drawer that hangs... every window latch" deploys mechanical parallelism without escalating pressure. The phrase "a shard of hush" appears twice in close proximity (paragraph 4) as both literal description and metaphor, creating synonym churn. Figurative density is high throughout ("streetlights daydream," "walls remember," "violet ghost") without clear pattern-teaching, occasionally obscuring rather than sharpening sense. The orris root functions as both object and atmosphere but its dual role sometimes blurs the causal line between physical shard and metaphorical effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—a sensitivity inherited through "accumulated attention like a callus built from noticing"—offers a fresh angle on haunting narratives, grounding supernatural atmosphere in craft and observation rather than traditional ghost tropes. The orris root shard as perfumer's inheritance and the concept of houses as living memory show specific synthesis. However, the execution remains within familiar literary-ghost territory, and the final realization follows a predictable arc from observation to epiphany. The piece transforms conventions through voice and sensory detail but does not take structural or thematic risks that might elevate it beyond well-executed familiar material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira as "creeping normality noticer" is established early and her observation drives the narrative's accumulative structure across multiple beats (photograph, banister, coffee cup, attic shard). However, noticing does not constrain choices or create meaningful turns—she catalogs rather than decides. The character trait enables the story's observational mode but does not force trade-offs or alter tactics under pressure. Present in setup, development, and closure, but observation remains passive throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The orris root shard appears in three distinct beats: attic discovery (setup), pocket warming during cataloging (development), and final warmth at realization (closure). It functions as inheritance object linking grandmother's craft to Mira's sensitivity, and its warming provides embodied feedback for her progress. However, the shard is handled rather than used—it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic, functioning more as atmospheric motif than causal agent. Its presence charges the final image but does not reweight prior material with new cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"A shard of hush" appears as metaphor in paragraph 4 ("shard of hush that she carries") but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics—it describes Mira's perceptual state rather than constraining her options. The concept is present thematically (intensification of awareness, houses holding silence) but never becomes a mechanism that alters choice. It functions as atmospheric descriptor rather than active story element.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" is mentioned once as framing device ("how profoundly ordinary this all is") but never constrains or enables action. The attribute is asserted rather than demonstrated through choices with visible cost. It appears in closure reflection but as theme statement rather than trait that shaped prior beats. Label-only use without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Sanctify" appears twice: first as method ("sanctify of careful attention"—likely typo for sanctity), then as action ("she sets the cup down gently as if handling something sanctified"). The action of treating objects as sacred shapes Mira's careful handling and frames her relationship to inherited space. However, it does not create a turn or redefine options—it describes her consistent approach rather than a pivotal choice. Present in middle development and implicit at closure, but no major turn traces directly to this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Through displaced objects" is established early as method and executed across multiple beats: photograph, book position, chair angles, drawer openings, window latches, coffee cup. The method shapes Mira's investigative tactics throughout and drives the accumulative structure. Each displaced object functions as evidence building toward recognition. The mechanics matter: objects are not merely observed but cataloged as "communications" that constrain interpretation. Present in setup, development, and closure; essential to the story's investigative logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The bay setting (sea lavender, dune grass, salt-worn clapboard, harbor road) is established in opening and provides atmospheric frame. However, "quiet bay in spring" functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint—the story could occur in any quiet inherited house without structural change. The setting supplies mood and sensory detail but does not pressure choices or alter tactics. Postcard description that enriches but does not drive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The streetlight timeframe bookends the narrative: "violet hour before full dark" opening to "full wakefulness" at closure, tracking Mira's progression in parallel with evening deepening. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Mira faces no clock pressure, and her exploration proceeds at contemplative pace. Time is poetic frame rather than tactical constraint. Present in opening and closing with purposeful arc, but does not alter moves or force trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand why some houses feel alive" is stated explicitly in paragraph 3 and drives Mira's cataloging behavior across beats. The desire is enacted through observation and investigation, not merely told. However, the motivation faces no friction—Mira wants understanding and achieves it without cost or competing want. No internal conflict between this desire and another value, and the resolution satisfies the want tidily. Present throughout and drives action, but lacks complicating pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" is executed as oxymoronic tone pairing quiet observation (hush) with intensity (blaze). The prose maintains contemplative restraint throughout while building sensory and emotional charge, particularly in the final paragraph's "quiet blaze of recognition." Tone modulates appropriately from opening stillness through accumulating awareness to charged closure. The pairing is coherent and charges the final image, though the explicit phrase "quiet blaze" in the ending arguably over-articulates what the prose has already built.</comment>
