<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena's methodical preparation and perceptual aperture are clearly drawn, but her process remains abstract—she "feels for the counterweight of opposite emotion" without dramatized struggle or micro-choices under pressure. The mother's Alzheimer's backstory is told rather than anchored to a present choice that shifts her stance. The ending gesture (rolling the canvas) feels performative rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost, leaving motivation declarative rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered detail (ribbon fragment, quarry, grief sediment) toward a final image meant to reweight the stakes. Orientation anchors arrive by the end of the first paragraph. However, the closure lacks on-page cost—Elena completes the portrait and will send it, but no option is foreclosed, no price paid, and no before/after legible beyond task completion. The final image ("lance through the fog") reprises earlier diction but does not reconfigure meaning or impose felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The quarry in mist is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("fog rolled across stone faces," "gravel," "hollowed-out crater") and the ribbon fragment is handled twice (pressed against palm, held for emotional signature). The portable canvas and pigments appear but do not constrain choice. The fog modulates from opening to "began to thin" at closure, charging the final image with atmospheric shift that supports the ending without dictating it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—awakening dormant empathy for Marguerite's sister—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows Elena's options; she arrives, paints, and finishes without obstacle or visible trade-off. The "unifying opposites" method is declared but not tested under pressure. Marguerite's disappearance and the sister's plea provide context but do not escalate into a choice that forecloses a path with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (grief, empathy, visibility through absence) emerges from particulars: face blindness as aperture, the ribbon as residue, "the hunger to be seen." The final image offers a non-literal answer—"not answers, but completion"—but risks stating the thesis rather than dramatizing it. The Alzheimer's parallel and "dormant empathy" language veer toward abstract declaration. Stronger when anchored to the quarry's "exhaling" atmosphere and the portrait's emergence from negative space.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "aperture," "architecture of emotion," "counterweight." Distance is controlled and diction matches Elena's interior lexicon. However, several lines drift into elevated register that feels imposed rather than voice-organic: "time's patient work," "death's silence," "emotional sediment." The closing passage ("methodical and patient") reprises diction from the opening without heightening pressure, reading as summary rather than embodied closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory anchors are strong ("stiffened silk like preserved skin," "stone faces cut into the hillside"). However, multiple paraphrase loops and template stems flatten momentum: "She searched for... She searched for...," "The portrait would go... Elena would not solve... But she would awaken..." The verb "lance" is used twice in different contexts (police "lance through piles," Elena will "lance through the fog"), creating figurative muddle. The final paragraph recycles diction ("methodical," "fragment," "shadowed") without propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Face-blind portrait artist solving cold cases through emotional perception is a fresh premise with conceptual intrigue. The "unifying opposites" method and "painting from negative space" offer non-obvious angles. However, execution leans on familiar tropes: the lone investigator, the five-year-old disappearance, the masquerade mystery. The ending's "not answers, but peace" formulation risks pat closure. The premise shows originality; the arc does not fully transform it through unpredictable turns.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena's face blindness informs her perceptual method (seeing "architecture of emotion") and is mentioned in both setup and ending. However, it does not constrain a choice or create friction; she paints successfully without visible trade-off. Her role as portrait artist drives the action but could be replaced by another investigative frame with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ribbon fragment is handled in the opening beat (pressed against palm) and reappears when Elena uses it to "feel for... emotional signature." It arrives with the sister's note, primes the portrait work, and is implicitly present at closure as the channel for Marguerite's emotional residue. Setup, development, and closure participation are all present, but the object does not impose cost or narrow options—it enables rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Cold cases frame the backstory (seventeen solved, Marguerite's five-year disappearance) and establish Elena's track record. However, the concept does not shape on-page tactics or choices; the story unfolds as a single portrait session without investigative pressure, witness interviews, or time-sensitive clues. It functions as thematic context rather than active stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Methodical" is shown in the opening ("pressed... against her palm") and closing ("methodical and patient") and once during setup ("methodical as a surgeon arranging instruments"). However, it does not constrain a choice or impose cost—Elena's process unfolds smoothly without the trait creating friction or enabling a reversal. Label-only in peak beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Lance" appears twice: police "lance through piles of stone" (past tense, others' action) and Elena will "lance through the fog" (future intention, metaphorical). Neither use drives an on-page turn or alters Elena's options. The action is mentioned but not dramatized as a choice with consequence. Swappable with "search" or "sift."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Unifying opposites" is signaled in the second paragraph ("her method was by unifying opposites") and enacted in the painting beat ("Where Marguerite had felt terror, someone else had felt triumph"). It shapes the portrait's creation and distinguishes Elena's approach. However, the mechanics remain abstract—no visible struggle or cost tied to holding both poles. Present in setup and development but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The quarry in mist anchors the opening, provides spatial detail (crater, gravel, stone faces), and the mist "began to thin" at closure, charging the final image with atmospheric shift. The setting does not impose a tactical constraint (weather, access, discovery risk) but it recurs with evolving resonance. Setup, lyric reprise, and tonal participation are all present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"After the evidence disappears" frames the setup (five years cold, witnesses' memories eroded, physical traces gone) and establishes the absence that motivates Elena's method. The timeframe does not create urgency or narrow options on the page—Elena works at her own pace. It shapes context but does not tighten tactics or alter the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Awaken dormant empathy" is stated early as Elena's gift and reprised at closure ("awaken dormant empathy... not answers, but completion"). The motivation is declared and guides the portrait's purpose. However, it is told rather than tested—no on-page friction between Elena's desire and a competing cost or failure. Present in setup and closure but not dramatized through conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" is not named but rendered through diction and rhythm: "shadowed quarry," "fog rolled," "methodical as a surgeon," "silence that felt like death," "the quarry would return to its shadowed silence." Tone is coherent and modulates subtly (opening fog, thinning mist at closure). The final image ("shadowed silence, waiting") sustains the tone and charges the ending without breaking into overt declaration.</comment>
