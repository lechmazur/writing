<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kira's interiority is concrete and her motivation to witness/translate is clear, but the piece relies heavily on reflection without sufficient embodied contradiction under pressure. The character's "quietly enthusiastic" nature is told more than shown through micro-choices. Her final realization feels asserted rather than earned through struggle—she arrives at understanding without meaningful internal conflict or cost. The grandmother functions as pure backstory without applying immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural; the piece builds density through layered description and reflection, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Kira recognizes her purpose as witness). However, the closure lacks visible cost—the realization is a confirmation rather than a foreclosure. Orientation is adequate (who/where/when established early), but the "backwards prophecy" concept remains abstract and doesn't constrain tactics on the page. The meaningful tightening is weak; the static bursts and coin-casting feel ornamental rather than consequential.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (honeyed gold light, weathered table). The contracted universe provides an intriguing frame, and the coins function as a tactile micro-setting element. However, the setting doesn't constrain Kira's choice at closure—she could perform this ritual anywhere. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the atmosphere consistently supports the contemplative tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding purpose through divination—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No meaningful tightening occurs; Kira's process of casting coins and listening to static doesn't face opposition or escalate. The "realization" arrives without cost or trade-off—she simply confirms what she already believed. Agency is present (she chooses to continue her practice) but the choice doesn't foreclose a live path or alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of patient witnessing versus instrumental knowing emerges organically from Kira's practice. The "backwards prophecy" concept offers potential richness but remains abstract—it's explained rather than dramatized. The final insight about recognizing "the present for what it truly was" verges on platitude without specific grounding in cost or contradiction. The ambered light and coin imagery recur purposefully, though the closing "quietly enthusiastic" phrase echoes prompt language too directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. The narrative voice carries a distinct lyric texture with purposeful compression ("隐藏" character insertion reads as artifact or intentional multilingual flourish—unclear). Perceptual signature is consistent (filtering through scientific vs. intuitive frameworks). However, the prose occasionally slips into expository mode, particularly when explaining the grandmother's philosophy. Psychic distance remains appropriate, and the focalization never leaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. However, several instances of paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "quietly enthusiastic" appears twice; "patient" recurs without reweighting; "the static" and "static bursts" cycle through multiple near-identical constructions. Template cadence in reflection passages: "She believed...," "She had learned...," "She would..." The metaphor of "wavelength" is overextended without coherent vehicle logic. Figurative density is high but some images muddle (purpose "隐藏 itself from those who sought it too loudly" mixes registers).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The contracted-universe premise offers fresh framing, and the "backwards prophecy" concept is intriguing. However, execution remains in the abstract—divination-as-witness has been explored widely, and this doesn't transform the template through specific lived cost. The grandmother's wisdom arrives as received philosophy rather than hard-won knowledge. Kira's practice feels static; she performs the same ritual at beginning and end without risk or meaningful variation. The piece commits to its premise but doesn't follow implications into uncomfortable territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kira is identified as a "cast lots decision maker" continuing her grandmother's tradition. She performs the coin-casting twice on the page (opening framing, then the ritual itself), but the practice doesn't drive a key turn—she confirms rather than discovers. Present in setup and ending, but the decision itself (to continue her work) lacks consequence or cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The foreign coins are introduced early, described in tactile detail (worn smooth, copper disk, symbols), and handled during the ritual. They appear in setup and the ending ritual, but their specific properties don't constrain choice—any divination tokens would serve the same function. The "wavelength" each carries is asserted, not demonstrated through causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Backwards prophecy is explained philosophically ("prophecy flowed backward through time") and shapes Kira's worldview, but it doesn't create tactical pressure or alter on-page options. It functions as theme rather than active concept—Kira's realization fits the concept but would work without it. Present in setup and thematic closure, but missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Quietly enthusiastic" is labeled twice (paragraph 2, final paragraph) but not dramatized through specific action-with-cost. The trait doesn't constrain behavior—Kira could perform the same actions with any temperament. It colors narration mildly but never forces a visible trade-off or enables a unique choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Distill" appears three times: as verb describing her method, in "distilling again" during the ritual, and implicitly in the concept of "reducing...complexity to essential truths." It's thematically central and shapes her approach, but the action itself is abstract—we don't see concrete mechanics of distillation that alter outcome. Present across beats but swappable with "interpret" or "parse."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Understanding static bursts is signaled early ("learned to understand static bursts as a language") and demonstrated during the ritual when she listens for patterns. The method matters to her practice and appears in the climactic moment when the coin "seemed to catch its echo." However, the mechanics remain vague—we don't see how understanding differs from misunderstanding. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but could be replaced with any form of pattern-reading.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck is established immediately with vivid sensory detail and familial history (grandmother stood there thirty years before). It provides the physical anchor for the entire piece and appears in the final image. However, it doesn't pressure Kira's choice—she could perform this ritual elsewhere. The deck functions as atmospheric container rather than tactical constraint, though the weathered table is handled on the page.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The contracted universe is established in setup and provides the story's premise—distances collapsed, stars grew close, static became denser. It shapes the world Kira inhabits and appears in the reflection on "this smaller universe" at closure. However, the contraction doesn't create time pressure or tighten specific decisions within the scene. It's a backdrop condition rather than an active force.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To wavelength align with purpose" is stated explicitly in the narrative and drives Kira's ritual practice. Her desire appears in setup and culminates in her realization about being a witness. However, the motivation is confirmed rather than tested—no friction between competing wants, no visible cost to pursuing alignment. The desire shapes her actions but doesn't conflict with anything on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Tone is contemplative and carries quiet uncertainty about cosmic meaning throughout. The mood modulates slightly—descriptive calm to focused ritual to gentle epiphany—and remains coherent. However, "stellar doubt" as phrased doesn't manifest distinctly; the piece reads as patient wonder more than doubt. Tone supports the final image but doesn't sharpen under pressure or charge the closure with felt tension.</comment>
