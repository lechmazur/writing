<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Yara's interior contradiction is legible: she craves connection but her sympathetic nature previously drained her, creating a lived tension between wanting to give and needing to receive. The arbor scene embodies this paradox through concrete image—she sees her younger self offering endless help without asking for reciprocity. The shift from performative giving to "ask[ing] what shapes they needed from her hands" demonstrates character-particular growth with visible cost (abandoning her familiar martyrdom). Motivation is consistently rooted in her fear of dissolving into others' grief, but the final choice feels slightly summarized rather than dramatized in a high-stakes beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (marsh-reeds, glass-powder spirals, obsidian arbor) that converge at closure when Yara realizes the Threader is a practice, not a person, reweighting her search from external validation to reciprocal dedication. The arbor scene crystallizes this shift with visible cost: she must abandon her identity as selfless caretaker and risk asking for help. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). One meaningful deepening occurs when the arbor reflection forces her to confront her performative sympathy, narrowing her options to either flee or commit to mutual kinship with visible vulnerability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The obsidian arbor functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: kneeling at its base forces Yara to see her reflection and confront her past pattern, directly enabling the closure realization. The crystalline orchard recurs across beats with specific sensory anchors (geometric shadows, molten copper lake, glass-powder marks) that guide her physical search and charge the final image of spiral marks "leading her deeper into the web." Spatial choreography is clean (crater rim → arbor descent → climb back toward orchard lights). The glittering environment mirrors her internal "luminescent ache" through concrete detail rather than overt symbolism, and the "hollow promise" of marsh-reeds gains tactile weight when contrasted with the orchard's "frozen quartz" fruit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Yara seeks "a place where her sympathy could root instead of drain." One meaningful tightening occurs when Corwin warns "no one goes alone the first time" and the arbor "shows you what you're seeking, but only if you approach it honestly," raising the cost of her search from external discovery to internal reckoning. The arbor scene forces a trade-off—she must renounce her identity as unilateral giver to access reciprocal kinship—with legible cost in "ask for help, not only offer it." However, the resolution reads more as realization than a high-pressure choice that forecloses competing live options in the moment; the decision to stay crystallizes smoothly without visible friction or a dramatized refusal of an alternate path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the arbor image: kinship requires presence and reciprocity, not performative self-sacrifice. The Threader's spiral-within-spiral motif recurs with purpose—it appears as street art, in the arbor bark, and finally as path marks—accumulating meaning from mystery to practice to invitation, reweighting Yara's search from finding a person to embodying a dedication. The final image "spiral within spiral, leading her deeper into the web" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates cleanly in Corwin's "honestly" and Yara's recognition that villages "had taken and taken" because she "had never asked to receive," avoiding overt thesis statements. The marsh-reed sculptures shift from "questions she hadn't learned to ask" to shapes co-created with community, deepening thematic resonance through concrete objects rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable throughout; perceptual signature is character-particular (notice how Yara reads the orchard's brilliance as something that "hurt somehow" and filters the crater through her fen-village past). Diction remains consistent—"hollow promise," "geometric shadows," "luminescent ache"—with purposeful elevation that matches her sculptural vocation without drifting into unmotivated register. The arbor reflection sequence maintains clean focalization: "she understood" and "She had tried" anchor realization in present perception rather than omniscient summary. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Rhythm modulates effectively from the contemplative opening to the urgent climb back, and psychic distance tightens appropriately at the arbor scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic resonance. Figurative language is controlled and earns its keep: "marsh-reed...hollow promise," "fruit of frozen quartz," "luminescent ache" all recur with evolving meaning tied to stakes. However, mild template cadence appears in the middle section: "She would stay. She would learn...memorize...bring...ask" stacks four parallel future constructions in succession without variation, creating a drumbeat rhythm during a pivotal beat. One paraphrase loop: "as something like anticipation" echoes the earlier "something different" without added pressure. Opening and closing lines are strong; the arbor as "a question carved from night" and final spirals "leading her deeper" charge the frame. No major loops or scaffolding beyond the noted parallels, and sentence openings generally vary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Threader-as-practice rather than person is a fresh turn on the mentor-quest trope, and the marsh-reed sculptor vocation offers specific, grounded detail. However, the emotional arc—artist fleeing performative sympathy to find reciprocal community—tracks a familiar template (wounded healer seeks belonging through self-acceptance), and the crystalline-crater fantasy setting, while vivid, relies on stock high-fantasy imagery (obsidian arbor, glass-powder, frozen quartz) without transformation through world logic or lived consequence. The arbor revelation feels earned in hindsight but arrives smoothly without a bold, risky complication. Transformation test: the core plot (person searches for mysterious figure, discovers the figure is a shared practice, decides to stay and participate) could function with different names and setting imagery intact, suggesting the freshness resides more in execution than premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Yara's choice to "ask what shapes they needed from her hands" and her decision to "stay" are on-page decisions that alter her path from transient sculptor to rooted community member. Present in setup (opening), middle (approaches families, receives map from Corwin), and closure (decision to stay and dedicate). However, her agency at the peak beat is more realization than contested decision—no live alternative is dramatized and foreclosed in the moment, lowering causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The obsidian arbor appears in setup (Corwin's map), is handled at the climax (Yara kneels, sees her reflection, reads the glass-powder tag), and shapes the closure (the realization that the Threader is a practice). Its reflective surface constrains her choice by forcing self-confrontation, and its spiral branches echo the Threader's tag, charging the final image. Present in three beats with evolving function from destination to mirror to validation, and its specific properties (glossy bark, spiral branches, shows truth) are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Webs of kinship are signaled early ("webs of kinship here were visible"), shape middle tactics (Yara joins family searches, accepts Corwin's guidance), and appear in the closure image ("deeper into the web"). The concept pressures her choice by offering an alternative to her draining pattern: she must learn to receive, not only give. However, the mechanics remain abstract—on-page demonstrations of reciprocal kinship are thin (families "welcomed her with careful warmth" is summary, not scene), so the concept functions more as thematic claim than lived constraint with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" is backstory-established ("unable to pass a stranger's sorrow without shouldering it") and explains her past drain, but the trait does not constrain a present on-page choice with visible cost. The arbor scene references her past over-giving, and her decision to "ask" rather than only offer is framed as growth beyond this trait, but we do not see her sympathetic impulse tested and resisted in a present beat. The attribute drives backstory causality but remains label-only in the present window.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Dedicate" is signaled early in her motivation ("graft herself onto community"), enacted at closure ("She would dedicate herself to this community"), and the Threader practice is revealed as "a dedication to marking the places where newcomers learned to weave themselves into waiting webs." The action redefines her search from finding the Threader to becoming the Threader. Present in setup, middle thematic layering, and closure. However, the dedication itself is future-facing summary rather than a completed on-page act with immediate cost, which lowers immediacy.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The shared search is signaled in setup ("families would point out suspected locations, share theories"), Yara participates in middle beats ("approached three families...join their searches"), and at closure she receives Corwin's map and sees new marks "leading her deeper." The search method shapes her tactics (studying groves, walking the steep path) and enables the arbor encounter. However, the mechanics of the search remain thin—what does "studying the northern groves" entail on the page?—so the method pressures choices more by framing than by specific procedural constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard perched at the crater's edge is present throughout (opening, Corwin encounter in "northern groves," descent to arbor "at the crater's heart," climb back "toward the orchard lights") and its spatial structure guides Yara's movement. The "steep path down" and the arbor's position "where the shimmer ran hottest" create a physical journey that mirrors her internal descent and return. Specific details (geometric shadows, molten copper lake, glass-powder marks on the path) recur and constrain navigation. The setting pressures choices by forcing the descent and return climb, charging the final ascent with earned momentum.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" appears once as a poetic anchor but does not function as a tightening timeframe. Yara's journey is marked by vague durations ("three weeks of muddy walking," "the week since her arrival," "On her fifth day") that establish sequence but do not create urgency or constrain decisions. No countdown or deadline pressures her choice to descend to the arbor or stay. The timeframe is present but ornamental, not a live clock that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to "graft herself onto community" is signaled early ("where she could graft herself onto community rather than bleed into strangers"), drives middle tactics (approaching families, accepting Corwin's map, walking the path), and is dramatized at closure when she recognizes she must "ask for help, not only offer it" and decides to stay. The arbor scene creates friction between her want (belonging) and the cost (renouncing her martyrdom identity). The motivation is on-page and conflicted, though the final choice reads more as acceptance than a wrestled decision with live competing pulls in the moment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is established early ("the brilliance hurt somehow, pressing against the ache she carried"), recurs in the middle ("The luminescent ache in her chest didn't fade, but it shifted, becoming something like anticipation"), and subtly modulates from pain to anticipation at closure, charging the final ascent. The tone is consistent across beats—melancholy longing mixed with tentative hope—and the orchard's glittering harshness mirrors her internal state. Rhythm and diction support the tone without forcing it, and the ache's persistence with transformation (not erasure) avoids false resolution.</comment>
