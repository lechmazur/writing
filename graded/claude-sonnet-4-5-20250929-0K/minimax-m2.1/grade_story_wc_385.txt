<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand echo people is established through extensive backstory (~30%+ reflection), but her agency remains observational until the final paragraph where she "stepped into the heart of the song" without a prior on-page choice that visibly narrows options. The forty-season backstory and grandmother's seashell provide context but flatten present urgency. Interiority leans toward diagnostic phrasing ("a wound that never fully healed," "trapped frequency") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure in the present scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers setting, backstory, and thematic concern toward a moment of entry. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—Elara steps into the song at the alignment—but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatized (no visible trade-off or foreclosed path on the page). The nexus setup and celestial trigger provide structure, yet the final act ("stepped into") functions as threshold gesture rather than a choice with legible consequences. Orientation anchors are present early (canyon singer, nexus, starlight, seashell).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus, three riverbeds, starlight, and seashell are vividly rendered with sensory specificity and POV filter (forty seasons of listening, canyon echoes). The seashell constrains Elara's method (listening device) and returns warm at the climax, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear; the environment structures the ritual timing. Micro-setting (body, shell, stone markers) functions purposefully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning why echo people exist and how to restore them—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through backstory of investigation and converges at the alignment, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice alters Elara's options; the universe's hum swells and she steps forward as planned. The escalation reads as atmospheric intensification (starlight shifts, seashell warms) rather than a decision under competing costs. One meaningful deepening occurs (voice "that might have been her own") but without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—the cost of hearing everything, the nature of mimicry versus authentic voice—emerges through layered imagery (echoes, frequencies, stolen souls). The seashell and alignment motif recur with shifting weight. However, the final paragraph edges toward direct statement ("where all echoes began and ended, and where the truth...waited at last to be spoken") rather than letting the image alone carry resonance. The central question about echo people is posed but not answered or reconsidered with cost on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara hears layered frequencies, notices sound transformations, filters the world through acoustic metaphor. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close at seashell moment, widening for backstory). Diction remains elevated and consistent ("serpentine nexus," "canyon echo singer") with no head-hopping. Register is lyric-literary throughout; no dialogue to test voice distinction. Reflection anchors to present stimuli (seashell, starlight, hum).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; opening and closing lines carry lyric weight. Information density is high in the first two paragraphs, then backstory reiterates the echo-people mystery without advancing present stakes. Minor template cadence in paragraph three ("Why did some people echo? Not the physical kind...but the deeper sort") and a paraphrase loop between "echo people" explanations. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors. The final sentence runs long with stacked clauses that slightly blur propulsion at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The canyon echo singer premise and the concept of soul-frequency theft offer a fresh synthesis of sonic mysticism and identity erasure. Execution leans on familiar quest-for-answers structure; Elara's passivity (listening, gathering maps, waiting for alignment) and the unresolved mystery lower distinctiveness. The seashell artifact and celestial timing add specificity. Risk-taking is moderate: lyric voice and reflection-heavy design without a decisive on-page turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her perception filters all detail, but her only on-page decision is stepping into the song in the final line—a threshold gesture without visible cost or competing options dramatized beforehand. Observation dominates; no mid-story choice alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The whispering seashell half appears in paragraph two (listening device carrying voices), recurs in paragraph four ("grew warm," new voice), and charges the final moment. It enables Elara's method and reweights at closure. Setup, development (warmth cue), and payoff (new voice) are present. Causal pressure is moderate; the shell is integral but not irreplaceable (any artifact could serve).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Webs of intrigue" is described in paragraph three as the network connecting echo people and methods of their creation, but no intrigue unfolds on the page—no rival, hidden actor, or complicating revelation. The concept remains thematic backdrop rather than shaping present stakes or tactics. Late summary-only use; no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Richly perceptive" is demonstrated via Elara's ability to hear hidden frequencies and trapped notes in echo people's speech. The trait enables her investigation but does not constrain a choice or impose a cost on the page (no sensory overload, no forced trade-off). Setup and middle presence; no closure linkage or visible price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Ensure" appears in paragraph four: "She had to ensure...she would be ready to hear the truth." This frames her motive for attending the nexus but does not generate a turn; the alignment proceeds as expected. Introduced late (fourth paragraph), functional but not causally pivotal. The action could be replaced with "discover" or "prepare" without altering structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Progressive disclosure" is mentioned in paragraph three (maps obtained "through progressive disclosure and careful negotiation") as backstory method. It does not shape on-page tactics or return at closure. Summary-only; introduced past midpoint; no causal pressure in the present scene.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus under starlight is established in the opening line, grounds all action, and provides the celestial alignment trigger that times the climax. The crossing riverbeds and winding stones structure Elara's position. Setup, middle anchoring, and closure participation (starlight shifts, she steps into the nexus heart) are present. The setting enables the ritual and charges the final image with specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"While the universe hums its secret song" appears in the opening and recurs as "humming grow louder" and "melody swelled" in paragraphs four and five. The hum provides atmospheric escalation and a timed event (celestial alignment makes frequencies visible), but no on-page clock tightens tactics—Elara waits and listens as planned. Functional temporal frame without pressure-driven urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to learn why some people echo" and "how to restore what had been taken"—is stated in paragraphs two, three, and four. The desire drives her presence at the nexus but is not dramatized through conflicting wants or a visible cost in the present scene. Setup and middle presence; closure gesture (stepping into the song) enacts the desire but does not test it against competing stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tone reads as lyric melancholy: the phrasing is elegiac ("laughter of children long turned to dust," "infinitely alone"), imagery is somber (dry riverbeds, starlight, trapped frequencies), and the mood modulates from reflective stillness to quiet intensity as the hum swells. Coherent across beats and present in the final image ("seeking answers in the space between sound and silence"). No sharp tonal break; the reed-blown quality is sustained through cadence and diction.</comment>
