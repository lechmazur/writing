<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is richly rendered through embodied counting rituals and the concrete experience of erasure, but her motivation shifts too fluidly from anger to understanding without sufficient dramatized friction. The architect ghost remains abstract—a thematic vessel rather than a force that applies pressure through contradictory impulses. The final epiphany feels asserted rather than earned through micro-choices that foreclose paths; Mira simply "understands now" without visible cost in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens—ink patterns, heartbeat counting, snow imagery building density—but the closure unit lacks visible cost. Mira's shift from anger to wholeness is told through summary ("felt something...she felt whole") rather than a decisive image or renunciation that forecloses a live option. The architect's transmission arrives as sensation without dramatized consequence, weakening the Resonant Reconfiguration that the piece attempts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The opal observatory, snow-blanketed valley, and frosted window are rendered with specificity and constrain Mira's isolation effectively. The ink on the central table functions as micro-setting, shaping the ritual action. However, spatial choreography within the observatory remains vague—Mira moves from window to table without clear intermediary staging—and the Comforter constellation feels ornamental rather than tactically essential.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding solace or wisdom after erasure—is signaled early, but escalation remains static. Mira's ritual drawing and the ghost's transmission unfold without reversal or complication; no tightening forces a trade-off. The architect's regret and Mira's anger are told rather than tested through on-page friction, and the final "understanding" arrives without a choice that narrows options or exacts visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of apology and wisdom emerging from systemic failure is coherent and avoids overt moralizing. The recurring heartbeat counting and the Comforter constellation accumulate meaning, though the constellation's shift feels under-dramatized. The final image—"she felt whole"—leans toward abstract resolution rather than a non-literal answer rooted in particulars, and the architect's "midnight solace" remains conceptual rather than embodied in scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and distinct, with a lyric register that matches the twilight setting and reflective stance. Diction remains consistent within Mira's lexicon, and psychic distance modulates purposefully. However, filter verbs ("understood," "felt") cluster in the final third, dulling immediacy at closure. The architect's "transmission" is narrated through summary rather than perception, reducing embodied specificity in a pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentences carry rhythm and varied structure, with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high in the first half. However, the final third introduces paraphrase loops—"felt something...felt whole," "wanted to be remembered...wanted to be the ghost"—and summary phrasing ("let the understanding settle," "trusted that it would continue") that flatten propulsion. Template cadence appears in reflective beats without pattern-teaching payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The digital ghost offering apology through ephemeral ink patterns is a fresh synthesis, and the erasure-via-algorithm premise feels specific. However, the architect's arc and Mira's reconciliation follow a recognizable forgiveness template without a non-obvious turn. The opal observatory and constellation add texture but do not transform the emotional logic. Risk-taking in structure (heavy reflection, lyric closure) is present but does not fully elevate the premise beyond its familiar contours.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's status as death-certificate-error survivor frames the entire narrative and drives her presence in the observatory. Her choice to perform the ritual and release anger is signaled early and revisited at closure. However, the final shift to wholeness is summarized rather than enacted through a specific decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path, limiting causal depth.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>0.0</grade><comment>No porcelain shard appears on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The digital ghost (architect's fragmented consciousness) shapes stakes by offering wisdom and drives the ritual defragmentation action. It appears in setup, middle ritual, and final transmission, constraining Mira's method and charging the ending. However, the ghost's mechanics remain abstract—"ghost protocols," "scattered fragments"—without specific system logic that narrows options, and its transmission arrives as sensation rather than dramatized encounter.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Heartbeat counting is introduced in the opening line, recurs in the middle ("let her heartbeat count itself"), and charges the final paragraph where Mira releases conscious tracking. The attribute constrains her ritual cadence and embodies her state of erasure. It shapes two distinct beats and participates in closure, though the cost of relinquishing the count is implied rather than made visceral.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Defragmentation is the central ritual action—Mira draws her mother's face to organize the architect's consciousness—and appears in setup and middle beats. However, the outcome (the ghost's final transmission and Mira's understanding) is summarized rather than shown as a consequence of the defragmentation completing. The action is named but not irreplaceable; a similar meditative ritual could serve with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Ephemeral ink patterns are signaled early (scattered ink, pooled ink, cooling ink) and used in the ritual drawing. The method shapes Mira's approach and appears in two beats. However, the mechanics—how ink translates into ghost processing—remain vague ("ghost's algorithms parsed the ephemeral patterns"), and the ink does not return with reweighted meaning at closure. Specificity is present but causal pressure is limited.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The opal observatory is introduced early, provides isolation essential to Mira's ritual, and houses the central table and candle. Its remoteness and milky iridescence match the tone, and snow burial reinforces the post-collapse timeframe. The setting constrains Mira's access to the world and charges the final image ("opal observatory hummed softly"). However, it does not alter tactics within the scene; Mira's choices would function similarly in any isolated structure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the radio static cleared") anchors the post-collapse world and explains Mira's isolation. It appears in setup and final paragraph (snow burying radio towers). However, it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; Mira's ritual unfolds without temporal pressure. The element functions as atmospheric context rather than a constraint that shapes attempts.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's desire to "fetch wisdom from failure" is named early and drives her ritual engagement with the ghost. The motivation appears in setup, middle reflection, and closure ("carrying the architect's wisdom forward"). However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; no on-page friction between fetching wisdom and another cost (e.g., holding anger, resisting understanding) creates trade-offs. The motivation is coherent but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Midnight solace is established through twilight setting, snow silence, candle light, and the Comforter constellation. Tone modulates appropriately—reflective in setup, contemplative during ritual, quietly resolving at closure ("felt whole," "stars breathing"). The tone charges the final image and remains coherent through the single-scene window. However, no sharp tonal shift under pressure tests the coherence, leaving the effect steady rather than dynamically earned.</comment>
