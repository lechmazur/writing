<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's phobia is named but never constrains a live choice—she "listened to stars humming," spiraled into the library, then stood and declared herself transformed without on-page struggle against enclosure. Internal contradiction is asserted ("fear and power could coexist") rather than dramatized through simultaneous impulses in scene. Daniel's shift from mentor to captor is summarized in a single expository block ("he had known the truth all along") instead of revealed through action. The final declaration "I am not who you made me" feels unearned because no micro-choice under pressure tested her resolve or foreclosed a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words (waived). Closure unit: Maya's final declaration aims for Charged Poise but lacks visible cost—no on-page action forecloses a path; Daniel's reaction ("his eyes widened") does not constitute a reversal or price paid. The seashell/cast mechanism appears three times but remains ornamental; decryption happens off-page ("pattern emerged from chaos") without showing her outwitting Daniel through tactical application. Inferred lens is Causal but the because/therefore chain breaks: the notes reveal coordinates/dates yet their content never alters her options in scene. Cost proof test fails: no sentence at closure shows a legible sacrifice or foreclosed alternative.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rusted library supplies vivid sensory anchors—"metal cold through her film-slicked jacket," "moonlight poured through holes in the ceiling like spilled milk"—and the child's cast on the reading table provides a concrete object that charges the ending attempt. Spatial choreography remains clear (shelves, skylight, stacks, table). However, the setting does not constrain Maya's final choice; she could deliver her declaration anywhere. The phobia-inducing enclosure is noted ("shelves pressing closer, air thickening") but never forces a trade-off or tactical shift, remaining atmospheric rather than pressure-driving.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming identity) is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Daniel advances and Maya realizes his betrayal, but the turn is told rather than shown through contested action. The final beat lacks agency: Maya traces smudged notes and "pattern emerged"—passive discovery—then stands and speaks while Daniel's eyes widen. No on-page reversal alters tactics; coincidence (the cast happened to be on the table) supplies the solution. The cost is declared ("trembling certainty") but not demonstrated through a forfeited option or visible price paid in the closure moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (vulnerability as strength) emerges through particulars—the phobia, stunt-double career irony, the seashell's maternal voice—and the final image attempts resonance when Maya recognizes her own voice "waiting to be born." However, the ending tips into thesis statement: "vulnerability, fully embraced, was the ultimate strength" and "trembling certainty was its own form of courage" are direct thematic assertions rather than earned through scene pressure. The child's cast and seashell recur with purpose, but their meaning shift is narrated ("Each decrypted word strengthened her resolve") instead of shown through a non-literal final image that reweights prior material without stating the moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains third-limited throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—stunt-performer lens colors descriptions ("coordinated punch to the chest")—and the prose modulates with emotional intensity ("her phobia clawing at her throat"). However, diction slips into elevated register at peak beats: "riddling compulsion," "surgical precision," "honeyed condescension of a puppeteer," "transformation from guardian to captor" feel writerly rather than character-particular under crisis stress. Daniel's single line of dialogue ("You were never supposed to remember...") carries subtext but arrives late and alone, offering no rhythm test for voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Template-cadence check triggered: three successive complex sentences in paragraph two open with "The [noun]" constructions ("The whispered seashell... The revelation... The seashell"), creating drumbeat rhythm (−0.5). Paraphrase loop in paragraph six: "he had known the truth all along, had facilitated her mother's capture, had let Maya live a lie while using her as an unwitting pawn" and the following sentence "His transformation from guardian to captor" restate the same betrayal without added pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphor strings appear in high-pressure beats: "words tumbled out like tide against rock," "moonlight poured through holes... like spilled milk," "transforming vulnerability into something sharp and usable" (−0.4). Cumulative line-level debt totals −1.1, disallowing 9+ and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Core premise—stunt double with enclosed-space phobia discovers swapped-at-birth identity via whispering seashell and decrypts mother's notes on a child's cast—stacks multiple high-concept elements without organic synthesis. The seashell/cast mechanism feels ornamental rather than inevitable; the identity-swap revelation and mentor-betrayal tropes follow template arcs. The library setting and stunt-performer profession do not transform familiar material through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The final declaration "I am not who you made me" echoes countless self-actualization climaxes without fresh inflection. Transformation test: swapping names/places would leave the emotional arc intact, signaling insufficient freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Phobia-ridden stunt double present in setup (career backstory, "secret phobia of enclosed spaces") and mentioned at closure ("her phobia remained"), but the trait never constrains an on-page choice. Maya does not struggle against enclosure to trace the notes or confront Daniel; the phobia is described as "clawing at her throat" yet she proceeds without visible cost or tactical workaround. Swappable with any fear-driven protagonist; the stunt-performer skillset does not shape her outwitting attempt.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Whispering seashell appears in setup (pressed into palm, speaks in mother's voice), returns mid-story ("went silent now, but its echo remained"), and reprises at closure ("whispered once more, and this time she recognized the voice as her own"). Three touches across beats with reweighted meaning (mother's voice → her own voice) demonstrate lyric resonance. However, the seashell does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it remains symbolic rather than causally active. Removing it would weaken thematic charge but not break plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Transformative betrayal shapes the dominant stake: Daniel's shift from mentor to captor ("he had known the truth all along, had facilitated her mother's capture") drives Maya's need to reclaim identity. The betrayal is setup mid-story, complicates her options (he advances as she decrypts), and is present at closure when his eyes widen as he realizes "she was not the pawn he had designed." However, the transformation is summarized rather than dramatized through escalating reveals, and Maya's counter-move (decrypting notes) does not directly exploit or mirror the betrayal's mechanics. Functional but could be swapped for a generic antagonist role with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Firmly adaptive" is labeled twice: Maya's "adaptive nature was not a weakness but a survival mechanism" and Daniel's "adaptive betrayal." The trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost; adaptability is asserted as theme rather than demonstrated through a choice where flexibility incurs a price or rigidity blocks a path. The stunt-double career ("every persona she had adopted for the camera, had been rehearsal for this moment") gestures toward the trait but remains metaphorical summary. Swappable label without mechanical integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Outwit" appears in two beats: "she would outwit the man who had stolen her truth by reading what he had tried to bury" and the closure moment when Daniel realizes she is not controllable. However, the outwitting is not dramatized—Maya traces notes and "pattern emerged from chaos" without showing tactical friction or a feint that exploits Daniel's assumption. The action is told rather than staged through specific moves that redefine options. Easily swappable with "confront" or "defy" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Decrypting smudged notes on a child's cast appears in setup (cast on reading table, "surface covered in faded pencil marks") and at closure ("Her trembling fingers traced the smudged notes, and pattern emerged from chaos—coordinates, dates, a map"). The method shapes the ending attempt and is specific to the premise. However, the mechanics are summary-only: we do not see her decipher a single mark or test a hypothesis; "pattern emerged" is passive discovery rather than active problem-solving under Daniel's pressure. The cast is introduced late (second half) and resolves a problem (how to know her identity) it did not help create earlier.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rusted library under stars anchors the entire scene (setup through closure), supplies vivid sensory detail ("metal cold through her film-slicked jacket," "moonlight poured through holes"), and houses the key object (cast on reading table). The setting is present in all three gates. However, it does not constrain a choice—Maya's phobia is mentioned but never forces a tactical trade-off; she could decode the cast and confront Daniel in any location. The stars witness but do not pressure. Functional atmosphere that fits tone but remains interchangeable with similar abandoned spaces.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After discovering you're not who you thought" frames the entire narrative: the seashell revelation occurs "Three hours ago" and the story unfolds in the present as Maya processes and acts on that discovery. The timeframe is setup clearly and present at closure (she stands with the cast, transformed by the discovery). However, time does not tighten decisions—no countdown or escalating deadline; "three hours" could be three minutes or three days without altering tactics. The frame is functional but generic; easily swappable with any post-revelation window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"To prove that vulnerability is power" is stated directly in the closure paragraph: "vulnerability, fully embraced, was the ultimate strength." The motivation is present in setup (phobia as "second heartbeat," career built on "performing bravery"), developed mid-story ("adaptive nature was not a weakness but a survival mechanism"), and lands at closure. However, it is told rather than dramatized through a choice where embracing vulnerability incurs cost or defeats a threat. No friction between the desire to prove this and a competing want; the motivation reads as thematic claim rather than lived struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Trembling certainty" is named explicitly ("she understood, with trembling certainty") and recurs at closure ("her voice steady despite the trembling that still raced through her frame," "trembling certainty was its own form of courage"). The tone coheres across beats—physical trembling paired with declarative resolve—and modulates with pressure (phobia clawing, then standing to confront). The phrase charges the final image by embodying the paradox. However, the tone is over-articulated through direct statement rather than carried solely by rhythm and image, and "trembling certainty" itself becomes a repeated label. Strong thematic fit but execution tips toward thesis statement.</comment>
