<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to reawaken beauty through music—is consistent, but her interior life remains thin. She makes no difficult trade-offs or choices under pressure; the statues simply "step aside" and she walks forward playing. Embodied emotion is largely absent; we get "pressure behind her eyes" but no contradictory impulses or visible cost when she commits to the orchard's heart. The transformation lacks agency-driven causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph, meeting the test. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the statues bend, fruit gleams brighter), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically visible—Elara does not forfeit or lose anything on the page. The locust shell "slips from her fingers" without felt price, and the final image reads more like a symbolic tableau than a crystallized reconfiguration with palpable stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The orchard, sky-bridges, and locust shell are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("honey and forgotten storms," "translucent amber"). The orchard setting supplies the statues and constrains Elara's path, shaping the closure image when the statues step aside. However, spatial choreography within the orchard is vague—we never learn how far she walks or what physical obstacles she navigates—and the body as micro-setting is underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reawakening beauty—is signaled early and coherent. But escalation under the Accumulative lens is shallow: the statues begin to move, then simply yield. No reversal or deepening narrows Elara's options; she encounters no friction, trade-off, or tactical cost. The piece accumulates atmosphere but lacks a tightening that forecloses a live path or forces a choice with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—transformation, resonance, the gap between knowing and understanding—emerges from particulars (the locust shell, the statues' stone-to-flesh memory). The final image attempts a non-literal answer, but the ending tells us the fruit "shed some of its tarnish" rather than showing a choice or cost that embodies the thematic question. The resonance is gestured at, not earned through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person close on Elara. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled diction ("syncopating," "tarnished wonder"). However, psychic distance drifts into omniscience when the narrator claims the statues "had once been musicians" without dramatizing how Elara knows this. The interior voice occasionally slips into thesis-speak ("the gap between knowing and understanding") that feels imposed rather than character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and the prose is evocative, but several artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("the gap between knowing and understanding" recurs four times with minimal variation), template stems ("Elara [verb]" appears six times in close succession), and elevated diction that drifts from embodied perception into abstract register ("询问" appears untranslated, likely a generation artifact). Stock metaphors ("winter branches," "sap in spring") appear in high-density clusters without payoff. These issues dull momentum in the middle third and touch the closure paragraph ("the earth's long memory").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core premise—musician reawakens beauty in a mechanical world via enchanted orchard—is competently executed but closely tracks familiar templates (artist versus industry, magic versus mechanism, stone guardians coming to life). The locust shell as a resonance object is a specific detail, but the story does not transform the archetype into something that feels inevitable in hindsight. The ending satisfies the prompt but offers no surprising synthesis or bold risk that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choice to play is the story's hinge. However, her decision is not dramatized as a turn under pressure—she "understood immediately" and "her heart provided the answer" without visible internal conflict or cost. She appears in all three gates (setup, middle, closure) but her agency is more receptive than causal, lowering integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The locust shell appears early (setup), is handled in two beats (discovery, pressed to ear), and reappears at closure when it "slipped from her fingers" and becomes "part of the earth's long memory." The final reprise reweights its meaning from personal discovery to shared resonance. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost—it simply falls away—capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Breaking free" is present thematically (the locust shell "had been shed," the statues "remembering what it was like to be flesh") and shapes the stakes. But it does not alter Elara's tactics or force a trade-off on the page; she simply plays and the world responds. Setup and closure participation are legible, but middle development is thematic echo rather than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Resonantly soft" describes the first note Elara plays and the attribute recurs in "hollow resonance" of the shell. It appears in setup (implied in the shell's nature) and at closure (the music "spread through the orchard like warmth"). However, it does not constrain or enable a choice with cost—it is a sonic quality that characterizes the music without altering tactics or forging a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Uproot" appears twice: "to uproot what remained or to reawaken what had gone dormant" (the statues' question) and "Each phrase uprooted another layer of fossilized silence." The action is metaphorical rather than physical and does not drive a turn—Elara never literally uneeds to uproot anything, nor does the act change her options. Middle development is absent; the word appears as thematic flavor.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Signaling through heart rhythms" appears late (final third): "Elara's heart provided the answer in its rhythm—steadily, insistently, a signal that needed no translation" and "a signal sent through heart rhythms to everything that still remembered." The method is asserted but never demonstrated as a mechanic that shapes attempts or costs. Setup and middle development are missing; it resolves a problem (how to communicate with the statues) it did not help create.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard with living statues is present from the second paragraph (setup), pressures Elara's path (the statues' "patient 询问"), and supplies the spatial context for closure (statues step aside, fruit gleams). The orchard constrains her route and its magical rules—statues animate, fruit glows—alter the stakes. However, the statues' yield is passive rather than a negotiated cost, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"The gap between knowing and understanding" recurs as a conceptual timeframe but does not function as a live clock that tightens decisions. Elara "stepped through into something that felt like arriving home after a journey she hadn't known she was taking," but the transition is metaphorical and does not alter tactics or impose urgency. Setup and closure echo the phrase; middle development is absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "reawaken beauty in a mechanical world" is signaled early ("the city below ground its gears") and drives Elara's journey across bridges and into the orchard. It shapes her choice to play for "the beauty that had been buried beneath gears and efficiency." However, the desire is never conflicted on the page—no competing want or cost fractures her commitment—and the resolution is frictionless. Setup, middle, and closure participation are present but dramatization of internal friction is thin.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Tarnished wonder" is embodied throughout: "tarnished wonder" in the orchard description, "tarnished at the edges but shimmered with iridescence" (locust shell), and "shedding some of its tarnish" (fruit at closure). The tone modulates from searching melancholy to earned awe as pressure builds, and the final image charges the concept. The phrase appears in setup and closure with consistent sensory anchoring, and the closure reprise reweights prior material.</comment>
