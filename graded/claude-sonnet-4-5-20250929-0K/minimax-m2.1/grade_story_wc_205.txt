<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vespera's interior life is rendered with specificity—her "poet's heart" understanding storms, the vase shard teaching her to carry fragments without being cut. Her evolution from revolutionary to curator is embodied through concrete choices (covering mirrors methodically, touching the shard's edge) rather than summarized. The final decision to cover the final mirror while holding space for multiplicity shows contradictory impulses crystallizing into stance. Minor deduction: the revolutionary backstory remains somewhat abstract; we see the failure's residue but not the specific wound that reshaped her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Vespera in Archive Hall during visible-time era). The accumulative lens is taught early—visible time pooling, sediment imagery—and held through closure. Storm arrival tightens pressure; Vespera's glimpse of the founders as desperate refugees delivers a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the archaeological dispute with undeniable cost (official histories versus lived truth). The closure lands with felt consequence: her choice to cover the final mirror while imagining a civilization "learning to see itself clearly" forecloses the single-story demand of her failed revolution. Cost is legible in the renunciation of certainty and the acceptance of multiplicity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid's crystalline walls, amber-honey time pools, and brass warning pipes create a tactile world. Mirrors function as more than decoration—they constrain Vespera's storm protocol and concentrate temporal force, directly shaping her methodical covering actions. The vase shard's physical sharpness ("edges still sharp enough to draw blood") anchors both setting detail and thematic weight. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the eastern wing sequence. Minor gap: the "excavation quadrant seven" detail feels like a token nod to archaeological setting without further grounding the dig site's spatial relationship to Archive Hall.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the founders' true nature and what that truth means for civilization's self-conception—is signaled early through the archaeological dispute framing. Storm arrival creates immediate physical pressure (cover mirrors before temporal violence erupts), which braids with the epistemic question. The glimpse of hollow-eyed founders narrows options: Vespera can no longer hold the official heroic narrative. Her final choice to cover the mirror while accepting multiplicity forecloses her earlier revolutionary demand for "a single story, a single future"—a visible cost scaled appropriately to this length. The escalation proceeds through accumulative pressure (time's visibility, storm's approach, founders' revelation) rather than causal reversals, consistent with the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the vase shard, mirror protocol, and founder imagery rather than assertion. The piece explores how civilizations curate their pasts and the cost of holding singular versus multiple truths. The mirror-covering method serves as embodied metaphor: controlling reflection, managing what can be seen. The final image—"the kind of beautiful and terrible thing that covers its mirrors during storms and still chooses to look"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The piece earns its insight that "truth mattered less than what civilizations chose to make of their truths" through Vespera's concrete work and the founders' desperate image. Minor slip: "This one—this quiet work of devising methods..." briefly tilts toward thematic statement rather than letting the image carry full weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV maintains stable distance with Vespera's perceptual signature (poet's vocabulary, baroque architectural focus, temporal metaphors). The prose carries distinct texture: "visible time that pooled like amber honey," "burnished sorrow...grown smoother over the years." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the storm revelation. Two weaknesses prevent higher scoring: (1) "her poet's heart understanding" and similar filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy when directness would sharpen pressure; (2) register drifts slightly elevated in the penultimate paragraph ("This one—this quiet work...would succeed because it held space for multiplicity") where the diction feels more essay than embodied thought under storm conditions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong opening line and vivid imagery ("visible time...pooled like amber honey," "hollow-eyed and desperate, their escape pod cracked"). Information density is high; most sentences advance understanding or atmosphere. However, template cadence appears in the reflection-heavy fourth paragraph: "The mirrors were...," "She uncovered...," "The burnished sorrow..." creates a repetitive stem pattern. The penultimate paragraph contains conceptual loops—"a single story, a single future" / "multiplicity...baroque complexity...both lost and found"—where adjacent phrases restate rather than advance. The closure paragraph recovers with concrete imagery (cloth over mirror, imagined civilization). Deduction for template runs and thematic paraphrase, but artifacts do not obscure the closure image itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of visible time, archaeological dispute, and mirror-covering protocol as temporal mechanics feels fresh and specific to this voice. The piece transforms the "failed revolutionary finds new purpose" arc through the concrete particularity of baroque asteroid setting and time-as-substance physics. The vase shard carrying imagery of fleeing figures avoids stock symbolism by integrating physically (sharp edges, pocket weight) and causally (archaeological evidence). The mirror method—covering reflective surfaces to manage temporal storms—offers a non-obvious problem-solving approach that grows organically from world logic. Risk is present in the dense conceptual layering and accumulative structure. Minor deduction: the revolutionary backstory itself (demanding forgotten histories be spoken) uses familiar template language that the present-tense ingenuity elevates but does not fully escape.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vespera's identity as "defunct revolutionary" frames her opening chorus work and shapes her present methodical approach (trading one revolution for another). Her past failure to demand "a single story" directly motivates her final choice to hold space for multiplicity—a clear causal link. The element appears in setup (opening paragraph), develops through reflection on council skepticism (middle), and charges the closure (contrasting past and present revolutions). Cost is visible: she renounces certainty. Deduction for the revolutionary work remaining somewhat abstract rather than dramatized in specific past choices that echo present stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The vase shard is handled in three distinct beats: pocket touch noting sharp edges (paragraph 2), mid-storm reflection that it taught her to carry fragments without being cut (paragraph 5), and final touch at closure (paragraph 7). Its imagery (fleeing figures) provides archaeological evidence that reweights the dispute. Physical properties matter—sharpness warns against improper handling, creating embodied constraint. The object's presence charges the final realization about carrying multiplicity. Strong integration; minor gap: the shard enables but does not constrain a key tactical choice during storm protocol.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute (explorers versus refugees) is established early and provides the epistemic stake: what truth should be taught. Storm revelation shows founders as desperate, not victorious, directly answering the dispute. However, the dispute remains framing device rather than live conflict—no on-page scholars arguing, no immediate consequence of choosing one interpretation. Vespera's realization that "truth mattered less than what civilizations chose to make of their truths" responds to the dispute conceptually but the element itself does not constrain her mirror-covering choices or alter tactics. Functional setup and thematic payoff, but limited middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Poetically inclined" manifests in Vespera's metaphor-rich perception ("visible time...pooled like amber honey," "poet's heart understanding"), her association of mirrors with reflection/sight, and her final imagining of civilization "learning to see itself clearly." The trait colors voice and interpretive lens throughout. However, it does not visibly constrain or enable a key choice with cost—her mirror protocol succeeds through mechanical method, not poetic insight. The trait enriches texture and thematic resonance but remains more atmospheric than causal. Present across all three gates but functions as characterization layer rather than decision driver.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Devise" appears explicitly in the mirror-covering method: "It had taken her months to devise this method." The action grounds her present expertise (council trust, overlap reduction by seven-tenths) and enables the central storm sequence. Her devising work defines the present revolution as "quiet work of devising methods, covering mirrors, holding shards." The final choice to cover the mirror while holding multiplicity extends the devising ethos to civilization's self-conception. The element shapes both her credibility and the story's central metaphor (managing reflection). Strong integration across setup, middle credibility, and closure; not quite indispensable because the storm sequence could theoretically function without the devising backstory, though it would lose significant weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mirror-covering method is signaled early (paragraph 3: mirrors as conduits, covering as buffer), demonstrated through urgent action (draping mirrors across the eastern wing), and validated at closure (storm dissolves into decorative light, final mirror covered). The method's mechanics matter: uncovered mirrors pull past fragments into present, creating maddening overlaps; covered, they dissipate violence harmlessly. Council skepticism and seven-tenths overlap reduction establish stakes. The method enables Vespera's glimpse of the founders (she pauses before the final mirror) and charges the ending image. The element drives multiple beats, constrains her urgent choices, and shapes the final act. Very strong integration; slightly short of indispensable only because the core thematic work could theoretically survive without the specific mirror mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid provides distinctive atmosphere (crystalline walls, brass pipes, baroque corridors) and houses the archive and excavation quadrant. Time's visibility as environmental phenomenon creates the world's central pressure—time pooling, flowing backward during storms. The setting enables the mirror protocol (reflective surfaces, crystalline walls that absorb energy) and the archaeological dispute (excavation sites, founders' artifacts). However, setting details remain primarily atmospheric; no specific architectural feature constrains a tactical choice beyond the generic presence of mirrors. Strong setup and closure participation (crystalline walls absorbing storm energy), but middle development shows setting as stage rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after time becomes visible" structures the entire world logic and creates the archaeological dispute's urgency. Visible time is described concretely (pooling like honey, leaving footprint impressions, rewinding during storms) and motivates Vespera's mirror method. The element anchors orientation, enables the storm mechanics, and charges the revelation (seeing founders as they "truly were"). Three visible years equal eleven invisible ones—a conversion that tracks societal adjustment. The timeframe shapes every beat's stakes and enables the closure's conceptual repricing. Strong setup, pervasive middle involvement, and essential closure role. Not quite 8.5+ because the specific three-year duration does not itself constrain a choice; "after time becomes visible" would function equally well at any post-visibility moment.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vespera's desire to reimagine civilization appears in her curatorial role (holding forgotten histories), her work to understand the past, and her final realization that civilizations must learn to see themselves as "both, as all." The motivation is stated explicitly in the penultimate paragraph: holding both explorer and refugee narratives rather than demanding a single story. However, the motivation remains largely thematic claim rather than dramatized friction. No scene shows Vespera actively choosing between conflicting interpretations with visible cost until the very end. Setup present (revolution demanding histories be spoken), closure payoff clear (accepting multiplicity), but middle beats focus on mirror protocol rather than epistemic struggle. Functional integration with purposeful reprise, but not essential—the storm work could proceed without this framing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Burnished sorrow" is named explicitly in paragraph 5 and embodied throughout: Vespera's revolutionary failure residue, her walk through archive corridors with "temporary impressions," the vase shard teaching her to carry loss smoothly. The tone remains elegiac and contemplative even during urgent storm action, modulating intensity without breaking register. Metaphors reinforce the tone (amber honey, polished stone, baroque sediment). The final image—covering mirrors while choosing to look—crystallizes the burnished quality: sorrow acknowledged and managed, not erased. Tone charges closure effectively. Minor deduction: the explicit naming "burnished sorrow she carried had grown smoother" briefly tells rather than trusting the established atmospheric work.</comment>
