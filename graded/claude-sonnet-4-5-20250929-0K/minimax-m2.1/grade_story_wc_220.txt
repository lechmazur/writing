<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and particular—bloodhound sensory gifts, tactile cylinder reading—but the brother remains a voice-in-wax abstraction without contradiction or friction. The final "understanding" arrives as serene epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses a path; no visible cost attends the revelation. Embodied emotion is present in the leaf-handling and fingertip work, but the closure beat ("I knew with certainty") asserts resolution without dramatizing renunciation or stake-altering decision. Reflection dominates (~40% by line count) yet anchors concretely and interleaves with micro-choices (constructing the device, shifting methods), meeting the BRR expanded allowance; Q1 and Q5 remain uncapped.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph without penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases from scrapyard → cylinder construction → tactile decoding, culminating in the brother's message and dual-object closure image. Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final paragraph crystallizes the narrator's stance—waiting, translating distance—but the cost is asserted ("distance into closeness") rather than legible as forfeiture or tactical shift on the page. The cylinder's reveal does not narrow options or foreclose a live path; it confirms hope already held. One meaningful deepening (shift from scent-search to tactile reading) is present, meeting the textural lens threshold, but the cost-proof test fails—no exact sentence shows what the narrator sacrifices or loses in accepting this state.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The scrapyard wasteland and metal labyrinth ground action throughout; the cylinder as micro-object constrains the final beat (fingertip decoding). Sensory hierarchy is strong—bloodhound nose, tactile grooves, bruised sky—and filtered through scavenger priorities. Spatial choreography is clean and the post-war idiom ("harvests," salvaged chest, phonograph tech) remains consistent. The autumn leaf and cylinder return to charge the ending image, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that setting or recurring object constrain choice or charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find brother's message) is signaled early and pressure tightens once: the narrator shifts from scent-based search to tactile decoding, a meaningful turn under the textural lens. That turn arises from protagonist agency (months of device construction, trial methods) and demonstrates one escalation. However, the resolution lacks visible cost—unlocking the cylinder confirms existing hope rather than forcing a trade-off or foreclosing a pursuit. No live option is narrowed; the "wild hush" and waiting posture persist unchanged, limiting band entry to mid-6s under the escalation guardrails.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (love as translation, distance as illusion) emerges from the dual preserved objects and the textural riddle without thesis statement. The cylinder/leaf pairing reweights prior material—beauty surviving fire, encoded intimacy—and the brother's grooved message delivers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the physical decoding metaphor and the "wild hush" motif. The ending offers a non-literal answer (distance → closeness via wax and patience) that avoids sentimental summary, though the final certainty slightly softens ambiguity. No thematic echo penalty; the brother's words read as earned particular rather than prompt label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, and a distinct perceptual signature (bloodhound scent-reading, texture-as-language) maintain coherence. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated and consistent—no mid-paragraph head-hopping or register clash. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats. The narrator's way of noticing (composition of metals, ridge-and-valley meaning) is character-specific. Elision is purposeful (brother's departure → cylinder's hiding) and the revelation is paid off on the page. The final paragraph's slightly uniform cadence and reliance on "understood" / "knew" verbal stems reduce propulsion slightly but do not obscure clarity or break voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language (wound, memory, bottled messages, seed metaphor) is vivid and mostly coherent, though "tinted revelations" in paragraph three feels like unexplained ornament. Minor template cadence in the final paragraph: "The riddle... resolved," "I sat... holding," "He had left... had searched" creates a slight drumbeat without payoff. No filter-verb stacks or therapy-speak in peak beats. Propulsion remains strong through the decoding sequence; the closure image is clear. Overall craft is solid with minor rhythmic uniformity at the end preventing higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The tactile-decoding twist on the phonograph cylinder and the dual-preservation motif (leaf/wax, grooves/love) offer fresh synthesis. The post-resource-war scrapyard is specific rather than generic dystopia, and the bloodhound sensory gift particularizes the scavenger role. The transformation test holds: plot and emotional arc depend on these exact choices. However, the "love as translation" and "distance as illusion" formulations verge on abstraction without a final counter-pressure or moral trade-off to sharpen the thematic calculus. Risk-taking is present (lyric pacing, extended reflection) and heightens coherence without obscuring clarity, meriting +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Bloodhound-retired-from-bodies is seeded early (paragraph one) and enables the scent-reading skill, but the actual turn (tactile decoding) does not require the "retired from finding bodies" backstory; generic scavenger expertise would suffice. The trait informs voice and motivation but does not create a key decision or constraint. Present and functional, but the "bodies" detail is swappable with minor edits. Two gates (setup, development via scent skill); no closure-specific payoff where the retirement history itself matters. Mid-band cap at ~4.6 for missing irreplaceable pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Autumn leaf appears in three beats: paragraph one (memory anchor), final paragraph reprise (dual-object image), and implicit throughout as brother's gift. It seeds the preservation-as-proof motif and charges the ending by pairing with the cylinder. However, the leaf is not handled or used in the middle escalation; it bookends rather than constrains a choice. Setup + payoff gates met; development gate weak. The lyric reprise reweights the stake (beauty survives fire) with cost in the waiting posture, reaching the allowance ceiling of ~6.3 for two-gate resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Tinted revelations" is named once in paragraph three and realized in the tactile-decoding turn: the narrator stops playing sound and reads texture, unlocking hidden meaning. This shapes the key escalation and closure mechanism. However, "tinted" remains ornamental—color does not operate on the page; the actual method is tactile, not optical. Setup is late (second third), development is present (fingertip reading), payoff is direct (message unlocked). Three gates met but specificity is weak; "hidden revelations" would work identically. Causal role in one major beat; swappable metaphor limits the band to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Intuitively" is seeded early (bloodhound nose, "intuitiveness that had made me valuable") and enables two beats: scent-based salvage work and the tactile shift when scent fails. The trait constrains the middle attempt (scent alone is insufficient) and enables the final method (trained fingertips read texture like braille). Cost is present: months of device construction and trial. All three gates met (setup paragraph one, development in failed methods, payoff in tactile success). The attribute drives escalation and closure participation with visible effort, but the trait itself is slightly generic (many scavengers could be "intuitive"). Strong two-beat involvement lifts it into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Riddle" anchors the cylinder mystery from paragraph two and the resolution beat in paragraph three: "The riddle of the cylinder resolved itself not as a puzzle to solve but as a door that opened when I stopped trying to force it." This reframes the conflict (from decryption task to intimate understanding) and enables the thematic closure. Setup early, development through failed "every method" attempts, payoff explicit in the resolution sentence. The riddle concept is essential to the accumulative pressure and the reweighting at closure; removing it collapses the narrative logic. Three gates met with strong causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Phonograph cylinder with secret grooves is seeded in paragraph two, attempted "every method" mid-story, and the tactile-reading mechanism is paid off in paragraph three's decoding sequence. The grooves' physical geography (ridges, valleys, stylus pressure) matters on the page and cannot be swapped. Setup, development (months of device construction, failed playback), and payoff (fingertip reading) all present. The method is causally indispensable: it drives the escalation and delivers the brother's message, charging the closure image. High specificity (wax, spiral, braille-like texture) and beat involvement across all three phases merit high-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Scrapyard settlement and cracked wasteland frame the entire story and supply the salvaged chest, phonograph parts, and post-war scarcity that motivate the search. The setting is present throughout and provides resources (scrap tech) that affect outcome. However, the setting does not pressure a choice at closure—the final revelation occurs in the narrator's hands, not because of spatial constraint. Setup immediate, development functional (materials sourced from scrap), but payoff is weak; the "twisted metal and rusted remains" in the final paragraph are backdrop, not active constraint. Two gates met with modest causal involvement; mid-5s for functional resource supply without closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the last resource war" and "seven harvests ago" establish time and scarcity, shaping the stakes (brother missing, knowledge lost). The timeframe motivates the cylinder's preservation and the settlement's tech limits. However, time does not tighten decisions on the page—no live clock or deadline pressures the final decoding. Setup clear, development implicit (years of silence, months of construction), but no payoff where elapsed time alters tactics or cost at closure. Two gates met; the temporal frame is consistent and thematic but functionally swappable with any post-collapse window. Functional-replaceable band, capped near 4.8 for missing closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Translate distance into closeness" is explicit in the brother's grooved message (paragraph three) and motivates the seven-harvest search and the narrator's final waiting posture. The desire is dramatized through months of device work and method-switching, with friction between hope and silence. Setup appears late (brother's motive revealed in the decoded message), but development and payoff are strong: the narrator accepts the encoded intimacy and mirrors the waiting. The motivation shapes the thematic closure and is irreplaceable. Late setup costs −0.3; strong payoff and causal pressure lift it into mid-6s despite the delayed explicit statement.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Wild hush" appears twice: paragraph one (post-war silence "louder than bombs") and final paragraph ("seemed to breathe with his presence"). Tone is coherent—contemplative, patient, elegiac—and modulates with the tactile discovery without breaking into triumph or despair. The hush charges the final image by reweighting silence from absence to connection. Setup early, payoff strong, but middle development is thin; the tone remains static through the decoding sequence rather than shifting with pressure. Two gates met with a charged reprise that reweights the stake; lyric resonance lifts it to low-6s.</comment>
