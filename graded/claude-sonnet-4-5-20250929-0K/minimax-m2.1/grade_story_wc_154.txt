<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's interiority is specific and embodied—the anesthetic softening, the translator's instinct to witness—but the pivotal "grafting" moment lacks visible cost or contradiction. Her choice to decode the cast is unobstructed; no competing impulse or foreclosed path appears on the page. The phrase "shrewdly innocent" is labeled but never dramatized through an on-page tradeoff. Fatima's touch and the grandmother's relief are concrete, but Elira's arc feels more observational than transformative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through layered translation and the coral-fragment motif, closing on a resonant image (Elira pressing the cast, feeling shared grief). Cost is implied—she will return the cast, relinquishing witness—but the price lacks sharp on-page consequence; no option narrows, no tactic shifts. The atrium-to-bedside transition is legible, the anesthetic frame holds, and the closure image reweights prior material, satisfying RR (Charged Poise). One meaningful deepening is present, sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and anesthetic haze anchor orientation early and filter perception throughout. The brain coral fragment is handled twice (opening and close), constraining Elira's reflective stance and charging the final image with "living architecture that built itself from damage." Spatial choreography (atrium → bedside) remains clear. The setting does not pressure a middle choice directly, but the recurring coral motif and twilight-mist frame shape the closure image, meeting the 9+ test narrowly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: translating Fatima's trauma into testimony. The request from Dr. Okonkwo initiates movement, and Elira's decoding reweights the grandmother's grief, but no live option narrows or trades off on the page. The child's touch and smudged notes deepen meaning, yet Elira never encounters friction—no rival interpretation, no cost to speaking the truth. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but lacks a visible tightening that forecloses a path. One deepening is present, sufficient for band entry, but the felt price remains oblique.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—witness, translation as healing, damage becoming reef—emerges from coral, cast, and Elira's translator identity without overt statement. The final image ("lotus-hearted and ancient, beautiful in its terrible persistence") offers a non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in Fatima's silence and the grandmother's weeping. No thematic echo or moralizing intrudes. The "shrewdly innocent" label hovers as tell rather than dramatized tension, and the coral metaphor risks over-curation, but the ending reweights prior material with earned poignancy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (translator's ear, anesthetic blur) is consistent. Diction is elevated ("gauze of evening fog," "lotus-hearted ache") and voice-motivated, though some phrases verge on ornament ("terrible poetry given context and care"). Filter verbs ("she understood," "she was known for") slightly dull immediacy but remain voice-appropriate. Dialogue is minimal (Dr. Okonkwo's single line) and functional. The final paragraph's recursive lyricism ("an ache that was lotus-hearted and ancient") charges the closure without obscuring it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"pacific conflict-zone," "vernacular of shrapnel," "unknotting," "lotus-hearted ache"—and several metaphors crowd peak beats without clear pattern-teaching. "Lotus-hearted" and "terrible persistence" in the final line feel over-wrought. Template cadence appears in the backstory block: "She had been… her body now spoke… she had not chosen… but here she was." Paraphrase loop: "the coral fragment seemed to pulse… a piece of living architecture that built itself from damage" restates prior framing. Information density is moderate; some lines ornament rather than advance. No major causality break, but pervasive elevation and synonym churn lower momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The coral-as-healing-architecture and translator-as-witness synthesis feels purposeful but not surprising; the emotional territory (trauma recovery, cross-generational testimony) is well-worn. The anesthetic-haze frame and smudged-cast mechanic offer specific texture. "Shrewdly innocent" remains a label without fresh dramatization. The ending's lyric turn is competent but does not transform the premise in hindsight. Risk-taking is moderate—lyric accumulation and reflection-led mode are handled cleanly but do not radically heighten stakes. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira (pacific conflict-zone translator) is present throughout and her translator identity shapes the decoding action. Her choices (approaching the bedside, translating aloud, deciding to return the cast) create the story's key turns. However, her professional skill resolves a problem (smudged notes) it did not help create, and no on-page tradeoff or constrained decision dramatizes her unique capability under pressure. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (approach, translate, decide) +0.9, causal pressure (enables understanding) +0.8, closure linkage (final decision to return cast) +0.9, specificity (translator skill) +0.5; swappability (a different empathetic professional could plausibly perform the same arc) −0.6, resolves without having caused −0.9. Total neighborhood ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Brain coral fragment appears in paragraph 1 (cool against palm, opening anchor) and paragraph 8 ("seemed to pulse with its own quiet warmth"). The reprise reweights the healing/damage metaphor but does not constrain a choice or alter Elira's tactics between appearances. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (metaphor recharge in penultimate paragraph, not final action) +0.5, lyric resonance +0.4; ornamental use (no action pressure) −0.8, swappability (another symbol of resilience would fit) −0.6. Total neighborhood ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Shared anxieties (Elira's shrapnel/healing body language, Fatima's trauma, grandmother's distress) frame thematic context but do not shape on-page stakes or alter tactics. The concept is echoed rather than dramatized as a decision point. Present by implication throughout, but no choice hinges on recognizing or navigating shared anxiety. Early presence +0.5, thematic coherence +0.4; ornamental/thematic-only use −1.0, swappability −0.6. Total neighborhood ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is labeled in paragraph 3 ("capable of reading… yet somehow retaining a purity of hope") but never dramatized through an on-page tradeoff or constrained action. No choice reveals the tension between shrewdness and innocence; the trait remains asserted. Early signal +0.4; label-only −0.9, no beat involvement −0.0, no causal pressure −0.0, no closure linkage −0.0, swappability (generic "hopeful realist" label) −0.6. Total neighborhood ~2.4, rounded to 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Unknotting: Elira "unknotting needed to begin" (Wolof decoding), and the piece's central action is deciphering layered messages to recover testimony. The action is signaled mid-story, drives the translation beat, and enables the grandmother's relief. However, the unknotting is completed in one contiguous passage without escalation or setback. Early-middle signal +0.5, one major beat +0.4, causal pressure (enables understanding, changes grandmother's state) +1.0, closure linkage (the cast's story is recovered, shaping Elira's final decision) +0.9, specificity (requires translator skill) +0.6; late signal (second third) −0.3, summary-dominant (much of the decoding is recounted dialogue) −0.5. Total neighborhood ~6.7, rounded to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Decrypting smudged notes on a child's cast: the method is signaled when Dr. Okonkwo requests help, executed in paragraphs 5–7 (Elira translating Arabic, French, Wolof, child's drawings), and its result (recovered testimony) directly shapes the closure decision. However, the decryption faces no resistance or ambiguity; the notes yield immediately. Early-middle signal +0.5, one major beat (the translation passage) +0.4, causal pressure (enables recovery of testimony) +0.9, closure linkage (recovered story motivates return of cast) +0.9, specificity (unique method) +0.7; no middle complication or failed attempt −0.0, swappability (another forensic or empathetic method might substitute) −0.5. Total neighborhood ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium at twilight: present in paragraph 1 (opening anchor) and final paragraph ("as the mist thickened and the atrium lights warmed"). The setting frames Elira's reflective state but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Early signal +0.7, closure reprise +0.6, lyric resonance +0.4; ornamental (postcard mood) −0.9, no action pressure −0.0, swappability (another quiet recovery setting) −0.6. Total neighborhood ~4.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>After the anesthetic kicks in: timeframe is signaled in paragraph 1 ("After the anesthetic kicks in, the world had taken on this softened quality") and filters Elira's perception throughout. However, no ticking clock tightens decisions, and the anesthetic haze remains static rather than escalating or fading. Early signal +0.7, perceptual filter across beats +0.5; no tactical pressure from time −0.0, ornamental/mood-only −0.8, swappability (another mild dissociative state) −0.6. Total neighborhood ~3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>To graft new meaning onto old wounds: motivation is explicitly named in paragraph 7 ("grafting new meaning onto old wounds now, taking the scattered, terrified marks… and weaving them into a story"). The desire drives Elira's translation and her final choice to return the cast. However, the grafting is announced rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices or visible cost. Mid-story signal +0.3, one beat (translation passage) +0.4, causal pressure (shapes translation framing) +0.7, closure linkage (motivates return) +0.7, specificity +0.5; label-heavy / tell-dominant −0.8, no friction between want and cost −0.0, late explicit statement (second half) −0.3. Total neighborhood ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Lotus-hearted ache: tone is elegiac and tender throughout, cohering through the anesthetic haze, the coral metaphor, and Elira's witness stance. The phrase "lotus-hearted ache" appears only in the final sentence, but the ache (Elira's body language, Fatima's trauma, grandmother's weeping) and the lotus image (beauty from damage, coral architecture) thread the piece. The final line crystallizes tone and charges the closure image. Closure charge +1.2, coherent modulation (tender restraint under pressure) +0.9, specificity +0.6; single explicit mention (final line only) −0.4, risk of over-curation −0.2. Total neighborhood ~6.1.</comment>
