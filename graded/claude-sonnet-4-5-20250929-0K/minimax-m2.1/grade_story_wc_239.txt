<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara exists only as a container for abstract movement through conceptual space. No contradictory impulses, embodied emotion, or micro-choices under pressure appear on the page. The "journeying inward while walking out" remains pure assertion without dramatized internal conflict or cost. No choice forecloses a path or reveals a hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchored by ~120 words; no penalty. The piece teaches a lyric/accumulative pattern but delivers no closure unit—no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost. The final paragraph repeats earlier description without narrowing options, changing knowledge, or reweighting the premise. Cost proof test fails: no on-page sentence makes a price legible at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The Archive is vividly rendered with purposeful detail (spiraling galleries, stones predating light, golden helix). However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Elara moves through it without friction. The dictionary is carried but not opened or used. Spatial choreography remains coherent, but setting functions as postcard description rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>No dominant stake is dramatized—observation replaces decision throughout. The Spiral of Arbitration is described but never engaged; no reversal or tightening choice narrows options. The piece delivers pure accumulation of atmosphere without escalation, agency, or a trade-off that forecloses a path. Coincidence does not complicate because nothing is at risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from images (archive, dying stars, spiral, dictionary as talisman) without overt statement. However, the final paragraph offers no resonant, non-literal answer to a central question; it simply restates the opening's meditation. The piece gestures toward paradox resolution but never dramatizes it or imposes cost, leaving theme abstract rather than earned through specific experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single POV; stable distance and tense; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and carries a distinct lyric texture ("breathless interval," "resounding hush"). However, the prose relies on elevated register throughout without modulation under pressure, and perceptual signature remains generic contemplation rather than character-particular noticing. Filter verbs ("she had learned") appear but do not dull immediacy given the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings show variety. Paraphrase loop across final two sentences: both describe simultaneous inward/outward movement using near-identical structure without added pressure (−0.4). Figurative density is high but consistent with lyric mode and taught early; no mixed metaphors. Information density is moderate; many lines do atmospheric work without advancing choice or knowledge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The Archive and cosmic-scale contemplation echo familiar speculative templates (final witness, library at universe's end). "Journeying inward while walking out" is a recognizable paradox trope. The piece commits fully to its lyric register but does not transform the premise through specific lived detail, non-obvious moral calculus, or a fresh synthesis. Voice is coherent but the concept feels derivative without a payoff that reweights prior material.</comment>
