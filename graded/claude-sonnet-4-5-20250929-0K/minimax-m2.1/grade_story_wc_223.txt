<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to archive small gestures is established, and her interiority shows embodied grief through the walking patterns and chessboard handling. However, the character reads more as a conceptual vehicle than a fully contradictory presence—her "benevolently ruthless efficiency" is stated but never generates an on-page dilemma where care conflicts with triage. The sister's absence drives the action, but Mira's choices feel pre-decided; she walks patterns and releases sound without internal friction or a moment where competing impulses force a visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early through the walking-archive conceit and maintains it to closure. Orientation anchors (whispering gallery, interregnum, Mira) arrive within the first paragraph. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira walks "beginning" and releases her sister's name, a shift from holding to letting go—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible in a specific forfeited action or choice. The interregnum framing and acoustic-space logic cohere without contradiction, earning mid-7s, but the final image's cost is felt more than visible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The whispering gallery functions as both setting and constraint: the dome's acoustic properties enable Mira's archival method and charge the final release of her sister's name. The chessboard's fire scars and missing pawns ground the interregnum in tactile detail. Spatial choreography (gallery center, dome curves, corners) remains clear, and sensory selection (footsteps scattering into whispers, "luminous absence") supports tone without catalog excess. The setting directly shapes the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—releasing the sister's memory—is signaled early and remains coherent. Mira's movement from spelling the sister's name "one final time" to spelling "beginning" constitutes a single tightening under the Accumulative lens, sufficient at this length. However, the escalation lacks a visible tradeoff or cost on the page; the shift from holding to releasing is declared rather than dramatized through a contested choice. The interregnum provides ambient pressure but does not force Mira to forfeit a live option, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the stranger's water bottle, the mother's song, the old man's doorway defiance anchor "small gestures" without moralizing. The final walk spelling "beginning" reweights prior material—shifting from elegy to continuity—without stating a thesis. Minor penalty: "the space between endings held everything that mattered" and "absence could hold its own meaning" edge toward articulation of theme in the penultimate paragraph, reducing the resonance of the final image slightly. Still, the chessboard's "waiting" carries genuine ambiguity and cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable, and the prose carries a consistent lyric-textural signature ("benevolently ruthless efficiency," "nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence"). Diction remains elevated but voice-coherent throughout. However, register drift appears in peak moments: "the acknowledgment that absence could hold its own meaning, its own weight, its own terrible light" slips into philosophical exposition that feels externally imposed rather than filtered through Mira's lived perception. The piece remains clean in mechanics and free of head-hopping, but the narrator occasionally assists comprehension rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening and middle sections. However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "The way a stranger…The way a mother…The way an old man" constitutes a three-beat anaphora that reads ornamental rather than pattern-taught, and the final paragraph recycles "the small gestures, the unbound memories, the nomadic shadows" in list form without new pressure. Mixed metaphor: "luminous absence" recurs five times, diluting its charge. Figurative density in the final third (terrible light, fractured voices, acoustic curves) approaches overwriting without clear payoff. Deductions: paraphrase loop −0.4, template cadence −0.5, figurative density without pattern-teaching −0.4, totaling approximately −1.3 within Q7's accumulation cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The whispering-gallery archive and footstep-spelling method offer a fresh synthesis of space and grief. The interregnum setting and crisis-actor-turned-survivor frame bring specificity. However, the emotional arc—survivor archives loss, then releases it—follows a familiar template, and the piece does not transform it through a non-obvious moral calculus or embodied cost that would surprise in hindsight. The chessboard and acoustic particulars elevate, but the core movement from holding to letting go lacks the inevitability or risk that would reach high originality bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The character is present throughout and her crisis-actor/survivor duality is seeded early. She walks the patterns (action), but the dual identity does not create a key turn or constrain a choice with visible cost. The attribute is more thematic backdrop than causal lever. Present in all three gates but remains functional-replaceable; a grief-stricken archivist without the crisis-actor detail would yield the same arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The chessboard appears in paragraph two (setup), returns in the final paragraph (closure participation), and its missing pawns are tied to irreplaceable loss. It is handled on the page ("carried under her arm," "sat where she had placed it") and charged with meaning ("waiting…a kind of hope"). However, it does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics; its role is lyric-resonant rather than causally active. Two-gate presence (setup + closure reprise) with thematic reweighting earns mid-6s under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Nomadic penumbra" appears once in paragraph three as a label for Mira's condition ("the nomadic penumbra of her existence had taught her that crisis was not a location but a condition"). It does not shape on-page stakes, constrain choices, or return at closure. The concept is philosophically consistent with the interregnum and her walking, but its integration is ornamental—a thematic gloss rather than a causal force. Present but replaceable; deduct for late arrival (second third) and summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Benevolently ruthless" is stated in paragraph two ("She moved through the gallery with the benevolently ruthless efficiency of someone who understood that triage meant choosing who could be saved"). The trait aligns with her triage past and her archival selectivity, but it does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost—no moment shows her choosing what to save versus what to release in a way that dramatizes the tension. Label-only mention without causal work; functional but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unbind" appears in paragraph three ("She had learned to unbind herself from the need to classify events as before and after, as real and performed") and implicitly recurs in the final release of her sister's name. The action is thematic and seeds the ending's letting-go gesture. However, it is presented as completed learning rather than an on-page struggle; the unbinding does not drive a turn so much as describe a pre-existing state. Setup + closure linkage present, but the action is more reported than dramatized in a contested beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The walking-pattern method is introduced in the opening line, demonstrated in paragraph three (spelling the sister's name), and paid off in the final paragraph (spelling "beginning"). Its mechanics—footsteps traced into acoustic curves—directly enable the archive and shape the closure image. The method appears in all three gates, drives at least two distinct beats (sister's name, "beginning"), and is causally indispensable to Mira's archival project. The specificity of the whispering gallery's acoustics makes the method irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is named in the opening line, its acoustic properties explained and used throughout (dome scattering whispers, sound traveling to corners), and it directly enables the closure action (releasing the sister's name into the curves). The setting is not merely backdrop—it provides the unique resource (acoustic transmission) that makes Mira's archive possible and charges the final image. Setup, development (middle walking beats), and closure participation all present; causal pressure and irreplaceability are high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The interregnum is seeded in the opening paragraph, recurs in the basement-waiting flashback (middle reflection), and is invoked in the final paragraph ("During the interregnum, she had learned that the space between endings held everything that mattered"). It provides the historical pressure and frames the stakes (transition chaos, loss of the sister), but it does not function as a live clock tightening on-page decisions. The timeframe is thematic context rather than an active constraint on tactics. Setup + thematic closure participation earns mid-6s; lacks middle escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "become the historian of small gestures" is stated in paragraph three and demonstrated through the examples (water bottle, song, doorway defiance). It drives Mira's archival walking and the choice to release her sister's name. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in a moment of conflicted choice—no on-page beat shows friction between preserving and releasing. Setup + closure relevance present, but the motivation remains summary-level rather than enacted under pressure. Solid integration but lacks visible cost tied to the want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" recurs five times and anchors the tonal palette: the sister's missing response, the chessboard's empty ranks, the space between sound and hearing. Tone modulates subtly from elegiac density in the opening to the quieter "beginning" at closure, supporting the shift from holding to releasing. However, overuse in the final third risks becoming a tic rather than a charged reprise. The tone is coherent through turns and directly charges the final image, meeting development and closure gates, but repetition without escalation prevents higher scores.</comment>
