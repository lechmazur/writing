<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kira's motivation is stated ("patient revolution," "sculpting patience from impatience") but never tested by a concrete on-page choice with visible cost. Interior life consists largely of poetic declarations ("unyoke herself," "restrained wildness") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The climactic moment—placing her palm on the viaduct—carries no dramatized struggle or trade-off, only abstract "unyoking" of energies. No genuine flaw or limit shapes her actions; she succeeds without friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored by the opening paragraph (−0 penalty). The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens through ritual observation and lunar tracking, but the closure moment ("unyoking the ancient energies") remains abstract declaration rather than a legible Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. The final paragraph asserts transformation ("changes that no other cartographer would think to map") without showing what has altered on the page or what Kira has forfeited. Cost Proof Test: no exact sentence makes cost legible at the ending beat (−0.6).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("warmth that rose from deep within the earth," "ice spoke in groans and cracks"). Spatial choreography is clear and the lake's reflective properties function in the moon-path tracking. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Kira moves freely, and the setting remains decorative backdrop rather than a pressure point that shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("patient revolution") is declared but never dramatized as a live dilemma with competing options. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows Kira's choices; she proceeds from observation to ritual completion without obstacle or cost. The climax—releasing "ancient energies"—occurs without resistance, error, or price, reducing escalation to a ceremonial enactment rather than a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of patience versus restlessness is repeatedly stated ("sculpting patience from impatience," "revolution was never measured in seasons alone") rather than emerging from concrete events. The ending asserts thematic payoff ("horizons could only be crossed by those who had learned to wait") in near-prompt language without a resonant, non-literal image that reweights prior material. The final paragraph summarizes the theme rather than dramatizing it through specific action or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and controlled, with a consistent elevated register ("unyoke," "restrained wildness," "softly purposeful"). Distance remains stable in third-person limited. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("revolution was never measured in seasons alone") and the prose relies on stock poetic gestures ("silver fire," "ancient beast from an era before names"). One typo: "andshifted" (paragraph 3) disrupts flow at a key sensory beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several paraphrase loops appear: paragraph 2's "viaduct hummed" / "frequency she felt" restates the same sensory input, and paragraph 4's "unyoking begin" / "unyoke the ancient energies" cycles synonym churn (−0.4). Template cadence in paragraph 3: "Each night she unyoke herself… sitting… reading…" stacks three participial actions in formulaic sequence (−0.4). Figurative language ("ribs of some ancient beast," "mirror of silver fire") crowds several beats without clear payoff, trending toward decorative overwriting (−0.3).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The core premise—solitary cartographer unlocking ancient magnetic energies through lunar observation—synthesizes fantasy tropes (hidden nexus, dormant power) without a fresh angle. The "patient revolution" framing feels prompt-derived rather than organically character-driven, and the climax follows a predictable arc: discovery → ritual → transformation. Emotional specificity is absent; Kira's interior remains generic ("restless energy," "patient revolution") without lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kira is present throughout and her role as horizon mapper frames the opening, but her actual choices do not create key turns. She observes, tracks, and enacts a ritual without on-page decision points or visible cost. The "vigilant" trait appears in her careful measurement but does not constrain or enable a pivotal action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The magnetic viaduct appears in paragraph 2 (discovery), paragraph 4 (approach and touch), and the final paragraph (unyoking completion). It shapes two beats and participates in the ending, but its mechanics remain abstract ("hummed with a frequency," "song growing stronger") rather than causally active. The viaduct is essential to the plot but not irreplaceable; a similar locus could serve the same function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Patient revolution" is stated explicitly multiple times but never dramatized as a stake that alters tactics. It remains a thematic label rather than a concept that shapes on-page choices. The story tells us Kira has pledged herself to this revolution, but we never see her weigh competing options or pay a visible cost tied to patience versus impatience.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Softly purposeful" appears twice as a descriptor of Kira's movements but does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost. It functions as atmospheric flavor rather than a trait that creates friction or opportunity. Label-only use without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unyoke" appears in paragraph 3 (unyoke from distractions), paragraph 4 (the unyoking begins), and the final paragraph (unyoking the ancient energies). It frames the climactic action and recurs with evolving meaning. However, the action itself is abstract and easily swappable with "release," "unlock," or "free" without structural change. It shapes the ending but is not mechanically or causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Tracking moon paths is signaled in paragraph 3 ("tracking moon paths across the frozen lake's surface") and used in the method description. It appears again in paragraph 4 when "the viaduct's magnetic song rose to meet the moon path she had been tracking." The mechanics are mentioned but not enacted in detail; we do not see her adjust her tracking or face friction in the method. It shapes one key connection (viaduct meeting moon path) but remains somewhat ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake are introduced in the opening, anchor every scene, and provide the warm stone Kira touches in paragraph 4. The setting is essential to atmosphere and supplies the viaduct's physical form. However, it does not pressure Kira's choices or alter her tactics; she navigates it freely without constraint. The setting is integral to the story's identity but functions more as stage than obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the lake freezes over" anchors the opening and the ice's state recurs in sensory detail ("groaned and shifted beneath its white skin"). The timeframe is present but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. Kira works "through the longest night of the year" in the final paragraph, but no live clock pressures her actions or alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To sculpt patience from impatience" is stated in paragraph 3 and echoed in the final image ("the kind of person who could see the destination in the journey itself"). The motivation is told but never dramatized through conflicting wants and costs. We do not see Kira struggle between impatience and patience in any on-page choice; the transformation is asserted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Restrained wildness" appears in paragraph 4 and the tone sustains a controlled, elevated register throughout. The prose modulates between observation and ritual enactment, and the final image attempts to charge the restraint-release dynamic. However, tone remains static; no meaningful shift in cadence or intensity marks the climactic moment, and the ending's declarative summary flattens rather than heightens pressure.</comment>
