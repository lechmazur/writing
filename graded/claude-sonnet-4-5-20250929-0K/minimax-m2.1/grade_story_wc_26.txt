<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is richly textured with concrete contradictions—she preserves hope while feeling "luminous regret," handles the river stone to remember weight. The character's motivations are established early and her micro-choices (pausing at the footage, choosing not to probe memory gaps) reveal hierarchy of values. However, the work itself remains abstract; we never see her gather hope fragments in a way that forces a choice with visible cost. The ending renews her vigil without dramatizing a path foreclosed or a stance crystallized through on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when adequately by the second paragraph (blooming library, Mira, after the Unbinding). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story deepens through layered reflections and recurring images (river stone, mother's dissolution, blossoms) rather than because/therefore turns. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final image of Mira continuing her vigil, but the cost remains implied rather than legible on the page—no option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) does not apply here; anchors arrive early enough. The accumulative design is taught, but the final cadence shift does not reweight the dominant stake with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds is vivid and purposeful, grounding Mira's work in a space where "blossoms grow from the ether itself, petals glowing with stored memory." The river stone functions as micro-setting, handled in multiple beats and charged with tactile memory. Spatial choreography is clear (aisles, suspended dream-frames, footage viewer). The setting constrains Mira's role and charges the final image of her walking the aisles, meeting the 9+ gate. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her dusk-noticer perspective.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the shape of hope as it transforms—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation remains abstract: Mira watches footage and reflects, but no live option narrows on the page. The "argument" she is building has no on-page recipient or test. The piece deepens our understanding of the Unbinding and hope's metamorphosis, consistent with Accumulative/Textural lens, but the final beat does not tighten options or force a trade-off. Agency is present (she continues her vigil) but the cost is conceptual rather than felt in a moment that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between bound and unbound hope, old tactile memory versus new radiant abstraction. The river stone, mother's dissolution, and blossoms accrue meaning without overt statement. The ending offers a resonant reconfiguration: "preserving the shape of hope in her quietly luminous way" reweights prior material without moralizing. The "argument" Mira builds—that hope is transforming, not diminishing—arises from specific images (apples from particular trees, child's dream, mother's unmaking). The piece invites reflection on loss and metamorphosis without forcing a thesis, and the recurring motifs (stone warmth, luminous regret) deepen rather than decorate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable and controlled throughout. The narrative voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: "sharp eyes catching the way hope accumulated in corners," "luminous regret that hung around certain frames like halos." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close when Mira touches the stone, wider when describing the Unbinding's history). Diction remains within the focalizer's plausible lexicon—poetic but grounded in her role as archivist. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose reflects Mira's contemplative mind under sustained attention rather than crisis pressure, and the rhythmic control supports the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentences vary in structure and rhythm, supporting the contemplative accumulative design. Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or thematic texture. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "She understood this footage intimately because she had been the one to archive it, though she could not remember the archiving itself, only the afterward" restates the memory-gap concept already established. "She neither confirmed nor denied these rumors; she simply continued her softly deliberate work" adds minimal new pressure. Template cadence in the penultimate paragraph ("She had always been sharp-eyed about dusk, about the moments when one thing became another, when the bound and unbound touched at their edges") stacks parallel clauses without clear propulsion. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase and template artifacts that dull momentum in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—archiving dreams and tracking hope's evolution after humanity sheds physical form—offers a fresh synthesis of memory-keeper and post-human transformation. The blooming library above clouds, river stone as last tactile anchor, and "dusk noticer" role feel specific rather than generic. However, the emotional arc (solitary curator preserving fragments of a lost world) echoes familiar elegiac templates without a bold structural or moral surprise. The piece commits fully to its lyric, reflective mode and resists safety-hedging, but the central turn—Mira continuing her vigil—feels anticipated rather than inevitable in hindsight. No risk penalty applies; the execution is competent within its chosen register.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is identified as "a dusk noticer, one of the few who remained attuned to the liminal hours when day surrendered to night." The trait appears in setup and is referenced at closure ("she had always been sharp-eyed about dusk, about the moments when one thing became another"). However, her sharp-eyed noticing does not create a key turn or constrain a choice with cost on the page. She observes and reflects but does not decide differently because of this attribute in a way that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The element is functional—logically present in her role—but replaceable with "careful observer" or similar without structural loss. Meets two gates (setup, closure mention) but lacks middle development and causal pressure. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; final score 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The river stone appears in multiple beats: introduced early ("her only artifact from the age of bodies"), handled mid-story ("she pressed her palm against its cool weight"), and returns at closure ("The river stone in her pocket grew warmer as she worked"). It carries reweighted meaning (cool → warm, memory anchor → active witness) and is irreplaceable as the last tactile object. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Mira does not choose differently because of the stone. Meets all three gates (setup, middle, closure) and shows specificity, but lacks causal pressure. Score 5.8 for purposeful early–final reprise with reweighted meaning but no decision linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"A shadow unbound" appears thematically throughout: "humanity had been shedding its shadows," "shadows still clung to their former owners," "their shadows dispersed entirely into light." The concept frames the world and stakes (documenting the Unbinding). However, it does not shape a specific on-page choice or tactic; it remains thematic backdrop rather than active constraint. The footage of the mother "dissolving into luminous threads" concretizes the concept in one beat, lifting it above pure theme. Meets setup and is present in multiple beats, but lacks middle choice constraint and closure participation beyond thematic echo. Score 4.8 for functional presence across beats without causal pressure on a decision.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" is introduced early ("Mira moved through aisles...with softly deliberate steps") and repeated at closure ("her softly deliberate work," "her quietly luminous way"). The trait colors her manner but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. She does not choose deliberateness over speed in a moment where the trade-off matters, nor does the trait prevent a faster option that would carry different stakes. Meets setup and closure gates; label appears in action description but lacks middle development through a forced choice. Score 5.1 for consistent presence without dramatized cost or enabling pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" (British spelling "metamorphose" as noun, or intended verb "metamorphosis") appears explicitly: "not a loss but a metamorphose of tremendous significance." The concept shapes Mira's argument about hope transforming rather than diminishing, driving her work and final stance. The mother's dissolution and humanity's shedding of shadows exemplify metamorphosis in multiple beats. However, the action itself (the ongoing transformation) is backdrop; Mira does not enact or witness a metamorphosis that changes her options on the page. The element is central thematically and present across beats, but the major turn (Mira's continued vigil) would work with "transformation" or "change" substituted with minor edits. Score 6.4 for shaping one key thematic turn (the argument) and being present in closure reasoning without unique causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The method is introduced early: "her role was to compare silent video footage from decades apart, tracking how the collective dream-state evolved." It is dramatized in the middle beat where she studies footage of the child and mother, noting details only visible through comparative analysis. The method enables her to see "luminous regret that hung around certain frames like halos" and to build her argument about hope's transformation. It shapes her tactics (watching, comparing, archiving) and is indispensable to her role. However, it does not force a choice with cost—she does not decide to compare or not compare in a moment where alternatives carry different stakes. Meets all three gates and shows causal work in enabling her observations. Score 6.7 for essential presence across beats and enabling her core activity without forcing a dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "blooming library above clouds" is introduced early, grounding the setting in a vivid, specific location where "blossoms grow from the ether itself, petals glowing with stored memory." It provides resources (the dream-archives, the footage) that enable Mira's work and charges the final image ("The blossoms above her swayed with non-existent wind, and Mira continued her vigil"). The setting is purposeful and irreplaceable—remove it and the story's logic breaks. However, it does not pressure a choice or constrain tactics in a beat; it functions as a rich stage rather than an active obstacle or enabler of a decision. Meets all three gates and is essential to the premise. Score 6.3 for strong setup, closure charge, and irreplaceability without forcing a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after dreams become shareable" is established early and elaborated: "changed again after the Unbinding began. For decades now, humanity had been shedding its shadows." It frames the world and Mira's role, appearing in setup and shaping the premise (archiving shared dreams and tracking the Unbinding's progression). However, the timeframe does not tighten a decision or create urgency; Mira's work proceeds at an untracked pace with no live clock. The element is functional—it defines the era—but does not alter tactics or choices on the page. Meets setup gate and is causally consistent, but lacks middle and closure pressure. Score 5.4 for clear setup and logical presence without decision pressure or tightening effect.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to preserve the shape of hope" is stated explicitly and dramatized through her nightly work: "gathering fragments of hope from the dream-archives and weaving them into something that might endure." It drives her actions across beats (studying footage, building her argument, continuing her vigil) and is indispensable to the story. However, the desire faces no on-page friction or counter-pressure that forces a choice between preserving hope and another want or cost. The motivation is consistent and causally linked to all her moves, but lacks a dramatized moment where she chooses preservation over an alternative path with visible consequence. Meets all three gates and shows causal pressure across beats. Score 6.6 for essential presence and clear drive without a peak choice moment where competing wants collide.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tone of "luminous regret" is established early ("luminous regret that hung around certain frames like halos") and sustained throughout: the mother's "terrible beauty," Mira's memory gaps, the river stone warming, the "quietly luminous way" at closure. The tone is coherent, modulates with the material (intensifies when describing the mother's dissolution), and charges the final image where Mira continues her vigil "in her quietly luminous way." It is not a single static mood but a purposeful blend of loss and radiance that reweights the premise (transformation as both grief and transcendence). The tone is indispensable; removing it would flatten the story's emotional register. Meets all three gates with strong closure charge. Score 7.2 for coherent modulation and decisive role in charging the ending without a moment where tonal choice forecloses an alternative register with dramatized cost.</comment>
