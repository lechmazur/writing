<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is richly embodied—her guilt over Elena's death manifests in physical sensations (copper taste, fever's aftermath) and contradictory impulses (wanting to touch the smudge but never doing so until the pivotal moment). The choice to touch the illustration and then issue the warning feels earned by her three-day fever-dream of processing Elena's face and the "word she could never quite hear." Minor slip: "fault tolerance as an oracle" reads slightly expository for peak interiority, though it's quickly grounded in dream imagery. The final shift from terror to lightness tracks causally through the smudge-touch revelation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira touches the smudge, forgives herself, and issues the warning—foreclosing her paralysis with visible cost (swallowing terror, accepting that errors will recur). The accumulative lens holds throughout: pressure builds through sensory details (aurora, frost patterns, pressure dropping) and the botanical illustration's recurring presence. The drive from fever-break to forecast is motivated by her internal reckoning with Elena's ghost. One small orientation delay: the administration's term "fault tolerance" arrives slightly late but does not obscure the stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mountain weather station constrains Mira's choices materially—she must stand at the console, read the displays, issue warnings—and the aurora's green light charges both the frost patterns and the final image. The botanical illustration functions as micro-setting, its paper texture and Elena's thumb-smudge becoming the physical anchor for Mira's emotional turn. Sensory hierarchy is strong: under lingering fever she notices cold, light, and the station's "chittering" instruments. The setting is woven through action (moving to the console, typing the forecast) rather than described statically.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Mira can issue a warning despite her guilt over Elena's death—is signaled early and tightens when the console shows pressure dropping and she hesitates at the controls. The touch of the smudge is the pivot that narrows options: she can no longer hide behind her terror. The storm's arrival provides external escalation that converges with her internal shift. The cost is legible: she "swallows" terror and truth together, foreclosing her paralysis. One reversal (fever breaks → she can act; she touches the smudge → she can forgive) is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the botanical illustration's smudge—imperfection as "the most honest feature"—and the accumulating images of margins, periphery, and swaying certainty. The final image (Mira's heart "light enough to do its work," eyes on "the margins where weather began") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how one lives with error. Elena's unheard word crystallizes as "forgive" without being stated earlier, avoiding thematic echo. The story resists moralizing: grief's "exact mass" is felt rather than explained, and the ending balances cost (terror swallowed) with resumption of duty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance; Mira's perceptual signature (peripherally aware, drawn to edges and smudges) colors every observation. Diction remains in register: "chittering" instruments, "pale grief" aurora, "swaying in her like a damaged antenna" all feel voice-particular. The prose modulates under pressure—short clauses when she touches the smudge, longer accumulative rhythm in the final paragraph. No head-hopping. One minor slip: "fault tolerance as an oracle—that was what the administration called it" reads slightly expository, though it quickly returns to dream imagery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythm, no loops or scaffold, high information density. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor friction: "peripherally aware" appears three times (dream, console, illustration) in slightly mechanical pattern, though each use advances a beat. The metaphor "swaying in her like a damaged antenna" is vivid and character-specific. Figurative language is controlled and does not overload peak beats. Propulsion is steady; every sentence does work. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of weather forecasting, guilt, and botanical illustration feels specific and earned rather than template-driven. The "smudge as honesty" motif transforms a familiar redemption arc through tactile particularity. The story takes a risk by centering on interior reckoning rather than external confrontation, and it pays off with the touch-as-pivot choice. Swappability test passes: removing the weather station or the illustration would collapse the story's logic. Slightly held back by the familiar "mentor's death weighs on successor" frame, though the peripheral-awareness lens and margin imagery freshen it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira as fault-tolerant oracle shapes two key beats: her hesitation at the console (hands hovering, "certainty swaying") and her decision to issue the warning after touching the smudge. Her choices—touching the illustration, typing the forecast—alter tactics and foreclose her paralysis. The term "oracle" is introduced late but does not undermine the setup. Her professional role pressures every move and charges the final image ("eyes on the margins where weather began"). Cost is visible: she swallows terror to resume work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The botanical illustration appears in four beats: framing the dream, catching her peripheral vision, being touched (the pivot), and returning in the final image with auroral light on the smudge. Its physical properties (Elena's thumb-smudge, rough paper, glass frame) constrain and enable Mira's emotional turn. Removing it would collapse the story's causal spine. The smudge becomes "a small gray monument to the way truth could be held gently instead of swallowed whole," reweighting the opening grief. Closure is charged by its presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Swaying certainties" is embodied in Mira's "damaged antenna receiving two signals at once" and her hesitation at the controls. The concept shapes her tactics: she cannot issue the warning until she resolves the sway by touching the smudge and accepting imperfection. It appears in the middle beat (console hesitation) and the ending ("swaying in the wind but still standing"). The concept is not merely thematic—it alters her on-page options. Slightly weakened by the phrase "swaying certainties" never appearing verbatim; the reader infers it from "sway" and antenna imagery.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Peripherally aware" is mentioned three times: Mira is "peripherally aware of frost patterns," Elena was "peripherally aware of her own limitations," and the illustration "caught her peripheral vision." The trait constrains one key action: Mira notices the illustration in her peripheral vision, which triggers her decision to touch it. The cost is that she has been avoiding full confrontation until that moment. The trait feels somewhat label-reliant (the phrase recurs mechanically) rather than dramatized through embodied perception throughout, but it does enable the pivot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The action "smudge" (Mira touching Elena's thumb-smudge on the illustration) is the story's hinge: it shifts her from paralysis to action, from swallowing truth to holding it gently. The smudge is set up early (paragraph 5), withheld ("she never had" touched it), then executed at the midpoint with immediate consequence ("something shift in her chest"). Removing this action would erase the story's causal turn. The smudge also charges the final image ("catching the auroral light, a small gray monument"). Cost is visible: she risks confronting her grief and succeeds.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"By occupying margins" is signaled early (weather station on a mountain, aurora as "pale grief," Mira noticing frost patterns "at the margins") and shapes her final stance: "her eyes on the margins where weather began." The method is embodied in her professional role (observing edge conditions to predict storms) and her emotional tactic (holding truth "at the edge of perception" rather than head-on). It appears in the setup, middle reflection, and ending, but the mechanics are more thematic than action-driving—she does not, for instance, use marginal data to solve a plot problem. Still, it charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mountain weather station supplies concrete resources (console, displays, instruments that "chitter") and pressures Mira's choices: she must stand at her post and issue warnings despite her guilt. The station's isolation mirrors her emotional state; the arriving storm provides external escalation that converges with her internal shift. The steel bones "torn at" by wind, the flickering lights, and the console's data points all constrain her tactics and charge the final image. Removing the station would collapse both the professional stakes and the sensory anchors.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after fever breaks" is anchored precisely (3:47 AM) and supplies urgency: Mira is newly lucid but still weak, and the storm system is "building somewhere to the west." The fever's three-day duration primes her readiness to act (she has processed Elena's death in dreams). The clock tightens her decision: pressure is "dropping steadily," the first gust strikes as she types. However, the fever itself is more setup than ongoing constraint—by the time she acts, it has broken. The timeframe shapes one key choice (issuing the warning now) but does not recur as a live pressure after the opening.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to find the weight of a swallowed truth" is dramatized in embodied images: truth "had weight; she had carried it in her body like a stone," and she is "trying to find its exact mass." The friction between wanting to absolve herself and fearing she cannot is shown in her hesitation at the console and her avoidance of the smudge. The final choice—to touch the illustration and then issue the warning—resolves the motivation with visible cost: she "swallows" terror along with truth. The motivation drives two beats (console hesitation, smudge touch) and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tone of "auroral sorrow" is established immediately (aurora as "pale grief," copper-and-regret taste) and modulates under pressure: from fever-dream heaviness to the "old terror" rising when the storm strikes, then to final lightness ("her heart finally light enough to do its work"). The aurora's green light recurs to charge key images (frost patterns, the smudge in the final paragraph). Tone is coherent across beats and directly shapes the closure image: sorrow remains ("small gray monument") but no longer paralyzes. The tone is never static; it deepens and shifts with Mira's internal reckoning.</comment>
