<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's interiority is concrete and specific—"chronic hush," "echo-harbor violinist," the mendicant's bowl as inheritance all ground her. Her motivation to "unbind something" is embodied through the violin and carried by her grandmother's storytelling tradition. The final choice to carry the bowl forward feels earned by the accumulated grief and stubborn beauty. Minor: the internal contradiction could be sharper; her grief is asserted more than it conflicts with her resolve on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The chronic hush establishes constraint early; Marina's playing accumulates pressure through recursive echoes until the hush "stutters" and is "interrupted." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the world begins to breathe again, the bowl carries "a promise kept across generations," and the cost is the acceptance of devastation as inseparable from what remains. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening—music breaking the hush—sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse, shipwrecks, and scorched orchard constrain Marina's acoustics and choice of location; the mendicant's bowl vibrates with resonance, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear: center of orchard, bowl on moss-covered concrete, hulls reflecting sound. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—dripping water as "small bell," ash-coated silence. The setting is not mere backdrop; it shapes the music's behavior and the final image of walking through the shipwreck ring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: to interrupt the chronic hush and release what the fire trapped. The tightening occurs when the first note "pushes out into the hush like a hand reaching from a well" and the echo answers, then accumulates as the bowl vibrates. Cost is visible—playing for what "could not be unburned" and accepting the devastation as "woven through" the beauty. Agency is decision and action: she raises the violin, plays, and carries the bowl forward. One meaningful pressure point sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the grandmother's storytelling tradition, the mendicant's bowl as witness, and the orchard as "beautifully, terribly unfinished." The final image—carrying the bowl "like a promise kept across generations"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing: beauty is inseparable from damage. Subtext operates through the bowl's vibration, the echoes, and Marina's playing for both loss and stubborn renewal. Minor: "to find beauty in the unfinished" is stated directly in the penultimate paragraph, though it is also dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "chronic hush," "echo-harbor violinist," "skeleton of iron and stubbornness" all carry a specific, lyric register. POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is consistent—Marina hears "what others missed in the spaces between sounds." Diction remains within her sensibility; no head-hopping. The prose modulates with pressure: the first note is "raw and searching," then the music "accumulated, building something from nothing." Rhythmic control under pressure is strong; no filter-verb stacks or template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; lines do multiple jobs—"skeleton of iron and stubbornness ringed by the hulks of ships" anchors setting, tone, and metaphor. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; sentence openings vary. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful: "hand reaching from a well," "chronic hush," "teeth of devastation." Minor: "beautifully, terribly unfinished" appears twice in quick succession, a small echo. Grammar and punctuation are clean; spatial choreography tracks clearly. Zero scaffold or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of echo-harbor acoustics, mendicant's bowl as inheritance, and the sunken orchard is specific and non-obvious. The "chronic hush" as antagonist and the bowl vibrating with story-memory are fresh inflections. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise without retreat. Minor: the devastation-yet-beauty resolution is familiar territory, though the execution is strong and particular. The combination of elements feels organic rather than checklist-driven.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Echo-harbor violinist appears early (paragraph 3), shapes her perception of the chronic hush and the shipwreck acoustics, drives the central action (playing to unbind), and anchors the closure ("The echo-harbor had answered her at last"). Her specific training enables the tactic of using the hulls for reflection. Causal pressure is strong; the role is irreplaceable. Cost is tied to her ability: she hears the hush's interruption. Three beats (training, playing, final answer) plus closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mendicant's bowl appears early (paragraph 2), is placed beside her as "an offering" (first beat), vibrates with the music's frequency (second beat), and is carried forward at closure as "a promise kept across generations" (third beat, reweighted). The bowl's connection to the grandmother's storytelling tradition and its resonance with Marina's music make it causally active and irreplaceable. Closure linkage is strong; the final image depends on it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Chronic hush is introduced in the opening, constrains Marina's acoustics (paragraph 3: "stolen even those echoes"), shapes the dominant stake (to interrupt it), and is transformed at closure ("had been interrupted" and the world begins to breathe). The hush is the antagonist; its properties (completeness, ability to silence echoes) alter her tactics and define success. Causal pressure is high; swapping it for generic silence would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Acoustically perceptive (echo-harbor violinist training) appears early, enables her to "hear what others missed in the spaces between sounds," constrains her recognition of the hush's completeness, and drives the tactic of using shipwreck acoustics. The trait is specific and causally active in two beats (recognition, method). Minor: the perceptiveness is more ability than visible tradeoff; cost is implied (she hears the loss more acutely) but not dramatized as a sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Unbind appears in paragraph 4 ("her purpose here was to unbind something"), drives the playing action, and resolves at closure (the hush is interrupted, the trapped grief released). The action is signaled early and is causally central. Minor: "unbind" is somewhat abstract; the concrete action is "playing," and "unbind" functions more as thematic framing than a discrete tactic. Two beats (stated purpose, playing) plus closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Family tradition of storytelling around bonfires appears in paragraph 2 (grandmother's mendicant's bowl and refugee camps), is referenced again in paragraph 5 ("family tradition... lived in her blood"), and shapes her understanding of music as pattern-making. The tradition primes her approach but does not constrain a specific on-page choice; it is more heritage than active method. Two touches (setup, reflection) with thematic linkage to closure, but mechanics are not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is anchored early (paragraph 1), supplies the acoustics that define the echo-harbor problem (paragraph 3), provides the rusted hull that reflects her first note (paragraph 4), and frames the final walk-out (closure). The setting's properties (shipwreck acoustics, ash-coated silence) constrain her method and charge the final image. Three beats (arrival, acoustics, first echo, exit) plus closure linkage; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>After the rainforest burns is anchored in the opening ("seventeen days... when it finally stopped") and establishes the devastation that created the chronic hush. The timeframe sets the premise but does not tighten decisions on the page; Marina's playing is not time-pressured. The "after" is crucial to the world-state but does not function as a live clock. Setup strong; middle and closure participation weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>To find beauty in the unfinished appears explicitly in paragraph 5 and the penultimate paragraph, is dramatized through her playing for both loss and renewal, and resolves at closure ("she had found it—not in despite of the devastation, but woven through it"). The motivation drives her choice to play and shapes the final stance. Friction is present (grief vs. beauty, devastation vs. stubborn life). Two beats (playing, realization) plus closure linkage; cost is acceptance of inseparability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Magnificent simplicity is coherent throughout: spare diction ("chronic hush," "skeleton of iron"), lyric compression, and the simple bowl as central object. Tone modulates with pressure—first note "raw and searching," accumulation "building something from nothing," closure quiet and resonant. The final image (carrying the bowl "like a promise") charges simplicity with weight. No tonal breaks; the mode holds across beats and supports the thematic register.</comment>
