<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's interior contradictions are present—the buried dream versus research career—but her micro-choices under pressure remain abstract. The wisteria's backstory about the countess introduces a second character's stakes that dilute focus. The final bow-lift reads as gesture rather than a choice that forecloses a visible path with felt cost; we don't see what she surrenders or gains on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: coffee-stain visions, wisteria memory, and perforated-destiny motif accumulate toward the bow-lift. Closure registers as Charged Poise—the final note crystallizes her choice—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than concretely legible (no visible price paid or option foreclosed on the page). The lens holds, escalation is present as density increase, but cost proof is soft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The velvet observatory, midsummer light, and wisteria are vivid and purposeful. The ice violin's tactile cold and the coffee grounds provide micro-setting detail. The wisteria's agency (pressing against the window, holding breath) arguably constrains Elena's attention and charges the final beat. Sensory selection is effective throughout, filtered through Elena's research lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—dream versus empire—is signaled early and tightened by the coffee-stain vision and the wisteria's story. One meaningful deepening occurs as the futures "fade at the edges." However, the bow-lift does not narrow options or show a visible trade-off on the page; the resolution remains gestural. Agency is present but the cost is implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The perforated-destiny motif recurs purposefully (countess gaps, coffee stains, final "light where certainty had blocked") and charges the ending without overt statement. The piece resists tidy moral and invites ambiguity. The final line offers a resonant non-literal answer: letting in light equals choosing want over fear. No thematic echo; the wisteria and violin particulars anchor the concept.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; Elena's perceptual signature (provenance researcher's idiom, plant-listening, coffee-reading) is distinct and purposeful. Diction remains within her lexicon; no head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. The prose modulates with emotional intensity—rushed syntax at the bow-lift. Psychic distance shifts intentionally. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings shift effectively. However, figurative density is high throughout ("secret wanting to be told," "promises losing their glow," "green breath," "ice violin sang of everything") without pattern-teaching or cost differentiation; this registers as mild overwriting (−0.4). Two paraphrase loops: "perforated with gaps… punched holes through" and "fading… losing their glow" (−0.2). Minor scaffold in "she had learned to listen without flinching, to receive without questioning why." Information density is strong; propulsion is present but occasionally dulled by metaphor stacking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ice violin and plant-telepathy pairing is fresh; the perforated-destiny conceit is specific and non-obvious. The coffee-reading and wisteria witness are particular to this voice. The bow-lift as closure choice feels earned in hindsight from prior particulars. However, the dream-versus-empire binary and the magical-choice moment trend toward familiar craft-fiction templates. Emotional specificity and idiom lift the piece above generic execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Provenance researcher is signaled early and colors Elena's perception (tracing ownership, reading coffee grounds). It enables the coffee-reading beat and constrains her attention to gaps in the violin's history. However, her research role does not create a key turn; the choice at closure (bow-lift) is artist versus researcher, which the role sets up but does not drive causally. Present in two beats (opening framing, coffee-stain vision) and primes the ending stakes. Swappable with "archivist" or "curator" with minor edits (−0.5). Late lyric reprise absent. Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (setup only) +0.3, closure linkage (frames choice) +0.5, swappability −0.5, no middle development cap at 3.4 waived because priming closure counts as development under accumulative lens = 5.8, round down.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Transparent ice violin is present in opening (arrival, unwrapping, hums with cold), middle (spreads papers "the ice violin waited"), and ending (lifts bow, first note sings). It anchors the dream-versus-cataloging choice and the perforated-destiny motif (light passes through). However, its use is largely atmospheric; Elena does not play it until the final gesture, and its crystal/ice properties do not constrain a middle action with visible cost. Three beats +1.4, early signal +0.6, closure linkage (present, active in final image) +1.2, specificity (crystal form matters to light motif) +0.5, causal pressure (object of choice but not shaping tactics) +0.4, ornamental middle mention −0.6 = 6.9, round down.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Perforated destiny appears in the provenance gaps paragraph, coffee-stain vision ("perforated… remade"), wisteria memory ("punched through that cage like light through ice"), and final line ("perforated destiny… let in light"). It shapes the thematic lens and charges the ending image. However, it does not alter Elena's on-page tactics or narrow her options; it functions as motif rather than constraint. Four beats +1.4, early signal +0.6, closure linkage (reweighted in final line) +1.0, causal pressure (theme-level only, no action constraint) +0.2, cost connection (conceptual, oblique) +0.3, swappability (could be "fractured fate" or "contingent destiny") −0.6, ornamental middle mentions −0.5 = 5.2, round down.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plant telepathy is signaled early (oak, basil, wisteria voices) and enables the wisteria memory beat. However, it does not constrain a choice with cost; the wisteria speaks but Elena does not struggle with the gift or pay a price for receiving. Two beats (childhood summary, wisteria beat) +0.9, early signal +0.6, causal pressure (enables information, does not narrow options) +0.3, closure linkage (wisteria "held its green breath" frames final moment) +0.5, no visible tradeoff −0.8, summary-only childhood mention −0.4, swappability (could be "empath" or "sensitive") −0.5 = 4.1, round down.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Propagate appears in final paragraph ("propagate either her fear or her longing") and the ice violin's "strange song" propagating. The verb ties to the plant motif and the choice to spread music versus cataloging. However, it arrives late (final third) and does not drive a middle turn; it summarizes the stakes rather than enacting them. Late first appearance (final third) −0.8, one beat (ending only) +0.4, closure linkage (frames final stakes) +0.7, ornamental (verb choice rather than dramatized action) −0.7, summary-only −0.6, swappability ("spread" or "share" work as well) −0.6, missing setup cap 4.6, missing middle cap 3.4 = 3.4 + 0.3 (closure frame) = 3.7, round down.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Coffee-reading is signaled early (Buenos Aires training), occupies a full beat (spreads grounds, images come), and delivers the two-futures vision that defines the central choice. Its mechanics matter: the liquid bleeds future through cracks, grounds settle into patterns. However, after the vision beat it vanishes; no return or cost at closure. Two beats (setup, vision) +0.9, early signal +0.7, causal pressure (provides key information, narrows choice) +1.0, specificity (liquid/crack metaphor, Buenos Aires detail) +0.6, closure linkage (absent, visions "drying now" mid-story) 0.0, no cost connection 0.0, missing closure participation cap 2.8 waived under lyric exception because the vision it provides reweights the ending choice = 6.2, round down.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Velvet observatory is present in opening (arrival site), middle ("velvet observatory" twice), and ending (midsummer sun across velvet observatory). Midsummer light is integral to the transparent violin's intro and the timeframe. The wisteria presses against the observatory window, linking setting to the plant-telepathy action. However, the space does not constrain movement or supply a resource that alters tactics; it is atmospheric anchor. Three mentions +1.4, early signal +0.6, closure linkage (named in final paragraph) +0.5, causal pressure (window enables wisteria contact, light charges violin image) +0.7, micro-setting (window, light) alters perception +0.4, ornamental (no spatial constraint on choice) −0.6, swappability (could be "studio" or "conservatory") −0.5 = 5.9, round down.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "before the promise loses its glow" appears mid-story ("she had until the promise lost its glow to decide") and in the ending paragraph ("the promise lost its glow"). Midsummer anchors the opening. However, the clock is metaphorical and does not tighten on-page tactics; no countdown or visible urgency shift. Two beats (mid, end) +0.9, early midsummer signal +0.4, closure linkage (present in final paragraph) +0.7, causal pressure (frames deadline but does not alter moves) +0.3, vague ticking (no numeric or sensory countdown) −0.6, swappability ("before the light fades" or "before sunset") −0.5, missing middle development (no mid-scene urgency increase) cap 3.4 waived because the phrase reappears and reweights at closure under accumulative lens = 4.8, round down.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dream versus empire is signaled in the coffee-stain vision, articulated clearly ("empire of knowledge… dream of making music"), and dramatized in the bow-lift. The friction is present: "dream she had buried beneath research and rent payments." However, the conflict is largely told in the vision paragraph rather than shown through on-page struggle or contradictory impulses in action. Two beats (vision, bow-lift) +0.9, early signal (vision at ~40%) +0.4, causal pressure (defines the choice) +0.9, closure linkage (bow-lift enacts the dream choice) +1.2, cost connection (empire path foreclosed) +0.5, told friction (vision paragraph is summary) −0.7, no embodied struggle in middle −0.4, swappability (artist versus scholar is familiar) −0.5 = 6.4, round down.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Mulberry appears once (countess fled "into a night that smelled of mulberry and impossibility"). Ache is implicit in "everything she had never allowed herself to want" and "letting the ice violin sing… its strange song." Tone is wistful, melancholic, charged with longing throughout; it modulates from cool observation (opening) to urgent lyricism (ending). However, "mulberry ache" as a phrase does not recur or charge the final image directly; the tone is coherent but the specific cue is ornamental. Coherent tone +1.2, modulates with pressure (cool to urgent) +0.8, final image charged (first note, longing) +1.0, early signal (mulberry mid-story) +0.3, one beat (countess memory) +0.4, ornamental (mulberry scent does not return) −0.6, label substitution (ache is implicit, not foregrounded) −0.4, swappability ("plum sorrow" or "violet longing" fit as well) −0.5 = 5.6, round down.</comment>
