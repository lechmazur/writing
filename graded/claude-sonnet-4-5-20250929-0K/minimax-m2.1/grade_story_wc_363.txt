<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The spinner's interior life is conveyed through ornate description rather than contradictory impulses in scene. Her "decision" to unravel herself arrives via summary and epiphany ("understanding now") without prior visible conflict between want and fear. The grandmother backstory sprawls across multiple paragraphs without anchoring in present micro-choices that alter tactics. Embodied emotion is scarce; most feelings are asserted through labels ("trembling in her heart") or stock gestures.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural through ritual description, but closure—the spinner's self-transformation—occurs off-stage in summary ("began to unravel herself") with no on-page action or image that makes the cost felt. The causality is unclear: what specific sacrifice does she make, and how does her consciousness flowing into the bead differ from metaphor? Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who she is, her specific goal, the orchard's spatial reality remain vague), triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The final paragraph asserts completion without showing the transformation or its price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The orchard and loom are described lyrically but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is absent: we never learn the loom's position relative to the trees, the workbench layout, or how the spinner moves. Sensory detail leans heavily visual and abstract ("raveling silence," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry") without grounding in smell, temperature, or tactile immediacy. The bamboo forest and apple trees are postcard elements that do not pressure the action. Capped at 7.0 per Q2 orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sending a message across impossible distance—is declared but never tested on the page. No on-page reversal narrows options; the spinner sits, remembers, then decides in a single epiphanic move without visible cost or trade-off. The "latent sacrifice" is named but not dramatized: what exactly does she give up, and how does it foreclose a future path? Coincidence does not complicate, but neither does agency: the fabric "completed itself" and the edges "shifted...without her hands." Escalation is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme of message-sending and transformation through sacrifice emerges from the premise, but the final image ("the amber bead was gone") is too vague to reweight prior material with conceptual cost. The grandmother's "raveling silence" motif recurs but remains abstract; no concrete particular anchors what the silence took or what the message carried. The epiphany ("some messages could only be sent by becoming the message itself") is stated rather than earned through scene pressure. Subtext is scarce in a single-character piece with no dialogue to carry implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>POV distance is stable (close third), but the voice drifts into elevated register ("loom's heddles clicking in rhythm with her heartbeat," "raveling silence accelerated") that reads more like narrated atmosphere than the spinner's perceptual signature. Psychic distance widens at key moments: "she understood now" and "the truth she had been weaving toward" are narrator-assisted epiphanies. No dialogue to evaluate. Internal voice lacks specificity—her way of noticing bamboo, amber, or puzzle edges is generic rather than character-particular. Free indirect style is attempted but inconsistent, sliding into summary when pressure should tighten.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: "raveling silence" appears five times, "impossible distance" thrice, and figurative language crowds most sentences without pattern-teaching ("time's unraveling tapestry," "stoically sparkling," "geometry and grief"). Paraphrase loops abound: paragraph three restates the grandmother-bead-message nexus already covered in paragraph two. Template cadence: "might have been memory, might have been intention, might have been the last word" stacks without advancing sense. Register drifts into academic abstraction ("latent sacrifice," "node in a pattern") inconsistent with a weaver's interior. Key closure beat is told, not shown. Artifacts touch closure; apply −1.7 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—weaver transforms herself to send a message—is a recognizable fantasy template (self-sacrifice for communication) executed without fresh lived detail or non-obvious stakes. Puzzle edges and amber bead are quirky but ornamental; their function is asserted, not demonstrated. The orchard-loom-bamboo combination feels assembled from prompt elements rather than organic to the character's world. Emotional arc (waiting three seasons, then instant resolve) lacks complexity. No bold structural risk; the piece unfolds as linear description leading to summary transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Wistful loom spinner is named, described, and makes one decision (to unravel herself), but the choice is summarized rather than dramatized and does not create a key turn—the transformation happens off-stage. She observes and remembers for most of the text. Present across all sections but does not drive beats through on-page action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Tree sap amber bead appears in paragraphs two, three, five, and seven (four beats). It is held, watched, glows, and vanishes, but its mechanics are unclear: how does her consciousness flow into it, and what constraint does it impose? The bead participates in closure (vanishes in final paragraph), yet the transformation is told, not shown. Swappable with any magical vessel without altering structure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Raveling silence is mentioned five times as atmospheric descriptor and thematic echo but never shapes a concrete choice or tactic. It "accelerated" and "waited," yet these are metaphoric assertions, not causal events. The concept is ornamental; removing it and replacing with "growing tension" would leave plot unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Stoically sparkling modifies the amber bead in paragraph two ("stoically sparkling with an inner light") and is never revisited. The trait is a poetic label that does not enable or constrain any action. No visible tradeoff tied to the quality of the sparkle.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Recommence appears twice: once in the opening (she waited three seasons to recommence her work) and once late ("prepared to recommence not her work but her existence"). The second use repurposes the word thematically but does not define the major turn—she begins to unravel herself, which is a new action. Swappable with "begin" or "resume."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Jigsaw puzzle edges found in a rummage sale box appear in paragraphs two and four. Their mechanics ("patterns she alone could read," "wove the puzzle edges into the fabric," "shifted...finding their final configuration") are asserted but never demonstrated. The method does not constrain attempts; we do not see her use them to solve a problem or fail. Present in setup and payoff (two gates), but development is missing—no middle choice shaped by the edges.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest frames the opening and closing but never supplies a resource or obstacle. The setting is descriptive backdrop; the spinner could perform the same actions in any isolated place. No micro-setting detail (tool, body constraint, spatial pressure) alters tactics. Present in setup and payoff but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Hush of time's unraveling tapestry is an opening phrase; timeframe is vague throughout. "Three seasons" is mentioned once but does not tighten decisions. No live clock tracks elapsed time or creates urgency. The ending ("in the instant of her transformation") compresses time without prior buildup. Time is atmospheric, not structural.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>To carry a message across impossible distance is named in paragraphs one, three, five, and eight. The desire drives the premise and is present in closure (message arrives), but friction between want and cost is told rather than dramatized. We never see her weigh alternatives or feel the sacrifice before she makes it. Motivation is declared, not tested in scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Latent sacrifice is named once in paragraph five and surfaces as theme (self-transformation), but tone is uniformly elegiac and ornate throughout—no modulation with pressure. The final image asserts completion without charging the mood with cost or grief. Static poetic register; no cadence shift at closure.</comment>
