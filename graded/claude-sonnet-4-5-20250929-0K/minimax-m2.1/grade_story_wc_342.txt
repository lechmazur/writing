<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's prosopagnosia is established early and her pattern-perception skill is clear, but her internal experience remains somewhat abstract—we see what she does more than who she is under pressure. The choice to work through the night and complete the commission feels more dutiful than conflicted; no visible trade-off or personal cost emerges on the page. Her final departure with the coin reads as a completion rather than a foreclosure that changes her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece opens with clear who/what/where anchors and maintains spatial coherence throughout. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the coin's pattern guides Mira's craft, density increases as she paints, and the final image reweights preservation as transformation. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Mira completes the work and leaves with the coin, but no path is foreclosed and no price paid on the page. The ending offers conceptual repricing (limits are scales of perception) but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library is vividly rendered with internal spiral staircases and the smell of dry knowledge, and spatial choreography remains clear as Mira climbs to the ceiling. The coin's worn surface and faint indentations constrain her perception and guide her brushwork, charging the final image. Setting detail is filtered through Mira's pattern-recognition lens rather than tourist catalog, and the demolition equipment creates time pressure that affects pacing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the library's knowledge before demolition—is signaled early and the ticking clock creates coherent pressure. However, escalation remains gentle: Mira finds the safe, studies the coin, paints through the night, and departs without meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options. The work proceeds smoothly without visible obstacles, trade-offs, or a moment where the cost of her choice becomes legible. Dawn arrives but the consequence (demolition) occurs after she's gone, placing the price off-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—preservation as transformation, patterns across scales, the translation of knowledge into new forms—emerges organically from Mira's craft rather than assertion. The coin's constellation patterns shifting across centuries and Mira's ceiling depicting multiple temporal moments simultaneously create genuine conceptual depth. The final realization about limits and scales of perception grows from prior particulars (the fractally precise detail, the overlapping sky configurations) without moralizing. However, the ending risks abstraction: "limits did not exist, only different scales" edges toward thesis statement rather than fully resonant image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited throughout with consistent perceptual signature: Mira notices patterns and textures more than faces, the bark better than any introduction. Diction stays elevated but coherent ("fractally precise," "heightened stillness") and matches the scholarly milieu. However, psychic distance occasionally drifts toward narrative summary rather than embodied perception, particularly in the guild backstory paragraph. No dialogue appears, appropriately for a solitary nocturnal task.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong rhythm and varied syntax, and information density is high in description of the coin and Mira's painting process. However, several template-cadence runs appear: "The library inside...had been hollowed...its walls still smelling" and "The guild's last living member had died...leaving behind...His note mentioned...and a request." The phrase "heightened stillness" in the penultimate paragraph reads slightly forced. Figurative language ("memories reverberating through time," "living presence") clusters without clear pattern-teaching. Minor paraphrase loop: "patterns too intricate to perceive" / "patterns...she was merely revealing what had been hidden."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The combination of face-blind artist, tree-trunk library, and constellation-preservation task offers specificity, and the transformation-not-mere-copying insight provides thematic weight. However, the core emotional arc—solitary craftsperson completes mysterious commission before deadline—follows a familiar template without strong friction or surprise. The prosopagnosia trait, while distinctive, doesn't materially complicate her task or create trade-offs. The ending's philosophical turn (limits as scales) gestures toward profundity but doesn't earn it through embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's face-blindness is established in the opening line and referenced when she's chosen for pattern-work rather than social recognition, shaping why the guild selected her. However, the trait doesn't constrain or enable any on-page choice during the actual painting; she works alone with objects, not faces. Present in setup and thematic frame but not causally active in the core conflict beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The safe appears when Mira finds it behind the false panel, contains the guiding coin, and is mentioned as part of the scholar's instructions. However, the safe itself is inert—merely a container. The coin inside does the causal work. The safe enables discovery but doesn't constrain choice or return with reweighted meaning; it's functional but replaceable with any hidden cache.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The concept of "discovering limits" is asserted in the final paragraph ("some discoveries were about limits—the discovery that limits did not exist") but not dramatized through on-page struggle. Mira encounters no meaningful limit in her work; she finds the safe, decodes the coin, paints through the night, and completes the task successfully. The theme is claimed rather than embodied through constraint and cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" describes the coin's indentations and Mira's inherited detail in her painting, appearing in three distinct moments. The trait enables her understanding of the constellation patterns and guides her brushwork, but the advantage operates without visible trade-off—no moment where precision costs her speed, breadth, or clarity. Present and functional but swappable with "meticulous" or "pattern-sensitive" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Crafting the ceiling painting is Mira's sustained action across the night, the causal spine of the narrative. She traces the coin's patterns, translates constellations into brushstrokes, and creates the multilayered sky. The act of painting directly enables the preservation-as-transformation closure and could not be swapped with another action type. Present in setup (her tools), middle development (working through the night), and payoff (the completed ceiling she examines at dawn).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The coin's faint indentations are discovered mid-story, studied for their shifting constellation patterns, and directly guide Mira's hand as she paints. The method is specific: she must turn the coin at precise angles to resolve the marks, and those marks determine her brushstrokes. Present in two beats (discovery/study and painting) with causal pressure, though introduced after the first third. The mechanism matters and isn't swappable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library with its spiral staircases, hollowed heart, false panel near the ceiling, and demolition deadline creates both spatial constraint (she must climb to reach the safe and paint the ceiling) and time pressure. The setting's imminent destruction drives the urgency, and the wood grain itself becomes the canvas. Present throughout, shapes multiple choices, and charges the final image as the wrecking ball breaches.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "hush just before" demolition and the "one evening before the wrecking ball arrived at dawn" frame creates urgency and tracks through the narrative: night work, dawn approaching, demolition equipment sounds becoming audible, and finally the breach. Time tightens Mira's window and explains her solitary all-night effort. However, she completes without apparent rush or trade-off, softening the pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The scholar's wish "to mirror the sky inside walls that would soon cease to exist" drives Mira's commission and she fulfills it by painting overlapping temporal configurations. The motivation is present in setup (the scholar's note) and payoff (the ceiling depicting multiple sky-moments simultaneously). However, the desire is the dead scholar's, not Mira's own; she executes rather than struggles with conflicting wants, reducing friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Heightened stillness" is established through "the quiet so complete that she could hear the tree's slow breathing" and "settled around her like a living presence," modulates with the approach of dawn and demolition sounds, and charges the final image of Mira's solitary departure. Tone remains coherent through beats and supports the accumulative pressure without breaking into incongruous register. The phrase itself appears once and functions as anchor rather than label.</comment>
