<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mina's interiority is concrete and particular ("feeling its weight in her palm, considering its purpose"), and her final choice to throw her own stone emerges from dramatized understanding rather than assertion. The researcher remains more symbolic cipher than character—his choices are present but lack internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The "not old" construction and "brightness of someone who had not yet learned to weep" lean toward clever descriptor over lived psychology. Mina's shift from passive watcher to active participant earns the change, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through the ring sequence, each bringing layered memory and understanding, culminating in Mina's mirrored action that reweights the opening stance. Orientation anchors promptly (floating rock, sycamores, pond) and the closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mina's stone-throw forecloses passive reception and crystallizes her path forward with conceptual cost (a lifetime of learning). The escalation reads as density increase across four rings, each reweighting the dominant stake (learning to vanish/appear). One minor seam: "magnetic grotto beneath the stars" is named but never spatially grounded or used to constrain choice, creating slight disorientation about whether it's metaphor or literal location.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating rock, pond, sycamores, and starlight are vividly rendered and establish clear spatial relations. The stone—handled twice, first by researcher then Mina—serves as micro-setting that charges the final image and constrains the teaching method. Sensory detail is purposeful: "mossy bank," "mountain wind," "darker than the sky it reflected." The magnetic grotto is named but remains abstract, never grounding how it relates to the visible platform or altering any tactic. This keeps the piece shy of 7.5+ where environment would more directly shape a mid-scene choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly signaled: Mina seeks the vanishing technique. Pressure accumulates through the ring sequence—each wave brings memory, scent, sound, understanding—forcing Mina from passive waiting to active participation. The researcher's warning that "truth woven carefully could not be rushed" establishes a credible constraint. Agency at closure is renunciation of passive stance; Mina's stone-throw forecloses the student role and accepts "the rest of her life learning," a felt cost that narrows options. The cost is more temporal/conceptual than urgent-physical, fitting the Accumulative lens but preventing entry to 7.5+ where a sharper trade-off would land.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—delayed revelation as self-discovery, teaching through withholding—emerges organically from the ring sequence and is never stated as thesis. The final image (Mina throwing her own stone) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: she becomes the withholder, closing the loop without moralizing. "Growing younger was just another word for returning" and "truth withholds itself" risk abstraction but are anchored in the concrete act of stone-throwing. The backwards-aging researcher concept charges the thematic question without becoming allegorical stand-in. One line veers close to Thematic Echo: "Some truths...could only be taught by withholding them until the student was ready," but it's followed immediately by embodied action (she throws the stone), limiting the drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds stable; psychic distance is controlled and purposeful. Diction is elevated but consistent: "ancient pattern," "eternal hush," "quality of wind through old trees." The researcher's speech carries distinct formality ("Vanishing is not what you imagine") contrasted with Mina's physical grounding. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register drift: "dimension where opposites reconciled" and "process—a dimension" introduce abstract-philosophical vocabulary mid-pressure that edges outside immediate perception, though it coheres with the contemplative voice. No head-hopping; focalization remains with Mina throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, revelation, or character. Two artifacts touch pressure beats: "someone who had lived long enough to understand that growing younger was just another word for returning" is a paraphrase loop (growing younger = returning restated without added meaning), and "truth woven carefully / truth withholds itself / truths could only be taught" recycles the same conceptual claim across three moments, creating synonym churn around the core thesis. The closure paragraph stacks filter constructions ("understood," "knowing") that slightly dull immediacy. Otherwise, prose is controlled and vivid with strong concrete anchors ("smooth as worry, dark as the space between stars").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The backwards-aging researcher and pond-ring teaching method offer a fresh synthesis; the piece avoids generic mentor-student templates by embedding the lesson in sensory accumulation rather than dialogue exposition. The final move—Mina becoming the teacher by mirroring the act—feels earned in hindsight and specific to these particulars. Risk: the lyric, contemplative mode with minimal external conflict. The "magnetic grotto" and backwards-aging remain under-explored, gesturing at larger strangeness without full integration, which keeps the piece from feeling indispensable. Tone and imagery cohere as singular vision; no template echoes detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The researcher is present throughout, frames the lesson, and makes the key choice to throw the stone. His backwards-aging trait is mentioned ("not old...silver beard...brightness of someone who had not yet learned to weep") but does not constrain any tactic or choice on the page; it colors atmosphere without altering causality. He appears in the final third via Mina's vision ("saw the researcher as a boy") but this is summary of eternal recurrence, not a decision that shifts present stakes. Setup gate met; middle gate weak (observation, not choice-under-pressure); closure gate weak (mentioned but not causally active in Mina's final act). Two-gate minimum met, but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "magnetic grotto beneath the stars" is named twice: once in paragraph one as backstory context, once in paragraph six as metaphor ("not a place, but a process"). It is never entered, handled, or used to enable/constrain a choice. No middle beat involvement; it does not shape Mina's decision to throw the stone. Setup gate barely met (named early); middle gate missed; closure gate missed. The grotto remains ornamental world-building, swappable with any other mystical training site. Late-reprise as metaphor does not constitute causal participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Delayed revelation is the structural spine: the researcher warns "this would take time," Mina settles to wait, and understanding arrives only through the ring sequence. Each ring withholds meaning until it reaches her, and the fourth ring delivers the epiphany. The concept shapes stakes (she cannot rush the lesson) and tactics (she must endure the process). The final beat—Mina choosing to create her own delayed revelation by throwing a stone—directly enacts the concept with cost (committing "the rest of her life"). Setup, middle involvement, and closure participation all present. Causal pressure high; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is attributed to the researcher via indirect statement ("truth woven carefully could not be rushed") and demonstrated through his methodical stone-toss and patient wait. The trait constrains his teaching method: he does not explain, he demonstrates via rings. However, the weaving itself occurs off-page (the "four decades perfecting" is backstory); on-page we see only the result (one stone thrown, rings interpreted). Setup gate met (named early as principle); middle gate partial (the method is shown but not tested under opposing pressure); closure gate partial (Mina mirrors the method but does not herself "weave" with visible technique). One key turn shaped, but swappable with "teaches indirectly" or "reveals gradually."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Withholding is the dominant action: the researcher refuses direct teaching, throws a stone instead of explaining, and allows the rings to carry meaning. Mina's major turn—understanding that revelation must be self-generated—traces directly to the researcher's withholding. The climax (Mina throwing her own stone) enacts the lesson she received via withholding. Setup early (he "had sworn never to teach"); middle beat (he instructs "watch the rings" rather than decode them); closure (Mina withholds her verbal answer and throws instead). Removing this action collapses causality. Three gates met; causal pressure high; cost visible (Mina's lifetime commitment).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pond-ring method is signaled early ("Watch the rings"), used in the sustained middle sequence (four rings, each bringing revelation), and mirrored at closure when Mina throws her own stone. The mechanics matter: each ring must reach the shore in sequence, and Mina cannot rush them. The method shapes her tactic (patient waiting) and enables the final turn (her understanding that she must create rings for another). Setup, development, and closure all present. Specificity high: removing the rings and substituting another method would require rewriting most beats. Minor friction: the rings are somewhat passive—Mina receives rather than wrestles with them—but the final mirroring redeems this.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating rock platform is described early and establishes spatial separation (researcher elevated, Mina on shore) that mirrors the knowledge gap. It anchors the scene and provides the vantage for the stone-throw. However, it does not constrain a choice under pressure or alter tactics; Mina could learn this lesson on level ground. Setup gate met (present by end of first paragraph); middle gate weak (setting as stage, not pressure); closure gate weak (the platform is present but inert in the final beat). Lyric reprise: the rock "no larger than a modest room" returns implicitly as the contained teaching space, but this is atmospheric, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Through the trance" as timeframe is gestured at ("this would take time," "patient as the mountain itself," "waited exactly this long") but no trance state is dramatized or tracked. Mina's perception shifts with each ring, but the text does not mark entry/exit from trance or use time pressure to tighten decisions. The learning spans an unspecified duration; closure arrives when the fourth ring lands, but the timeframe is ambient rather than a live constraint. Setup gate weak (time mentioned but not framed as trance); middle gate missed (no clock or state-shift affecting tactics); closure gate missed (the ending does not hinge on trance duration or exit). Swappable with "over the course of an afternoon" or "during meditation."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mina's desire to learn vanishing is stated early ("come to learn the one thing he had sworn never to teach") and drives her presence on the shore. The motivation is tested: she must endure patient waiting rather than demand answers, and at closure she chooses active practice over continued reception. Friction between wanting instant knowledge and accepting the cost of lifelong learning is present. However, the desire is told more than dramatized—Mina does not articulate why she seeks this technique or what she'll sacrifice to gain it. Setup gate met; middle gate partial (waiting is motivated but not conflicted on-page); closure gate met (her stone-throw commits her to the path). One key turn shaped; visible cost at end.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Sycamore hush" establishes contemplative, reverent tone early ("eternal hush, golden leaves whispering secrets") and is sustained through "quality of wind through old trees," "silence returned, deeper now," and "settled into her bones, patient as the mountain." Tone modulates subtly: anticipation during the wait, layered revelation during the ring sequence, quiet resolve at closure. The hush charges the final image—Mina's stone-throw occurs within the same attentive silence, now generative rather than receptive. Coherent across turns; no tonal breaks. Minor issue: some elevated diction ("magnetic grotto," "dimension where opposites reconciled") slightly tensions the earthy hush with abstraction, but the grounding images (moss, stone, water) anchor the dominant register.</comment>
