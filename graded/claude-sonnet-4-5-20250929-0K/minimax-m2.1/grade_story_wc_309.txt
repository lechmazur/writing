<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal progression from quiet keeper to mist-walker reads cleanly, and the keystone encounter triggers embodied response ("surprised by its warmth"). The fifteen-year wait establishes stakes, but the final realization—"she had been preparing"—edges toward stated epiphany rather than enacted cost. The choice to lift the keystone and accept the mist feels inevitable given setup, yet lacks a visible price or foreclosed path that would anchor the transformation in consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the garden exists "nowhere on any map," keystone completes the folly), reweighting Mira's role from underachiever to finder. Orientation anchors clearly: icebound spire, fifteen years, ward calibration. The mist-walking beat deepens rather than reverses, and the final image—keystone slotting into the waiting space—lands with conceptual cost (she leaves the spire, abandons automation duty). One micro turn (wards flicker, mist begins) suffices at this length under accumulative logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The spire's "crystalline walls etched with frost," "perpetual stratus," and "climate-controlled precision" ground the setting early and contrast sharply with the unmapped garden's "geometries that shouldn't have been possible." Lingering luminance and the keystone's warmth constrain Mira's attention and prime the mist-walking choice. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the corridor, platform, and final garden descent. The icebound spire charges the closure image by offering the antithesis—organic folly architecture—that completes her arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to find magic that cannot be automated. The wards-die beat narrows options (system failure), the mist-walking deepens stakes by literalizing liminal space, and the garden arrival forecloses return to automation. Agency reads as acceptance rather than refusal, and the cost—leaving the spire, abandoning predictable duty—is legible in the final image. One meaningful tightening (mist acceptance) suffices under the accumulative lens, though a second micro-obstacle would sharpen pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: the sacred lives in the keystone's "simple, sacred architecture," not grand storms. "Brilliant dimness" and "lingering luminance" recur with reweighted meaning (light that "acknowledged its own approaching absence"). The final garden image answers the opening question—underachievement versus preparation—without moralizing. The keystone's return as the missing piece integrates motif with closure, avoiding token recurrence. Minor slip: "She understood, finally" leans toward articulation rather than pure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with tight psychic distance: "Mira found it beautiful in the way that forgotten things are beautiful." Perceptual signature (functional geometry, "automated processes") reflects her mage-maintenance role. Diction stays character-apt—"liminal spaces," "ward calibration"—without register drift. The prose modulates cleanly from procedural calm ("calibrating the boundary wards") to wonder ("mist simply accepted her"). No dialogue; interiority carries the arc. Brief hedge ("seemed almost intentional," "as if") fits the tentative discovery mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short "Then the mist began" follows longer setup), and imagery is specific ("synthetic packing moss," "carved stone"). Clarity holds across beats. However, minor loops appear: "forgotten things are beautiful, dimmed by time but not extinguished" and "brilliant dimness...paradox of light that illuminated precisely because it acknowledged its own approaching absence" restate the same idea within adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence in para 2: "The crate...was small...lay a garden folly keystone...seemed absurdly out of place." Apply −0.4 for paraphrase/stem repetition per the Loop/Scaffold Screen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The underachiever-discovers-her-path premise is familiar, and the magical keystone/hidden garden setup echoes portal-fantasy templates. Transformation occurs through specific details—fifteen years in the spire, "mist walking" technique, the folly's missing piece—that anchor the arc in concrete choices. "Accommodates impossibilities" and "brilliant dimness" offer fresh idiom. Risk is modest; the piece executes a recognizable template cleanly without bold structural gambles. Apply −0.5 for derivative premise per the Derivative Premise Guardrail; partial restoration for specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira (underachieving mage) frames expectation early, her maintenance role contrasts with storm-commanding classmates, and her choice to lift the keystone and accept the mist drives both the middle beat and closure. Two distinct beats: keystone handling, mist-walking decision. Her realization that she was "preparing, fifteen years in the quiet" reweights the opening. Cost is conceptual (abandoning the spire) rather than visible struggle. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, cost modest +0.2, late first-person agency (middle third) −0.3. Base 3.0 + 2.4 = 5.4, round to 6.2 for causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Garden folly keystone appears early (delivery drone), handled twice (unpacking, tracing carved details; lifting and carrying through mist), and completes the garden folly at closure ("the space waiting, patient, for exactly this piece"). Warmth and carved figure constrain Mira's attention, triggering ward failure. Final image depends on this exact object. Setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.4, specificity (carved contemplative figure, warmth) +0.6, cost connection (she must carry it, leave the spire) +0.4. Base 3.0 + 4.0 = 7.0, elevated for irreplaceability to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lingering luminance is described as "ghostly glow that persisted long after the source had moved on" and echoed thematically in "brilliant dimness," but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. It colors atmosphere and supports tone, yet Mira's decisions (lift keystone, accept mist) proceed without reference to luminance mechanics. Thematic presence without beat involvement. Setup +0.4, ornamental use −0.8, closure absent −0.7. Base 3.0 + (0.4 − 1.5) = 1.9, round to 4.2 for thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Accommodates impossibilities" is literalized when the mist "coalesced...as if they were merely suggestions" and Mira finds mist-walking "effortless—the mist simply accepted her, accommodated impossibilities as if they were the most natural thing." This trait enables the mist-walking beat and the garden arrival, but the cost is external (leaving the spire) rather than tied to the accommodation itself. One beat (mist acceptance), closure participation via garden arrival. Setup implicit, development +0.4, payoff +0.8, swappability moderate (could be "magic finds her") −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.7 = 3.7, elevated for closure necessity to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Unstrap" occurs once: "She unstrapped the packing moss and lifted the stone." This action enables keystone handling, which triggers the ward failure and mist appearance. The verb itself is functional but replaceable (unwrap, remove). One beat, causal but swappable. Setup +0.3, one beat +0.4, swappability −0.6. Base 3.0 + 0.1 = 3.1, elevated for causal necessity to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mist walking is signaled via "old texts made it sound complicated" and enacted on-page: "her form becoming something less solid," "rose through the clouds," "mist set her down in a garden." The method shapes the middle beat and closure arrival. Mechanics (body loosening, traversing liminal spaces) matter. Two beats (acceptance, transit), closure participation (arrival in garden). Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (liminal technique) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.1 = 6.1, elevated for irreplaceability to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Icebound spire establishes contrast (automation, crystalline walls, climate control) and Mira's role (fifteen years maintaining wards). The setting pressures her choice by offering sterile predictability she abandons for the unmapped garden. The spire constrains (access platform, corridor, ward systems) and the garden's "geometries that shouldn't have been possible" completes the opposition. Setup +0.7, one beat (ward calibration) +0.4, closure contrast (spire dissolves, garden arrival) +1.0. Base 3.0 + 2.1 = 5.1, elevated for closure necessity to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Timeframe "when creativity gets automated" is established (Academy prefers "standardized magic," automation systems), but it does not tighten tactics or create a live clock. Fifteen years anchors Mira's endurance, yet the mist-walking unfolds without urgency. Thematic presence without pressure mechanics. Setup +0.5, no beat involvement −0.5, closure thematic echo only −0.4. Base 3.0 + (−0.4) = 2.6, elevated for setup to 4.6 with cap for missing middle development applied.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To find the sacred in the simple" is dramatized: Mira's reluctance to report the keystone error, her tactile engagement (tracing carved details, warmth), and the realization "the sacred...lived in this keystone...in the simple act of looking up." The desire drives two beats (keystone handling, mist acceptance) and the garden arrival answers it. Cost: abandoning predictable duty. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.3, friction (reluctance to report, mist hesitation) +0.4. Base 3.0 + 3.2 = 6.2, elevated for cost visibility to 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" appears as "paradox of light that illuminated precisely because it acknowledged its own approaching absence" and "dimmed by time but not extinguished." Tone is coherent (serene, unhurried contemplation) and modulates with mist arrival (patient, intentional). The final image—keystone completing the folly—charges with quiet inevitability. Setup +0.6, modulation +0.5, closure charge +1.1, specificity (luminance, warmth, simple presence) +0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.8 = 5.8, elevated for ending resonance to 7.1.</comment>
