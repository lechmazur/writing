<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's descent past survival instinct and her final transformation are motivated, but the shift from drowning panic to transcendent acceptance lacks embodied struggle—the "no drowning" moment arrives as assertion rather than earned through micro-choices. Internal contradiction is present (survival vs. task completion) but flattens once the perfume activates; the protagonist becomes a passive vessel for memories rather than wrestling with the cost. The grandmother's legacy provides clear motivation, yet Marina's individual stakes dissolve into collective essence without visible friction at the pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Marina becomes the living repository, forecloses her singular existence) with conceptual cost legible in "not as herself but as something greater." Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the perfume unlocks layered memories, density increases, and the final image reweights her sacrifice as "lonesome and splendid." One meaningful deepening occurs when she opens the vial and accepts transformation. The causality of the mechanism (perfume as key, hidden gears, temple's recognition) holds, though the leap from "drawing water into her lungs" to transcendent breathing skips embodied struggle and risks convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underwater temple, kelp curtains, altar with extinct sea creatures, and rusted gears create vivid spatial anchors. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Marina's urgency: "icy water," "burning lungs," "dim flashlight," "warm vial." The temple's architecture (collapsed entrance, vaulted ceilings in memory, walls blooming soft twilight light) constrains her descent and choice to unsnarl the mechanism. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The vial's warmth and the perfume's spiral constrain the final choice and charge the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: complete the family task or die without finishing. Pressure tightens as oxygen fails ("remaining air bubbled past her lips in a desperate exhalation") and the distress signal brings no help. Opening the vial is an agency-driven escalation that forecloses retreat. The mechanism behind the altar and the temple's recognition narrow options toward the transformation. The cost—surrendering "singular existence" to become the vessel—is legible in the final image. One meaningful tightening (vial opened, gears unsnarled) is sufficient for this length under the Accumulative lens, though the shift from drowning to transcendent breathing bypasses physical struggle and slightly undercuts visceral escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of ephemerality, preservation, and sacrifice emerges organically from the temple's purpose ("trap designed to capture and hold the gathered essence") and Marina's transformation. The perfume as vessel for "accumulated hush of ten thousand voices" avoids overt statement. The final image—"lonesome and splendid all at once"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the cost of preservation without moralizing. Subtext operates in the grandmother's warning, the family's multi-generational preparation, and Marina's realization that the temple "needed a vessel." Minor slip: "ephemeral nature of all things beautiful" borders on abstraction, but concrete images (incense, robes, twilight through water) anchor it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tight interiority during the vial decision, then expansive as memories flood. Perceptual signature is present in Marina's focus on the vial's warmth and the temple's hush. Diction is elevated ("gathered hush," "lonesome and splendid") and voice-consistent, though "羲悬" (extraneous character after Marina's name in the opening) appears to be a typographical artifact. Under peak stress, the prose maintains lyric texture without collapsing into fragments, supporting the Accumulative lens. However, "unsnarl the final tangle of gears" introduces a verb ("unsnarl") that feels slightly incongruous with the surrounding register, and the shift from panic to serenity lacks embodied compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language ("kelp curtains," "sunken cathedral," "spiraling column of silver and gold") is vivid without overwhelming. Information density is high: most sentences advance atmosphere, memory, or transformation. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The gathered hush of the temple seemed to intensify" echoes the opening's "gathered hush of centuries," and "Marina gasped, drawing water into her lungs, but she felt no drowning. She felt the opposite" is a near-restatement. Template cadence in the final paragraph ("not as herself but as something greater: the gathered hush given form, the ephemeral rendered eternal, the last song...") stacks parallel clauses without propulsion. Minor: "unsnarl" (verb choice) and the extraneous character "羲悬" are small line-level slips. These artifacts do not obscure closure but reduce tightness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The underwater-temple-as-memory-trap premise and the perfume-as-key offer a specific angle on preservation/sacrifice themes. The grandmother's map and warning, the multi-generational family duty, and the mechanism behind the altar are particular to this story. However, the core arc—lone explorer accepts mystical transformation to preserve a lost civilization—echoes familiar genre templates (Lovecraftian descent, chosen-one vessel). The emotional climax (Marina becomes the repository) is earned by prior setup, but the transformation itself (pain → transcendence, drowning → new breathing) lacks friction or a non-obvious cost. The final image's "lonesome and splendid" duality adds texture but does not fully subvert expectation. Proximity check: no direct echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Marina is the distress signal sender. The signal is mentioned once in exposition ("The distress signal she had broadcast hours ago would bring no help in time") but does not create a turn or shape tactics. It establishes hopelessness but is not revisited or used to complicate choices. Present but ornamental; no causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The crystal perfume vial appears in the opening (clutched to chest), the grandmother's map and warning prime it, Marina presses thumb to stopper (hesitation beat), unscrews cap (escalation), the perfume rises and touches her face, and it "responded to her touch" at the mechanism. The vial is handled across at least four beats and its opening is the decisive escalation. It shapes the ending ("perfume had become her new atmosphere") and is irreplaceable (scent as key). Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity; hairline slip: the vial itself is not revisited in the final image, though its contents are.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Gathered hush" is seeded in the opening ("gathered hush of centuries"), intensifies when the temple leans inward "as if the structure itself leaned inward, waiting," and culminates in the final image: "the accumulated hush of ten thousand voices singing" and "the gathered hush given form." It shapes the dominant stake (preservation of ephemeral essence) and charges the final reconfiguration. The concept is not merely thematic; it defines what Marina becomes. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability; slight deduction for abstractness (the "hush" is more metaphor than tangible constraint on tactics).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Touches memories" is the perfume's core mechanism: it "touched memories she had never lived, flooding her consciousness with visions" and "the perfume responded to her touch, its memories intensifying." The attribute enables the transformation (Marina gains access to the temple's heart through memory-key), constrains the choice (she must accept the flood), and defines the cost (her singular self dissolves into collective memory). Present across multiple beats, causal pressure high, closure participation strong. The trait is specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" is the physical action that completes the sequence: "Her fingers, moving without conscious direction, found the mechanism hidden behind an altar carved with sea creatures now extinct. The perfume responded to her touch, its memories intensifying as she unsnarl the final tangle of gears that had rusted shut." The unsnarling is the decisive enabling action that makes the temple's heart beat again and triggers the transformation. It appears at the climax, is causally necessary, and is irreplaceable (no other action could substitute). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; minor grammar slip ("unsnarl" should be "unsnarled").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Overriding instinct" is signaled in the opening: "Marina understood that she had overridden her survival instinct the moment she descended past the temple's collapsed entrance." It defines her initial choice (descent despite danger) and is conceptually linked to the final renunciation (accepting transformation over life). However, it does not shape middle tactics or return with reweighted meaning at closure; the phrase itself does not reappear. The method is stated early and conceptually consistent but lacks on-page demonstration of ongoing struggle between instinct and will. Functional across setup and thematic payoff, but middle development and closure participation are weak.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater temple is present in the title-like opening phrase, anchors all action (collapsed entrance, kelp curtains, altar, hidden mechanism, walls blooming light), and its architecture (rusted gears, extinct sea creatures carved on altar) constrains Marina's choices. The temple's "heart" beating again is the physical closure event. The setting is irreplaceable: the story cannot function without this exact temple and its preserved magic. Present across all three gates (setup, development, payoff), high causal pressure, strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"As time runs short" is legible throughout: "her lungs burning," "oxygen failing," "remaining air bubbled past her lips in a desperate exhalation," "Her oxygen was gone, her air spent." The ticking clock tightens the vial-opening decision and escalates pressure. However, once the perfume is released, time ceases to constrain ("she no longer needed to breathe in the conventional sense"), which dilutes the timeframe's role at closure. Strong setup and middle pressure; closure participation is conceptual (time transcended) rather than tactical. The timeframe shapes two beats and alters tactics but does not charge the final image directly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" is thematically central: the temple was built "to capture and hold the gathered essence of a civilization that understood how quickly everything precious dissolves into nothing." Marina's acceptance of the transformation enacts this motivation. However, the desire itself is not dramatized as Marina's conscious goal; it is her family's multi-generational project. Marina's personal motivation reads more as duty (complete the task) than an active desire to harness ephemerality. The concept shapes theme and closure but is not tested through conflicting wants. Present in setup and payoff; middle friction and personal stakes are underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is explicitly named in the final beat: "Marina felt herself becoming lonesome and splendid all at once—solitary in her sacrifice yet brilliantly illuminated by the glow of a thousand remembered sunsets." The tone is established early (icy darkness, ancient hush, her solo descent) and modulates through the memory flood (grandeur of the temple's glory) to the bittersweet transformation. The tone charges the final image and coheres across turns. Strong closure linkage and specificity; the explicit statement is slightly on-the-nose but earns it through prior build.</comment>
