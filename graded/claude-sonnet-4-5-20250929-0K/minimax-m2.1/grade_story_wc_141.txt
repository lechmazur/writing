<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's professional identity as myth-buster is clearly established, and her progression from debunker to reluctant embracer shows some internal contradiction. However, the final transformation feels explained rather than embodied—"she felt something gentler" tells the shift without showing the micro-choices under competing impulses. The turn toward acceptance arrives through extended reflection rather than a dramatized moment where her skepticism and longing genuinely collide on the page. Interiority leans toward summary and thematic announcement in the final third.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: resonant pattern building toward a reconfiguration of Elena's stance. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who, where, when established early). The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Elena accepts mystery), but cost remains abstract—"professional despair" is named, then softened without visible forfeiture of reputation, method, or a concrete next action. The Russian word "убегая от" (running from) breaks immersion and reads as an artifact. One meaningful deepening occurs, but the final image doesn't reweight prior particulars with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The observatory is vividly anchored: copper dome, salt-and-sawdust smell, dust motes, weather-beaten table. The cello and painted seashell constrain Elena's investigation and charge the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (her "professional curiosity," "familiar mixture of melancholy and purpose"). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting pressure reaches the ending, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but some description lingers in postcard mode ("bruised twilight sky," "dark as dead eyes") without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Elena's need to explain versus her unacknowledged longing for connection. The inciting turn (cello hum reveals a vision) arrives clearly and narrows her options from detached investigation to personal reckoning. However, escalation is largely reflective—she "began to retell" and "pieced together fragments"—rather than a sequence of on-page decisions with visible trade-offs. The final acceptance of mystery is a stance crystallization, but the cost (forfeiting her debunking mission) is told rather than demonstrated through a concrete forfeiture or renunciation scene. One meaningful tightening under Accumulative lens, but pressure doesn't visibly narrow options in the final third.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—unspoken connections, ephemeral understanding—emerges from the cello's function and Elena's reimagined dialogues. The painted seashell's spirals suggest meaning moves in circles, a purposeful image. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "some mysteries were not meant to be busted but embraced" and "the compass of human connection pointed...inward." This is thematic echo and moralizing that replaces earned resonance. The "ongoing hum" image is evocative but arrives after the explanation, reducing its charge. Subtext operates in the cello/seashell dynamic, yet the ending summarizes rather than dramatizes the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, remains stable and voice-motivated. Diction fits Elena's intellectual register ("methodical precision," "demystification," "theatrical trappings"). Perceptual signature is consistent: she filters through her professional lens ("expecting another straightforward explanation"). No head-hopping. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("the compass of human connection pointed...inward, toward the ephemeral moments") where simpler embodiment would sharpen impact. The Russian word "убегая от" (running from) in the penultimate paragraph is unexplained and breaks the established English narrative frame without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "expecting nothing more than an abandoned project" / "not produce the discordant twang she anticipated" restates expectation without new pressure. Template cadence in reflection blocks: "she realized," "she understood," "she felt" cluster in the final third. The phrase "универсальный riddle of all the things left unsaid" mixes languages mid-phrase without pattern-teaching or payoff, reading as artifact. Stock metaphors ("dark as dead eyes," "abandoned thoughts") appear without fresh inflection. Minor filter-verb stacks in peak beats ("she realized," "she understood," "she felt") dull immediacy. These artifacts touch but do not fully obscure the closure, triggering moderate Q7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The myth-buster-confronts-real-mystery premise is familiar, and the emotional arc follows a predictable template: skeptic → experience → acceptance. The cello and painted seashell offer specific objects, and the "reimagines past conversations" attribute provides a fresh angle on haunting. However, the transformation test reveals weakness: swap Elena for any skeptic and the arc holds unchanged. The "ephemeral compass" conceit is articulated rather than dramatized through irreplaceable choices. Some lived detail (salt-and-sawdust smell, half-finished cello) anchors the premise, but the resolution retreats to safe abstraction ("some mysteries were not meant to be busted but embraced") rather than a bold, particular answer.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena's myth-buster role is established early and frames her investigation. Her professional method drives the opening beats (packing equipment, expecting straightforward explanation). The cello touch and subsequent visions narrow her stance from detached skepticism to personal reckoning, meeting Development. At closure, she "leave[s] this place without a scientific explanation," participating in the ending. However, her choices are largely reactive—she responds to visions rather than making tactical decisions that trade off her debunking method against a competing want. The myth-buster identity constrains but does not force a visible on-page cost or alter tactics in a second distinct beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The painted seashell appears early (Setup) on the weather-beaten table. It is handled in one beat: "the painted seashell warm in her hand where she had not consciously reached for it." It returns in the middle reflection as a guide: "seemed to guide her, its spirals suggesting that meaning moved in circles." It is present at closure conceptually but not handled or reweighted with new function. Two mentions, one touch, thematic suggestion. The seashell's "spiraling symbols" are described but their mechanics do not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Functional but largely ornamental; could be replaced with another symbolic object without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Ephemeral compass" is named explicitly mid-story: "was not an instrument at all but a direction that existed only in the moment of questioning." It shapes the middle reflection: Elena follows the cello's hums as directional guidance toward unsaid conversations. At closure, "the compass of human connection pointed...inward" restates the concept. However, it does not constrain an on-page decision with visible cost—Elena does not weigh competing directions or forfeit an alternative path tied to the compass metaphor. The concept is present across Setup, Development, and Payoff, earning eligibility above mid-band, but remains thematic rather than tactical. Lyric reprise with some reweighting, but no causal pressure or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Reimagines past conversations" is the attribute that defines Elena's visions. Introduced in the middle beat ("she reimagined past conversations—not as they had happened, but as they might have been"), it drives the accumulative reflection: "conversations with her mother, with colleagues she had dismissed, with lovers she had debunked into silence." At closure, this reimagining enables her acceptance of mystery. The attribute is causally active across Development and Payoff and appears in three distinct beats (initial vision, reflection sequence, final acceptance). However, the cost tied to reimagining is told rather than shown: we do not see her forfeit a present opportunity or relationship because of this revisitation. All three gates met; causal role in multiple beats; moderate specificity; cost is implied but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Retell" is named explicitly: "Elena began to retell not a supernatural mystery but her own story, piecing together fragments of conversations." This action drives the middle accumulative sequence and defines her shift from investigator to participant. At closure, the act of retelling underwrites her acceptance: she leaves "without a scientific explanation" because she has retold her personal narrative instead. The action is present in Setup (implicit in her expectation to explain), Development (explicit retelling of fragments), and Payoff (the story she now tells herself). However, retelling is largely reflective and summary-driven; it does not involve a second on-page scene where she speaks or acts differently because of what she has retold. Lyric reprise with moderate reweighting; swappable with "re-examine" or "revisit" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Resonant hums in a half-finished cello" is the method signaled early: cello on the table, Elena brushes the strings, "a low resonant hum filled the observatory." The hum triggers the vision, establishing mechanics. In the middle, "Each time she touched the cello strings, she reimagined past conversations," showing repeated use. At closure, "the ongoing hum" charges the final image and Elena sits "within that whisper." The method appears in all three gates, drives two distinct beats (initial vision, repeated reimagining), and its incompleteness (half-finished cello, unattached neck) mirrors Elena's unfinished conversations, adding specificity. Removing the cello's hum would break the story's central mechanism. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The abandoned observatory on the cliff is anchored early and vividly: copper dome, pitted rust, salt-and-sawdust smell, open shutter. It contains the cello and seashell, supplying the resources that drive Elena's investigation. At closure, "the observatory itself were a book settling into its final chapter, and Elena sat within that whisper" personifies the setting and charges the ending. However, the cliff location and abandonment do not constrain Elena's choices—she could conduct this investigation in any isolated structure. The observatory functions as atmospheric container rather than tactical pressure. Setup, Development (supplies objects), and Payoff (final image metaphor) are present; causal involvement is moderate; specificity is high but tactical constraint is low.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Inside the whisper of closing pages" appears only in the final paragraph: "the wind carried whispers of closing pages, as if the observatory itself were a book settling into its final chapter." This metaphorical timeframe is ornamental and does not tighten decisions or tactics earlier in the story. No clock or deadline shapes Elena's investigation; she arrives at twilight, explores at her own pace, and reflects without temporal pressure. The timeframe is absent from Setup and Development, appearing only at Payoff as a lyric image. Late introduction (final third), no causal pressure, and easily removed without altering the story's logic. Decorative metaphor that does not constrain the narrative clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To decode a universal riddle" is Elena's implicit motivation: she seeks to "explain away" supernatural claims and decode mysteries. The riddle is named mid-story: "a reckoning with the universal riddle of all the things left unsaid." At closure, her stance shifts from decoding to embracing mystery, showing motivational friction. However, the desire to decode is largely background framing rather than a dramatized want that creates on-page conflict—Elena does not weigh decoding against a competing immediate goal with visible cost. The motivation is present across Setup (her career), Development (realization of the riddle), and Payoff (abandoning the decode mission), but the friction is told in reflection rather than tested through a choice that forces her to forfeit a concrete opportunity. Functional across three gates; moderate thematic charge; low dramatization of cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Gloomy cheerfulness" is established early: "There was something rather beautiful, she often thought, about explaining away magic...This gloomy cheerfulness had sustained her through years of disappointments." The tone is coherent and modulates: opening melancholy with purpose, middle wonder and trembling, final "gentler" recognition without despair. At closure, the tone shifts from active cheerfulness to passive acceptance, charging the final image. However, the oxymoron is named rather than consistently embodied in sentence rhythm and image—after the initial paragraph, the prose trends toward earnest lyricism without sustained tonal contradiction. The tone is present in Setup, modulates in Development, and reconfigures at Payoff. Moderate coherence; some charge to the ending; could be more consistently woven through diction and syntax under pressure.</comment>
