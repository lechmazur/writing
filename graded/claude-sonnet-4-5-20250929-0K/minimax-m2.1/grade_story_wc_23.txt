<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior is grounded in concrete ritual (bronze censer foot, moon-phase clarity) and her micro-choices to answer midnight calls show agency under pressure. The woman at the marsh is given tears and a reverse-migration pull, but remains a figure to be guided rather than a second living consciousness with contradictory impulses. The piece earns its Earned Stasis closure—Mara commits to repeated midnight navigation with visible cost (she will walk north into grief)—but the final encounter feels more like illustration than dramatic friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by the cupola view; the dominant stake (guide the bereft through grief geography) emerges early and tightens when the woman's voice breaks through static asking Mara to walk north. The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara descends, meets the woman, and commits to the work again—"neither an ending nor a beginning, but a way through"—with the cost made legible in her willingness to traverse the marsh repeatedly. One substantive tightening (the midnight call → descent → marsh meeting) is sufficient for this length under an Accumulative lens; the final image reweights the premise without forced reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The signal station cupola, rusted ladder, and marsh with black water and twisted cypress create a vivid micro-setting. The bronze censer foot functions as setting-as-object: its warmth and weight anchor Mara physically and constrain her method (she carries it as tether). The marsh moonlight guides the final walk, charging the closure image. Sensory selection is strong (green patina, starlit silver water), and spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—navigate grief geography for the lost—is signaled early. The midnight call provides a meaningful tightening: the woman tries to walk north against collective advice, and Mara's decision to meet her and walk together forecloses the option of passive listening. The cost is visible: Mara will repeatedly descend into the marsh, enduring the fluctuating clarity of lunar cycles. Under an Accumulative lens, the single on-page reversal (call received → descent committed → woman found) narrows options with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of reverse migration—moving toward loss rather than away—emerges through Mara's ritual and the woman's compulsion without overt statement. The bronze censer foot shifts from inherited anchor to warmth-sharing promise, and the final image offers a resonant answer: "a way through, rough and honest and true." The piece resists tidy closure, embracing the ongoing work of solace. One slip: "the real navigation happened here" edges toward thematic summary, though it remains anchored in the marsh meeting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; Mara's perceptual signature (moon phases as tide, grief as cartography) is specific and sustained. The dialogue between Mara and the woman is natural, economical, and goal-driven: "Stay where you are. I'm coming to meet you." Register remains consistent; no head-hopping. One minor slip: "the only terrain that truly mattered" drifts slightly into narrator commentary rather than strict POV modesty, though it remains plausible as Mara's conviction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the opening establishes mood and stakes cleanly. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (moon-phase clarity both trait and constraint). Minor scaffold appears in repeated syntactic stems: "Mara was…," "Mara understood…," "Mara walked…" across the middle third, creating a light template cadence. The final paragraph edges toward overwriting ("gleamed like the bronze censer foot") but remains legible. No loops or major opacity; propulsion is steady.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "patchwork navigator" guiding the bereft through grief geography offers a fresh synthesis of psychopomp and emotional cartography. The midnight phone calls on a severed line and the reverse-migration concept (toward loss, not away) provide non-obvious angles. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows through with specificity (bronze censer foot, hydraulics failure). One constraint: the marsh meeting resolution feels slightly predictable once the coordinates are spoken, limiting the final surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices create key turns: she answers the midnight call, decides to descend and meet the woman, and commits to walking north together. Present in setup (cupola), middle (phone call), and ending (marsh meeting). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bronze censer foot appears in setup (inherited, patina described), middle (carried in pocket, warmth noted), and ending (warm in her palm, metaphor for tears). It functions as anchor and tether but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page. Present across beats with thematic weight, but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Reverse migration shapes the dominant stake: the woman tries to walk north to her daughter's death site against collective advice, and Mara commits to walking toward grief with her. Concept drives the central choice and redefines the work as "toward or away." Present in middle and ending with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Moon-phase fluctuation is signaled early ("clarity sharpest during the dark weeks") and mentioned again at the end ("clarity would fluctuate with its phases"). It constrains Mara's method but does not alter an on-page tactic or create a visible trade-off. Functional but not decisive.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Build" appears in the woman's call ("Everyone says go south"), Mara's accumulated reputation ("the work she had built"), and the final promise ("Together, they would build something from this"). The action frames the closure: building a way through grief. Present across beats and charged at the end, though the verb's generality slightly limits irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cryptic midnight phone calls are signaled early ("at midnight the lines still carried something"), drive the middle beat (the woman's fragmented voice), and enable Mara's descent. The method shapes her reputation and tactics. Present in setup, middle, and ending reference; strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The starlit signal station frames the opening (cupola view, rusted ladder, dark beacon) and closes the piece ("watched from the hill, its dark beacon no longer needed"). The setting provides the vantage for Mara's work and the spatial contrast (hill station vs. marsh meeting) that charges the final image. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The hydraulics failure is mentioned in the opening ("after the last storm season") and closing ("the hydraulics might have failed"), but the timeframe does not tighten tactics or create urgency. The "three years" and "midnight" cues provide atmosphere but do not constrain choices. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation to navigate the geography of loss drives every beat: Mara's ritual, the phone call response, the descent, and the marsh meeting. Friction arises in the fluctuating clarity and the recurring pull to walk toward grief. Desire is dramatized through choices with visible cost (repeated navigation, ongoing solace work). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Raw solace is sustained through diction ("rough and honest and true," "the honesty that raw solace required") and the tone of earned endurance without sentimentality. The tone modulates with pressure (opening meditation, urgency of the call, quiet resolution) and charges the final image. Coherent across turns, though one phrase ("raw solace") is named twice, nudging toward label.</comment>
