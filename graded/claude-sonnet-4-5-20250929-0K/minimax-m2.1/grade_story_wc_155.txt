<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and embodied—the hollow efficiency and shaking hands ground her need—and the final uncurling is earned by prior causality. Internal contradiction appears in the laugh with its "pensive edge," acknowledging joy's fragility. The old women and children serve as witnesses rather than full secondary characters, keeping focus tight. Minor slip: "whatever impulse made forgotten things reach out to be remembered" drifts into abstract commentary where concrete agency would sharpen the turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues through layered images (fog, fresco, light) and pays off when the dancer "lifts off the wall" and the district "remembers." Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira's uncurling chest and the district's remembered joy crystallize options with felt cost (the fragment darkens, giving everything). Orientation is prompt: "In the orchard district...Mira walked." One tightening suffices at this length. The cost is legible in "the fresco fragment was darker than before, as if it had given everything it had left to give."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fog-bound district is vivid and recurring: "settled like sediment over five centuries," "twisted stumps...like broken teeth," walls with "empty windows." The fog constrains Mira's work ("would not hurry for her") and supplies the charged atmosphere that makes "the walls glow in ways that seemed almost deliberate." The fresco fragment and projector function as micro-setting objects that charge the closure. Minor slip: the knowledge network is named but not spatially grounded, and the shift from setup to performance could track distances more clearly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rediscovering joy after "three years of painting corporate lobbies"—is signaled early and drives the projection scene. One meaningful tightening: Mira's laugh with its pensive edge acknowledges that joy "could end," a visible emotional trade-off. The children's imitation and the old woman's touch deepen pressure without requiring multiple reversals. The fresco's darkening is a legible cost that forecloses repeating this act. Under the Accumulative lens, this suffices for strong escalation at 600–800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—continuation versus preservation, joy passing "like a flame that never quite goes out"—emerges through concrete action: the fragment giving its colors, the children imitating the dancer, the knowledge network awaiting "not preservation, but continuation." The final image of dancers staying "in the eyes of the children" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. Minor slip: "the fold of a daydream that stretched across centuries" in the closing line edges toward abstract embroidery rather than letting the prior particulars hold the weight alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, filtering setting through Mira's artist's eye ("colors...like breath onto glass," "layering brightness"). Perceptual signature is consistent: light, memory, inherited knowledge. Distance modulates purposefully, zooming to the collective ("The people came silently") then tightening to Mira's chest uncurling. Minor slips: "whatever impulse made forgotten things reach out" and "because the ruined orchard district was remembering" drift into omniscient commentary that weakens Mira's focalization at peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is often striking: "fog had settled like sediment," "colors...like breath onto glass," "twisted stumps...like broken teeth." Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere and character together. Slips accumulate: "the blur of something that matters" is self-explanatory scaffolding; "the way all genuine joy carries within it the knowledge that it could end" tells rather than trusts the image; "as if it had given everything it had left to give" repeats the concept of depletion unnecessarily. These artifacts appear in non-closure beats but lower momentum. Deduction: −0.6 for scaffold/paraphrase loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The combination—muralist using light projections, fresco fragment, fog-bound district—feels specific and organic. The emotional arc (corporate hollowness → rediscovered joy through ancestral art) transforms familiar material through vivid particulars: exposed film, knowledge network, the fragment darkening. The closure image (joy persisting in children's eyes) is earned in hindsight. Held back from higher scores by reliance on familiar recovery-through-art beats and a few generic abstractions ("whatever impulse," "the fold of a daydream") that dilute the specific synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout, her choice to project light creates the key turn, and her chest uncurling anchors closure. The act of setting up equipment, switching on the projector, and layering brightness are causal beats. Her laugh with its pensive edge charges the ending. Strong integration: setup, development (choices under pressure), and payoff all clear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fresco fragment is handled in setup ("pressed between glass"), examined ("the dancer...seemed to move"), used as the projection source ("the first beam...struck the fragment"), and its darkening at the end ("darker than before, as if it had given everything") reweights the cost. Three distinct beats plus closure linkage; irreplaceable specificity (grandmother's rescue, the hidden colors). Strong causal pressure and cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Exposed film is mentioned once ("The exposed film she used as her canvas was sensitive to light, capturing projections the way memory captures feelings"). It sets up the projection method but does not constrain a mid-scene choice or return charged at closure. Present and functional but not causally active across beats. Scores in the mid-band for setup + thematic echo without development or payoff pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is demonstrated repeatedly: "projecting colors onto walls," switching on the projector, "layering brightness until the dancer seemed to lift off the wall," "painted with light the way her grandmother had painted with pigment." The attribute shapes her method and the central event; the fresco's depletion is a visible cost tied to this exact technique. Setup, development, and payoff all present.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The display occurs and drives the middle-to-end sequence: people gather, children imitate, the old woman touches Mira's arm, the fragment darkens. It is the story's central event. Held slightly below 7.0 because the display itself unfolds without tactical obstacles; once the projector is on, the scene proceeds smoothly to closure. One major beat with closure linkage but limited mid-scene friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The knowledge network is named in setup ("her grandmother's friends, the old women who remembered everything—had sent word") and one old woman appears at the end to say the grandmother's name. Functional setup and cameo payoff, but the network does not shape Mira's tactics or constrain her choices on the page. Present but replaceable; any prompt could have brought her back. Scores in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district pervades the story: fog "settled like sediment over five centuries," twisted stumps, empty windows, the communal wall Mira finds. The fog constrains her work ("would not hurry for her"), supplies the light effects ("made the walls glow"), and the district's "remembering" charges the closure image. Setup, repeated development beats (fog as obstacle and resource), and indispensable closure participation. High irreplaceability and cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Within the fold of a daydream" appears only in the final line as a lyric flourish. No clock or urgency shapes Mira's choices; "hours, or perhaps only minutes" acknowledges vagueness rather than tracking time. Present as thematic coloring but does not constrain tactics or tighten decisions. Ornamental mention without causal pressure; scores below functional band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rediscovering lost joy is signaled early ("That joy was what Mira had come back to find"), dramatized in her shaking hands and "hollow efficiency," tested by the projection act, and paid off in "something...began to uncurl like the first green shoot of spring" and her pensive laugh. Friction between want (joy) and cost (the fragment's depletion, the knowledge it could end) is visible. Setup, development under pressure, and closure all clear.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Pensive mirth is embodied throughout: the fresco's "uncomplicated joy" contrasts with Mira's awareness of loss, her laugh "had a pensive edge to it, the way all genuine joy carries within it the knowledge that it could end," and the ending holds both recovery and fragility ("in the fold of a daydream"). Tone modulates under pressure (quiet setup, bright display, bittersweet close) and charges the final image. Coherent and purposeful; reaches the essential band.</comment>
