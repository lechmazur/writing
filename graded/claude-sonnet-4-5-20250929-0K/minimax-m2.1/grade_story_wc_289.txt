<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's profession as a ghostwriter is established with texture ("She worked in whispers"), and her observation of the nest yields an internal shift. However, the move from "keeper of secrets" to "weaver of connection" feels more like thematic articulation than a choice under contradictory pressure. The final decision to build the installation arrives as resolved insight rather than an on-page struggle between competing impulses. Embodied emotion is present but the stakes remain conceptual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (Mira, lotus temple, post-storm). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the nest discovery deepens reflection, which crystallizes into the installation idea. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira's final understanding reweights her work's meaning, and the cost is opportunity (years of anonymous labor now claimed). The lens holds, though the ending leans heavily on articulated epiphany rather than image alone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and layered: "wet stone and something greener beneath," lotus petals "bruised gold," lily pads holding rainwater. The nest—a micro-object—constrains the final choice by offering architectural metaphor that shapes the installation concept. Spatial choreography is clear (bench, pond, rocks, temple courtyard). The post-storm atmosphere charges the reflective tone and recurs in the final "wet aftermath."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Mira's search for connection between her scattered letters and herself. The nest discovery triggers one meaningful deepening that narrows her stance from passive keeper to active weaver. However, there is no on-page cost or trade-off dramatized—no client refused, no secret reconsidered—only the decision to proceed. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but lacks friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the nest's spiral, Mira's letter-writing, and the metaphor of rejoining. The ending offers a non-literal answer: all longing spirals toward the same center, and her work was connective architecture all along. Subtext operates in "needed someone else to speak" and "never kept copies, but remembered every word." The final image of dual spirals (thrush and Mira) resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and consistent: "white prayer," "world that had just wept," "prismatic quiet." Psychic distance is stable, filtered through Mira's perceptual signature. However, two passages drift into elevated register beyond her established idiom: "patent spiraling twigs...Nautilus curve...mathematical secret" and "prismatic quiet" feel ornamental rather than character-specific. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished with rhythm variation and strong images. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "rejoin what they had lost, bridging silences" / "rejoining what the storm had scattered"; "thread" recurs six times across adjacent paragraphs without pattern-taught purpose. "分离ations" is a typographical artifact (Chinese character mid-word). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; the Nautilus metaphor and "second sky" work. Template openings ("She thought about," "She would build," "She stayed") flatten momentum in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ghostwriter premise is fresh, and the nest-as-spiral metaphor offers a purposeful structural echo. However, the installation concept arrives fully formed without complication, and the "all longing connects" resolution feels familiar in lyric-essay mode. The piece commits to its vision but does not transform the template significantly. Risk-taking is moderate: the reflective density suits the Accumulative lens, yet no unconventional choice heightens stakes beyond expectation.</comment>
