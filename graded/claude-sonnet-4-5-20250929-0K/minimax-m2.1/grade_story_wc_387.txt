<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Yuki's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with calloused fingers tracing patterns and her philosophical stance integrated with her craft. Her contradiction—philosopher by nature, net-mender by trade—drives her worldview rather than alternating in summary. However, the piece leans heavily on reflective summary rather than micro-choices under pressure; the whistle and descent feel more performative than choices that foreclose options. No secondary character appears on the page to test her stance through relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by the first paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (moon paths, fireflies, whisk, nets) that reweight the appreciation-of-hidden-effort stake. The closure—whistle召唤ing fireflies, feeling the pattern complete, then descending to mend nets—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing her stance. Cost is implied but not viscerally legible on the page: no visible forfeiture or trade-off marks the final image, only readiness. Orientation Test penalty waived; pattern taught early. Closure lands but cost remains oblique (−0.4).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The whispering parapet, flooded paddies, and moon paths anchor setting vividly with sensory detail filtered through Yuki's philosophical attention. The bamboo whisk functions as micro-setting: handled twice, its weight and split prongs carry her mother's hidden effort and charge the whistle moment. The parapet's coolness and the fireflies' dance constrain her midnight vigil and her final act. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; no tourist-catalog sprawl.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—appreciating hidden effort—is signaled early and accumulates through observations of nets, father's fishing, water spiders, fireflies. The whistle moment tightens pressure slightly, converging disparate threads into a single recognition. However, the piece lacks a meaningful choice that narrows options or forecloses a path with on-page cost. The descent to mend nets reaffirms her existing stance without visible trade-off or loss. One deepening (whistle召唤 fireflies, pattern completes) is present but escalation under the Accumulative lens remains gentle; cost clarity is weak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—hidden effort, repair as reverence, the grammar of nets and connection—emerges organically from concrete particulars (nets, whisk, moon paths, firefly dance) without assertion. The final image (whistle, pattern completion, descent) reweights prior material: her teaching her father patterns he doesn't know he's using, her mother's whisk now meditation tool, all converging. The closing line "ready to mend whatever waiting nets needed her come morning" risks slight moralizing but stays rooted in her labor. Subtext operates in her "strange pleasure in his ignorance" and the fireflies' dual grief-joy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled. Perceptual signature is distinct: Yuki notices "invisible threads," "moon paths stretched…like silver stitching," "scintillatingly somber flashes"—language filtered through her philosopher-mender lens. Diction elevates but stays character-consistent (e.g., "demure audacity" reads as narratorial color matching her worldview). No dialogue; no second character on the page. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from embodied perception (cool stone, bamboo weight) to reflective summary. One minor slip: "scintillatingly somber" feels like authorial color rather than Yuki's own phrasing under pressure (−0.2).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and imagistic with high density: most sentences layer setting, character insight, and thematic material. Figurative language is dense ("moon paths…like silver stitching," fireflies as "scattered thoughts," net-mending grammar) but coherent and voice-motivated. However, runs of abstract philosophizing ("the invisible threads that connected moments," "how a single break could unravel meaning itself") accumulate without immediate scene pressure, risking decorative overwriting. Paraphrase loop: "invisible threads…patterns she could not see but understood" restates rather than advances (−0.2). Template cadence in middle paragraph: "Her neighbors thought…but they brought…trusting…just as she appreciated…" creates a drumbeat (−0.3). Closure beat stays clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The net-mender philosopher synthesis and the hidden-effort theme offer a fresh angle on labor and connection. Specific details (bamboo whisk's split prongs, water spiders' nets, moon paths guiding her father's fishing) ground the meditation in particulars. The whistle—calling fireflies as her mother taught—provides one memorable inflection. However, the contemplative-woman-on-parapet frame and the convergence-of-past-and-present structure are familiar templates. The piece transforms them through specificity but does not take bold structural or perspectival risks that would elevate originality further.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Yuki is present throughout but her choices remain observational until the whistle (final third). The whistle and descent are decisions, but they reaffirm rather than alter her stance. No middle choice dramatizes her net-mending philosophy under pressure. Present in closure (descent to mend nets) but participation is confirmatory rather than transformative. Setup clear; development weak; closure participation present but low-agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Whisk appears in beats two (drawn from sash, examined, held before her with moonlight on prongs) and three (still warm in hand as she descends). It carries her mother's hidden effort and serves as meditation tool, charging the whistle moment thematically. However, its use remains contemplative rather than constraining a choice or altering tactics. Early signal strong; two beats present; closure linkage (warm in hand) is mention-only without causal weight (−0.6 for ornamental reprise).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Hidden patterns/effort frame the entire piece: net repair, fishing patterns she taught her father, water spiders' nets, moon paths, firefly grammar. The concept shapes her stake (to appreciate hidden effort) and her midnight vigil is an act of recognition. The whistle moment synthesizes disparate patterns into one convergence. However, the concept remains thematic rather than tactical; it does not narrow options or impose a visible cost. Setup strong; development thematic; closure thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Scintillatingly somber" modifies the fireflies' flashes in the third paragraph: "each glow a small grief and a small joy held in the same trembling light." The phrase labels the contradiction rather than constraining action. Yuki understands this intimately, linking it to her mother's death and the whisk's dual purpose, but the attribute does not enable or constrain a choice with cost. Label-only use (−0.6); late first appearance (second third, −0.3); no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The whistle appears in the final third as the convergent act: "a sound she had not made since childhood, since her mother had taught her to call the fireflies." It completes the pattern (moon path, firefly dance, wet stone, dry bamboo, mother's teaching, father's labor) and earns the "demure audacity" tone. Fireflies respond, validating the act. However, it arrives late (final third, −0.6), resolves a pattern it did not help create earlier (−0.4), and could be replaced with another召唤 gesture. Setup weak (mother's teaching mentioned earlier but whistle not foreshadowed); development absent; closure participation strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Following moon paths" appears in paragraph two: Yuki's eyes follow the moon paths across flooded paddies, "letting her mind travel along their shimmering courses." The method is visual/contemplative rather than physical navigation. The moon path leads toward the harbor where her father's boat waits, linking to the fishing patterns she taught him. Present early; one beat; method is observational rather than tactical. Swappable with "by watching" or similar (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Whispering parapet after rain anchors the entire scene: cool stone under palms, wet leaves, ancient stones absorbing conversations, vantage for seeing moon paths and harbor. The setting enables her vigil and frames her philosophical stance. Rain's aftermath (washed earth scent, flooded paddies, damp air) charges the atmosphere and allows the moon-path imagery. The parapet's height provides the view that connects her observations to her father's boat. Setup immediate; development (vantage, cool stone tactile) pressures her stance; closure (she descends from it) marks transition. Could score higher if the descent carried visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Firefly season is signaled in the opening (fireflies emerge) and closing (whistle calls fireflies, "these long summer nights"). The timeframe allows the firefly imagery that carries the scintillatingly-somber duality and responds to the whistle. However, the season does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline; it enables atmosphere rather than constraining tactics. Setup clear; development atmospheric; closure participation thematic (fireflies respond). No urgency or trade-off tied to the season itself (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Appreciation of hidden effort is Yuki's explicit motivation, declared in paragraph two and threaded throughout: neighbors' faith in her craft, water spiders' nets, her father's use of patterns she taught, the whisk craftsman's work, her mother's teaching. The vigil itself is an act of appreciation. However, the motivation is told and contemplated rather than dramatized in a choice with friction or cost. The whistle moment synthesizes appreciation but does not test it against a competing want. Setup strong; development reflective rather than conflicted; closure affirms without cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Demure audacity" is named once in the whistle beat: "The demure audacity of the act struck her even as she performed it: a grown woman, a philosopher of mending, whistling at the moon like a girl calling to ghosts." The tone fits the piece's quiet confidence and her contradictory stance (philosopher who hums, questions at wrong moments, takes pleasure in her father's ignorance). However, the label arrives late and is stated rather than modulated across beats. The tone is coherent but not dynamically charged across turns. Label-only (−0.4); late explicit naming (−0.3).</comment>
