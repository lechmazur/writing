<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aria is present and her route-mapper identity is established early, but her interior life relies heavily on paraphrase and label-speak ("trembling certainty," "analytically artistic mind"). The climactic reveal—"I never told him I was afraid to lose him"—arrives through reflection rather than embodied conflict, reducing emotional cost. The mentor relationship is told rather than dramatized, so the final confession lacks grounding in on-page pressure. Micro-choices that would demonstrate her values under stress are absent; she follows arrows without meaningful internal resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words; no penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the mist, cracks, and train station accumulate toward the confession moment. Closure attempt: Aria speaks her unspoken truth aloud, a Resonant Reconfiguration (cathartic release). Cost is asserted ("decades of silence," "trembling…quiet into certainty") but not dramatized—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift follows the confession. The phantom punch "leaves marks in the air" but this image feels decorative rather than causally integrated. One meaningful deepening is present (mystery → confession), meeting the 600–800 word standard, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The starlit vault in mist, cobblestones, and train station are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail. Setting guides Aria's path via the cracks-as-arrows, meeting the constraint test. However, the station's "dozens of pillars…cracked in patterns that spelled words" is never used—Aria "almost" reads them, then moves to confession without spatial interaction. Micro-setting (the punch, the air) charges the final image, lifting the score. No spatial coherence breaks, and the vaulted ceiling motif bookends effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: find the fortress of unspoken truths, signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the mist and arrow-cracks, but Aria's agency is passive—she follows rather than chooses under conflicting options. The confession at the station is a deepening, but it arrives without visible trade-off or foreclosed path; speaking aloud costs nothing tactically. The dare from the mentor is setup-only; no on-page antagonist or complication tests her commitment. One meaningful tightening (arrival at station → confession) meets the length standard, but cost legibility is weak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken truths emerges from the fortress conceit and Aria's confession, meeting the core requirement. The phantom punch and mist recur with slight reweighting at the end. However, the final paragraph moralizes: "courage was just another path to be mapped" is a thesis statement rather than an earned image. The confession itself—"I loved your teaching…terrified of becoming lost"—reads sincere but abstracts the emotional stakes. The piece gestures toward complexity (fear, love, loss) but resolves into tidy self-knowledge without ambiguity or cost. Prompt-like language ("fortress of unspoken truths," "analytically artistic") echoes throughout, reducing organic emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent, though the narrator occasionally drifts into expository summary ("She understood then…"). Perceptual signature is present—route-mapper's eye catalogs cracks—but the voice lacks rhythmic variety and leans on stock poetic constructions ("breath released from ancient lungs," "holes punched through velvet"). Dialogue is absent. Free indirect style is clean. Under peak stress (the confession), diction remains elevated and abstract rather than compressing into Aria's particular idiom. No major filter-verb stacks, but the texture is more committee-lyric than character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Significant template cadence and paraphrase loops harm momentum. "Analytically artistic mind," "trembling certainty," and variations recur without adding pressure. Paragraph structure is repetitive: many begin with declarative setup + elaboration in identical stems. Figurative density is high throughout ("mist rose…like breath," "stars hung like holes," "vault around her") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.5). The confession beat itself is clear, but surrounding prose recycles "ancient," "forgotten," "unspoken" in synonym churn. Loop check: adjacent sentences restate (e.g., "the answers you seek are not hidden—they are waiting" rephrases the same idea). Cumulative artifact penalty: −0.8 to −1.2 in Q7, with loops touching the closure third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Premise—mysterious fortress as metaphor for unspoken truths—is familiar and executed without transformation; the train station and phantom punch are atmospheric but do not reimagine the core conceit. The dare, the vanished mentor, the magical arrows, and the cathartic confession follow a well-worn template. Emotional specificity is weak; Aria's fear and love are asserted rather than dramatized through lived detail. No bold structural or perspectival risk. Transformation test: plot and arc could function unchanged with different props and setting. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −0.8 within Q8 for close match to writing-prompt templates without fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character "meticulous route mapper" is mentioned in the opening and closing but does not constrain on-page choices. Aria observes cracks and follows arrows; her mapping skill is label-only. No scene shows her choosing one route over another or using her precision under pressure. Functional but replaceable: she could be any seeker. Present at setup and payoff but lacks middle development. Cap: missing middle development → 3.4; ornamental use −0.6; swappability −0.5. Band anchor ~3.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Object "phantom train ticket punch" appears at setup (belt), middle (grows warm), and closure (leaves marks in the air spelling her truth). Two distinct beats with evolving state. However, its mechanics are vague—it "leaves marks on nothing" yet suddenly writes in air—and it does not narrow options or impose cost. The marks are decorative; Aria could speak her truth without the punch. Closure linkage is present but weak. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓ → eligible ≥6.1, but causal pressure is low (−0.8) and cost tie is missing (−0.4). Rounds to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Core Concept "unraveling mysteries" is the stated goal (find the fortress) and frames the quest. Aria follows clues (arrows, mist) but the "mystery" resolves into personal confession rather than puzzle-solving. The concept shapes stakes at setup and loosely at closure, but middle beats are passive following, not active unraveling. Cost is emotional rather than investigative. Setup ✓, closure weak ✓; missing middle development → cap 3.4; however, closure participation lifts slightly (+0.5) and early signal (+0.4) edges it to 4.6. Swappability: "seeking truth" or "journey" would work as well.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Attribute "analytically artistic" is mentioned four times but never constrains or enables action. Aria does not choose one mode over another, nor does the duality create friction. Label-only trait; no visible tradeoff. Present at setup, absent in development and closure. Cap: missing middle and closure → 2.8 max. Ornamental use −0.6, label-only −0.3. Rounds to 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Action "dare" is the inciting incident (mentor's challenge three moons past) and frames Aria's goal. It sets up the quest but does not return or reweight at closure; the confession is Aria's internal need, not a response to the dare. Setup ✓, closure absent. Cap: missing closure → 2.8; however, strong causal role in framing the quest (+0.9 one beat, +0.8 causal pressure on setup) and early signal (+0.5) lift to ~5.1. Replaceable with "quest" or "promise."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Method "cracks in pavement forming arrows" appears early and middle, guiding Aria to the station. Two beats (discovery, following east). However, the arrows do not impose cost or create tactical friction—they are helpful, not constraining. No closure participation; once at the station, the cracks vanish from the text. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, closure absent → cap 2.8; causal enablement (+0.9) and two beats (+0.9) lift to ~4.6, but swappability (−0.5: "map" or "signs" work equally) lowers to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setting "starlit vault in mist" is vivid and recurs throughout (opening, middle vault image, closing lift). Three beats with evolving density. The mist does not constrain choice but does charge the final image ("mist began to lift…dawn's first light"). Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓ → eligible ≥6.1. Causal pressure is low (postcard more than constraint, −0.7), but closure linkage (+1.0) and early signal (+0.5) support ~6.1; swappability (−0.4: "fog" or "night" similar) and lack of tactical cost (−0.3) lower to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Timeframe "upon the hour that divides bad habits and new starts" appears at opening and closing ("The hour of division had passed"). Lyric reprise reweights the moment with the confession as a new start. However, time does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure. Setup ✓, closure reprise ✓; missing middle development → cap 4.6. Resonance lift for early–final reprise (+0.6), but no tactical constraint (−0.6) and swappability (−0.4: "dawn" or "threshold moment"). Rounds to 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation "to find the fortress of unspoken truths" is declared early and shapes the quest. Aria's arrival and confession dramatize the goal, though friction between want and cost is weak—she walks in, no barriers. Three beats: setup, journey, closure confession. Gates: all three ✓ → eligible ≥6.1. Causal pressure moderate (+0.7), closure linkage strong (+1.2), early signal (+0.5). However, the confession is more release than conflicted choice (−0.5 cost connection weak). Rounds to 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Tone "trembling certainty" is named twice and described ("heart hammering…mind…convinced," "trembling…quiet into certainty"). The oxymoron is present at setup and closure but does not modulate with pressure—it is static duality. The final confession releases trembling into certainty, a modest charge. Gates: setup ✓, payoff weak ✓; middle development absent → cap 4.6. Closure linkage (+0.7), early signal (+0.4), but label-only execution (−0.5) and no pressure modulation across beats (−0.3). Rounds to 4.9.</comment>
