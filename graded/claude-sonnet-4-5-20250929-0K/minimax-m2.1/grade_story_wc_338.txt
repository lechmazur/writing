<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena's interior is over-articulated with diagnostic precision ("methodically curious by nature," "shielded openness") that flattens her into a collection of traits rather than embodied contradiction. Her decisions—descending, documenting, leaving—lack visible cost or competing impulses; she operates as an ideal archaeologist without genuine struggle. The final ascent mentions "shielded openness" and "reverence" but these remain labels, not choices that foreclose paths. No on-page moment forces her to choose between competing goods with felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (Elena at Thornmoor henge) and a Situational lens: she interprets archaeological evidence under the pressure of silence and historical mystery. However, the closure—her ascent acknowledging "secrets no longer silent"—lacks visible cost or a decisive reweighting of her stance. The narrative recounts her methodical work but does not dramatize a moment where options narrow or meaning shifts on the page. The final paragraph summarizes thematic achievement rather than landing a charged image, reducing the closure to conceptual claim without felt pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The fresco vault is vividly rendered ("faces and patterns running like tears through the plaster") and the rain-scoured detail anchors the setting in sensory specificity. The henge's geometry and the hidden passage constrain Elena's access, shaping her tactical choices. However, the environment functions more as atmospheric backdrop than as a force that pressures the final image; the ascent and dawn light close the piece descriptively rather than charging the closure with spatial cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—interpreting the reopened chamber's significance—is signaled early but never escalates through on-page reversal or tightening. Elena's methodical documentation proceeds without meaningful resistance, complication, or trade-off. The decision to leave the chamber "exactly as she found it" is framed as wisdom but no competing desire (to excavate further, to claim credit) exerts pressure in the scene. The narrative declares stakes ("profound discoveries") rather than dramatizing a choice that narrows options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of patience, reverence, and "interpreting silence with empathy" emerges through imagery (whispered chapel, rain-scoured fresco) and Elena's reflective stance. However, the final paragraph explicitly moralizes the theme ("the most profound discoveries come not from forcing open doors") rather than allowing the image to speak. The "whispered chapel" recurs with reweighted meaning but the closure drifts into summary and label rather than landing a non-literal answer through concrete action or image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual filter ("reading the spaces between places," "followed silence rather than sound"). However, the diction frequently elevates into academic register ("methodically curious," "shielded openness," "perceptive map framer") that reads as external characterization rather than Elena's lived idiom under pressure. The prose maintains consistent narrative distance but lacks rhythmic modulation at the closure; the final paragraph stacks abstraction ("reverence," "acknowledged," "memory") where concrete image would sharpen the ending.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose suffers from template cadence and phrase repetition: "methodically curious" appears three times, "whispered chapel" four times, "shielded openness" twice, often as labels rather than dramatized choices. Paraphrase loops cluster in the final paragraph ("secrets no longer silent, its stones holding the memory") restating closure claims without advancing pressure. Filter-verb stacks ("understood," "believed," "considered") dull immediacy in reflective passages. Information density is low in the opening and closing paragraphs, which summarize character traits and thematic achievements rather than advancing scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise—comparing archival footage to reveal a reopened chamber—offers a specific investigative hook, and the fresco vault provides concrete archaeological detail. However, the emotional arc and thematic resolution (patience over excavation, reverence over discovery) follow a familiar template of contemplative restraint without sharp friction or non-obvious cost. Elena's "shielded openness" and methodical patience read as idealized competence rather than a stance forged through struggle. The piece relies on stock descriptors ("whispered chapel," "blank parchment") and closes with an explain-everything summary that mechanically resolves ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elena is the focalizer and acts (descends, documents, leaves), but her choices do not create key turns or narrow options with cost. The "perceptive map framer" label appears in exposition; her framing work (cross-referencing footage) occurs off-page before the narrative begins. Her decision to leave the chamber unchanged is presented as wisdom rather than a trade-off between competing desires.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The henge appears in the opening, middle (altar stone, passage geometry), and closing (dawn light through stones). It supplies the hidden passage that constrains Elena's access and frames the final image. However, its symbolic recurrence ("whispered chapel") dominates over functional use; the stone circle does not evolve meaningfully across beats or charge the closure through causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The "whispered chapel" appears as a metaphor for the henge in multiple beats (villagers' prayers, Elena's descent, final acknowledgment). It functions thematically but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics; Elena's actions would remain unchanged if the chapel metaphor were removed. The concept is ornamental, recurring in description without altering her choices or the story's causal logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Methodically curious" is invoked three times as a character label but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The trait describes Elena's off-page archive work and justifies her patient approach, yet no scene dramatizes a moment where method or curiosity forces a trade-off or alters her tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Reopen" drives the mystery: someone reopened the vault between 1952 and 1987, and Elena documents the evidence. The action is central to the investigation but occurs off-page in the past. Elena's present work—descending and leaving—does not enact reopening; she acknowledges rather than performs the key action. The element shapes the premise but not the protagonist's closure choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Comparing silent footage is signaled early, shapes the inciting discovery (the 1987 doorway), and reappears in the vault where Elena projects the reels side by side. The method drives two beats (archive discovery, vault comparison) and enables her to read the chamber's history. However, the comparison does not charge the final image; her ascent and thematic reflection leave the footage behind.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault is vividly described and supplies the hidden passage that constrains Elena's access. It appears in the descent, the documentation beat, and implicitly in the ascent. The vault's "dry corner" enables her equipment setup, a micro-tactical detail. However, the setting functions more as atmospheric container than as a force that pressures the closure; the ascent and dawn shift focus away from the vault's particulars.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"The spot where a map tears, dividing known from unknown" is a metaphorical timeframe rather than a ticking clock. It appears in the opening reflection and closing summary but does not tighten decisions or alter Elena's tactics. The narrative spans discovery, descent, documentation, and ascent without temporal pressure or deadline; the metaphor decorates the theme without constraining action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To interpret silence with empathy" is named in the opening and closing and frames Elena's approach (patience, reverence). However, the desire is not dramatized through friction or competing wants. No on-page moment shows empathy costing her another goal (speed, credit, completeness). The motivation justifies her restraint but remains a thematic claim rather than a choice with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Shielded openness" is invoked twice as a character label and modulates the reflective tone (curiosity tempered by reverence). The tone is coherent but static; it does not shift under pressure or charge the final image. The closing paragraph sustains the same contemplative register as the opening, avoiding tonal escalation or reconfiguration that would reweight the stake at closure.</comment>
