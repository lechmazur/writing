<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to bridge community divides is clear and sustained, but her decisions feel more declarative than embodied under pressure. The interiority remains abstract—"empathetically decisive nature" is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Key choices (calling Antonescu, speaking Romanian) arrive as competent moves without visible internal cost or trade-off that would elevate characterization into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through the repaired clock and returned cuckoo, but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than legibly tied to Elara's agency on the page. The final paragraph summarizes transformation ("communities, like clocks, could be repaired") instead of landing a decisive image where pressure crystallizes. Causality is present but elliptical—weeks of work are compressed into summary, weakening the because/therefore linkage at the climax. The orientation is clear, so no penalty applies there, but the closure unit lacks the felt cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The grain elevators, clock tower, and silos anchor the setting with purposeful detail that reflects community barriers. The astronomical dials and Ukrainian handkerchief carry specificity. However, the environment functions primarily as symbolic backdrop rather than constraining on-page choice—the tower's mechanics are told in summary ("The repair itself required...") rather than dramatized with spatial or tool-based friction that would push this into high-band territory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—bridging fractured community—is signaled early, but escalation remains conceptual rather than on-page pressure. The key turn (Antonescu agreeing to help) is told in summary across "weeks" without a visible moment where options narrow or cost is paid. No on-page reversal or tightening forces Elara to trade one goal for another; her competence smooths all friction, leaving insufficient escalation under any lens to enter the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bridge-from-silos theme emerges through concrete images (elevators, clock weight, languages), but the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("communities, like clocks, could be repaired") rather than letting the ending image reweight prior material without explanation. The Kovalenko weight and interspersed languages offer textural richness, yet the thematic payoff arrives via summary and label rather than resonant silence, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature (Elara's perspective filtering community history through the library's lens) is present. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("gravitational pull of community needs," "celestial predictions") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Dialogue is minimal and functional; when present, it advances goals but lacks subtext or naturalism that would distinguish voices.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Several passages exhibit template cadence and overwriting: "rehabilitated shy students...rehabilitated the library's neglected...had rehabilitated the concept" is a synonym loop that dulls momentum. Figurative density in the opening ("gravitational pull," "winter snow against grain elevators") creates muddle without advancing scene pressure. The final beat summarizes rather than propelling through image, and the closure paragraph stacks abstract nouns ("starlight and song," "harmonious choral librarian") that obscure rather than sharpen. Apply −0.8 for loops and figurative overload across high-pressure beats, plus the closure beat is touched by abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—community repair through a clock tower and multilingual mediation—combines familiar tropes (fractured small town, symbolic object) without a sharp, non-obvious angle. Elara's competence and the smooth resolution trend toward template satisfaction rather than lived complexity. The interspersing of languages is present but not dramatized as risky or costly, leaving the synthesis functional but replaceable. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates originality.</comment>
