<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is embodied and contradictory—"shrewdly innocent about which she claimed to be" and the coexistence of love and uncertainty anchor her stance. The eighteen years of raising the changeling are summarized rather than dramatized, but her present choices (entering the garden, placing the tooth, refusing to identify the body) are motivated and carry weight. The final forgiveness is earned through accumulated particulars rather than declaration. Minor slip: the son's "true eyes" moment is told in summary, diluting what could be a pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates pressure through layered reflection anchored to present stimuli (the archway, the fountain, the tooth) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (forgiveness as acceptance of fracture) with visible emotional cost. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tooth's glow reweights the garden and Elara's stance. Slight drag: the ministry subplot (substitute body, officials) adds texture but doesn't tighten options on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The garden is vivid and purposeful: calendula, forget-me-nots, the Triton frozen mid-song anchor memory and the mother's sanctuary. The tooth's luminescence and the fountain's channels constrain and charge the final image, shifting from inert object to active constellation. Spatial choreography (archway, hedge, fountain basin) tracks cleanly. The garden's particulars (her mother's herb patterns, the gap in thorns) filter through Elara's selective attention and directly enable the closure ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Elara's need to transform accumulated mistakes into something her son's replacement can carry forward. The choice to place the tooth and refuse identification narrows her options (no official closure, only personal gesture). Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; the tightening is internal rather than event-driven. One visible cost: she forgoes the ministry's resolution and accepts permanent uncertainty. The stake could be signaled earlier; it emerges clearly only mid-story.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the bone-setting metaphor: fractures as windows rather than failures, wisdom as patient strength. The tooth's transformation into constellations offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The mother's voice ("look for the movement in stillness") recurs with purpose, and Elara's laugh—"more nostalgia than bitterness, more innovation than tradition"—tonally embodies the thematic synthesis. No prompt echoes or label-speak in the final beats. The "shrewdly innocent belief that even fractured things could learn to hold weight differently" risks abstraction but stays tethered to the physical tooth and fountain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly; Elara's perceptual signature (bone-setting language, forgiving skepticism, the metaphor of "cleft in certainty") is consistent and voice-particular. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the tooth-placement beat and opening for the mother's remembered voice. Diction remains within Elara's lexicon—no register drift. Minor slip: "absurdly like constellations" hedges the image rather than committing, and "something she could not articulate" / "could not quite name" loops across two paragraphs without added texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in most beats. Figurative language ("cleft in certainty," "shrewdly innocent," "absurdly like constellations") occasionally stacks without full grounding—three abstract phrases in the opening paragraph risk opacity. Loop detected: "could not quite name" (para 4) and "could not articulate" (para 5) restate the same incapacity without progression. The final sentence runs long and risks diffusion; "persistent, shrewdly innocent belief" recycles the opening's phrasing. No line-level artifacts touch the closure beat directly, limiting penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of bone-setting wisdom, changeling lore, and maternal inheritance feels specific and non-obvious. The refusal to identify the body and the garden ritual offer a fresh angle on changeling narratives—acceptance rather than retrieval. "Shrewdly innocent" and "wisely foolish" are memorable inversions. Risk: the lyric closure (tooth as constellation) is bold and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The story commits fully to its premise and follows through with particulars (the luminescent tooth, the fountain's channels). No close echoes of famous changeling tales detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara (forgiving skeptic) is present throughout and her choices—entering the garden, placing the tooth, refusing to identify the body—are key turns. Setup clear (para 1), middle choice (para 3, placing the tooth), payoff (para 7, forgiving herself). The skepticism ("nothing involving changelings ever truly ended") and forgiveness coexist in her stance and drive the closure. Strong beat involvement and causal pressure, but the skepticism could constrain a middle choice more visibly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The changeling's baby tooth is handled twice (para 3, opened and held; para 6, placed in the fountain) and returns with reweighted meaning (glows, traces constellations, becomes the ritual's focus). Setup by para 3, enables the middle ritual action, and charges the final image. Irreplaceable: its luminescence and symbolic weight (evidence of the changeling's reality) make it indispensable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the tooth's transformation is the story's hinge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"A cleft in certainty" is signaled early (para 4: "the cleft in certainty that had defined her motherhood") and shapes Elara's stance: she never knew if her child was fae or human. It constrains her choices (she cannot seek simple resolution) and reappears in the final image (fractured things holding weight differently). The concept drives the dominant stake and reweights at closure. Could press harder in the middle; it's more thematic echo than tactical constraint there.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" appears twice (para 1 and para 7) but functions more as characterization label than action constraint. Setup clear; the trait colors Elara's voice and her final stance ("shrewdly innocent belief"), but no middle beat depends on this specific trait—she could be "wary yet hopeful" with similar effect. Lyric reprise reweights the opening, lifting it into mid-band, but swappability and lack of visible trade-off limit score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Yearn" drives para 5 explicitly ("Elara yearned for something she could not articulate") and underpins the entire garden visit—her need to transform mistakes. Setup by para 5, the yearning motivates the tooth-placement ritual and the final forgiveness. The story's structure (arrival, ritual, acceptance) traces directly to this desire. Strong causal role and closure linkage, though the yearning could be signaled earlier for tighter integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Bone setting is signaled in para 4 ("something that felt like bone setting for the soul") and para 6 (the mother's teaching). It provides the story's central metaphor (fractures as sites of strength) and shapes Elara's understanding at closure. Setup mid-story, thematic payoff in the final image. The mechanics remain metaphorical rather than literal, which fits the lyric mode but limits tactical constraint. Strong thematic integration; weaker as method-that-shapes-attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The secret garden is present throughout, anchors all action, and supplies the resources (fountain, herb patterns, the gap in thorns) that enable the ritual. Setup para 2, middle action (kneeling, placing the tooth) depends on the fountain, and the final image (light through channels, constellations on stones) is garden-specific. Spatial choreography clear; the setting constrains choices (she must come here, use the fountain) and charges closure. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the substitute body is found" is signaled in para 2 (body discovered at dawn) and frames the entire visit. The timing creates urgency (officials want identification; Elara refuses and comes to the garden instead) but doesn't tighten on-page decisions beat-by-beat—no live clock counting down. Setup clear, affects the inciting situation, but middle and ending would hold without precise elapsed time. Functional causality; moderate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to turn mistakes into constellations" is dramatized in para 5 (Elara's yearning "to transform these accumulated mistakes") and para 7 (the tooth's light spreads "like constellations"). Setup mid-story, drives the ritual choice, and the final image literalizes the desire with visible cost (she accepts uncertainty, forgoes official closure). Strong closure linkage and specificity; the metaphor of constellations is irreplaceable. Could signal earlier for higher score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone "nostalgic innovation" is coherent and modulates with pressure: nostalgia in the mother's memory and the unchanged garden; innovation in Elara's laugh ("more innovation than tradition") and the new constellation patterns. The tone charges the final image (old garden, new light) and holds through turns. Setup para 1–2 (memory, fifteen years), payoff para 7 (the synthesis). Strong thematic integration; the tone shapes how we read the closure rather than altering tactics directly.</comment>
