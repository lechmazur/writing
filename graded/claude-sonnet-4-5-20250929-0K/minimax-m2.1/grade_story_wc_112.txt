<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kira's motivation to prove sideways time is declared but never tested by a competing desire or obstacle that forces a genuine trade-off. Her actions proceed smoothly from hypothesis to confirmation without internal conflict or embodied cost—she simply pulls the lever and succeeds. The "mechanically warm" trait appears twice as a label without constraining a choice or creating friction. Interiority remains abstract ("beautiful, impossible multiplicity") rather than rooted in specific contradiction or struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: Kira adjusts the nexus, achieves temporal readings, and proves her hypothesis in a because/therefore chain. Closure arrives on-page ("time moves sideways") with conceptual repricing—the velith-wings' dual molt phases validate her theory—but the cost remains asserted rather than felt; no prior path is visibly foreclosed, and Kira's professional or emotional standing does not shift. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (who, where, when), and the single-scene window holds without spatial confusion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setting anchors early (research station, methane seas, twilight shift) and the magnetic nexus physically returns in multiple beats. The lever's "worn smooth by years of obliging service" seeds tactile history, and the containment bay's curved walls and observation panes provide spatial grounding. The station's cold climate contrasts with Kira's "mechanically warm" body, charging the final image of "hush" and "suspended moments." However, no environmental constraint narrows her tactical options—she pulls the lever unimpeded—preventing the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving sideways time) is signaled early and pressure accumulates as the nexus warms, but no reversal or tightening forces Kira to trade one good against another. She proceeds from hypothesis to lever-pull to confirmation without a moment when success becomes uncertain or costly. ARIA's "Unprecedented readings" declares victory rather than dramatizing a price paid. The velith-wings' dual molt phases offer visual proof, yet Kira's personal or professional cost remains off the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme of time's sideways nature emerges through the velith-wings' dual molt phases and the station's "breathing rhythms," but the final paragraph asserts the discovery ("time had revealed its sideways nature") rather than letting the image resonate without explanation. The leap from sky mechanic to xenobiological breakthrough is declared ("would reshape…forever") instead of earned through a specific, non-literal cost. "Mechanically warm beings—herself and the creatures alike" gestures at connection but remains abstract, lacking the concrete particular that would anchor thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, blending technical detail ("temporal vectors," "quantum states") with poetic phrasing ("pages of a book being read in slow motion"). Kira's perceptual signature—mechanic's touch, patient observation—remains stable, and ARIA's single line carries appropriate coolness. However, register occasionally drifts into generic lyricism ("beautiful, impossible multiplicity") that reads more as narrator flourish than Kira's particular idiom under pressure. No head-hopping; POV control is clean throughout the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clear and propulsive, with strong image work ("iridescent membranes folding and unfolding," "prismatic blueprints"). Rhythm varies naturally and paragraph breaks create visual pacing. Minor redundancies appear: "subdued awakenings" recurs three times without reweighting, and "mechanically warm" appears twice as identical phrasing. The phrase "obliging sky mechanic" is used twice in identical construction within the same story, creating a small template echo. Figurative density is controlled, and no paraphrase loops or causality-obscuring artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The research-station frame and xenobiology premise read as familiar genre furniture, and the plot arc (lone mechanic proves unconventional theory via machinery calibration) follows a well-worn template. The velith-wings' dual molt phases offer visual specificity, but the emotional throughline—patient outsider vindicated—does not transform the archetype through lived detail or moral ambiguity. Kira's backstory as "obliging sky mechanic" adds occupational color yet does not complicate her goals or final stance. The "sideways time" hypothesis is intriguing but resolved too cleanly to surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kira is present throughout, adjusts the nexus, and pulls the lever, but her choices are procedural rather than decisive—she executes a plan without friction or trade-off. Her mechanic background seeds the lever design but does not constrain a peak choice. "Obliging" appears twice as a label without shaping tactics. The character drives the plot forward but does not create a turn that narrows options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus appears in setup (hum, warming), middle (Kira grips the lever, adjusts alignment), and closure (reaches full power, confirming readings). It enables the temporal proof and is handled across three beats. However, it operates as an obedient tool—Kira pulls the lever and it responds without resistance or surprise—so causal pressure remains moderate. The "twilight" timing is noted but does not create a ticking constraint that alters her moves.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Subdued awakenings" frames the velith-wings' gradual revival in twilight and recurs three times, seeding expectation and returning at closure ("subdued awakenings…became a cascade"). It shapes the observational stakes—Kira documents slow metamorphosis—but does not force a tactical choice or create visible friction. The concept colors tone and theme yet remains descriptive rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Mechanically warm" appears twice as a label: once describing Kira's fingertips (tactile sensitivity) and once in the final paragraph linking her to the creatures. It does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost—Kira's warmth does not limit her movement in the cold bay, nor does it shape a choice under pressure. The trait remains ornamental, a mood accent rather than a functional lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lever is designed by Kira, gripped mid-scene, and pulled to final position, structuring the climax. "She gripped the lever…pulled the lever further…clicked into its final position" marks three physical beats. However, the lever obeys without resistance or consequence—no trade-off emerges from its use—so while it scaffolds the action, it does not redefine options or impose felt cost. Swappable with "button" or "switch" in function.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Through holographic principles" appears in setup ("holographic display array," "holographic feedback loops") and middle ("holographic displays intensified," "temporal mapping grids"). Kira has "spent months mastering" the method, and it converts creature movements into "visible mathematics." The method shapes her observational technique but does not constrain a choice—holograms succeed without friction. Introduced early and used twice, yet procedural rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The xenobiology research station anchors location early and supplies the containment bay, observation panes, magnetic nexus, and climate control. Kira moves from approach to bay to lever, and the station's "breathing rhythms" mirror the creatures'. Setting provides resources (harnesses, nexus, holograms) but does not pressure Kira's choices—she operates freely without spatial or procedural friction. The cold/warm contrast colors atmosphere yet does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Within the hush of beating wings at rest" appears only in the final paragraph as a poetic closure flourish. "Twilight convergence in seventeen minutes" is announced mid-scene but never counts down or tightens decisions—Kira proceeds at her own pace. The timeframe does not shape tactics or create urgency; it remains a thematic grace note rather than a live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To prove that time moves sideways" is stated early as Kira's hypothesis and goal, driving her nexus calibration and observation. She achieves confirmation at closure ("You were correct, Kira"). However, the motivation is declared and fulfilled without dramatized friction—no competing desire, doubt, or cost tests her commitment. The want shapes the plot's direction but remains uncontested, trending functional rather than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Icy warmth" as tone is signaled through contrasts: station's cold climate versus Kira's "mechanically warm" body, ARIA's "particular chill" versus the nexus's heat, "subdued" awakenings versus "cascade" intensity. The oxymoron is purposeful and modulates slightly as pressure rises. However, the tone remains stable rather than shifting decisively at closure, and the final image ("hush…suspended between moments") echoes earlier mood without reweighting it. Coherent but not transformative.</comment>
