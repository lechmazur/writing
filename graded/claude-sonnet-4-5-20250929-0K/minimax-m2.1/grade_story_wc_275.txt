<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira's choice to tend roses rather than follow her father's path is established but primarily through summary and retrospection. The character's interiority relies heavily on abstract claims ("senselessly perceptive," "patience she had not known she possessed") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The ending stance—peace as tending what can be saved—feels philosophically articulated rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. Agency exists but is largely reflective rather than tested by live pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Conceptual Repricing at closure: the final image reweights "peace" from absence-of-violence to active nurturing. However, the entire narrative unfolds in retrospective summary mode—"three seasons past," "those early months"—with no present-scene pressure. The orientation test waived (dome setting clear early), but the lack of a present tense crisis means the closure lands as theme statement rather than dramatized cost. The before/after is conceptual but the price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert roses create a vivid, coherent micro-setting with purposeful sensory detail (amber and rust petals, sand that "remembered water"). The setting charges the thematic contrast between enclosed sanctuary and chaotic wasteland. The ballast sandbag scrap functions as tactile anchor with historical weight. Spatial choreography is clean and the environment meaningfully frames Mira's choices, though it does not constrain a present-scene decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—choosing nurture over violence—is signaled early but operates entirely in retrospective mode without present pressure. The "chaos beyond the dome" and refugee encounter exist as summary rather than on-page escalation. No live reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the piece delivers one consistent philosophical stance from start to finish. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening would suffice, but the retrospective frame prevents visible cost at the moment of choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme—peace as active tending rather than absence of conflict—emerges organically from the contrast between father's "sheathed violence" and Mira's rose cultivation. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates effectively in the ballast sandbag ("engraved quiet") and the roses' "tranquil blaze." However, the penultimate paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("her work mattered in ways her father's never had") where dramatization would be stronger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a distinct lyric texture with controlled diction ("sheathed blade of memory," "thorned blossoms pushed through sand") and a stable third-person limited POV. Psychic distance is consistent and voice-motivated register elevations fit the reflective mode. However, several phrases approach stock literary phrasing ("like water finding its level," "burning against the sand") and the narrative certainty remains high throughout despite operating in retrospective summary, which reduces tension in the focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in descriptive passages. However, the piece exhibits paraphrase loops in the final two paragraphs: "her work mattered" → "weaving continuity through chaos" → "to tend what could be saved" all restate the same thesis with synonym variation. The phrase "engraved quiet where the weight of sand had pressed silence into every fiber" mixes metaphor (engraving requires a tool; pressing creates compression, not engraving). Template cadence appears in "She was...," "She had...," "She simply..." constructions. Figurative density is high but occasionally overwrought ("fever," "thunder that never broke into rain").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The bounty-hunter-father / pacifist-daughter premise is familiar but the glass-dome rose farm offers fresh specificity. The ballast sandbag scrap as inherited object with textural memory is a strong particular. However, the thematic arc—violence versus nurture, choosing growth over destruction—follows a well-worn template without transformation through moral calculus or lived complication. The "tower falls → chaos → sanctuary" frame is common in post-apocalyptic literary fiction. The ending insight feels anticipated rather than surprising in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira's pacifist stance is established early and drives the premise, but her key choice (walking into the dome and closing the door) occurs in backstory summary. The on-page "decision" to give refugees water is minimally dramatized and carries no visible cost or tactical constraint. Present in setup and thematically at closure, but middle development lacks an on-page choice with friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ballast sandbag scrap appears in one sustained beat (paragraph 3) with tactile detail and thematic charge ("engraved quiet"). It is handled on the page ("ran her thumb over the marks") and linked to her father's legacy. However, it does not constrain a choice, reappear with reweighted meaning, or participate in the closure image. Setup is strong; development and payoff are absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Engraved quiet" appears as a phrase describing the sandbag's texture but does not shape stakes or tactics. The concept is invoked once and then abandoned; the story's actual thematic work centers on "peace as tending" rather than "engraved quiet." Ornamental metaphor without causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Senselessly perceptive" is labeled in paragraph 5 and illustrated with examples (light through dome, stem slant, assessing refugees). The trait enables one on-page micro-action (leading refugees to the well) but without visible cost or tactical constraint. The attribute is told and demonstrated but does not drive a beat with pressure. Functional but replaceable with "observant" or "intuitive."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Sheathe" appears in the opening image ("sheathed blade of memory"), recurs in describing the father's ritual ("sheathe his blades"), and returns in thematic contrast ("He had sheathed violence into the world"). The action functions as a lyric motif with purposeful reprise that charges the thematic opposition. However, no character performs the physical action sheathe in a beat that alters options. Strong lyric integration; no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Inculcated them with values" is named in paragraph 4 but the mechanism remains abstract metaphor ("not through words...but through the constancy of her care"). The method does not shape a dramatized attempt or constrain tactics. One mention, no development or closure participation. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The desert rose farm in the glass dome is established early, provides vivid sensory anchors (amber/rust petals, sand, crystalline arches), and frames the central thematic contrast (sanctuary versus chaos). The setting enables the refugee encounter and shapes Mira's daily choices. The enclosure's boundary charges the closure opposition between tending inside and violence outside. Strong setup, middle involvement, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the tower falls" anchors the timeframe early ("three seasons past") and the chaotic aftermath provides context for Mira's sanctuary choice. However, time does not tighten on-page decisions; the entire narrative operates in retrospective summary ("those early months") without a live clock or urgent deadline. Functional context but no tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to weave continuity through chaos" is both demonstrated (tending roses, watering refugees) and explicitly stated in paragraph 6. It drives Mira's past choice to enter the dome and her ongoing work. However, the desire faces no on-page friction or competing want; the piece presents a settled stance rather than a conflicted pursuit. Setup and thematic closure present; middle cost absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is invoked in the phrase "tranquil blaze of color" (paragraph 6) and modulates across the piece: quiet tending charged by surrounding violence. The tone is coherent through the accumulative design and charges the final image of roses as "quiet engraving upon the world." The oxymoron fits the thematic opposition. Strong lyric cohesion, though the tone remains static rather than modulating under present pressure.</comment>
