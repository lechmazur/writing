<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is richly detailed with embodied emotion—black sand pressed to cheek, coin gripped during fires—and the contradiction between inherited restlessness and chosen compassion is clear. However, the arc relies heavily on reflection rather than dramatized choice; the final "understanding" about fire and water arrives as epiphany rather than earned decision that forecloses a path. Therapy-adjacent phrasing appears ("unyielding compassion rising in her like a tide," "scars could sing") that slightly softens the voice under pressure. The piece never shows Mira making a micro-choice in scene that alters present options; all conflict is retrospective.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the second sentence (who, where, turnout coat anchoring the firefighter role). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira's realization that destruction and renewal are one dance, then her return to the village—but the turn is conceptual and told ("she understood finally") rather than dramatized through a decision or renunciation with visible cost. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the layered images (lagoon, sand, coin, clouds) modulate cadence, but the ending softens into summary rather than a charged final image. No single meaningful tightening narrows options on the page; pressure remains static throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and black volcanic sand are vivid and recur with shifting meaning (mirror-still to molten gold), and sand is handled twice (scooped, pressed to cheek, clings to boots at the end). The environment subtly charges the final image—sand as volcanic glass marking passage. Sensory detail is strong and POV-filtered (firefighter noticing heat retention in the sand). The lagoon functions as micro-setting that enables reflection and reweights the protagonist's stance, meeting the 9+ test narrowly, but does not constrain a choice in the moment, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving one can be a source of light rather than destruction—is signaled early and sustained, but no on-page reversal or tightening occurs; all conflict is retrospective (father's fire, her training, prior emergencies). The piece declares she fights fires "with graceful alertness" and names her compassion as "unyielding," yet no scene pressure tests either trait. The ending claims she "chose, every single day," but we see only one contemplative visit to the lagoon with no live decision or cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure does not deepen; the piece circles the same thematic territory without escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—transformation of inherited destruction into healing purpose—emerges from concrete images (black sand, coin, fire/water duality) rather than abstract statement. The final image of sand clinging to boots as "footprints in ash" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the penultimate paragraph overexplains ("she understood finally that her father's flames and her own water were part of the same eternal dance") and the closing sentence spells out the thesis in prompt-like language ("a woman made of loss and fire...who chose...to be a source of light rather than destruction"), triggering the Thematic Echo penalty (−0.6 for final-paragraph articulation). The piece nearly earns its theme through particulars but retreats into summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual filtering (sand "like powdered obsidian," coin "like an ember"). Diction is elevated and lyric, though register occasionally drifts toward abstracting lyricism ("the stubborn grace of someone who chose") that edges past the focalizer's lived idiom. Purposeful compression and poetic cadence are consistent, but the voice flattens slightly in the final paragraph's summary mode. No dialogue is present to judge. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and holds it, so experimental tolerance applies, but the textural signature weakens when thematic summary takes over.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or poetic apposition—without pattern-teaching or a payoff that justifies the sustained elevation. The final paragraph stacks abstract constructions ("unyielding compassion rising," "made of loss and fire and the stubborn grace") and synonym loops ("not unscathed but unbowed, not healed but healing") that dull propulsion at the closure beat. Template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph (three clauses beginning "for the..."). Applying density penalty (−0.5), loop penalty (−0.4), and closure-beat artifact (−0.7 escalation per the pack rules), then capping all categories at 8.8 per the artifact-in-final-third rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—firefighter as arsonist's daughter seeking redemption—is a familiar template; the piece does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or world logic. Specific details (obsidian lagoon, drilled foreign coin, black volcanic sand) are vivid but function as atmospheric motifs rather than driving fresh synthesis. The emotional arc (inherited destruction → chosen healing) could transfer to any redemptive-profession story with minor edits. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the material. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies (−1.0 for template core without transformation).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The character is present and her firefighter role is named early, but no on-page decision or turn hinges on her specific identity as an arsonist's daughter. All conflict is retrospective; she observes and reflects without altering tactics or choices in the present scene. Setup and closure participation are present (she returns toward the village), but middle development is absent—no beat where being a firefighter or an arsonist's daughter constrains or enables an action. Functional but replaceable; swappable with "medic's daughter nurse" without structural change. Cap at 3.4 for missing middle development; lyric reprise (turnout coat at opening, return to village at close) allows modest lift within that ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Black sand is handled in two distinct beats: scooped and sifted through fingers (¶2), then clings to boots at the end (¶6). It carries specific properties (holds heat, volcanic glass) that charge the final image ("mark her passage like footprints in ash"). Setup is early, closure participation clear, but middle development is weak—sand does not constrain a choice or alter tactics in the lagoon scene. All three gates are present, allowing eligibility ≥6.1. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4 = base ~5.8; round to 6.1 for the charged final reprise that reweights passage and transformation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The concept "unyielding compassion" is named explicitly in ¶5 ("her unyielding compassion rising in her like a tide") but functions as theme claim rather than shaping stakes or tactics on the page. No beat shows compassion creating cost or narrowing options; all references are summary ("she fought for the buildings...for the children"). Ornamental use without causal pressure or closure participation beyond echo. Closure participation gate is missing (concept does not shape the final image or action); cap at 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Gracefully alert" is attributed to her by the villagers (¶4: "she fought fires with an almost graceful alertness"), but the trait is told, not shown; no on-page action demonstrates grace under pressure or alertness constraining a choice. The lagoon scene is contemplative, not urgent, so the trait has no visible trade-off. Label-only mention without embodied cost. Setup is present (middle third), but development and closure participation are absent; cap at 3.4 for missing middle development. Subtract label-only penalty −0.3 = 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Graft" appears once in ¶4 as metaphor ("This was her graft, her quiet way of attaching herself to something larger than grief"). The action is not dramatized—no scene shows her grafting or transplanting in literal or tactical terms. The metaphor is coherent with the healing-from-destruction theme, but it does not drive a turn; easily swappable with "anchor" or "bond." Introduced in the second half (setup gate missing), development and closure participation absent. Cap at 4.6 for late introduction; swappability penalty −0.4 = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The foreign coin drilled and strung on red thread is introduced early (¶3), handled on the page (drawn out, held to light, pressed back into pocket), and described with specific mechanics (drilled center, red thread, worn smooth, copper catching sun). It functions as talisman during "long nights when the fires raged," shaping her endurance, and reappears in the closure paragraph implicitly (pressed back into pocket before she rises). Three gates present: setup ¶3, development (gripping during crises mentioned), closure (pocket action before return). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (endurance tool) +0.8, specificity +0.5 = base ~5.8. No stronger closure transformation limits higher score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is named in the opening line, described with specific properties (black water that pulls light, mirror-still, transforms to molten gold), and is the sole location for the entire scene. It enables Mira's reflection and charges the final realization (fire/water duality mirrored in the lagoon's transformation). Setup early, development (she kneels at the edge, observes the water's shift), closure (the lagoon's color change triggers her understanding). All three gates present. Early signal +0.7, one beat (observation) +0.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6 = base ~5.9. The setting does not constrain a choice (pure enabling space), preventing higher bands; round to 6.4 for strong closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Migration of clouds" appears three times (¶1 opening, ¶2 continuation, ¶5 as the water catches light "as the clouds drifted onward") but functions as atmospheric backdrop without tightening decisions or creating a live clock. The timeframe is continuous but untracked—no urgency, no deadline. Clouds mark passage poetically but do not alter tactics. Ornamental use; swappable with any slow natural cycle. Setup present, development and closure participation absent (clouds do not shape the ending action or image beyond mood). Cap at 2.8 for missing closure; ornamental penalty −0.4, swappability −0.3 = 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To prove that scars can sing" is stated explicitly in ¶4 ("proving that scars could sing if you let them") as motivation, but the desire is not dramatized in a conflicted choice. All evidence is retrospective summary ("she fought for the buildings...for the children"). No on-page friction between the want and a cost; the lagoon scene is contemplative, not a test of the motivation. Told-only trends low. Setup ¶4 (mid-story), no middle development beat, closure paragraph echoes it ("a woman made of loss...") but does not dramatize the proof. Missing development gate; cap at 3.4. Closure echo with conceptual link +0.2 = 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Kelp-drift peace" does not appear as a phrase, but the tone throughout is contemplative, elegiac, slow-moving—consistent with a quiet, tidal mood. The tone modulates subtly (sand's coolness, coin's warmth, lagoon's color shift) and charges the final image of sand clinging to boots as she returns to the village. Coherent and purposeful, supporting the Accumulative/Textural lens. Setup early (¶1 establishes the meditative cadence), development (tone sustained through sensory layering), closure (final paragraph's rhythm accelerates slightly but holds the elegiac register). All three gates present; tone integral to the piece's effect. Early signal +0.6, coherence across beats +0.8, closure modulation +0.6 = base ~5.0; round to 5.2 for the tonal deepening that supports the final image.</comment>
