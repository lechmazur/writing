<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is largely observation-driven rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The apprentice's realization moment ("You see the beauty") arrives cleanly but his prior characterization is thin—steady hands and curious eyes don't dramatize internal conflict. The gift of the reed tongue feels motivated by Mira's established pattern of bartered awakenings, but her decision to pass it forward lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives on the page. Embodied emotion is present in gestures and arrangements but remains externalized; we see her smile and arrange leaves without access to competing desires that would charge the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, and when all anchored). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: repeated motifs (glass, plant arrangements, the reed tongue) build density toward the final moment where the apprentice kneels to learn. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the apprentice's new understanding crystallizes options without a decisive physical act, and the cost is conceptual (the passing of the reed tongue reweights Mira's solitary practice into shared language). One meaningful deepening occurs when the apprentice deciphers her plant language and she responds by gifting the reed. However, the conceptual cost at closure is oblique; the final image of the apprentice kneeling "to learn" reconfigures meaning but the felt price—what Mira or the apprentice forfeits—remains implied rather than dramatized in a single legible moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glassblower's courtyard is vividly rendered with selective detail: furnace roaring, discarded glass, the old oak. The pile of imperfect glass pieces constrains Mira's subject matter and the courtyard's spatial layout (easel near the discard pile, apprentice's workbench, her pocket) remains coherent across beats. The broken glass and fallen leaves function as micro-setting that enables her plant-language communication. However, the environment does not pressure a choice at closure—the apprentice kneels beside her arrangement, but the courtyard itself does not alter tactics or charge the final image; it remains backdrop rather than constraint in the ending beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mira's desire to communicate and share her way of seeing—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the apprentice asks "You're speaking to me," which narrows options and she responds by escalating her arrangements and ultimately gifting the reed tongue. The apprentice's agency ("began to learn") provides closure participation, but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral: we see the gift handed over, yet what Mira loses or risks by passing forward her "bartered awakening" is not dramatized with a felt price. The escalation reads as deepening through accumulation of plant-language complexity rather than a causal reversal that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: broken glass, colorblindness as metaphor for alternative perception, plant arrangements as language. The piece resists explicit moralizing until the final paragraph's "teaching anyone who would look closely enough that awakening could be bartered, traded, passed from hand to hand" which borders on thematic summary but remains tied to the image of the reed tongue. The apprentice's realization ("You see the beauty... In the broken things") verges on articulating the thesis but is saved by his embodied wonder and the subsequent gift exchange. The ending offers a resonant image (kneeling beside the arrangement) that reweights prior material without a stated moral, though the phrase "quiet revolution" in the penultimate paragraph leans toward tell. No penalty for the "phoenix" frame, which contextualizes without intruding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable on Mira throughout with no head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during her arranging, wider during the glassblower's observation). Perceptual signature is strong: "constant subtle shift of light and shadow, texture and form" filters her world-view and her colorblindness is shown through how she sees rather than told. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful—the apprentice's lines carry subtext and goal pursuit. One brief filter-verb cluster in the opening ("She had bartered... had given... had deemed") slows momentum slightly but remains voice-motivated and does not obscure immediacy. Diction stays consistent with the contemplative, lyric register; no mid-paragraph register drift. The phrase "innocently cunning smile" is asserted rather than shown in action, a minor tell within otherwise clean focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with purposeful rhythm and varied sentence structures. Information density is high in the opening (phoenix, courtyard, Mira's history, the reed tongue) without feeling rushed. Two minor scaffold moments: "This was her gift and her burden" summarizes rather than trusts the prior image, and "anyone who would look closely enough" in the penultimate paragraph loops the lesson already dramatized. The phrase "bartered awakenings with the old harmonium player... trading three paintings of shadows" introduces a metaphor ("bartered awakenings") that recurs but remains slightly abstract—what "awakening" means as a tradable unit is never concretely anchored, relying on the reader to infer. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting in "smoking phoenix" motif bookending (opening and near-end) without new work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The colorblind painter who sees beauty in imperfection is a familiar archetype, and the "broken things are beautiful" theme is well-trodden territory. The piece transforms this through specificity—plant arrangements as a constructed language, the concertina reed tongue as tangible inheritance—but the apprentice's arc from curious observer to enlightened student follows a predictable trajectory. The "phoenix rising" frame is evocative but remains ornamental; removing it would not alter the core beats. One fresh inflection: the plant-language mechanic is executed with concrete particulars (spiral of ivy, rose petal, dried flowers) that avoid quirk-for-quirk's-sake. However, the emotional arc and resolution feel anticipated from the setup; the apprentice's realization arrives exactly when expected without a surprising turn that grows from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira (colorblind painter) is present throughout and frames the narrative. Her colorblindness shapes her perception ("constant subtle shift of light and shadow") and motivates her focus on broken glass, satisfying setup. In the middle, her choice to escalate plant arrangements in response to the apprentice's attention demonstrates development. At closure, she hands over the reed tongue and begins a new arrangement, participating in the ending. However, her colorblindness itself does not constrain a key choice—she could perform the same actions as a sighted painter. The attribute colors her worldview but does not create a trade-off or visible cost tied specifically to the lack of color perception. Two beats (arranging, gifting) but the causal pressure is general rather than specific to colorblindness.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concertina reed tongue appears in the opening (setup), is carried in Mira's pocket mid-story, and is handed to the apprentice at closure (all three gates). It recurs with reweighted meaning: initially her "most treasured possession" from a bartered exchange, finally a gift that passes awakening forward. However, its specific properties—"worn smooth by generations," "contained the memory of every song"—are poetic assertions never tested on the page. The apprentice receives it "with wonder, not understanding its significance but sensing the weight," which tells us it matters without showing how its unique qualities (as opposed to any symbolic heirloom) constrain or enable. Present across three beats, but the object's irreplaceability is thematic rather than causal. Swapping it for another small heirloom would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Bartered awakenings" is mentioned in the opening ("bartered awakenings with the old harmonium player") and echoed in the final paragraph ("awakening could be bartered, traded, passed from hand to hand"). Setup and closure participation are present, but the concept does not constrain middle choices—Mira's plant arrangements and the apprentice's learning proceed without reference to bartering. The concept functions as thematic frame rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. What "awakening" means as a tradable unit remains abstract; the story never dramatizes an exchange where terms, cost, or refusal are at stake. The harmonium-player backstory is summary-only. The concept is ornamental: removing "bartered" and rewriting as "shared awakenings" would not alter plot structure or closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Innocently cunning" is applied once in the middle beat ("Mira smiled her innocently cunning smile"). The phrase is asserted as a character trait but not demonstrated through action—her arranging of plants to draw the apprentice's attention could equally read as patient, playful, or deliberate without requiring the specific cunning/innocence pairing. The trait does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost; it's a descriptor that colors a single moment without causal work. No setup (not mentioned in the opening), minimal development (one label), no closure participation. The attribute is replaceable; "knowing smile" or "deliberate smile" would function identically. Label-only mention trends low per the rubric.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Awaken" recurs thematically (bartered awakenings, "language of awakening," final paragraph's "awakening could be bartered") but is not a physical action Mira or the apprentice performs on the page. If interpreted as the apprentice's realization ("understanding blooming"), that moment is present at closure and drives his choice to kneel and learn. However, the action is swappable—replacing "awaken" with "understand" or "see differently" would require only synonym edits without structural change. The concept threads through the piece but never takes the form of a decisive action that redefines options; it remains an effect (the apprentice awakens to new perception) rather than a verb with agency. Present in closure, weak causal irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plant arrangements appear in setup ("The plant arrangements began as accidents"), develop through the middle (Mira deliberately arranges leaves, then flowers and petals in complex patterns), and are present at closure ("began a new arrangement"). The method constrains Mira's communication—she cannot speak, so she uses spatial composition—and enables the apprentice's decoding. The mechanics matter: "spiral of ivy," "single perfect rose petal," combining "fallen glass shards and dried plants together." The method drives two beats (the apprentice's question, Mira's escalation and gift) and shapes the final image. However, the cost tied specifically to this method is not legible—why plant language rather than written notes or gestures is never dramatized as a constraint with price. Strong presence across beats, moderate causal pressure, good specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The glassblower's courtyard is established in the opening, provides spatial anchors throughout (easel, furnace, pile of discarded glass, oak tree, workbench), and is referenced at closure ("spread across the courtyard"). The setting supplies resources (broken glass, fallen leaves) that Mira uses for arrangements and painting, satisfying setup and development. At closure, the courtyard is described ("sun rose higher over the courtyard") but does not constrain the final choice—the apprentice kneels beside the arrangement; the location is backdrop rather than pressure. The courtyard enables her practice (discard pile as subject matter) but does not force a trade-off or alter tactics in a key beat. Present across three gates, moderate enabling function, no closure constraint that would make the exact setting indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the phoenix rose" is mentioned in the opening sentence and referenced once near the end ("burning off the last smoke from the phoenix's rising"). The timeframe does not constrain decisions or tactics—no ticking clock, no urgency tied to the phoenix event. The piece's actual duration is indeterminate ("many months" of prior visits, then "one afternoon" for the key exchange). The phoenix frame is ornamental world-building that could be removed without affecting plot structure, character choices, or closure. Present in setup and glanced at in closure, but zero causal work. The timeframe is swappable; setting the story "in spring" or "after the war" would function identically. Mentioned but not used.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to find beauty in imperfection" is stated explicitly in the opening ("her gift and her burden—to find beauty in imperfection") and demonstrated through her choice of subjects (cracked vessels, bled colors). The motivation drives her repeated visits, her plant arrangements, and culminates in the closure gift—she shares her way of seeing with the apprentice. The desire is present across setup, development, and closure. However, the motivation is never conflicted on the page; Mira does not face a moment where finding beauty in imperfection costs her something concrete (status, acceptance, a sale) or where she must choose between this drive and another need. The friction is described ("when the world around her insisted that perfection was the only worthy goal") but not dramatized in an on-page scene where that insistence alters her tactics. Solid presence, limited conflict.</comment>
