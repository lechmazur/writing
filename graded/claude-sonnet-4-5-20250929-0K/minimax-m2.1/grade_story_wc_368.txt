<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Yuen's interiority is established through his dye-master patience and watchful waiting, but the epiphany feels unearned—he arrives at the tea house already primed for the answer, and the butterfly wing delivers it without meaningful internal resistance or contradiction. The donor-heart premise introduces a second character's influence but remains abstract; no embodied struggle between Yuen's forty-year habits and this "new heart" plays out in micro-choices. The final realization ("some people magnetized stories because they had learned to see value in every tale") reads as summary wisdom rather than a dramatized shift that forecloses a prior path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates reflective density around the butterfly wing and the heart transplant, building toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. However, the closure relies on restating the central question ("why some people magnetize stories") and answering it through direct articulation rather than an image or action that reweights prior material with felt cost. The decision to "return to his dye vats changed" is declared but not tested on the page, weakening the RR claim.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house is vivid and specific, with valley mists and mountain winds anchoring the spatial frame. The blue morpho wing functions as micro-setting: Yuen tilts it, watches light shift across it, and the iridescence charges the final image. The tea house itself, however, remains descriptive backdrop—it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. The body (his new heart) is mentioned but never embodied in a way that shapes a decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning why some people magnetize stories—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Yuen's contemplation does not narrow options or face a concrete cost; he arrives, observes the wing, and concludes. No reversal or tightening occurs: the grandmother's example and the donor's legacy are recalled, not tested. The piece claims transformation ("would return changed") without demonstrating a forfeiture or trade-off that makes the before/after legible with on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the butterfly wing's iridescence and the metaphor of receiving/transforming light. The piece avoids overt moralizing until the final paragraph, where "some people magnetized stories because they had learned to see value in every tale" edges into thematic echo. The donor heart and grandmother's legend offer specific anchors, but the ending leans on articulation ("illuminate what lay hidden in plain sight") rather than a resonant, non-literal answer grounded in the final image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature rooted in Yuen's dye-master vocabulary ("colors that revealed themselves only when ready," "iridescent caution"). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, though some phrases ("valley-mist wonder," "living archives of human wonder") tilt toward elevated lyricism that slightly exceeds the focalizer's practical lexicon under peak reflection. No head-hopping; filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. The reflective mode is clean and anchored to the present stimulus (the wing).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is generally high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The people who magnetized stories were not special by birth but by accumulation" closely restates the final-paragraph insight. Template cadence emerges in the fourth paragraph ("She had absorbed… She had woven… until her very presence drew"). The closure paragraph stacks multiple declarative wisdom-statements that dilute propulsion. No major grammar or logic errors, but figurative density in reflective beats occasionally slows momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The heart-transplant frame offers a fresh angle on the "why some people attract stories" question, and the blue morpho wing as teaching object is specific. Yet the core insight—receptivity and accumulation create narrative magnetism—arrives without resistance or a non-obvious complication. The transformation from dye master to story-vessel feels thematically neat rather than earned through risk. The floating tea house and valley mists are evocative but not structurally daring. Within-band: no major template echoes, but the resolution trends toward the median "learning through contemplation" arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Yuen is present throughout and his dye-master patience frames his observation. However, his watchfulness does not create a key turn; he arrives contemplative and concludes contemplative. His decision to "return changed" and "teach his apprentices" is declared in the final paragraph but not dramatized. Setup present, closure participation weak (action is future-tense), no middle choice that alters tactics. Functional but replaceable with another reflective observer.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The blue morpho wing appears in beats two, three, four, and six. Yuen purchases it, tilts it to catch light, watches colors shift, and lifts it in the final paragraph. The wing's iridescence teaches the lesson of transformation and charges the ending image. Setup early, development through repeated handling, closure participation clear. However, the wing does not constrain a choice or impose a cost—it is observed and interpreted rather than used in a way that alters options. Strong lyric reprise with reweighted meaning, but causal pressure is light.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Iridescent caution" appears as description of the wing's colors ("caution written in every shifting hue"). The concept echoes thematically but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. Yuen's contemplation is not cautious; he proceeds smoothly to understanding. The trait is ornamental, used to enrich description rather than to constrain or enable action. Present but swappable with "iridescent beauty" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" is attributed to the wing's "quiet explosiveness hidden within delicate architecture." The phrase describes the butterfly's visual impact but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. Yuen does not wrestle with explosive insight or suffer a quiet rupture; the understanding arrives gently. Label-only mention; no visible trade-off or tactical shift tied to the attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Illuminate" recurs across the piece: "illumination happened not through force but through quiet attention," "let it illuminate what lay hidden," and the final image where colors "cascade" across Yuen's hands. The action frames the thematic lesson and appears in the closure paragraph. However, it does not create a major turn—Yuen's realization is continuous rather than reversed. Setup present, middle articulation, closure participation via metaphor. Functional but the insight could be reached through "reveal" or "clarify" with minor edits. One key turn (the donor-heart realization), but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Sun trails are signaled early ("catching a sun trail that slanted through the paper screens") and return in the closure paragraph ("sun trails shifted"). Yuen uses them as the means to observe the wing's iridescence, which delivers the lesson. The method is present across beats and shapes his attention, but the mechanics do not alter tactics or impose a cost—he could have used any light source. Setup clear, middle use functional, closure reprise present. Swappable with "catching the light" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house is established in the opening line and returns in the fourth and sixth paragraphs ("The floating tea house seemed to nod in approval," "held him in its embrace"). It provides atmospheric anchor and spatial stability. However, it does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome—Yuen's contemplation could occur in any quiet setting. Setup strong, closure reprise present, but the setting remains postcard description rather than a constraint that alters tactics. Lyric resonance without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The heart transplant is signaled early ("Three months after the transplant") and returns in the fourth paragraph when Yuen realizes the donor was "a young teacher whose students still wrote letters." The timeframe establishes Yuen's recovery period and primes the receptivity theme. However, it does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page—the three-month mark is context, not a live clock that alters moves. Setup clear, thematic linkage present, but no escalation tied to time pressure. Functional backstory anchor, not a causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation is dramatized through Yuen's reflective search and the question "consumed him." It drives his visit to the tea house and frames the butterfly-wing observation. The desire is tested against the examples of his grandmother and the donor, and the final realization answers the question. Setup early, middle development through reflection, closure participation clear. However, no friction between wants and costs appears—Yuen does not sacrifice or forfeit to gain the insight. One dominant stake with clean resolution, but cost is abstract (future teaching promise) rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Valley-mist wonder is established in the opening ("where the valley mists met stone and sky") and sustained through imagery of "mountain winds," "ancient mountains," and "mist parted below." Tone modulates gently with Yuen's expanding understanding and charges the final image ("valley mist gathered again below"). Coherent across beats, purposeful atmospheric layering, and the tone supports the Accumulative/Textural lens. No tonal rupture or forced register shift. The tone could intensify further under pressure, but at this length the steady wonder reads as intentional and serves closure.</comment>
