<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority shows some concrete embodiment ("breathed deeply, letting her senses expand outward") and her professional skill is established early. However, the fisher's emotional state relies on stock phrasing ("eyes carried the particular emptiness") and his transformation at the end—tears falling freely—lacks the contradictory impulses that would earn higher scores. The decision to offer consolation rather than certainty feels gesture-appropriate but not deeply conflicted; no visible cost constrains her professional choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored quickly (geode, recollectionist practice, dusk arrival). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Maren traces emotional residue through conjecture, building density until the final reweighting ("Some paths don't disappear...They just lead somewhere unexpected"). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the fisher's grief shifts from loss to continuation—with felt cost (he weeps, but gains "another form of peace"). One meaningful deepening occurs when Maren finds the gaps and pushes past them to deliver her interpretation, altering the fisher's emotional stance on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The geode's iridescent walls and crater glass pedestal anchor the single scene effectively and are integrated into the recollectionist's method ("amplified her perception, refracting her awareness"). The seeds arranged in spirals and the glass humming under effort provide tactile, specific detail that supports Maren's work. The micro-setting (glass surface, translucent walls) constrains her process and charges the final image ("iridescent walls held their light steady, patient witnesses"), meeting the 9+ gate test for setting participation in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the son's fate—is signaled early and drives Maren's effort. One meaningful tightening occurs when she encounters the gaps ("places where the thread simply stopped") and must push deeper, narrowing her interpretive options. The resolution depends on Maren's professional agency (choosing to follow emotional trails rather than physical ones), and the cost is visible: she delivers an answer that brings "not closure but continuation," a trade-off the fisher accepts through tears. Under the accumulative lens, the pressure coheres and the final image reweights the father's grief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the crater glass, seeds, and the geode's patient light rather than direct statement. The final image—"Some paths don't disappear...They just lead somewhere unexpected"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The phrase "cheerful gloom" in the penultimate paragraph borders on thematic echo but is framed as a professional stance rather than a thesis statement, and the particulars (tears, light, fragments) ground the emotional truth. The ending reweights the father's sorrow into a form of peace, embodying the theme through scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Maren's professional perception ("her gift and her burden," "she had learned to love the space between knowing and imagining"). Diction is controlled and purposeful, with some elevated register ("transliterate emotions," "botanical breadcrumbs") that fits a specialist's internal lexicon. The dialogue is minimal but purposeful: the fisher's "My son" and Maren's closing line advance the emotional arc. Under peak stress, Maren's perceptual texture stays consistent (tracing images, pushing deeper), though the phrase "certain souls are drawn toward distances others cannot perceive" tilts toward abstraction without grounding in her immediate sensory experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences layer setting, action, and interiority effectively ("She worked by conjecture, piecing together fragments the way a sailor reads scattered clouds"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "every surface seemed to hum with the residue of things not yet forgotten" is restated conceptually in "reading the residue that living beings left behind." The phrase "some paths didn't fade gradually. Some disappeared all at once" uses template cadence without new pressure. The final paragraph contains minor overwriting ("iridescent walls held their light steady, patient witnesses") that borders on symbolic convenience. No loops touch the closure beat directly, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.8 for distinct paraphrase and template issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of recollectionist profession, crater glass, and emotional residue on migrating-bird seeds offers a specific synthesis. The piece transforms a missing-person template through the lens of memory work and conjecture rather than forensic certainty. However, the core emotional arc—parent seeking lost child, finding bittersweet peace—remains familiar, and the transformation relies primarily on the fantastical method rather than a non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail that would distinguish it further. The "cheerful gloom" tone and geode setting provide texture but do not fundamentally alter the template's emotional algebra.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maren (sea-foam recollectionist) is present throughout, guiding the fisher and performing the transliteration. Her choices shape two key beats: arranging the seeds and initiating the reading, then deciding to push past the gaps to find emotional rather than physical trails. The final consolation ("Some paths don't disappear...") alters the fisher's stance on the page. Early signal present; two beats involved; closure linkage clear. However, the decision to offer comfort rather than certainty lacks visible cost or tradeoff—no professional risk or personal sacrifice is dramatized—capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crater glass is introduced early ("ancient pedestal") and used in two distinct beats: initial setup and the active transliteration where it "hummed with effort, its surface rippling." It constrains Maren's method (she must place palms flat, let senses expand) and returns in the closure paragraph as the geode's light "seemed gentler now," reweighting the atmosphere. Specificity is high (carved from impactite, transliterates emotions). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, though the cost is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Missing pieces" (core concept) shapes the dominant stake: discovering why the son's path disappeared. It drives Maren's middle choice to push deeper when she finds gaps, and the closure reframes the concept—paths don't vanish, they transform. Early signal is present ("paths they had walked"), development occurs when she encounters "the places where the thread simply stopped," and payoff lands in the final reweighting. The concept alters Maren's interpretive tactics and the fisher's emotional resolution, demonstrating causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The attribute "transliterates emotions" (via crater glass) is signaled early and enables Maren's work across multiple beats: she reads residue, watches images flood through, traces the son's journey. It constrains her method (requires the glass, physical contact, focused breathing) and is essential to the middle discovery and final interpretation. However, no visible tradeoff or cost is tied specifically to the transliteration ability—no risk of misreading, no personal toll dramatized—limiting the score to mid-band despite strong setup and beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conjecture (action) is named early as Maren's method ("She worked by conjecture, piecing together fragments") and drives her middle choice to interpret gaps via "emotional trails rather than physical ones." The final consolation is an act of conjecture—offering the fisher a plausible, hopeful narrative rather than certainty. Early signal, development in the gap-encounter beat, and closure linkage are present. However, the action is somewhat swappable with "interpretation" or "divination" without structural loss, and no specific cost of guessing wrong is dramatized, capping the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method "via the scattered seeds dropped by a migrating bird" is introduced in the fisher's arrival beat (small leather pouch, seeds inside) and directly enables Maren's work: she arranges them in spirals around the glass, and they carry the son's emotional residue. The mechanics matter—seeds collect residue from every touch before the bird picks them up again—and this shapes Maren's ability to trace the journey. Early signal, clear development (arrangement and reading), and the method is indispensable to the transliteration process. However, the seeds do not return or shift meaning in the closure image, slightly limiting upper-band reach.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The iridescent cave inside a crystal geode is introduced in the opening line and frames the entire scene. The setting constrains Maren's practice (she built it there; the walls "amplified her perception, refracting her awareness"), shapes the transliteration beats (crater glass on pedestal, spirals of seeds), and charges the closure image ("iridescent walls held their light steady, patient witnesses"). Early signal, two+ beats, closure linkage, and the geode's refractive properties are irreplaceable—Maren's method depends on this specific environment. Strong causal pressure and specificity earn high integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "before memory fades" is mentioned once early ("the urgency of her work—always before memory fades") but does not tighten Maren's on-page decisions or alter her tactics. No live clock is dramatized; the fisher arrives "at dusk" but no subsequent time pressure shapes the transliteration. The phrase primes thematic resonance but does not constrain action or accelerate choices, limiting the score to functional presence without causal integration. Missing middle development and closure participation; setup gate only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover why some paths disappear" drives the fisher's arrival (seeking his son's fate) and Maren's middle choice to push past the gaps. It is dramatized through the fisher's emptiness and Maren's professional obligation, shaping two beats. The closure reframes the motivation—paths transform rather than vanish—with felt cost (the fisher's tears, the shift from grief to continuation). Early signal, development, and payoff are present. However, friction between the fisher's want and Maren's professional limits is understated; no moment where she must choose between certainty and compassion is dramatized, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The tone "cheerful gloom" is named late ("her voice carrying the cheerful gloom that her profession required") but is embodied earlier in phrases like "fractured light," "residue of things not yet forgotten," and "another form of peace." The tone modulates appropriately—lighter at the opening, heavier during the gap encounter, settling into bittersweet consolation at the end. It charges the final image by framing the fisher's tears as both sorrow and relief. However, the explicit naming in the penultimate paragraph feels like a thematic echo rather than organic tonal control, and the late signal limits upper-band reach despite purposeful execution.</comment>
