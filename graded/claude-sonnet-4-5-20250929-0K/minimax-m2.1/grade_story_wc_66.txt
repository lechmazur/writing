<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivations are clear and rooted in a consistent set of values (preservation, resistance), but her interior life leans heavily on abstraction and label-speak ("thistled calm," "diligent," "scientific mind") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The piece never tests her commitment with a meaningful on-page choice that forces trade-offs; she continues her work without dramatized conflict or cost that forecloses a path. The single-POV interiority is specific in texture but lacks the micro-choices and contradictory impulses that would elevate characterization into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece opens with orientation anchors (who, where, when) and establishes a coherent setting and backstory frame. However, there is no on-page closure event: Mira begins her broadcast as she has done before, with no decisive change, renunciation, or visible cost that reweights prior material. The ending ("continued her quiet revolution") summarizes ongoing action rather than crystallizing a before/after shift. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (building atmosphere and detail), but without a turn, deepening, or charged final image that reconfigures the dominant stake, closure does not land on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful: the ember alcove, mist, shortwave radio glow, and dust all contribute atmosphere and texture. The radio's "secretly luminous" glow and the dust's memory properties are distinctive and integrated into Mira's work. However, none of these elements constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that alters tactics or outcome; they remain evocative but not causal. Strong for atmosphere, but just short of the 9+ gate because the setting does not force a decision at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving stories through pirate broadcasts—is signaled early, but pressure remains static throughout. Mira prepares her broadcast "with particular care" tonight, yet no on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; she simply begins to sing as she has done before. There is no external opposition, internal conflict, or cost that narrows options or changes knowledge. The story reads as a portrait of ongoing work rather than a conflict with escalation and resolution scaled to this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—stories as resistance, memory embedded in the physical world, preservation through unconventional means—emerges organically from image and action rather than statement. The dust-as-memory conceit is specific and textured, and the "teaching dust to speak" metaphor resonates without becoming heavy-handed. However, the ending does not offer a non-literal answer or reweight prior material; it restates the premise ("continued her quiet revolution") without tension or cost. Theme is present and coherent but does not achieve the charged final image or earned insight that would elevate it into the high band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinctive perceptual signature: Mira's attention to texture, sound, and the interplay of light and shadow feels consistent and character-specific. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with phrases like "thistled calm" and "secretly luminous" anchoring voice. No dialogue is present. However, some interiority leans on label-speak ("meticulous, scientific mind," "thistled calm") rather than embodied perception, and the prose occasionally drifts into expository summary ("She was a pirate broadcaster...") that flattens immediacy. Strong voice control overall, with minor slips in filter density and summary mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically controlled, with vivid sensory detail and varied sentence structure. Information density is good; most lines advance atmosphere or character. However, several passages loop or paraphrase without adding pressure: "She was a pirate broadcaster, though not of the old-fashioned sort..." restates what follows, and the final paragraph ("In the ruined city, in the years after the story famine...") recaps rather than propels. Minor scaffold and summary mode in expository passages lower momentum. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, but pervasive minor issues prevent entry into the high band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—pirate broadcaster who teaches dust to tell stories in a post-famine world—is imaginative and specific. The dust-as-memory conceit and the method of cloaking stories in song lyrics offer fresh angles. However, the execution does not fully transform these elements into earned turns or stakes; the broadcast itself is summarized rather than dramatized, and the dust's agency remains abstract. The piece reads as a well-crafted portrait rather than a narrative with a non-obvious synthesis or risk-taking that heightens closure. Mid-band originality: specific and committed, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira's role as copyist is mentioned early and frames her legitimacy, allowing her pirate work to remain secret. However, the copyist role does not constrain or enable an on-page choice; her broadcast work could proceed without it. Present and logically consistent, but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The radio dial glow is seeded early ("faint amber glow"), described as "secretly luminous" (wrapped in cloth to avoid patrols), and returns when Mira adjusts the dial before singing. It appears in three beats and the secrecy detail constrains her behavior. However, it does not shape the ending or alter tactics in a way that makes it indispensable; the broadcast proceeds as planned. Strong integration across beats, but not irreplaceable at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pirate broadcasting is the story's central activity, shaping Mira's motivation, risk (patrols), and method. It drives the dominant stake (preservation and resistance) and is present at closure when she begins to sing. The concept is essential to plot logic and the ending image. Removing it would break the narrative arc.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Secretly luminous" is applied to the radio glow and motivates Mira's precaution (wrapping the casing to hide light from patrols). It enables her work by reducing detection risk. However, the attribute does not constrain a specific on-page choice or create visible cost; the patrols never appear, and the precaution is backstory. Functional but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Cloak" appears in the method of cloaking stories within song lyrics, making them "slippery and elusive" to casual listeners. This shapes the broadcast's design but is explained rather than dramatized; we do not see Mira weave a narrative into melody on the page. Present and logically relevant, but the action is summarized rather than shown, limiting its causal force.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The method—song lyrics that carry hidden narrative—is described at length and is central to Mira's broadcast technique. It shapes her preparation and the story's conceptual premise. However, we do not see the method in action; the lyrics are not quoted or their structure demonstrated. The mechanics are told rather than shown, and the broadcast is summarized ("began to sing") without on-page payoff. Functional setup, but no closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ember alcove is introduced early, evoked throughout (candlelight, coal brazier, dust in corners, cracked windows), and provides the physical space for Mira's work. Mist pressing closer at the end adds atmospheric charge. The setting is vivid and recurring, but it does not constrain a choice or alter the outcome; the broadcast could occur in any hidden room. Strong texture, but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"After the story famine" is established early and provides context for Mira's mission (stories have become scarce and precious). The timeframe motivates her work and the presence of patrols. However, it does not create on-page urgency or tighten decisions; no deadline or evolving condition pressures her tonight. Present and thematically relevant, but not active in escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation—to teach dust to tell stories—is introduced mid-story, explained in detail, and tied to Mira's discovery and method. It shapes her nightly routine and her sense of purpose ("knowing that she was not merely telling stories"). However, the motivation is not tested or conflicted on the page; she continues her work without friction or cost. Clear and specific, but not dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Thistled calm" is introduced as Mira's characteristic mode—"gentle determination, peaceful resolve"—and the prose maintains a measured, reflective tone throughout. The tone is coherent and consistent, supporting the portrayal of Mira's quiet resistance. However, it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image; the story ends in the same register it began. Static mood, mid-band fit.</comment>
