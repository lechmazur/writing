<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to document and preserve the submerged town's memory is clearly established, but her interior life remains largely observational rather than contradictory. The piece tells us she "understood her role now with crystalline clarity" rather than dramatizing the realization through conflicting impulses. Embodied emotion is minimal—most feeling is filtered through metaphor ("stories would remain above the surface") rather than physical sensation. The final choice to arrange photographs feels more like execution of a pre-formed plan than a decision forged under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara's systematic trail-laying and discovery accumulate density that reweights the stakes by dawn. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes her mission with the sapphire label as proof that "some truths would not stay submerged," and the cost is conceptual (the town will be flooded again, but memory persists). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. One minor causality slip: the cache of intact bottles "as if waiting for a toast that had been interrupted" stretches credibility for fifty years underwater, but does not break the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ridgeway, exposed foundations, and emerging street signs create a coherent spatial stage. The sapphire label functions as micro-setting—its vivid blue "refusing to be washed clean" charges the final image and constrains Elara's interpretive choice (evidence that memory endures). Sensory detail is selective: "cracked spine of asphalt visible beneath dwindling shallows," "whitewashed and painted in colors she had forgotten." The wind chime falling silent provides a concrete time marker. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout theночь traverse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the drowned town's memory against bureaucratic erasure—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara discovers intact bottles and her childhood home's walls, intensifying the urgency before other wardens arrive to "calculate what could be salvaged and what should be buried again." However, escalation is more textural accumulation than narrowing pressure: Elara faces no live obstacle or trade-off, and her systematic trail-laying proceeds without friction. The ending reconfigures understanding but does not foreclose a path with visible cost on the page—she prepares to present evidence, but we do not see resistance or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as violence, institutional erasure versus personal memory, the reservoir's failure to expunge human story. The sapphire label serves as a resonant particular—its refusal to drown anchors the abstract question without stating a moral. The final image offers a non-literal answer: "some truths would not stay submerged no matter how long the water tried to hold them." One slip: "she spin stories into shared meaning because silence was a kind of violence" borders on thematic echo, articulating the thesis rather than letting the trail of photographs and discoveries embody it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through Elara's professional lens: "trained to read water's intentions the way others read faces." Diction is controlled and elevated—"the great expunge of names and histories," "mirrored hush," "crystalline clarity"—fitting a literary register. Two slips harm the score: "precisely humane details" is awkwardly abstract, and the phrase "the reservoir spoke in a language she had not heard since childhood" is somewhat generic. The final paragraph's "when the waters rose again—and they always rose again—the stories would remain above the surface" feels like helpful narrator rather than Elara's embodied perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm is varied and sentences generally advance, but several artifacts cluster in peak beats. "快照" (Chinese for snapshot) appears mid-sentence—likely a generation artifact that breaks immersion. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "She understood… to ensure… to replace… She understood…" recycles stems. The phrase "she spin stories into shared meaning" contains a verb-tense error ("spin" for "spun"). Mixed metaphor: the reservoir "held its breath" but also "spoke in a language"—breath-holding precludes speaking. These line-level issues dull clarity in high-pressure moments and disqualify 9+ globally per the filter-verb/template-cadence rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The drowned-town premise is familiar (cf. "The Drowned Giant," reservoir fiction tropes), but the piece personalizes it through Elara's warden role and the systematic photograph trail. The sapphire label as concrete synecdoche for memory's resilience offers a specific inflection. However, the arc follows a template: lone protagonist discovers submerged past, arranges evidence, prepares to confront institutional forgetting—no major surprise or moral complexity. The ending's declaration "some truths would not stay submerged" is earnest but predictable. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −0.6 for close match to writing-prompt templates without transformative lived detail or non-obvious calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara volunteers for the inspection (setup), systematically leaves photographs along the ridgeway (development), and arranges them in chronological order at dawn to present "not just evidence but meaning" (closure participation). Her choices create the photograph trail that structures the piece. However, her decisions feel pre-formed rather than forged under pressure—she executes a plan without visible friction or trade-off. The warden role enables observation but does not constrain a key turn. Two gates present, causal pressure moderate, closure linkage clear but passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The label is discovered in paragraph two, described vividly ("sapphire-hued… its glass still intact despite fifty years beneath ten meters of water"), reappears when Elara finds the cache of bottles in paragraph four, and returns charged in the final line: "The sapphire label gleamed in her pocket, a small blue heart that had refused to drown." Three beats, early setup, closure linkage strong. Its color and intact state embody the theme that memory endures. Deduct −0.3 for ornamental description in the middle beat (bottles "as if waiting for a toast") without immediate pressure, but the reprise reweights prior material with cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The resurfacing town shapes every beat: it draws Elara to the ridgeway, supplies the exposed foundations and street signs she navigates, creates the urgency (other wardens will arrive by dawn to decide what to re-bury), and anchors the closure image (stories remain above surface even when waters rise again). The concept is not merely thematic—it alters Elara's tactics (systematic documentation before re-flooding) and forecloses the option of passive silence. Setup immediate, development pervasive, payoff integral. High irreplaceability and causal pressure across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Precisely humane details" appears once in paragraph four describing her childhood home's walls, labeled but not dramatized. The phrase is abstract—"humane" typically applies to treatment of beings, not architectural detail—and does not constrain or enable an on-page action. No setup, no middle development, mentioned only in passing. Ornamental use without causal work; swappable with "intimate" or "tender" details. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup and middle development; score 4.2 for label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Expunge" is used twice: paragraph one describes "the great expunge of names and histories" following the reservoir's creation, and the final paragraph states "The reservoir had hoped to expunge this town from human memory." The action defines the antagonist (institutional erasure) and the stakes (Elara's counter-mission). It does not drive a specific turn—Elara's photograph trail is a response, not a reversal—but it shapes her motivation and the closure image (stories will not be expunged). Setup clear, thematic development strong, closure linkage present. Deduct −0.4 for swappability ("erase" would work with minor edits) and for being told rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Photographs are introduced in paragraph two (Elara pulls "the first photograph from her coat"), she "moved systematically along the ridgeway, leaving a trail of photographs at intervals like breadcrumbs," and by dawn she arranges them "in chronological order, preparing to present not just evidence but meaning." The method is signaled, executed, and shapes the closure. However, the mechanics remain vague—we do not see her choose which images to place where, or how the trail will guide others. Two gates solid, one beat of use, closure participation clear but summarized rather than dramatized. Deduct −0.5 for summary-only execution in the critical middle beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The ridgeway at twilight is named in the opening line and functions as Elara's vantage point. It does not constrain a choice or supply a resource—Elara could conduct her trail-laying from any elevated position. The "midnight ridgeway at twilight" phrasing is temporally confusing (midnight or twilight?). Spatial anchoring is clean, but the setting remains a postcard backdrop rather than an active pressure. Setup present, no middle development, minimal closure charge. Lyric reprise absent. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; score 5.9 for clean spatial grounding and setup signal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The wind chime falls silent "an hour ago" in paragraph one, marking a temporal boundary but not creating pressure. Time advances passively: "through the night," "by the hour when stars should have emerged," "by dawn." No live clock tightens Elara's decisions—she works methodically without urgency until other wardens arrive, an event mentioned but not dramatized. The timeframe is tracked but does not alter tactics. Setup present, no development, no payoff. Swappable with any nighttime window. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle and closure; score 3.8 for vague pressure and passive time tracking.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to spin stories into shared meaning because silence was a kind of violence" is stated explicitly in paragraph three and restated in the final paragraph. The motivation frames her photograph trail, but it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. We do not see friction between this want and a competing cost (e.g., personal grief versus public duty). Setup clear, development label-only, closure participation thematic rather than enacted. Deduct −0.5 for told-only motivation and −0.3 for lack of visible trade-off. Score 5.4 for coherent framing without embodied conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" appears in the final paragraph ("the mirrored hush of early morning"), echoing the "peculiar stillness" of paragraph one. The tone is quiet and elegiac throughout, modulating from initial breath-holding suspense to the accumulative reverence of discovery. It coheres across turns and charges the final image—the hush mirrors Elara's resolve and the reservoir's temporary retreat. One purposeful early-to-final reprise that reweights the stake. Deduct −0.2 for static mood in the middle section (no tonal shift during peak discovery). Score 6.3 for lyric coherence and charged ending under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
