<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivations are clear—she seeks lost conversations and her師傅's truth—and her choices (following the map, entering the room, beginning to write) are legible. However, her interior life remains somewhat thin; we get competent description of her profession and her師傅's decline, but little contradictory impulse or embodied emotion under pressure. The final choice to write feels thematically appropriate but lacks the visceral cost or internal conflict that would elevate it into high bands. The師傅 functions more as backstory catalyst than on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: fragments assemble (plate, map, letters) toward a charged final image where Mira begins to write, reweighting the premise of silence and lost speech. Orientation anchors (Mira, greenhouse city, post-oasis drought) land early enough. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise—where she accepts her師傅's silence by continuing his work, foreclosing the path of retrieval with the felt cost of inheritance. One persistent weakness: the map's treasure-hunt mechanics feel convenient rather than causally earned, and the room's discovery lands without sufficient resistance or complication to charge the escalation fully.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under toxic sky is vivid and purposeful: "growing upward, growing inward," succulents that "learned to survive on memory of water," gold leaf catching light "like small suns." Micro-setting details (zinc plate, oilskin, warped timber, candlelight in tunnels) are filtered through Mira's calligrapher's attention and constrain her journey. The final image—"the room became a garden again"—charges the closure by transforming the setting's barrenness into a space of renewed growth. Spatial choreography (workbench, lower levels, tunnels, hidden room) tracks clearly across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where lost conversations go—is signaled early and tightens through the map's revelation of coordinates and the phrase itself. The escalation reads as accumulative deepening: fragments → map → room → thousands of letters → her師傅's pages. However, the journey lacks sufficient resistance; Mira encounters no meaningful obstacle between deciding to follow the map and discovering the room. The final act of writing offers agency with felt cost (she accepts the burden of continuing silenced speech), but the path there is too smooth to enter high bands for pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: candor as survival ("truthtelling in the curve of a letter"), the cost of honesty in a world requiring "rationing lies," and the room as repository of unspoken truths. The final image—gold leaf catching candlelight, "the room became a garden again"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. The師傅's decline functions as embodied theme (he "wilted near dishonesty"), and Mira's choice to write "the words her師傅 could not speak" reweights silence as inheritance rather than failure. Minor slip: "something new was beginning to grow" edges toward overt thematic declaration in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Mira's calligrapher's perception ("gossamer sheets her canvas," "gold her commitment to permanence"). Diction is mostly controlled, though occasional elevated register ("candor lived in small moments," "pilgrimage to honesty") reads slightly above her embodied voice under pressure. The師傅 reference uses Chinese characters (師傅) without translation, which is purposeful but creates momentary opacity for some readers. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during the plate examination, pulling back for the journey), and no head-hopping occurs. The perceptual signature—attention to texture, gold, and inscription—remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high ("After the oasis dried, the city had learned to live differently—growing upward, growing inward, growing truthful"). However, several artifactual patterns emerge: "She spread...She held...She followed...She found...She sat...She took...She wrote" creates template cadence in the second half. Minor paraphrase loop: "coordinates, and below them, the phrase" is immediately echoed by "the phrase 'where lost conversations go.'" Figurative language is occasionally strained ("dust that had forgotten how to be soil," "walls that no longer bloomed"). The closure image is clean, but accumulated line-level patterns across non-closure beats prevent entry to 7.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of calligraphy, environmental collapse, and epistolary silence offers a fresh angle, and the room of lost letters is a vivid, non-obvious destination. However, the treasure-map structure follows a familiar template (hidden artifact → journey → revelation), and the resolution—protagonist discovers secret repository and decides to contribute—echoes established patterns in speculative fiction about preserving lost knowledge. The師傅's physical decline as metaphor for moral sensitivity is striking but not fully transformed beyond its premise. Transformation test: the emotional arc (discovering a mentor's hidden truth and choosing to honor it) could migrate to other settings with moderate adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and makes key choices: examining the plate, following the map, entering the room, beginning to write. Her profession shapes her attention (gold leaf, letterforms, texture) and the final act of writing is causally linked to her identity as calligrapher. However, her choices face minimal resistance and her interior contradictions are thin, limiting causal pressure. She appears in setup, middle journey, and closure, satisfying all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The zinc postal plate is introduced early, handled in two distinct beats (initial examination and tilting to flame to reveal hidden coordinates), and its revelation drives the map's legibility. However, after revealing the coordinates, it disappears from the narrative; it does not return in the closure or reweight meaning. It enables the journey but is not indispensable—any inscribed object could serve similar function with minor edits. Setup and development gates are met; payoff gate is absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Candor shapes the premise (師傅's decline from intolerance of "small deceptions," the city's "survival untruths") and charges the thematic stakes. The room of unsent letters dramatizes candor's absence, and Mira's final choice to write "the small truths that survived only when someone chose to say them" ties agency to the concept. However, candor does not constrain her tactics during the journey—she faces no on-page choice between honesty and expedience. The concept is present in setup, thematically developed, and articulated at closure, but tactical pressure is limited.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The attribute is ascribed to the師傅 ("wilted near dishonesty like a flower denied sunlight") and motivates his backstory decline and silence. It pressures Mira thematically—she inherits his commitment to truth—but does not constrain her own on-page choices with visible tradeoff. The physicians' misdiagnosis versus Mira's understanding creates a knowledge gap, but this is expository rather than decision-shaping. Setup and thematic development are present; on-page cost tied to Mira's agency is weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rereading occurs in a pivotal beat: "she reread the map fragments for the fourth time that evening" immediately precedes her discovery of the secondary impression and coordinates. This specific repetition under lamplight enables the story's central turn (finding the hidden phrase). However, the action itself is not irreplaceable—any close examination could reveal the same information. It drives one major beat and primes the journey to closure; present in setup (as ongoing study) and development, with indirect closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The shredded treasure map is found under floorboards (setup), its fragments are spread and studied (development: "each piece a small confession"), and following its trail leads Mira to the room (payoff). The map's fragmented state mirrors the theme of lost and incomplete communication. However, the method faces no real friction—the map is legible enough to follow without significant reconstruction challenge—and any hidden directions could serve a similar function. All three gates are met with modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under toxic sky frames every choice: the domes, collapsed growing halls, abandoned greenhouses with tunnels, succulents surviving on "memory of water." The setting supplies the map's origin (old quarter postal insignia), the journey's path (lower growing levels), and the room's concealment (behind succulents). The toxic sky recurs as environmental pressure ("Outside, the toxic sky churned on") and the final image transforms the setting into metaphorical garden. Setup, development, and closure participation are all strong; the setting constrains access and charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The post-oasis timeframe establishes the world's scarcity ("rationing lies, survival untruths, the pretending that tomorrow would bring rain") and motivates the師傅's earlier decline. However, it functions as static backstory rather than live pressure. No clock tightens Mira's present choices; her evening of study and nighttime journey face no temporal constraint. Setup is present (the dried oasis is mentioned early), but development and payoff are weak—time does not alter her tactics or charge the closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation is seeded when Mira discovers the hidden phrase "where lost conversations go," explicitly pursued through the map journey, and fulfilled when she finds the room and understands "what the treasure map truly was—not a path to wealth, but a pilgrimage to honesty." Her final act of writing continues lost conversations, directly serving this desire. The motivation is dramatized across all three beats (discovery, journey, writing) and carries felt cost (accepting inheritance of her師傅's unspoken burden). Minor weakness: the journey itself lacks significant friction between desire and obstacle.</comment>
