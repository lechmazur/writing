<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is richly textured through her sustained fascination with night-blooming flowers, and her discovery moment at the cathedral window feels earned by months of contemplation. However, the piece leans heavily on reflective summary rather than micro-choices under pressure—we're told she "worked with a persistence" and "spent months trying to understand" without witnessing concrete decisions that test her commitment or reveal contradictory impulses. The final epiphany ("not merely about flowers opening in darkness but about...profound patience") edges toward therapy-speak articulation that a character mid-crisis would not summon so tidily. The renunciation or cost remains implied rather than dramatized with a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Mira, pavilion, autumn, then winter transition), and the piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens through its layered imagery and seasonal progression. The closure—Mira's realization and shift from "decorative commission into something true and essential"—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing), reweighting her artistic purpose. However, the cost remains largely asserted ("quiet courage of blooming unseen") rather than shown through a specific forfeiture on the page; we don't see what she gives up or what constraint now binds her new work. The discovery of the cathedral window's hidden layers provides the turn, but the mechanics of *how* she overlooked it for months and *why* this particular morning reveals it feel convenient rather than causally inevitable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amber pavilion is vividly realized—etched glass panels scattering October light, frost tracings over floral motifs, the salvaged cathedral window—and these details constrain Mira's discovery (the "certain angles of light" that reveal hidden layers). Sensory hierarchy is strong: the "soft, umbral tenderness" of early morning and the ice crystals glowing "like scattered diamonds" filter through Mira's artist's eye. The postcards and garden beyond the pavilion supply recurring anchors that reweight the final image (green shoots "preparing their own quiet performance"). Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the setting charges the closure by making the revelation location-dependent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early and sustained through Mira's months of study. The piece accumulates pressure through seasonal transition and the mounting particulars (postcards, frost patterns, light angles), culminating in the cathedral window discovery that reframes her understanding. However, the escalation is largely contemplative; no external opposition tests Mira's commitment, and the turn feels more like patient waiting rewarded than agency forging a path. The resolution's cost—transforming her mural from "decorative commission into something true"—implies professional risk but doesn't show a client's objection, a deadline pressure, or a visible sacrifice that alters her tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the night-blooming mystery and resolves in the final insight about "profound patience required to witness beauty that hides itself" and "quiet courage of blooming unseen." The cathedral window's encoded knowledge of lunar cycles and temperature drops transforms the initial question into a meditation on trust and hidden witnesses. The closing image—spring bulbs "preparing their own quiet performance for the coming darkness"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. One friction: the articulation "the universe contains witnesses enough" in the penultimate beat edges toward theme statement rather than letting the image carry the weight alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture: "the melting of winter's last snow," "umbral tenderness," "reckon with what she was seeing." Perceptual signature is consistent—Mira's artist's eye selects color, light, and pattern throughout. However, the diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "profound patience," "the universe contains witnesses enough," "celebration of all the secret flourishing." The long, clause-heavy sentences maintain rhythm but flatten slightly under emotional intensity rather than sharpening. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not tested.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structures and strong sensory specificity ("burnt orange and deep gold," "warm, fragmented showers"). Information density is high in descriptive passages. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the opening's "questions that others dismissed as idle fancy" is restated as "the question consumed her...filling every quiet hour with its mystery"; the discovery beat recounts "noticed something she had overlooked for months" then immediately explains what she's seeing in a long, clause-stacked sentence that cycles through "hidden layers...hidden layers" and "etched design...etched glass." The phrase "reckon with what she was seeing" uses "reckon" intransitively in a way that reads slightly awkward. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "It was not merely about...but about...about..." creates a minor rhythmic stall. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems that touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of botanical postcards, cathedral window as encoded astronomical map, and artist's quest offers a specific, non-obvious angle. The detail of medieval artisans embedding bloom-timing knowledge in stained glass feels fresh and charged with thematic resonance. However, the core emotional arc—solitary artist achieves epiphany through patient observation—follows a familiar template without sharp transformation. The ending's shift from "decorative commission into something true and essential" risks the safety middle: we don't see what she paints differently or what professional cost she accepts. The piece commits fully to its lyric, contemplative mode and executes it cleanly, but the stakes remain abstract enough that swapping Mira for another introspective artist would leave the arc largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her months of study set up the discovery, but her key choices are largely contemplative—spreading postcards, studying photographs, noticing the window. The final turn (beginning to paint with new understanding) is asserted rather than shown with tactical consequence. She appears in the closure beat but does not make a decision that alters tactics with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The postcards are introduced early (first paragraph), handled in two distinct beats (initial description, winter study session spreading them on the worktable), and their annotations ("opened at 3am," dates and locations) directly enable Mira's line of inquiry. They return implicitly in the closure insight about blooming times. However, they are displaced by the cathedral window as the causal agent of discovery; their role is setup rather than resolution. Present in all three gates but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" is named explicitly in the second paragraph as "her favorite time to think, that suspended moment between darkness and light," and the discovery occurs "just as the first weak sunlight touched the etched glass." The concept shapes timing and atmosphere, constraining the revelation to a specific liminal moment. It charges the thematic resonance (night-blooming, hidden beauty) but does not narrow tactical options. Present in setup and closure with lyric reprise, eligible for mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" appears as a label in the opening line but is not tested by contradiction or visible cost. Mira's persistence is told ("worked with a persistence that surprised even herself") rather than shown through a choice where being quietly driven forecloses another path. The trait enables her months-long study but does not constrain a moment under pressure. Functional but replaceable with "dedicated" or "focused."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Reckon" appears at the discovery beat: "She pressed her face close to the glass, reckon with what she was seeing, and understood at last..." The verb marks the turn from observation to comprehension and directly precedes the epiphany that redefines her mural's purpose. The slightly archaic/bare form ("reckon" without "to") gives it textural weight. However, the action itself is brief and could be replaced with "grappling," "wrestling," or "confronting" without major structural loss. Present in two gates (development, closure) with causal role in the key turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cathedral window is signaled early (first paragraph mentions the pavilion's etched glass, second paragraph introduces "the cathedral window that dominated the eastern wall"), its mechanics matter (specific light angles reveal hidden layers), and it delivers the discovery that changes Mira's understanding. The window "contained hidden layers within its etched design that only revealed themselves at certain angles of light" and encodes "knowledge about the timing of night-blooms." Present in all three gates, drives the central turn, and is causally indispensable—without this exact method, the revelation fails.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The amber pavilion is introduced immediately and described with rich specificity (glass panels, etched vines, autumn light). It houses the workspace, postcards, and cathedral window, making it the container for all action. The setting enables the discovery (light through glass at dawn) but does not pressure Mira's choices—she could conduct this inquiry in any well-lit studio with the same objects. Present in all three gates and charges atmosphere, but the pavilion itself is swappable with another windowed space. Functional across beats, not quite indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Time is tracked: autumn (paragraph one) transitions to "across the melting of winter's last snow" (paragraph two), and the story closes with "last of the winter snow continued its slow melting" and "first green shoots of spring." The seasonal progression parallels Mira's slow accumulation of insight and the thematic cycle of blooming. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—months pass in summary without a deadline or constraint that alters her tactics. The drift is contemplative rather than urgent. Lyric reprise (winter melting → spring shoots) reweights the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The desire "to understand why flowers bloom at night when no one is there to witness their unfurling" is named early, pursued through months of study, and resolved by the cathedral window discovery and final insight. Mira's motivation drives every beat and culminates in the transformation of her mural. However, the friction between wants and costs is minimal—no competing obligation tests her commitment, and the resolution is largely intellectual rather than requiring sacrifice. The motivation is indispensable to the story's logic but not dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Umbral tenderness" is named explicitly in the second paragraph ("soft, umbral tenderness that made everything feel both intimate and vast") and infuses the descriptive palette throughout: "amber glow," "warm, fragmented showers," "suspended moment between darkness and light." The tone modulates slightly—brightening at the discovery ("laughed softly"), deepening at closure ("quiet performance for the coming darkness")—and charges the final image of hidden blooming. Coherent and purposeful, directly supporting the night-bloom theme.</comment>
