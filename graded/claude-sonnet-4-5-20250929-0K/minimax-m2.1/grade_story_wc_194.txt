<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is richly textured through embodied perception ("the creak of rusted hinges sounded like a greeting from a dying world"), and her contradictory relationship to inheritance drives the narrative. However, the ending truncates before we see her emotional response to the revelation, leaving the final choice or stance invisible. The grandmother's voice and the "truth" arrive but Elara's agency in response never materializes on the page, weakening the arc's closure moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story establishes clear causal progression through discovery beats (gate → house → reading room → gramophone), but the piece ends mid-revelation without delivering a closure unit. The text breaks off at "a choice that had echoe[d]" before any Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing can land with felt cost. Orientation is clean and the Accumulative lens builds well through the first 90%, but the absent ending makes cost illegible. Apply −1.5 for the missing closure unit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sepia reading room is established early with purposeful sensory detail ("scent of paper, leather, and something faintly sweet") and the gramophone becomes a tactile constraint that Elara handles. The "first yawn of evening" recurs to mark time's passage, and golden light filters perception throughout. The wisteria-claimed terrace and marble entrance hall anchor spatial progression cleanly. The setting doesn't quite constrain the peak choice because the text truncates before that choice lands, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering what her grandmother kept hidden—is signaled clearly in the opening third and drives each discovery beat. The gramophone's resistance → yield → sound emergence provides one meaningful tightening under an Accumulative lens. However, the truncated ending means no on-page cost or trade-off appears; we never see whether Elara accepts, rejects, or is altered by the truth. The escalation builds coherently but stops short of the moment where agency and cost must appear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between "bloodlines were merely accidents of history" and the pull of ancestral secrets, with the gramophone as a non-literal bridge between past and present. The "golden shadows… coalesce into shapes that might have been light or might have been memory" offers charged ambiguity. Yet the piece never delivers a resonant answer; the revelation begins but the text cuts off before Elara's stance can reweight prior material. No final paragraph moralizing, but also no thematic closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and Elara's perceptual signature is distinct throughout: "wisteria had claimed what was once a manicured terrace, weaving chaos through the bones of order" demonstrates her educated, elegiac idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully as pressure rises. The grandmother's voice arriving "not recorded but somehow present" maintains internal logic within the supernatural frame. Diction stays controlled and voice-specific under pressure with no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. However, several adjacencies loop: "secrets kept in plain sight" immediately after "deliberately placed," and "sound did not emerge as she expected, did not play" uses template negation twice in one beat. The phrase "first yawn of evening" appears identically three times. These artifacts don't obscure causality but create mild drag. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—sound-based ancestral memory accessed through a gramophone via "standing waves"—offers a fresh synthesis of inheritance horror and speculative mechanism. The sepia reading room and "suspended grief" create a specific, non-generic frame. Yet the truncation prevents the story from following its implications to a non-obvious closure, and the "dynasty that had ended" setup leans on familiar gothic territory. Solid freshness in execution but incomplete conceptual payoff.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is the "dynasty ender" and the characterization is clear, but her choices in the text are largely passive discovery moves (entering, approaching, sitting, turning the crank) rather than decisions that alter tactics under conflicting pressure. The text ends before she makes any choice in response to the revelation. Present and functional but not decisively shaping turns. Two of three gates (setup, middle presence); missing closure participation caps at ~4.6, adjusted down slightly for passivity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gramophone crank handle is described early ("gleamed as though it had been polished yesterday"), handled in the climactic beat ("her fingers closed around it… feeling something click into place"), and its turning triggers the sound mechanism that delivers the grandmother's voice. Three gates satisfied with clear causal pressure. However, it doesn't return with reweighted meaning or constrain a final choice because the text truncates. Strong middle integration but no closure linkage caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"A bridge of intuition" appears once in narration ("The truth came not as revelation but as recognition, a bridge of intuition…") but functions as thematic label rather than on-page stake or tactic. It does not constrain Elara's approach, alter her method, or shape any dramatized choice. Late appearance (final paragraph), ornamental use, and no causal pressure or closure participation. Multiple frictions: late first appearance −0.6, ornamental −0.7, swappability −0.5. Caps at 4.6 for missing setup; additional frictions bring final score to low functional band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Eloquently silent" is applied to the gramophone as description ("an object that spoke eloquently silent of secrets") but never constrains or enables any on-page action with cost. It's a label attached to an object rather than a trait that alters choices. No setup, no development, ornamental closure mention only. Missing setup and development gates; ornamental use −0.7; label-only trait −0.3. Caps and deductions place it in the ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Muse" does not appear as an on-page action. If interpreted as Elara's contemplation of the room and its secrets, those moments are descriptive rather than plot-turning; the gramophone operation drives the key beat, not musing itself. The element is either absent or present only as ambient coloring without causal work. No gates satisfied; if generously read as present via reflection, it remains ornamental and swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Standing waves" is signaled in the climactic beat ("the air itself seemed to vibrate with standing waves, patterns of resonance that built and built") and provides the mechanism through which the grandmother's voice arrives. However, it appears only in the final section with no earlier setup or middle development, and the text ends before any consequence or cost tied to the method can land. Late first appearance −0.5, missing setup gate caps at 4.6, but strong causal role in the climax and specificity lift it within the capped band to ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sepia reading room is established early with rich sensory anchoring, houses the gramophone as a key resource, and its locked status frames the mystery. The room's "suspended grief" and portrait-lined walls pressure Elara's emotional state throughout. The golden light through windows marks time and charges atmosphere. Setup, development (the room constrains access and creates discovery sequence), and closure presence all satisfied. Strong causal and atmospheric integration; it doesn't quite reach indispensable (could be another locked chamber) but it's essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"In the first yawn of evening" is signaled twice in the text, marking time's passage and creating a liminal window that the narrative explicitly ties to the supernatural reveal ("at this precise moment in the first yawn of evening when the veil between past and present grew thin"). The timeframe is purposeful and thematically charged, but it doesn't tighten tactics or create urgency; Elara's pace is contemplative throughout. Setup and closure participation present; development as tactic-shaper weak. Lyric resonance and thematic weight lift it to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover hidden truth drives every beat: she comes "because someone had to decide," approaches the locked room, and operates the gramophone despite uncertainty. Her desire is dramatized through progressive discovery actions and her internal tension between rejection of bloodlines and pull toward answers. Setup early, development through choices, and closure participation (she seeks and receives the revelation). Cost isn't fully visible because the text truncates, preventing the highest band, but the motivation is essential and shapes the arc throughout.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" recurs across the narrative with modulating function: initially as "amber light… spilling" across the garden, then "Golden shadows pooled in the entrance hall," and finally "the golden shadows seemed to coalesce into shapes" at the climactic beat. The tone remains coherent—elegiac, charged with melancholy and mystery—and intensifies under pressure without breaking. The tone charges the final image directly. Strong integration across all three gates with clear closure linkage; near-indispensable for the story's atmospheric logic.</comment>
