<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miriam's interiority is specific and character-particular—her atlas-editor's lens shapes what she notices. The choice to pursue the convergence is established rather than dramatized under pressure; the story tracks observation and interpretation more than decisional turning points. Embodied emotion appears in "the particular silence of a discovery about to be made," but most beats describe reading and inference rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. No meaningful cost forecloses a path on the page; the ending remains anticipatory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers clues (falcon, leaf, symbol, phrasebook) toward a final moment of interpretive confidence. Orientation anchors are present early (frozen lake, outpost, Miriam's role). The closure unit reads as Charged Poise—Miriam holds proof and feels discovery imminent—but the cost remains prospective rather than paid on the page. The final image reweights prior material but does not show a decisive change or visible sacrifice, only readiness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting detail is vivid and filtered through Miriam's cartographic expertise: condensation patterns, ice-buckled railing, corrugated walls. The frozen lake and outpost constrain movement and supply clues (yellowed papers, the falcon's arrival point). Sensory selection (frost as clock, droplets tracing like rivers) reflects professional bias. The phrasebook and map function as micro-setting elements that enable key interpretive beats and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving the convergence exists—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through interpretive tightening (leaf, symbol, phrasebook match) rather than reversal. The story deepens Miriam's confidence but does not dramatize a choice that narrows options or forecloses a live alternative on the page. The final beat crystallizes readiness rather than paying a visible cost; escalation is gentle and intellectual, fitting the Accumulative lens, but stakes remain prospective.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the convergence as both geographical fact and metaphor for origin, belonging, and discovery. The final image—"all things, given time, find where they belong"—hovers near explicit thesis but is anchored in condensation, water seeking level, and prior interpretive work. Subtext operates in the phrasebook's faded pencil note ("origin") and the silence of researchers who came before. The piece resists moralizing until the last clause, which softens resonance slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is clean and stable; diction matches Miriam's expertise (hydrographic, convergent watersheds, temperature differentials). Perceptual signature is strong—she reads condensation patterns, falcon behavior, and map discrepancies through an atlas editor's lens. The prose has distinct texture in clause rhythm and technical specificity. The final sentence's elevated phrasing ("the particular silence of a discovery about to be made") fits voice but edges toward abstraction under peak anticipation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual breathing. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character expertise, or interpretive accumulation. Minor scaffold appears: "the way moisture gathered differently near underground rivers" and "the way all things, given time, find where they belong" echo phrasing ("the way…") in the final third. No loops or muddle touch closure; figurative language (condensation as rivers, falcon's "deliberation") is controlled and apt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The atlas-editor protagonist and hydrographic mystery offer a non-obvious synthesis. Condensation-as-clue and the falcon as messenger transform familiar discovery-arc tropes through specific professional detail. The convergence premise is fresh, but the story does not transform it beyond setup; the final beat remains anticipatory rather than reaching a singular inflection. Emotional specificity (trust in interpretations despite dismissal) avoids template plotting, though the structure follows familiar "seeker assembles clues" logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Miriam is present throughout and her interpretive decisions (reading condensation, consulting the phrasebook, tracing watershed paths) shape beats. Setup: first paragraph establishes her role and expertise. Development: multiple middle beats involve her reading clues and making inferences. Closure: the final image centers on her readiness and confidence. However, her choices are observational and interpretive rather than decisional with visible cost. Swappability: a geologist or hydrologist could perform similar interpretive work with minor adjustments. The character enables the accumulative lens but does not drive a hard turning point.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: the phrasebook appears mid-story ("sat on her workbench"). Development: Miriam consults it twice—once noting the dog-eared page and again matching the symbol to the word "origin." Closure: it provides the interpretive key that confirms her theory. Two distinct beats of use; the dog-ear signals prior attention and the final consultation reweights the symbol's meaning. However, the object is not handled with evolving physical cost, and a similar reference work (annotated journal, decoded map) could substitute with edits. Solid integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: "singular convergence" is named in the opening via the indigo-marked cloth and marginal note. Development: the alpine meadows "where three watersheds were said to meet" shape Miriam's interpretive path and the leaf's significance. Closure: the final image hinges on proving "the convergence was real" and the phrase "origin" confirms its existence. The concept defines the dominant stake and alters Miriam's tactics (tracing underground water, consulting the phrasebook). Removing it would collapse the story's logic. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceable within this narrative.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: "the subtle confidence that came from years of trusting her interpretations" appears mid-story. Development: the trait is asserted in one beat (tracing water paths) but does not visibly constrain or enable an action with cost. Closure: the ending reprises "felt the particular silence of a discovery about to be made," echoing confidence, but the trait operates as label rather than dramatized choice-maker. No on-page tradeoff where confidence forecloses caution or vice versa. Functional but replaceable; determination or expertise could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setup: the falcon arrives early (paragraph two) with the leaf and symbol. Development: Miriam extracts the bundle, reads the clues, and matches the symbol to the phrasebook. Closure: the herald action enables the final interpretive confirmation. One major beat (arrival and extraction) plus closure linkage. However, the action is swappable—a messenger, a discovered cache, or a decoded transmission could deliver the same clues with minor structural adjustments. Functional within the accumulative design but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: condensation patterns introduced early (paragraph three: "droplets travel, tracing the pattern of their migration like tiny rivers"). Development: Miriam has learned to read these patterns "over the years" to reveal "hidden topography," and the method justifies her confidence in underground rivers. Closure: the final image invokes "condensation on the glass, in the pattern of water seeking its level." Two beats (window observation, final reprise) and the method underpins her interpretive authority. Mechanics matter; the lens-specific skill charges the ending. Irreplaceable within her expertise but deployment is light.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Setup: first sentence establishes "frozen lake" and "rusted outpost." Development: the outpost supplies prior researchers' papers, the phrasebook, and the map; the frozen lake defines the feeder streams Miriam must trace. Closure: "the frozen lake gleamed under a sky that seemed to hold its breath" anchors the final image. The setting constrains movement (tree line, stone, birch stands) and provides the research artifacts that enable interpretation. Multiple beats; removal would eliminate the physical and archival resources. Essential across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: "The falcon arrived on a Thursday" anchors the present; "after the falcon returns" is implied by the opening structure. Development: no live clock or tightening deadline; the timeframe is retrospective framing rather than forward pressure. Closure: the ending is anticipatory, not time-bound. The temporal marker orients but does not constrain tactics or escalate stakes. Functional orientation but replaceable; any post-event framing could serve. Caps: introduced as past-tense context, not developed, not closure-active → cap ~4.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: opening establishes Miriam's quest "to find where the rivers begin." Development: multiple beats dramatize the motivation—studying the frozen lake's language, tracing underground water, consulting the phrasebook to decode "origin." Closure: "She had come here to find where the rivers began, to prove that the convergence was real and to mark it on maps that would outlast her" anchors the final stance. The desire shapes every interpretive choice and the ending's charge. Friction appears in her conflict with dismissive cartographers. Three gates, strong causal pressure, closure-active, indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setup: "worrying tranquility" appears late (final third: "The winter stillness outside held a worrying tranquility"). Development: the tone modulates earlier beats (silence, breath-holding sky, "particular silence of a discovery") but the exact phrase arrives after midpoint. Closure: the final image—"sky that seemed to hold its breath," "particular silence"—charges the ending with suspended anticipation consistent with the tone. One late explicit naming plus tonal coherence across the arc. Lyric reprise reweights the stake; the ending would lose atmospheric charge without it. Late penalty mitigated by strong closure linkage.</comment>
