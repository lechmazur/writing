<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren's scholarly rogue persona is asserted through labels ("charming rogue scholar," "particular warmth of a woman who knew secrets worth dying for") rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses under pressure. Her planting action proceeds smoothly without meaningful internal conflict or trade-offs that would reveal character through friction. The backstory about "seventeen closed libraries and three interrogation rooms" is summarized exposition rather than lived experience shaping present choices. Elder Okonkwo exists primarily to deliver world-building rather than to create relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story offers atmosphere and world-building but no on-page closure with felt cost. Maren begins intending to plant the seed and ends having planted it; the drone passes without consequence, leaving the action's stakes theoretical. The "first root reaching downward" is metaphorical promise rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that reweights what came before. The piece reads as a setup awaiting its inciting incident rather than a complete arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The gourd seed, garden plots, and greenhouse are vivid and purposeful, establishing the resistance's spatial logic. However, the convergence point where Maren plants functions more as symbolic backdrop than tactical constraint—she encounters no obstacle at the site and the "soft" soil is conveniently pre-turned by anonymous hands. The setting describes a coherent world but doesn't pressure the central action or force adaptation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—planting the seed to resist cognitive taxation—is signaled but never tested. The drone's scan is the only opposition and it resolves instantly when Maren smiles and mentions cabbage. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Maren's plan proceeds exactly as intended from start to finish. The story lacks the "one meaningful tightening" required for this length, presenting installation rather than escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cognitive-tax premise and resistance-through-gardening concept are vivid, but theme is asserted through direct statements rather than earned through pressure. "Thoughts might be taxable, but the refusal to stop thinking—that was beyond their formulas" is thematic summary rather than dramatized insight. The final image of Maren standing guard repeats the opening posture without reweighting prior material through cost or transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent elevated register with strong imagery ("amber haze after thoughts became taxable"), but frequently slips into exposition that tells rather than shows. Phrases like "candidly cryptic quality that made listeners feel they were hearing two conversations at once" explain the effect rather than trusting the reader to perceive it. The single line of dialogue feels artificially stilted ("Lovely evening for cabbage") as a wink to the reader rather than natural speech under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Pervasive overwriting muddies key moments: "the particular warmth of a woman who knew secrets worth dying for" and "candidly cryptic, each furrow a sentence, each trellis a warning" stack modifiers without adding clarity. Paraphrase loops appear ("This was how the club operated—names never spoken" / "silent dialogue—tomatoes spelling out historical dates"). Template cadence runs through the middle third ("She understood what he meant. The seed wasn't merely botanical—it was philosophical resistance"). The closure beat itself suffers from figurative excess ("water table of rebellion") that abstracts rather than sharpens the image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The cognitive-tax premise is fresh, but its execution relies heavily on explanation rather than dramatization. The "plants as code" and "insects that eat bureaucracy" elements feel imported from a conceptual checklist rather than organically integrated through lived detail. The story avoids familiar beats but replaces them with world-building exposition, resulting in originality of premise without originality of dramatic execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout and makes the decision to plant, but "charming rogue scholar" operates primarily as a label. The claimed history of talking her way into libraries and out of interrogations is backstory summary; on the page she simply kneels, digs, plants, and stands. Her smile at the drone is the only moment where the "charming" trait manifests, and it creates no turn or cost—the drone simply moves on.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gourd rattle seed is introduced in paragraph two ("rested against her thigh"), receives Elder Okonkwo's explanation in paragraph three, is planted in the convergence in paragraphs six-seven, and appears in the penultimate paragraph as "the seed stirred." However, Maren's handling is largely ceremonial; the seed's unique properties (producing rattles that disrupt tax-monitors) are told rather than shown affecting tactics. It shapes the plot's forward motion but could be replaced with any MacGuffin of resistance without structural collapse.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The "secret language club" concept is established through the kale spiral and Elder Okonkwo's network, but it remains atmospheric background rather than a stake-shaping force. Maren operates alone in the scene; no club member interaction creates pressure or enables her choice. The concept is told through exposition ("This was how the club operated—names never spoken") rather than demonstrated through coded exchanges or recognition signals that alter her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Candidly cryptic" appears explicitly in paragraph two and is invoked again in paragraph eight ("the particular candidcryptic quality that made listeners feel they were hearing two conversations at once"). However, it functions as label-only characterization. The single line of dialogue ("Lovely evening for cabbage") is meant to demonstrate it, but the effect is told rather than dramatized—we're informed it has this quality rather than shown a cost or constraint emerging from it.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Warp" appears in Elder Okonkwo's instruction ("Let it warp the very concept of thought-currency") but remains abstract promise. The seed's future ability to warp is explained, but no warping occurs on the page. The term could be replaced with "disrupt," "undermine," or "challenge" without changing the story's mechanics. No turn traces causally to this specific action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method is established early (paragraph two describes the kale spiral and cabbage-leaf passwords) and Maren executes it in the center third (creating "a spiral within a spiral, the mathematical signature of non-compliance"). The action is specific and irreplaceable—removing the garden-pattern method would eliminate the story's central mechanism. However, it proceeds without complication or adaptation, limiting its causal pressure to enabling rather than testing Maren's choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The entomologist's greenhouse appears in paragraph three and again in paragraph seven when "the greenhouse lights flickered" as Okonkwo watches. It provides Okonkwo's credential and a surveillance detail but exerts no pressure on Maren's action. The praying mantises and bureaucracy-eating insects are vivid world-building but remain ornamental—Maren's planting would proceed identically without them. The greenhouse is a set piece rather than a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after thoughts became taxable" is established in the opening line and pervades the world logic (tax collectors, thought-monitors, drones). It shapes the stakes conceptually and motivates the resistance action. However, it functions as static backdrop rather than live pressure—no clock tightens Maren's window, and the tax-enforcement presence (the single drone) creates no urgency. The timeframe is essential context but doesn't drive escalation within this scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "stand guard over your own spark of defiance" is explicitly stated in the penultimate paragraph ("Maren Voss stood guard over her spark") and implicit throughout Maren's careful planting. However, it's asserted more than dramatized through conflicted choice—Maren never weighs the cost of planting versus safety, and no competing desire creates friction. The motivation is present and consistent but lacks the internal contradiction that would elevate it through visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Converging chaos is invoked directly in paragraph six ("the chaos of Hollowfield converged: the distant hum of monitoring drones, the rustle of leaves..."). The tone attempts to layer surveillance threat with botanical resistance and maintains consistency across beats. However, the execution is more controlled than chaotic—Maren's action proceeds smoothly, the drone passes without incident, and the various elements (insects, mantises, garden codes) are explained rather than colliding in pressured simultaneity. The tone describes convergence without enacting it through escalating friction.</comment>
