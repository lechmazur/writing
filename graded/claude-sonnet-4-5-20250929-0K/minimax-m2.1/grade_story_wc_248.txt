<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The library-burning backstory is told in summary; the Archive exploration lacks moment-to-moment choices that reveal her limits or internal friction. "Analytically intuitive" functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains options with visible cost. The three-year coda tells rather than dramatizes any transformation or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece violates orientation anchors: the opening library fire is summary; the Archive appears without clear spatial or temporal grounding past the 120-word threshold. Drive lens is ambiguous—causal linkage is weak (grandmother's fragment → Archive discovery is told, not shown), and accumulative patterning is not taught early. Closure is told ("she carried not just the knowledge...a promise fulfilled") rather than shown as a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost. Cost-proof test fails: no exact sentence makes the price of the three-year stay or emergence legible in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The Archive is described with vivid sensory detail (marble halls, burned-out lanterns, ancient smoke) but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image. Mira's movement through corridors is abstract; no spatial choreography or tool use alters tactics. The vandalized portrait is a set piece rather than an environment that pressures decisions. Micro-setting option (tapestry fragment, portrait mechanisms) is mentioned but not used to force a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (fulfilling grandmother's promise) is signaled but never tested by an on-page reversal or tightening. The portrait's hidden mechanisms open without resistance; no choice narrows options or imposes cost. The three-year stay is told in summary, not dramatized. Agency is absent—Mira discovers rather than decides, and the resolution ("she carried...a promise fulfilled") lacks a visible price or foreclosed path. Escalation under any lens is missing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (knowledge-hoarding vs. liberation) is declared rather than emergent from concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly ("to every future mind that would seek understanding without having to burn down the gates"), violating the no-statement rule and earning a −0.6 deduction. The vandalized portrait and layered tapestry function as plot devices rather than recurring images that reweight meaning at closure. No resonant, non-literal answer to the central question is offered; the ending summarizes the thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited. Diction is controlled but occasionally drifts into elevated register ("volcanic tenderness," "analytically intuitive") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Perceptual signature is present in Mira's attention to artistic detail but does not degrade under stress. No dialogue on the page to judge. Free indirect style is clean, though some filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") dull immediacy without voice motivation. Psychic distance remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Opening sentence is vivid but overlong (49 words) and buries the lead. Paraphrase loops appear: "knowledge had been hoarded rather than shared" restates "fees to open" without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the Archive section ("She had been following...when she found," "she understood why," "she realized"). Stock metaphors: "thread tied around her heart," "burning bright enough to illuminate." Figurative density in the closure paragraph ("volcanic tenderness," "thread...promise...gates") muddies rather than sharpens the final image. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems, −0.4 for stock metaphor strings.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Core premise (arsonist librarian discovers lost civilization that hid truth in art) is high-concept but not transformed through specific lived detail or moral calculus. The Keth-Soral civilization and the grandmother's lineage feel generic; the vandalized self-portrait and tapestry network are plot devices without fresh inflection. Transformation test fails: the emotional arc (discovery → fulfillment) could function with different names and places. No bold risk-taking or unconventional structural choice heightens stakes. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: template "hidden ancestry/lost knowledge" premise without personalization; apply −0.8 adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mira appears in all three thirds but her arsonist identity is backstory summary; no on-page choice tied to that role creates a turn. The Archive exploration is discovery without decision pressure. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development (arsonist trait does not constrain Archive choices). Late-breaking three-year stay is told, not shown. Swappability: any knowledge-seeker could replace her with minor edits. Apply −0.5 for ornamental backstory use, −0.4 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Tapestry fragment appears early (grandmother's deathbed) and returns in the portrait chamber, satisfying two-beat minimum. Setup and closure gates are met. However, the fragment's use is passive: it "pulled her deeper" (metaphor, not action) and matches the portrait (observation, not choice). Missing middle development gate: the fragment does not constrain a middle choice. Cap at 4.6. No causal pressure or cost tied to handling it. Apply −0.3 for decorative mention in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Vandalized self-portrait appears in the second third (missing setup gate; −0.3 penalty). It drives one key beat: Mira's discovery and mechanism release. Closure linkage is weak—the portrait is not mentioned in the final paragraph. Development gate is met (shapes the chamber discovery). Causal pressure is moderate: the scratches form shadows that guide her to hidden mechanisms. Swappability: any hidden artifact could replace it. Cap at 6.9 for missing setup. Apply −0.4 for swappability, −0.2 for weak closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is label-only; it does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. Mira's gift guides her fingers to "exact pressure points," but this is assertion rather than dramatized trade-off (e.g., missed social cue, exhaustion from focus). Present in all three thirds but ornamental. Apply −0.5 for label-only use, −0.4 for no cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Portray" is loosely tied to the self-portrait discovery but does not drive major turns. The portrait's defacement is backstory (someone else's action). Mira's tracing and mechanism release is discovery, not portrayal. Missing setup gate (action is not signaled early). Swappable: any hidden-message revelation could replace it. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup. Apply −0.6 for swappability, −0.4 for summary-only involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Trail of artistic creations is signaled early (murals, tapestries) and structures Mira's three-day search. Development gate is met: the trail leads to the portrait chamber. Closure gate is weak—the trail is not mentioned in the resolution. Causal pressure is moderate: the trail guides her path but does not narrow options or impose cost. Swappability: any map or clue system could replace it. Apply −0.4 for weak closure linkage, −0.3 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lost civilization archive appears in all three thirds. Setup and development gates are met. The archive supplies the portrait and final tapestry, driving two beats. Closure gate is weak—"Keth-Soral" is mentioned in the coda but the archive setting does not charge the final image. Causal pressure: the archive's murals and portrait chamber enable discovery but do not constrain tactics (Mira encounters no obstacles). Apply −0.5 for weak closure linkage, −0.3 for no visible constraint or cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Seventeen months after going off the grid" anchors the opening but does not tighten decisions or tactics. The three-day search and three-year study are told in summary without a live clock. Missing development and closure gates: timeframe does not constrain a middle choice or shape the ending. Apply −0.6 for ornamental use, −0.5 for summary-only involvement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Forgotten promise is signaled early (grandmother's deathbed) and returns in the final paragraph, satisfying setup and closure gates. Development gate is met: the promise drives Mira's Archive exploration. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no on-page friction between the promise and competing wants or costs. Causal pressure is moderate: the promise frames the quest but does not narrow options. Apply −0.4 for told-only motivation, −0.3 for no visible friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" is declared once ("Mira approached the portrait with volcanic tenderness") but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. Tone is static—elegiac and declarative throughout—without coherent escalation. Missing development and closure gates: the tone label does not shape middle choices or the ending. Cap at 3.4 for missing middle development. Apply −0.5 for label-only use, −0.3 for no closure linkage.</comment>
