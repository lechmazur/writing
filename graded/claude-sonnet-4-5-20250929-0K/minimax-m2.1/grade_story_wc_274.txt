<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kira's internal conflict between duty and truth is declared ("bravely conflicted") but never embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The decision to transmit arrives cleanly after a brief contemplation, without visible cost or foreclosed alternatives—her hands stop trembling and she simply acts. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("the foundation of everything...began to crack," "each sentence a small apocalypse") rather than character-particular perception. The final choice reads as inevitable from the start, lacking the friction required to earn the renunciation of her eleven-year role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with situational pressure. Orientation is clean (archivist, cryogenic library, eleven years, tonight). The inciting incident (letter arrives) triggers a because/therefore sequence: discovery → contemplation → transmission. However, the escalation is thin—no on-page obstacle complicates the choice, and the "dormant networks" conveniently enable the climax without prior constraint. Closure occurs on the page (transmission initiated), but the cost remains abstract ("everything changed") rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing. The causality holds but lacks a meaningful tightening that narrows live options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cryogenic library under snow is vividly established early with selective sensory anchors: "pocket of silence," "footsteps echoing...like stones dropped into a frozen well," "towering shelves of cryogenic vaults." The snow and silence recur purposefully to frame the ending's held-breath moment. However, the setting does not constrain a choice—Kira faces no spatial or environmental obstacle, and the interface functions as pure enabler. The micro-setting (crystalline interface, vaults) is present but ornamental; the library's vastness and cold charge atmosphere without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (whether to release the contraband letter) is signaled early. Escalation under the causal lens requires a tightening that narrows options or raises cost; here, the piece offers contemplation but no reversal or complication. Kira's agency appears as decision, but no obstacle tests her commitment—the networks "wait" for her, the system "had learned" she was ready, and transmission proceeds without friction. The resolution is driven by her choice, yet the cost ("everything changed") remains declarative rather than a visible forfeiture. One meaningful pressure point is present (the letter's revelation) but it does not force a trade-off with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme (truth versus preservation, complicity of silence) emerges from the letter's content and Kira's choice, not from overt statement. The recurring images of ice, silence, and dormancy shift meaning at closure (shroud → held breath). However, the ending articulates its thesis nearly directly: "she had done the bravest thing...contraband truths would finally have their say." The piece invites reflection on institutional silence, but the final beat tells rather than showing the thematic reconfiguration through a non-literal image. Subtext operates in the library's sentience metaphor ("the system had learned"), yet this borders on convenient anthropomorphism that soft-sells the ethical calculus.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; distance and tense hold throughout. The narrative voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("small apocalypse," "desperate fingers," "songs to life"), though some diction drifts elevated ("the mythology she had been raised to cherish") during peak beats. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (archivist's lens on vaults, networks, preservation protocols) but not deeply idiosyncratic. The prose modulates with emotional intensity (trembling hands, stopped trembling), and psychic distance tightens appropriately at the decision. Filter verbs are light. However, the voice occasionally converges on prompt language ("bravely conflicted," "dangerous liaison," "contraband truths") in ways that feel externally imposed rather than organically Kira's register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are not monotonous. Information density is moderate—many lines advance atmosphere and interiority, though some restate without added pressure (paragraphs 3 and 4 loop on the letter's weight and Kira's trembling). No egregious template cadence, but the prose leans on elevated metaphor clusters that blur momentum: "pocket of silence," "stones dropped into a frozen well," "each sentence a small apocalypse," "rot in ice." Figurative density is high across most beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, edging toward overwriting (−0.4). One paraphrase loop: "the weight of the revelation pressed against her chest" echoes "that dizzying quiet pressed against her thoughts" (−0.2). Grammar and clarity are clean; no significant loops in the closure beat. Overall, the piece is legible but carries scaffold that dulls propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—forbidden wartime love letter archived and later released by conflicted keeper—is a familiar template (star-crossed lovers, institutional cover-up, whistleblower arc). The cryogenic setting adds sci-fi veneer but does not transform the emotional or moral calculus in a non-obvious way. The letter's revelation ("enemies were lovers torn apart by politics") reads as stock forbidden-romance shorthand without lived specificity. Kira's arc follows a predictable path: discovery → internal debate → brave transmission. The "dormant networks" that awaken for her shift specifically, and the anthropomorphized system that "had learned" she was ready, gesture toward freshness but land as convenient contrivance. No bold structural risk or synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight; the story executes its template competently without surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: present from the opening line. Development: Kira's role as archivist motivates her access and her internal conflict over duty versus disclosure. Payoff: she makes the climactic choice to transmit. The character drives the key turn (initiating transmission) with agency. However, her decision feels foreordained by the framing ("the system had learned...she was ready"), which softens protagonist causality. Cost is abstract rather than a visible forfeiture tied to her specific role. Two beats (contemplation, transmission) + closure linkage, but swappability is moderate—any keeper role would function similarly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early (paragraph 2). Development: the letter's content triggers Kira's internal conflict and provides the information that rewrites her worldview. Payoff: it is the object she chooses to transmit, directly shaping the ending. The letter appears in at least three beats (arrival, reading, transmission) and its meaning shifts from forbidden evidence to catalyst for change. However, it is handled primarily through summary and description rather than tactile interaction, and its reweighting at closure is declarative ("contraband truths would finally have their say") rather than imagistically charged. Strong causal role but moderate irreplaceability—any incriminating document could serve a similar function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "contraband truths" first named in paragraph 3. Development: the concept frames the letter's content and Kira's ethical dilemma (preserve versus reveal). Payoff: explicitly named in the final sentence ("contraband truths would finally have their say"). The concept shapes the dominant stake (whether to release hidden knowledge) but remains thematic rather than a tactical constraint—it does not alter on-page options or force a trade-off with visible cost. Present across beats as a label, but swappable with "forbidden knowledge" or "dangerous secrets" without structural change. Mid-range integration: it organizes theme but does not narrow choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: labeled directly in paragraph 4 ("She was bravely conflicted"). Development: the attribute is told rather than shown—no on-page moment demonstrates contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The text summarizes her "loyalty to duty warring with...conviction" but does not dramatize the friction in a choice with cost. Payoff: by the final paragraph her hands have "stopped trembling" and she acts without further conflict, suggesting the attribute resolved off-page. Label-only mention trends low. Late explicit labeling (second half) and summary-only use cap the score; no visible tradeoff tied to the trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: the goal to scandalize (release the letter to provoke upheaval) is implicit from paragraph 3 onward. Development: the action is foreshadowed by Kira's contemplation of "what good was preservation if it meant keeping silence forever?" Payoff: she initiates transmission in the final paragraph, and the text declares "the scandal rippled outward." The action drives the climax and redefines the story's outcome. However, it is not irreplaceable—"reveal," "expose," or "transmit" would function identically with cosmetic edits. The action shapes the ending but lacks unique specificity; swappability and moderate causal texture limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Setup: mentioned in paragraph 2 ("dormant networks that had not stirred in decades"). Development: the networks "hummed beneath her feet" and "waited to carry this explosive knowledge" (paragraph 5), framing the means of transmission. Payoff: "The dormant networks sang to life" in the final paragraph, executing the climax. The method is signaled early and recurs, but its mechanics remain abstract—no on-page complication or constraint (password, authorization, risk of detection) tests Kira's use of it. It functions as a convenient enabler rather than a tactical problem. Present across beats with moderate causal role, but replaceable (radio, courier, upload) without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: established vividly in paragraph 1 ("library...in a pocket of silence," "towering shelves of cryogenic vaults," "snow outside"). Development: the setting recurs to frame Kira's isolation and the stakes ("the library's echoing halls holding their breath"). Payoff: the final image ("the dizzying quiet of the library under snow") reprises the opening motif, transforming silence from shroud to held breath. The setting charges atmosphere and the ending's tone, but it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—Kira faces no spatial obstacle or environmental pressure. Lyric reprise reweights meaning, reaching mid-6s, but lack of tactical involvement limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Setup: titled phrase appears in paragraph 4 ("In the blink that follows surprise"). Development: the story compresses subjective time (eleven years of service, tonight's event, the contemplation, the transmission) but does not use a ticking clock to tighten decisions. Payoff: no return to the "blink" at closure; the ending stretches into leisurely reflection. The timeframe is ornamental—mentioned once mid-story without altering tactics or pacing. No live clock that narrows options. Late appearance, single decorative mention, and no closure participation cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setup: the letter's author "hoping it would provoke an unspoken conversation" (paragraph 4). Development: the motivation is attributed to the historical writer, not Kira; Kira's own motive is to stop "keeping silence forever" and become "a messenger of truths." The element is mentioned but not fully owned by the protagonist. Payoff: the transmission aims to start a conversation ("toward eyes that needed to see"), echoing the original hope. The motivation frames the thematic goal but is not dramatized through conflicted choice with visible cost—Kira's decision is swift and unobstructed. Functional presence without irreplaceability; swappable with "inspire change" or "break the silence."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup: "dizzying quiet" introduced in paragraph 1 and reprised throughout ("that dizzying quiet pressed," "the dizzying quiet of the library"). Development: the tone modulates with pressure—silence shifts from oppressive to anticipatory. Payoff: the final image transforms quiet into "a held breath—a pause before the scandal rippled outward," charging the closure. The tone is coherent, purposeful, and reprised with reweighted meaning in the ending. However, it remains atmospheric rather than a constraint that alters choice. Strong lyric integration with closure linkage qualifies for mid-6s under the resonance allowance, but lack of tactical pressure limits higher scoring.</comment>
