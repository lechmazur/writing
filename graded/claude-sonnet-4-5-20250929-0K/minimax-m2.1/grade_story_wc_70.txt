<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's trait of involuntary truthfulness is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied cost. Her interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("her involuntary truth rising like bile") rather than concrete, character-particular perception. The revelation that she's been "collecting hope" through "small kindnesses" is told rather than shown through prior micro-choices, and the final shift feels epiphanic without the grounding struggle required at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but the closure unit—lights flickering back and Elara understanding her "true purpose"—delivers statement rather than a resonant image with legible cost. The riddle's "reveal" mechanic arrives late and resolves without prior complication or visible price. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly by the toll booth scene, waiving the Orientation Test penalty, but the causality between reading the riddle aloud and the drones "waiting" remains unexplained metaphor rather than earned turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The copper spire, nectar dusk, and internal tower stairs provide vivid atmospheric anchors. The lacquer box and matchbox are handled across beats, constraining the reveal sequence. However, the drone beehives and "great reservoir" remain abstract set-dressing without spatial or mechanical specificity that would allow the reader to visualize how static charges move or what "cracked like an eggshell" means in physical terms. The setting does not constrain Elara's choices at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the city's power—is signaled early, but Elara faces no on-page obstacle or trade-off when climbing the tower or reading the riddle. The "drones were waiting" resolution is delivered without cost, resistance, or a narrowing of options. Mira's assertion that Elara preserves wonder tells us escalation has happened rather than dramatizing a tightening choice. No visible price is paid; the lights simply "flicker back to life."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme—wonder as spiritual fuel—emerges clearly but is stated by Elara's internal narration ("the wonder had drained") and Mira's dialogue rather than demonstrated through concrete particulars. The riddle functions as a thematic bumper sticker. The final image of lights returning does not reweight prior material or offer a non-literal answer; it delivers the theme as a moral. The matchbox and "hope" collect are forced symbolic recurrences without fresh inflection at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature is generic ("her hand trembled," "breath catch") without character-particular idiom. Dialogue between Elara and Mira is functional but interchangeable in register; Mira's diction ("You preserve wonder in routine") is unnaturally articulate for a seven-year-old. The prose modulates adequately with scene pressure but lacks a distinct rhythmic texture or lexical specificity that would mark this voice as singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is mostly clean, but paraphrase loops appear ("the wonder had drained" / "children no longer looked up… with hopeful hearts"). Template cadence is present in repeated "she had been" constructions across the opening. Stock metaphors ("rising like bile," "settled like warm honey") reduce immediacy in peak beats. Information density is moderate; several lines restate the same content without added pressure. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—spiritual wonder fuels the power grid—is a widely used YA/fantasy template (loss of belief/magic causes system failure). The "candid toll keeper" and "drone beehives" offer surface specificity but do not transform the underlying emotional arc or moral calculus. The riddle's answer is delivered as exposition rather than discovered through specific choice. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece retreats to a neat restoration without ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara appears in all beats but her "candid" trait does not drive a key choice with visible cost. She accepts the box, climbs the tower, and reads the riddle without opposition or trade-off. Her truthfulness is mentioned but never tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lacquer box is handled twice (received, opened) and houses the matchbox, but it does not constrain choice or evolve in meaning. It functions as a delivery mechanism without independent pressure. Removing it for a simpler handoff would not alter stakes or closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The drone beehive failure frames the blackout and the ending restoration, shaping the dominant stake. However, the mechanics remain abstract; the concept does not constrain Elara's tactics or force a trade-off. It is present at setup and closure but not developed through middle choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara's involuntary truthfulness is declared multiple times but never dramatized through a forced disclosure or internal conflict. It does not constrain an on-page action or create visible cost. The trait is label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "reveal" action (reading the riddle aloud at the tower peak) triggers the lights' return, providing closure participation. However, it arrives late and resolves without prior complication. The action is present in two beats (opening the matchbox, reading aloud) but does not narrow options or create friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The matchbox and riddle are present at setup (inside the lacquer box) and payoff (read aloud at closure). The riddle's mechanics—why speaking it activates the drones—remain unexplained. It does not shape Elara's attempts or force a choice with cost; it simply works when needed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The lightning collection tower is named early, houses the climactic ascent, and the "great reservoir" site anchors the closure image. The internal stairs and copper spire provide spatial detail. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices or supply a resource that alters outcome; it is a stage rather than a pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The three-day blackout timeframe is mentioned at setup but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock during Elara's actions. Time does not alter tactics or escalate pressure; the evening setting is atmospheric rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to preserve wonder in routine" is told by Mira and confirmed by Elara's internal narration at the end. It is not dramatized through a conflicted choice or visible friction between want and cost. The desire is declared rather than tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "nectar dusk" tone (honey/violet imagery) appears at setup and modulates to "violet night" at closure, providing atmospheric coherence. However, the tone does not shift with pressure or charge the final image beyond decoration. It remains a static mood rather than a dynamic element that reweights stakes.</comment>
