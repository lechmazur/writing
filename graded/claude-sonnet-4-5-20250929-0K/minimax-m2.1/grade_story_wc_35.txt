<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miriam's gift is clearly established and her motivation coherent throughout, but her interior experience remains somewhat declarative rather than contradictory. The final choice—walking into morning light after redistributing remorse—feels earned by the three-day work sequence, though the embodied cost could be sharper: "sturdy brittle quality" tells more than it shows. Micro-choices during the pavilion work (placing dishes, touching formations) advance pressure, but the protagonist's struggle reads more as skilled labor than genuine internal conflict with competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Miriam methodically works through the pavilion, and closure arrives as Earned Stasis—she emerges knowing "some memories would always taste like sorrow, and that was not a failure but a kind of endurance." Orientation anchors quickly (chef/desert/pavilion), and the three-day work sequence provides one meaningful deepening. Cost is legible in the final image ("sturdy brittle"), though it leans abstract. The lens holds without contradiction, and the RR form (endurance that forecloses the path of emptying the pavilion entirely) is valid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The coral pavilion's impossible architecture—ice formations beneath desert dunes, pools holding "liquid moonlight"—is vividly rendered and purposefully atmospheric. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the three-day sequence, and the tidal pool formations function as both setting detail and interpretive tool that constrains Miriam's method. The pavilion's weight and brittleness directly shape her final understanding, charging the closure image. Sensory selection (touch, temperature, visual coral branches) fits the POV and advances pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Miriam can lighten the pavilion's accumulated remorse—is signaled early and sustained. The work sequence provides one meaningful deepening: she shifts from absorbing emotions to counterbalancing them with prepared dishes, a tactical change that narrows options (she cannot simply empty the structure). The cost is felt in her "sturdy brittle" emergence, though the escalation reads more as patient craft than high-pressure reversal. No coincidence resolves the conflict; her particular skill enables the outcome.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Miriam's actions: endurance and partial transformation rather than erasure. The pavilion as "repository for everything the desert people had never said aloud" and her counter-offerings of reconciliation/forgiveness avoid overt moralizing. The final image—walking into morning light with the knowledge that sorrow can be borne—reweights prior material without stating a thesis. The sandpaper metaphor recurs purposefully, and the ending resists tidy closure: the pavilion "would never be empty," validating complexity over false resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and narrative distance modulates with Miriam's focus (close during touch, slightly pulled back during the three-day montage). Diction is generally controlled, though occasional phrases ("at the close of an unspoken dream") introduce mild register drift. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (scholar-chef lens reading formations and flavors). The final paragraph's "sturdy brittle quality" leans abstract but remains within the established voice. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with strong figurative density in the opening ("palimpsest of remembered moments," "emotional residue seeping into every molecule like salt into sea-weathered wood"). Sentence structure varies, and the three-day work sequence is efficiently compressed. Minor template cadence in the pavilion description ("Each formation a memory made solid, each hollow pool holding...") and slight paraphrase loop between "stored remorse" mentions in paragraph two, but these don't obscure causality or closure. Information density is high; no major scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—chef who tastes memories encounters a structure storing generational remorse—synthesizes familiar fantasy elements (synesthesia, impossible architecture) through specific craft detail (tagine, tidal pool analysis). The transformation from absorbing to counterbalancing emotions via cooking offers a fresh tactical turn. The "sandpaper" metaphor and the choice to leave the pavilion weighted but smoothed rather than empty avoid stock resolutions. Execution feels committed rather than safety-hedged, and the final image ("sturdy brittle") integrates the physical-emotional paradox cleanly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Miriam's ability to taste memories frames her arrival and her unique fitness for the task. It appears in the opening, shapes her understanding of the pavilion's emotional flavor in paragraph four, and underpins her method of preparing counter-emotional dishes. The trait drives her tactical choice (cook rather than absorb) and connects to closure (she survives what others could not). Present across all three gates with causal pressure, though the middle-beat involvement is somewhat implicit in the cooking montage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The coral pavilion is introduced early (paragraph two), touched and analyzed across multiple beats (paragraphs four and five), and its transformed state ("weight redistributed, sharp edges worn smooth") is central to closure. Miriam's three-day interaction is hands-on (touching branches, placing dishes), and the structure's brittleness directly generates her final "sturdy brittle" quality. The pavilion is irreplaceable: its unique properties (storing remorse in coral, tidal pool formations) shape both her method and the ending's meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stored remorse is seeded in paragraph two ("this place stored remorse—generations of unspoken regret"), drives Miriam's experience in paragraph four (accumulated weight pouring into her), and shapes her tactical pivot to counterbalancing meals. The concept constrains options (she cannot empty the pavilion) and charges the closure insight ("some memories would always taste like sorrow"). Present across all three gates with clear causal pressure, though the middle development is compressed into the cooking montage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Emotionally contagious through touch" is introduced in paragraph four ("emotions were emotionally contagious through touch, spreading through her nervous system") and immediately demonstrated when she touches the coral branch. The trait constrains her method (she cannot safely absorb everything) and motivates her shift to using dishes as counter-offerings. Cost is visible: the contagion makes her throat tight with grief. Present in setup and development with a clear causal role, though closure participation is more implicit in her final state.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Subsume" appears explicitly in paragraph four ("afraid that one touch would subsume them entirely") as the risk others fear and Miriam must resist. Her refusal to "absorb the remorse" (paragraph five: "she did not try to absorb the remorse—she had learned better than that") pivots the story's method, though the term itself is used passively. The action shapes one key turn but is not the primary verb of closure; "sandpaper" and "redistribute" dominate the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tidal pool analysis is seeded in paragraph three ("her trained eye analyzing tidal pool formations") and applied again in paragraph five ("she analyzed the tidal pool formations and cooked"). The method is specific and character-linked, enabling her to read the pavilion's grief patterns and select appropriate counter-dishes. Present in setup and development, though the mechanics remain somewhat abstract (how formations dictate recipes is implied, not shown). Shapes attempts but doesn't dominate closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The desert fortress after rain appears in the opening and provides spatial anchor (beneath dunes, coral pavilion), but the rain itself does minimal causal work beyond establishing atmosphere. The fortress whispers that the pavilion stores remorse, and Miriam emerges into morning light at closure. The setting provides context but doesn't pressure her choices directly; the pavilion interior does the heavier lifting. Present across beats but more backdrop than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"At the close of an unspoken dream" appears only in the final paragraph, functioning as lyric framing rather than a tracked temporal constraint. No clock or deadline shapes Miriam's tactics; the three-day duration is noted but doesn't tighten decisions. The timeframe reads as atmospheric metaphor rather than live pressure. Late arrival and ornamental use cap score despite closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to sandpaper rough memories" is introduced metaphorically in paragraph four ("She could be the sandpaper that smoothed these rough memories") and fulfilled literally in paragraph five ("Each dish...began, slowly, to smooth the rough edges"). It drives her method across the three-day sequence and is reaffirmed at closure ("its sharp edges worn smooth"). The desire is coherent and tested through labor, with visible cost in her "sturdy brittle" state. Present across all three gates with clear causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Sturdy brittle" appears explicitly only at closure ("she felt the sturdy brittle quality of someone who had been made both stronger and more fragile"), but the dual texture is foreshadowed by the pavilion's "brittle" branches and Miriam's endurance. The tone modulates from scholarly/professional (opening) to visceral (paragraph four: grief flooding her) to resolute/bittersweet (ending). The final image charges the contradictory tone effectively, though earlier tonal grounding is more implicit than patterned.</comment>
