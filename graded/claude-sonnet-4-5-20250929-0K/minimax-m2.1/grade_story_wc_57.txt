<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is coherent as a philosophically minded collector, but his internal life is often told rather than shown through contradictory impulses. The protagonist's discovery feels more like a cerebral realization than a choice with competing desires under pressure. His grandmother's gift and the "infinitely patient" trait are labeled but never constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The final moment—"already planning"—reads as resolution without foreclosing a credible alternative path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens by midpoint: Elias examines the rope, and the fulgurite glass reveals hidden patterns. Orientation is anchored within the first paragraph (golden dock, snow, fog, harbor). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (insight that reweights his life's work) with conceptual cost legible in the final image: he commits to planting seeds and weaving patterns forward. One meaningful deepening occurs when the glass reframes the knots, tightening his understanding and future intent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dock, fog, snow, and fulgurite glass ground the scene with vivid sensory anchors and coherent spatial choreography. The fulgurite's hollow channels and the rope's worn fibers are purposefully detailed and shape the final revelation. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric rather than constraining Elias's choices; the dock and weather do not alter his tactics or impose a resource limit. Micro-setting (the glass and rope) charges the closure image, lifting the score into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the weavers' philosophy—is signaled early and coheres under the accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the glass reveals the knots' hidden logic, reweighting Elias's purpose. Yet the tightening is cerebral without a live trade-off or visible price that forecloses an option on the page. The resolution is a decision to plant seeds, but no competing want or cost tests his commitment in the moment. Agency is present but feels contemplative rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge preserved through practice—emerges organically from the rope, glass, and seed-collecting without overt statement. The final image (coiling the rope, planning spring planting) offers a resonant answer to the question of inheritance. The fulgurite as "caught lightning" and the knots as "spiraling patterns" recur with shifted meaning, charging the closure. Minor weakness: the comparison "like a flower finally opening to the sun" and "patient as the tide, certain as the return of light" trend toward abstraction and platitude in the final lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance is consistent. Diction is elevated and often lyrical ("small ghosts," "oceanic hush," "memory of the storm"), which fits a philosophical collector but occasionally drifts into generic lyricism ("truth could not be rushed"). Perceptual signature is present (he sees patterns others miss) but not deeply idiosyncratic. The voice is textured yet borders on formulaic in places: "patience as the man himself," "gentle as breathing and as necessary as seed-time and harvest." No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with strong imagery (fulgurite's hollow channels, hemp worn smooth by salt). However, template cadence and ornamental metaphor accumulate: "breath creating small ghosts," "the oceanic hush settle into his bones," "patterns seemed to rearrange themselves… like a flower finally opening." The final sentence runs long with stacked dependent clauses ("already planning which ancient seeds… which patterns… patient as the tide, certain as the return") that loop thematically without advancing new information. Paraphrase loops ("preserve… preserved… preservation") and synonym churn ("patience… patient") appear across adjacent lines. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and figurative density in a non-peak but thematically central beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—seed collector decoding ancient knowledge in rope knots via fulgurite—is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms familiar inheritance-and-craft themes through the particularity of lightning glass and maritime knots. However, the emotional arc and resolution feel familiar: lone scholar achieves epiphany under atmospheric conditions, then vows to continue the tradition. The transformation test is borderline; swapping seeds for another craft and knots for another code would leave the arc largely intact. No bold structural risk elevates the design.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias appears throughout and drives the investigation. Setup: introduced in paragraph one. Development: he examines the rope and uses the glass. Payoff: the final image shows him coiling the rope and planning spring planting. However, his "philosophical seed collector" role is more observational than decisional; the key turn is a realization, not a choice that forecloses a path. He handles objects and gains knowledge but does not face a trade-off that alters tactics under pressure. Two-gate coverage (setup, payoff) + lyric reprise, but limited causal pressure: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The fulgurite glass appears in three beats: introduced in paragraph two (grandmother's gift), used in paragraph four (held above the rope to reveal patterns), and pocketed in the final paragraph. It enables the key insight and charges the closure image. Early signal +0.5, two distinct beats +0.9, causal pressure (reveals hidden logic) +1.0, closure linkage (pocketed as he plans forward) +0.9, specificity (hollow channels from lightning) +0.5. Base 3.0 +3.8 = 6.8, round up for strong payoff moment: 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "secret weavers" frame the entire investigation: introduced in paragraph two, their philosophy is decoded in paragraph four, and the final image commits to passing their methods forward. Setup +0.6, development (the knots reveal weaver logic) +0.6, payoff (Elias will weave patterns into his practice) +1.0, causal pressure (shapes his understanding and intent) +1.0. Base 3.0 +3.2 = 6.2, round down: 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Infinitely patient" is labeled in the opening ("patient as the man himself") and echoed at the end ("patient as the tide"). It does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost; no moment shows Elias choosing patience over speed with a trade-off. Setup +0.4, closure reprise +0.5, but no beat involvement or causal pressure: label-only −0.3. Base 3.0 +0.6 −0.3 = 3.3, capped at 4.6 for missing middle development: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Coax" appears explicitly in paragraph one ("truth… must be coaxed gently from the world like a reluctant seed opening") and implicitly in paragraph four when Elias uses the glass to reveal the knots' logic. Setup +0.5, development (the glass coaxes hidden patterns) +0.5, but the final turn is a realization, not a continued action of coaxing. Causal pressure is moderate +0.6, specificity (verb matches his method) +0.4. Base 3.0 +2.0 = 5.0, round up for metaphorical coherence: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Decoding knot patterns is introduced in paragraph two (grandmother's explanation), executed in paragraphs three and four (Elias examines the rope, sees spiraling sequences matching seed casings, uses the glass to rearrange the patterns), and resolved at closure (he coils the rope, understanding complete). Setup +0.7, two beats (examination, revelation) +0.9, causal pressure (the method unlocks the philosophy) +1.2, closure linkage (coiling the rope) +1.0, specificity (knots mirror seed spirals) +0.6. Base 3.0 +4.4 = 7.4, round up for strong integration: 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The golden dock under snow is anchored in the opening and remains the constant location. Setup +0.6, closure (fog consumes the dock as he finishes) +0.8, atmospheric charge (snow, fog, harbor lights soften) +0.5. However, the dock does not constrain Elias's choices or alter his tactics; it is a stage rather than a pressure. Lyric reprise (golden dock / consumed by fog) reweights the mood but not the stake. Base 3.0 +1.9 = 4.9, lifted by strong closure atmosphere to 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"As fog rolls across the harbor" opens the story and thickens through the scene; snow begins to fall and catch in Elias's hair by the end. The progression marks atmospheric time but does not impose a deadline or tighten his decision. Setup +0.5, closure presence (fog consumes the dock) +0.7, moderate causal pressure (the hush aids contemplation) +0.5. Timeframe is marked but does not alter tactics. Base 3.0 +1.7 = 4.7, rounded up for coherent arc: 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Preserving ancient methods is Elias's stated purpose (paragraph two: "philosophy of preservation") and drives the scene: he decodes the rope to understand how knowledge survives, then plans to plant seeds and weave patterns forward. Setup +0.6, development (decoding is motivated by preservation) +0.5, payoff (he commits to passing methods forward) +1.0, causal pressure +0.8. However, the desire is not dramatized with competing friction or visible cost; it is a coherent want without an on-page obstacle. Base 3.0 +2.9 = 5.9, round up for clear closure linkage: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Oceanic hush" is introduced in paragraph four ("the oceanic hush settle into his bones—the particular quiet of a world between states") and sustained through the fog's thickening and the snow's fall. Tone is coherent, modulates with the deepening fog, and charges the final image (fog consuming the dock as Elias pockets the glass). Setup mid-scene +0.3, development (tone supports contemplation) +0.5, closure linkage (hush frames the resolution) +1.0, coherence +0.6. Base 3.0 +2.4 = 5.4, lifted by strong atmospheric charge to 6.7.</comment>
