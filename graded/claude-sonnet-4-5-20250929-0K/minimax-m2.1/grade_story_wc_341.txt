<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miriam's internal state is richly embodied through the telescope, grief categorization, and gondola setting. Her motivation—proving empty spaces remember—drives observation choices. However, the emotional cloud-categorizing remains largely introspective without on-page micro-choices that foreclose paths or create visible friction between competing impulses. The final "wholeness...spooling together" feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates observational density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: grief and science "spool together"). Orientation anchors cleanly (Miriam, gondola, eleven days post-accident). Cost is felt—acceptance of the colleague's loss and the broken string—but the final image ("something she could carry forward") leans toward summary declaration rather than a concrete on-page moment that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gondola, telescope, and mountain pass are vividly anchored and purposefully deployed. The suspended platform mirrors Miriam's liminal state; the telescope filters perception through her father's legacy. Sensory detail ("dusty starlight particles," "cable connecting this floating platform") is selective and POV-filtered. The telescope and gondola constrain and enable her work, charging the closure image with spatial symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: proving absence is presence, that the sky remembers. The story deepens through cloud categorization and telescope use but lacks a discrete on-page turn or tightening that narrows options or imposes cost. Miriam's final understanding ("strings could be rewoven") arrives as epiphany rather than a hard-won choice or sacrifice. Pressure accumulates texturally without a pivot that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—grief as persistent presence, memory woven through observation—emerges from particulars (telescope, cloud categorization, "sky kept careful records"). The final image attempts resonance via "spooling together" but edges toward explicit statement ("proof that even the most devastating breaks could not sever the thread entirely"). The cloud-as-emotion metaphor is sustained without over-articulation, though the ending privileges closure summary over resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; distance modulates appropriately with Miriam's reflection. Perceptual signature is distinct (scientific observer filtering through grief). However, elevated diction ("categorizing the formations not by their scientific designations but by the emotions they seemed to embody") occasionally drifts into expository register that flattens urgency. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance shifts serve emotional beats without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear but suffers from scaffold and template cadence: "There—a towering cumulonimbus...There—a wispy cirrus...There—a gentler altostratus" repeats stems mechanically without pattern-teaching payoff. Filter-verb clusters ("noticed," "realized," "felt," "thought") dull immediacy in high-density beats. The phrase "quiet explosions of understanding accumulating like cloud layers" is figuratively muddy (explosions don't accumulate like layers). Paraphrase loop in the penultimate paragraph restates "string broke...strings could be rewoven" without added pressure. Apply −0.8 for template cadence and filter stacks, −0.3 for figurative incoherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Emotional cloud categorization offers a fresh synthesis of grief and meteorology, anchored in the brass telescope legacy. However, the "sky remembers" premise trends toward familiar metaphysical territory without a sharp, non-obvious turn. The gondola setting and aviation-pioneer backstory add specificity, but the final "spooling together" image risks abstraction. Risk-taking is modest; the piece commits to its lyric-observational mode without bold structural deviation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Miriam's role as aviation meteorologist frames her cloud observations and legitimizes the gondola workspace. She makes one key observational choice (continuing work in the gondola "because the view from land felt too solid") that alters tactics. However, no second-beat decision or on-page turn pivots stakes. Present in setup and closure participation but lacks middle development pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The brass telescope appears in three beats: opening (warm from father's hands), middle (catching light, throwing "dusty starlight"), and closure (gripped tight, anchoring her). Its inheritance from her father charges it with memory; she lifts it to observe the spiral pattern at the vanishing point. Specific use (angling, gripping) alters her stance and charges the final image. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Spooled wholeness" appears explicitly in the spiral cloud pattern ("a spool of wholeness beginning to form from scattered parts") and the final image ("wholeness of her grief and her science finally beginning to spool together"). It shapes her interpretive goal but does not constrain a tactical choice or alter a middle beat. Lyric reprise reweights the stake at closure but lacks mid-scene causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" is introduced as metaphor ("Each cloud carried its own quiet explosiveness") and expanded ("the subtle kind that quietly rearranged everything"). It describes her realizations ("quiet explosions of understanding accumulating") but remains label-only; no on-page action is enabled or constrained by this trait. Ornamental thematic echo without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Memorialize" appears late (final third: "She began to memorialize—not a funeral or a plaque, but something more permanent: a catalog of emotional weather"). It names the action she's already performing (categorizing clouds) and frames the closure goal. However, it does not introduce a new tactic or reverse prior momentum; the cataloging was ongoing. Present in closure articulation but lacks early signal and middle development pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Categorizing clouds by emotion is signaled early ("categorizing the formations not by their scientific designations but by the emotions they seemed to embody") and demonstrated in the "There—a towering cumulonimbus of grief" sequence. The method shapes her observational work and the catalog she constructs. However, the mechanics do not alter a tactical choice or impose cost; it remains an interpretive lens rather than a constraint. Present across setup and closure but lacks middle causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sky gondola is anchored immediately ("suspended between two peaks," "thin cable connecting this floating platform to the world below"). It motivates her choice to work there ("the view from land felt too solid") and embodies her liminal state. The gondola "creaked and swayed" in the closure beat, physically grounding her suspended grief. Micro-setting that constrains workspace choice and charges the final image with spatial symbolism.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After the string breaks" is anchored as "eleven days since the accident, since her colleague's research balloon had plummeted." The timeframe motivates her gondola work and the emotional stake (proving the sky remembers). However, the eleven-day span does not tighten decisions or impose a clock; it serves as backstory anchor rather than live pressure. Present in setup and thematic framing but lacks tactical urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that empty spaces remember" is stated explicitly ("This was what she had been trying to prove since the string broke") and dramatized through cloud observation and cataloging. It drives her continued gondola work and shapes the closure goal. However, no on-page friction tests this desire against competing cost or fear; she pursues it without visible sacrifice or trade-off. Stated and enacted but lacks dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Dusty starlight" appears twice: the telescope "threw it back in dusty starlight particles, transforming the ordinary cloudscape into something luminous and strange" and "The dusty starlight deepened into true evening." The tone is lyric-melancholic, coherent through observational beats, and modulates from afternoon luminosity to evening deepening. It charges the final image with temporal and perceptual shift, supporting the textural accumulation toward closure.</comment>
