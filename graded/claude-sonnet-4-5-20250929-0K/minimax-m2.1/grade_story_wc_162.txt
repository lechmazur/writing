<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract contemplation ("necessary distances," "sacred thresholds") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The character's epiphany at the terrace—that drift patterns follow flight paths—arrives through observation and pattern-reading rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. The mother remains off-page throughout, reducing relational crucible to symbol. Minor penalty for diagnostic phrasing ("featherly determined") that labels rather than dramatizes trait-driven action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) emerge by the second paragraph, meeting the test. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (reunion framed as threshold-crossing with conceptual cost), but the cost remains abstract—"necessary distance" is declared sacred without dramatizing what Elara surrenders or risks on the page. The piece teaches an Accumulative lens (grain-reading, weather codes, spiral logic) but the final image ("every boundary was also a doorway") moralizes rather than charging prior material with undeniable pressure. Causality is present but loose: the terrace "drifts" toward the village by atmospheric currents with no prior setup of this mechanic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prism terrace supplies vivid color-fracture and grain-pattern detail, and the wood-reading method briefly constrains Elara's search (she kneels, traces knots). However, spatial choreography blurs—how the terrace drifts, its scale, and the peninsula geography remain vague. The final village materializes "like a diagram" without prior anchoring of distance or terrain. The setting does not pressure a choice at closure; Elara simply steps off when the village appears.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding her mother—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal. Elara observes, intuits, and then steps toward the village without facing a trade-off or obstacle that narrows options. The "sacred threshold" is declared rather than tested: no moment forces her to choose between competing goods or costs. The Accumulative lens allows pressure to build through reflection, but the final step feels unopposed, and the reunion occurs without visible sacrifice or transformation that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (thresholds, boundaries as invitations, patterns beneath chaos) is stated overtly in the final two paragraphs rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The closing line—"every boundary was also a doorway, and every distance was simply an invitation to move closer"—moralizes instead of offering a resonant image. Grain-reading and weather codes supply motif, but recurrence does not constrain choice or charge closure; they remain decorative. The piece gestures toward earned wisdom but delivers abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices grain, light refraction, pressure lines—but diction drifts into elevated register ("featherly determined," "fractured hush") that reads ornamental rather than character-rooted. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue on the page to assess. Psychic distance holds, though the final paragraph's thematic summary ("understanding that the necessary distance…") feels like authorial intrusion rather than Elara's immediate thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language clusters densely without clear payoff: "crooked rivers," "prism light," "fractured hush," "diagram drawn in the new weather." Mixed metaphor in paragraph six: terrace "moving toward" the village "by currents that followed flight paths" conflates water, air, and architecture without coherent vehicle. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph: parallel "that [clause]" constructions stack without variation. The scaffold phrase "the only maze that mattered" and synonym loop ("necessary distances" / "sacred threshold" / "boundary") dull closure momentum. No paraphrase loops severe enough to trigger full deduction, but density without clarity lowers propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Core premise (atmospheric butterfly effect reshaping weather and architecture) is imaginative, but execution leans on abstract concepts ("necessary distances," "sacred thresholds") rather than grounded transformation. The grain-reading method and weather-code logbook supply specificity, yet they resolve into metaphor without dramatized consequence. The reunion scene offers no fresh turn; the mother's compass "pointed not north but toward the next transformation" reads as placeholder novelty. Risk-taking in setting and frame does not fully cohere with character stakes, leaving the piece conceptually ambitious but emotionally generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and frames the quest, but her agency is limited to observation and pattern-reading until the final step. The child's "featherly determined" stance and intuition of distances supply trait color, yet no on-page choice alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. She decides to step off the terrace only after the village appears, making the decision reactive rather than a causal turn. Setup and closure gates met; middle development weak (no choice that narrows options). Score reflects functional presence without decisive pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The logbook appears in paragraph two (mother's obsession), returns in paragraph five (Elara realizes codes are coordinates), and is implied at closure ("left the logbook here deliberately"). However, the object is never handled or opened on the page; Elara intuits its meaning without dramatized interaction. The revelation that weather codes = coordinates is told in summary rather than shown through decoding. Setup and payoff gates met; middle interaction absent. Caps at 4.6 for no hands-on middle beat; lyric reprise (deliberate placement) lifts slightly into mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" is named early (paragraph three) and recurs throughout as thematic refrain, shaping Elara's internal stance ("knowing exactly how far she could push"). At closure it is restated: "the necessary distance between them had always been the point." However, the concept is declared rather than dramatized—no on-page moment shows Elara testing or respecting a boundary with visible consequence. Setup and closure gates met; middle constraint weak. Lyric resonance present but cost absent; score in low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" appears twice as a label (opening line, paragraph six) but never constrains or enables a specific action with cost. The trait colors voice but does not drive a choice or trade-off. Ornamental use; no middle development or closure linkage beyond repeated mention. Late reappearance (paragraph six, ~70% mark) does not reshape prior material. Score reflects label-only presence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Intuit" is named in paragraph three (Elara "had stopped intuiting her mother's location") and paragraph five ("some truths could only be intuited"). The terrace-drift realization (paragraph five) is framed as intuition earned through patience. However, the action is passive perception rather than a turning choice, and the method overlaps with "analyzing grain" (Element F). Setup and thematic closure gates met; causal middle turn weak. Score reflects theme-level presence without decisive pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Grain analysis is introduced in paragraph four (mother's teaching, Elara kneels and traces knots) and motivates the drift-pattern insight in paragraph five. The method shapes the middle beat (she discovers the terrace is moving) and primes closure (wood "would tell her what words couldn't"). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. However, the method does not constrain a later choice—Elara simply steps off when the village appears—so causal pressure is moderate. Score reflects solid integration across beats with modest stakes impact.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The terrace is named in the title and opening line, supplies the prism-light detail, and serves as the platform for grain-reading. It drifts toward the village, enabling the reunion. However, the drift mechanic is introduced late (paragraph five, ~60% mark) without prior cue, and the terrace does not constrain a choice—Elara observes until the village appears, then steps off. Setup and closure gates met; middle constraint weak. Score reflects functional but passive setting role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Three months ago" anchors the butterfly effect in paragraph two, and "after the butterfly effect" frames the world state. However, time does not tighten decisions on the page—Elara spends an unspecified duration observing, and the village's appearance is coincidental rather than deadline-driven. Setup gate met; middle and closure urgency absent. Score reflects contextual presence without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The question "why some thresholds feel sacred" is introduced in paragraph two (mother's obsession) and restated at closure ("the sacred threshold"). Elara's search is motivated by this curiosity, but the desire is never dramatized in conflict with a competing want or cost. She reflects on thresholds but does not test one that risks something tangible. Setup and thematic closure gates met; middle friction absent. Score reflects told motivation without on-page stakes test.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" appears in the final approach to the village and colors the atmospheric setting ("new weather," "uncharted codes," "unfamiliar currents"). Tone is quiet and contemplative throughout, modulating only slightly when Elara realizes the drift pattern. The final image sustains the tone but does not sharpen it with new pressure. Setup and closure gates met; middle modulation modest. Score reflects coherent but static mood that does not charge the ending with additional weight.</comment>
