<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena's interior life relies heavily on abstract epiphany ("the first stirring of something she could not name," "bewitch through a method she could not explain") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The seventeen-year backstory and restoration expertise are told rather than dramatized through on-page choice. The final stance—"completing a conversation"—feels asserted rather than earned by prior causal decisions that narrow options. No visible trade-off or foreclosed path anchors the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when adequately within the first third. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: Elena accepts the garden's mystery rather than controlling restoration), but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible—no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift demonstrates what she has surrendered. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (sound layering, nested awakenings motif), which the ending honors, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs (nickel discovery shifts her relationship to the work), meeting the minimum for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden's parabolic curves and seven-echo mechanism are vivid and specific. The garden constrains her work rhythm ("timing her brushwork to the echoes") and the nickel's presence alters the acoustics, directly affecting her perception. The final image charges the space ("the garden's reflected sound washed over her, patient and playful"), integrating setting with closure. Spatial choreography (pool's edge, fountain, mortar, terraced walls) remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elena's certainty about restoration versus the garden's mystery—is signaled early and tightens once (nickel discovery shifts her approach). However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on atmospheric intensification ("echoes seemed to pool," "mural was beginning to answer") rather than a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The ending crystallizes her stance but does not dramatize a trade-off or foreclosed path on the page. One meaningful deepening is present but pressure does not visibly force a decision with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—exchange of certainty for curiosity, listening as communion—emerges through the garden's acoustics and the carved musician's posture. The hobo nickel and mural musicians create a non-literal motif that avoids overt statement. However, the final paragraph edges toward direct thesis: "Some truths are not found in answers but in the willingness to exchange certainty for curiosity" feels closer to summary than resonant image. The nested awakenings concept charges the middle but the ending reweights prior material only moderately.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (Elena notices acoustic detail, fresco damage) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-rooted: "bewitch through a method she could not explain," "nested awakenings," "methodically infinite." Psychic distance modulates purposefully during reflection. Vocabulary remains mostly within a restorer's plausible lexicon, though a few constructions ("the acoustics turning her curiosity into something more like recognition") read as imposed rather than emerging from her voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Two artifacts touch mid-story beats: "a轮" (likely a character encoding error for "skull" or similar) appears mid-paragraph three, breaking immersion; "bewitch" as a verb in "felt herself bewitch through a method" reads as non-idiomatic without pattern-teaching. The phrase "methodically infinite" in the final paragraph stacks abstract modifiers. Paraphrase loop appears in paragraph five: "She understood now why the garden had been built this way, why the walls curved just so" unpacks the same realization across two clauses without added pressure. These issues lower momentum but do not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sound wave garden premise and hobo nickel's acoustic magnetism offer a fresh synthesis. However, the "restorer discovers mystical communion through found object" frame is recognizable and the story does not fully transform it through unexpected causal choices or non-obvious moral calculus. The nested awakenings motif is purposeful but somewhat abstract. Emotional specificity is moderate; the final stance feels more conceptual than lived. The piece commits to its premise but opts for atmospheric wonder over bold risk at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena is present throughout and her occupation frames the setting. She makes one key choice—keeping the nickel—that shifts her perception. However, most beats are observational (noticing echoes, cleaning the coin, sitting at the pool's edge) rather than decisions that alter tactics under pressure. The ending asserts she is "completing a conversation" but does not dramatize a choice with visible cost. Meets two gates (setup, payoff via presence in final image) but lacks middle development through a constrained decision. Early signal +0.6, one beat involvement +0.4, closure linkage (present but not causally active) +0.4, swappability −0.6 (any skilled artisan could observe similarly), ornamental in climax −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hobo nickel appears in three beats: discovery (week three), acoustic alteration (next morning), and final image (rests in her palm). It is handled on the page and its carved musician motif seeds the mural-listening theme. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose cost; Elena's decision to keep it is uncontested and her later actions do not depend on its presence. Strong early–final reprise reweights the listening motif. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (present, moderately charged) +0.9, specificity (carved detail matters thematically) +0.5, causal pressure (minimal; it alters perception but not tactics) +0.2, cost connection (absent) 0, swappability (any talisman could serve similar thematic role) −0.6, late first appearance (week three, past first third) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Nested awakenings are labeled explicitly in paragraph five ("The nested awakenings she experienced came one within another") and described as a sequence (sound, pattern, communion) but not dramatized through choices that alter options. The concept functions as thematic claim rather than stake-shaping force. It does not constrain tactics or create friction. Present in closure paragraph as motif only. Setup (absent until paragraph five, past midpoint) 0, one beat (paragraph five reflection) +0.4, closure linkage (label-only mention) +0.2, ornamental use (no action pressure) −0.8, swappability (any spiritual awakening frame could replace it) −0.7, summary-only −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Methodically playful" is stated in paragraph two ("She approached her work methodically playful, as she always did") and echoed in the final line ("patient and playful, methodically infinite") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. Cataloging damage and mixing pigments are methodical; timing brushwork to echoes could be playful, but no trade-off or friction arises from this trait. It remains a label rather than a visible force. Setup +0.5, closure linkage (echo in final line) +0.4, label-only trait −0.8, no causal pressure 0, swappability (any artisan temperament could fit) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Bewitch" appears once in paragraph five ("she felt herself bewitch through a method she could not explain") as passive internal state, not as an action Elena performs. The verb is non-idiomatic in this construction and does not drive a turn or redefine options. No beat traces causally to this moment. Present but ornamental. One mention (passive, unclear agency) +0.1, no beat involvement 0, no closure linkage 0, summary/passive use −0.6, swappability (could be "entranced," "transformed," etc.) −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Reflected sound is introduced early (paragraph two: seven echoes, garden's pulse) and shapes two beats: Elena times her brushwork to echoes (paragraph two) and the coin draws echoes (paragraph four). The mechanics are signaled and matter to her perception. However, the method does not constrain a choice with cost or shape the ending's options; it remains atmospheric. Setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (alters perception, not tactics) +0.3, closure linkage (present in final image: "the garden's reflected sound washed over her") +0.7, specificity (parabolic curves, seven echoes) +0.6, cost connection (absent) 0, swappability (any sensory phenomenon could serve similar role) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is introduced in the opening sentence, its parabolic curves and acoustic properties detailed in paragraph two, and it directly alters Elena's work rhythm (paragraph two) and the nickel's effect (paragraph four). The setting is irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the story's logic. It charges the final image and provides the environment through which all key beats operate. Setup +0.8, three beats (introduction, work rhythm, nickel acoustics) +1.4, causal pressure (enables and constrains perception and method) +1.2, closure linkage (active in final image) +1.4, specificity (parabolic design, terraced stone, seven echoes) +0.8, cost connection (space's mystery forces her stance shift) +0.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"In the pause between question and reply" is stated as a temporal frame in paragraph five but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. No clock pressures Elena's moves; the story unfolds across weeks with vague markers ("third week," "next morning," "afternoon light"). The pause functions as metaphor rather than lived constraint. One mention (paragraph five) +0.2, closure linkage (metaphorical only) +0.1, ornamental use (no tactical pressure) −0.7, swappability (any reflective interlude could replace it) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The desire to exchange certainty for curiosity is stated explicitly in paragraph five and implicit in Elena's shift from cataloging damage to embracing mystery. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; no on-page friction shows her resisting or paying a cost for this exchange. It shapes the thematic arc but does not drive a beat with visible trade-off. Setup (implicit in opening; explicit at midpoint) +0.5, one beat (paragraph five reflection) +0.4, closure linkage (present in final stance) +0.5, told rather than dramatized friction −0.7, swappability (any intellectual-to-intuitive arc could serve) −0.5.</comment>
