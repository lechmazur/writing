<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority carries specificity—her chess-tutor lens filters perception, her fidgeting hands serve character and plot. The past failure (nobleman's son) is concrete enough to motivate present stakes. However, the final epiphany ("permission to winnow through the accusations") arrives quickly after she sits; the arc from exile to self-forgiveness compresses without visible internal contradiction or struggle in the present scene. Embodied emotion is present but the therapeutic framing ("permission," "forgive herself") edges toward label-speak at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira completes the tapestry work and achieves self-forgiveness, walking with "fierce repose." Orientation is clean early (frozen village, thunder lull, chess tutor). The story accumulates symbolic weight (tapestry border, platinum labyrinth, frozen villagers resuming motion) and the final image reweights her exile as permission. Cost is felt but oblique—she carries the folded tapestry and the quiet mind, yet no prior option is visibly foreclosed on the page; the cost reads more as conceptual release than renunciation. One meaningful deepening occurs when she decodes the border and reinterprets her failure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen village with suspended merchants and children creates vivid situational constraint. The platinum labyrinth is rendered with light-capturing detail and spatial placement. The tapestry's "woven hush" and frayed threads are tactile and focal. Sensory selection (breath curls, frozen leaves, rain drops) modulates with the thunder lull's pacing. The labyrinth's gleaming presence charges the final paragraph, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment/object constrain choice or charge the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: self-forgiveness for past pedagogical failure. The lull and tapestry discovery provide one meaningful tightening when Mira begins decoding the border threads. Thunder resuming and villagers moving supply external escalation that mirrors her internal shift. Agency is present—she chooses to approach the labyrinth, decode the tapestry—but the work itself is contemplative rather than conflicted; no live option is tested or refused on the page. The cost is emotional release rather than a visible trade-off, fitting the accumulative lens but limiting band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (self-forgiveness, reframing failure as integrity) emerges from the tapestry's border imagery and Mira's pedagogical choice. The final line—"no longer exiled from herself"—reweights the opening exile without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the labyrinth's avoidance-then-approach and the "fierce repose" motif. The tutor-as-truth-winnower conceit is specific. Minor dock: "permission to winnow through the accusations" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary rather than pure image, though the folded tapestry and walking-through-thunder closure recover resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and voice-particular: "what they called her failure," "the price of teaching someone that some pieces were worth more than survival." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during tapestry work, wider for village tableau). No head-hopping. Vocabulary ("winnowed," "fierce repose") fits an educated, exiled tutor. Compression at closure (final paragraph shifts rapidly from tapestry completion to walking) is minor but noticeable; the reflective summary ("she had come here to forgive herself") briefly tells what the scene has been showing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is mostly clean with varied syntax and vivid imagery ("amber of stopped time," "woven hush"). Information density is high in the opening. Minor scaffold: "The first drops of rain began to fall as the villagers slowly, hesitantly, began to move again" uses passive phrasing and hedging adverbs where sharper construction would tighten. The phrase "fidgets productively habit" in paragraph four is a typo or grammatical slip ("productively" should likely be "productive" or the sentence restructured). No major loops or template cadence, but closure paragraph compresses multiple beats (finishing tapestry, rising, understanding exile, forgiving self, walking) in summary fashion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The chess-tutor/tapestry-decoding synthesis is specific and non-obvious; the frozen-village lull provides fresh atmospheric constraint. "Fierce repose" as tonal anchor is distinctive. However, the exile-leads-to-self-discovery arc and the found-object-that-tells-your-story device are familiar templates. The story transforms them through the tutor's particular lens and the labyrinth/tapestry pairing, but the emotional resolution (external permission enabling internal forgiveness) follows a well-trodden path. Risk is present in the accumulative structure and quiet ending, earning mid-high range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira (exiled chess tutor) is present throughout, drives the approach to the labyrinth, decodes the tapestry, and achieves the closure shift. Her chess-tutor lens filters perception and past choices. She appears in setup, middle (decoding), and ending (walking with repose). Her decision to decode the frayed threads narrows options and enables the self-forgiveness closure. Specific cost: carrying the folded tapestry and relinquishing self-accusation. Strong causal role across all three beats; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth appears early (paragraph 3) and at closure (penultimate paragraph: "gleamed beside her" and final: implicit backdrop). Mira avoids it since arrival, then approaches it, sits near its base. However, she never handles, enters, or uses it; the tapestry on the bench becomes the active object. The labyrinth's presence charges the setting and reflects sky/patterns, but its function is atmospheric rather than causal. Two mentions, purposeful early signal, closure presence, but no middle development or physical interaction. Lyric reprise qualification applies (early seed, final charge) but the tapestry does the plot work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Woven hush" appears explicitly in the tapestry description and implicitly governs tone (stillness, lull, sacred quiet). The concept shapes Mira's method (quiet decoding vs. loud confrontation) and the story's accumulative structure. It does not create a decision fork or tighten stakes on the page, functioning more as thematic atmosphere. Present in setup (tapestry's "woven hush"), middle (silent work), and ending (quiet mind, still hands). Moderate integration: colors all beats but does not force a specific choice or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Fidgets productively" is signaled early ("habit she had never quite shed—always twisting, always arranging") and actualized in the middle when her hands decode the tapestry border thread by thread. The trait enables the key action (winnowing frayed threads) and culminates in closure: "her hands finally still." Setup, development (fidgeting becomes productive decoding), and payoff (stillness as resolution) all present. The attribute constrains her method and charges the final image. Specific cost: the fidget habit must end for repose to arrive. Strong causal role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Winnow" is the core verb: Mira winnows the tapestry's border thread by thread, separating truth from decorative falsehood, and the penultimate paragraph explicitly states she "winnowed through the accusations until she found the truth beneath." The action shapes the middle beat (decoding work) and the thematic closure (self-forgiveness as discernment). Early metaphoric signal (chess tutor selecting essential moves), literal middle execution, thematic payoff. Irreplaceable: swapping "decode" or "unravel" would lose the grain-separation, truth-extraction specificity. Strong closure linkage and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border" is the literal method Mira uses to achieve insight. Signaled when she discovers the tapestry (paragraph 4), executed in paragraph 5 ("winnowed through the tapestry's border thread by thread, decoding the frayed edges"), and referenced at closure ("decoding the frayed threads of someone else's tapestry"). The mechanics matter: frayed = narrative gaps, border = marginal truth, thread-by-thread = patient discernment. Setup, development, payoff all present. The method is irreplaceable and directly enables the self-forgiveness closure. High integration across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Time-frozen village is established early (paragraph 2: merchants mid-bargain, children suspended in chase, "caught in this stillness for decades") and directly pressures the ending when the lull breaks and villagers resume motion, timing Mira's own unfreezing. The setting provides the labyrinth, the bench, the frozen leaves—micro-setting elements Mira uses. The village's thaw mirrors and validates her internal shift. Setup, middle (static backdrop for her work), and payoff (movement resumes as she completes decoding). The setting constrains her isolation and charges the closure image (walking through moving villagers). Strong causal and thematic role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"During the lull of distant thunder" frames the entire story: opening ("distant thunder rumbled… then quieted to create a lull"), middle (thunder holds its breath), and ending (thunder resumes, rain falls, villagers move). The lull creates a sacred pause that enables Mira's work and charges the closure when it breaks. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions with urgency—Mira works at her own pace; the lull's end arrives when her work is done, reading slightly coincidental. Setup and payoff strong; development (live clock altering tactics) weaker. Moderate causal role; the thunder shift is more symbolic than pressuring.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To forgive oneself for past mistakes" is the explicit motivation stated in the penultimate paragraph ("She had come here to forgive herself") and earned through the decoding work. The past mistake (nobleman's son, court trial, exile) is concrete and present in her interiority from the opening. The tapestry reveals "beneath the tutor's apparent failure was the fierce repose of someone who had given a student the most valuable lesson." The motivation drives her approach to the labyrinth, her decoding choices, and the closure (walking "no longer exiled from herself"). Friction between self-accusation and emerging self-acceptance visible in the border imagery. Strong setup, development, and payoff with felt cost (relinquishing exile identity).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Fierce repose" is named twice: paragraph 5 ("fierce repose of someone who had given a student the most valuable lesson") and the final sentence ("walked through it with fierce repose"). The tone—stillness holding intensity—governs the entire piece: suspended village, quiet decoding, controlled interiority, then the calm-amid-thunder ending. Coherent through turns. The oxymoron charges the final image by fusing Mira's pedagogical conviction (fierce) with her achieved peace (repose). However, the tone is more static than modulating; it is announced mid-story and held rather than built dynamically. Strong closure linkage and specificity; moderate tonal arc.</comment>
