<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is characterized primarily through aesthetic observation and proclaimed certainty rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interior experience relies heavily on abstract declarations ("tremor of certainty," "aesthetically driven heart") without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The walking-through constitutes minimal agency—no live options are foreclosed, no visible cost paid beyond the act itself. Motivation remains a told condition rather than a dramatized conflict between competing desires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors are present early (cobalt atrium, frozen lake, cloud-shadow poet). The piece attempts closure through Resonant Reconfiguration (the poet crosses what was forbidden and gains "settled knowledge"), but the cost remains asserted rather than legible on the page—no visible price, forfeiture, or tactical constraint appears in the final image. The "dissolution" operates as metaphor without dramatized consequence, weakening the closure effect under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, humming quartz colonnade, and stone floor create vivid spatial grounding with purposeful sensory detail (cobalt light refracting, hum resonating through bones). Sensory selection reflects the poet's aesthetic priorities. However, the environment never materially constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome—it remains atmospheric backdrop. The frozen lake's reflection in the final paragraph charges the image without enabling tactical change, sufficient for mid-6s but shy of the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—crossing the sacred colonnade—is signaled early but remains abstract. The narrative presents walking through as inevitable discovery rather than escalating pressure: each column "seems to draw closer," boundaries "dissolve like morning frost," with no resistance, trade-off, or credible obstacle. The tremor of certainty functions as authorial guarantee, eliminating genuine stakes. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the proclaimed transformation lacks visible cost, preventing escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—boundaries as perceptual constructs dissolved by courage—emerges clearly from the colonnade crossing. The piece resists overt moralizing in most beats, allowing image and action to carry meaning. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("some walls exist only to be dissolved by those brave enough") and the closure image restates rather than reweights prior material. The cloud-shadow motif recurs but does not shift meaning between beginning and end, limiting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited with a consistent perceptual signature filtering the atrium through aesthetic observation. Diction carries purposeful elevation ("lantern-moth hush," "cloud-shadow verses") that fits the poet's voice. However, register drifts into abstraction during peak moments ("dissolution of the invisible walls that had divided not territory but perception itself") where embodied immediacy would serve pressure better. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates controlled rhythm and vivid figurative language ("winter light broke against the frozen lake like fractured glass scattered across silver water"). Clarity remains high with no pronoun confusion or tense slips. However, multiple beats loop conceptually: "boundaries dissolve" is paraphrased across columns two, three, and the ending without new pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle section ("She approached...She stopped...She did not know"), and elevated diction in peak beats ("tremor of certainty" repeated thrice) creates minor register drift. Information density suffers from ornamental restatement where compression would sharpen momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—a poet crossing newly accessible sacred ground—follows a familiar template of forbidden-threshold-crossed without fresh transformation. The cloud-shadow motif provides a specific occupation but does not alter the arc's emotional or moral calculus in a non-obvious way. Execution is competent with vivid atmospheric detail, yet the core insight (walls are perceptual, courage dissolves them) resolves into a platitude. The transformation test fails: swapping "cloud-shadow poet" for another artist and "quartz colonnade" for another forbidden site leaves the arc unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The cloud-shadow poet is present throughout and frames perception, but her choices do not create key turns—she walks forward because the ban has lifted and her certainty compels her. Observation dominates; the paraphrasing and verse-reciting function as atmospheric texture rather than decisions that alter tactics or outcomes. No live option is foreclosed by a choice she makes on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The humming quartz colonnade is handled across multiple beats (first column palm-press, third column understanding, colonnade's heart turn). It appears in the setup, middle development, and payoff, and its hum charges the final image. However, its use remains largely static description—the columns encourage rather than constrain, and their crystalline properties do not impose a cost or enable a specific tactic. The element shapes atmosphere more than choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The tremor of certainty appears in setup (paragraph one), mid-development ("pulsed again in her chest"), and transformation to "settled knowledge" at closure. It orients the protagonist's stance but does not constrain options or create friction—it guarantees success rather than complicating it. The concept functions as thematic echo rather than dramatized pressure that narrows tactics, capping it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Aesthetically driven appears as a label in two beats ("aesthetically driven artist," "aesthetically driven heart") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The trait colors perception (filtering the atrium through beauty) without creating a trade-off—no moment where aesthetic priority forces a difficult choice or forecloses a safer path. Label-only mention without dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase appears in setup (mental note of the proclamation) and drives the column-three beat where reciting transformed verses "loosened another layer of the ancient prohibition." The action shapes one key turn (the method of crossing) and links to closure when the poet carries "first lines of a new poem." However, the paraphrasing could be swapped for another verbal/mental act (meditation, singing) with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Through dissolving boundaries is signaled in setup (the proclamation as "dissolution of invisible walls"), mechanics appear in the column-three beat ("method through dissolving boundaries was not physical but perceptual"), and the method shapes the crossing itself. It participates in closure when boundaries "dissolved at her approach." The method constrains tactics (must be perceptual shift, not force) and is present across setup, development, and payoff, though its effect remains abstract rather than imposing a visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium by a frozen lake anchors all action, appears in setup, supplies sensory resources (humming columns, cobalt light, frozen lake reflection), and charges the final image when "the frozen lake...caught the humming and held it, reflecting the cobalt light in patterns." The setting does not constrain a choice (the poet walks freely) but its atmospheric properties accumulate and reweight the closure image. Present in setup, middle, and payoff with moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>After the ban lifts appears in setup ("After the ban lifts, she had written") and orients the story's premise, but time exerts no pressure on tactics—no clock tightens decisions, no urgency shapes the crossing. The timeframe is static backdrop rather than a live constraint. Setup present; middle development and payoff absent. Mentioned but not dramatized as pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>To stride through boundaries once thought sacred is declared in setup, drives the colonnade approach, and is fulfilled in the crossing itself. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized with conflicting wants—no friction between desire and cost, no competing impulse. The poet's certainty removes ambiguity, making the stride inevitable rather than earned through struggle. Functional presence across beats but low conflict integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lantern-moth hush appears explicitly once ("lantern-moth hush of the atrium's sacred stillness") and the tone of quiet reverence modulates consistently through the piece without becoming static. The hush charges the final standing moment when silence and humming interweave. Tone supports pressure without overt shifts but does not escalate with stakes. Coherent and purposeful, present in setup and payoff with moderate integration in middle beats.</comment>
