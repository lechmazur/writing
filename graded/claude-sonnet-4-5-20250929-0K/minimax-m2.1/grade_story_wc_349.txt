<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The vendor's motivation to find "the place where stories begin" is present but never contested or complicated by on-page pressure. Her interior monologue remains abstract and exploratory throughout ("she understood now," "she had been drawn here") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that foreclose options. The final "purpose" arrives as a meditative epiphany rather than a decision with visible cost. No secondary character applies immediate pressure, leaving the piece a solitary contemplation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through repeated imagery (bottles, moonlight, absence) and achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when the vendor reframes her work from selling blank slates to "illuminating the gaps." Orientation anchors who and where by ~100 words. The cost, however, is conceptual rather than felt—her understanding deepens, but no prior option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The reconfiguration charges the premise but the price remains oblique, capping the closure effect in mid-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glass orchard library is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: crystalline branches, obsidian trunk, frosted quartz counter, bottled moonlight casting prismatic shadows. These elements constrain the vendor's movement and perception throughout. The bottles function as micro-setting, present in multiple beats and reweighted at closure when she arranges three on the counter. The swirling sea of clouds and perpetual twilight charge the final image of impossibility and potential.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the nature of story origins—is signaled early but never tightens into a forced choice or visible trade-off. The vendor moves through discovery without obstacle; her epiphany arrives through contemplation rather than agency under pressure. No reversal narrows options, and the "lull of opening day" remains atmospheric rather than a ticking constraint. The piece deepens meaning but does not escalate cost, leaving pressure coherent yet static.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—stories defined by their absences—emerges organically from concrete images (empty bottles, dissolving manuscripts, gaps between intention and articulation) without overt statement until the final reflection. The bottled moonlight and fragmentation motifs recur with shifting valence, and the closing image of "mindful scattering of silences" reweights earlier material. However, the final two paragraphs edge toward thematic summary ("every story was defined not by its words but by the mindful scattering of its silences"), slightly undercutting the resonance built through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice sustains a lyric, meditative register with purposeful compression ("Incise by quantifying absence") and patterned diction. Distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the raw materials of creation, pieces of potential narratives held in suspended animation") that slightly exceeds the vendor's practical idiom under contemplative pressure. Perceptual signature is present—she notices gaps, absences, negative space—but rhythmic modulation under pressure is limited; the cadence remains uniform throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere or thematic layering. Sentence openings vary, and figurative language (prismatic shadows, glimmering parole) serves the concept without overwhelming. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Each empty bottle… represented a story someone had chosen not to tell" is restated as "These were not complete works but the raw materials of creation." The phrase "waiting to be born" / "waiting for someone to give them shape" recurs with minimal variance. Template cadence in the opening paragraphs ("She had traveled… She set down… She moved…") slightly dulls momentum. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise—a metaphysical library where stories exist before language—offers a lyric twist on writerly reflection. The "quantifying absence" method is conceptually specific. However, the piece does not transform familiar territory (the writer seeking inspiration, the mystical library) through grounded conflict or non-obvious moral calculus. The vendor's journey remains contemplative and frictionless, with no bold structural risk or earned reversal. The synthesis is elegant but predictable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character present throughout; her profession seeds expectation and her final understanding reframes her work. However, she makes no on-page choice that narrows options or incurs visible cost. Her actions are observational and methodical (arranging samples, moving through aisles, selecting bottles) without decision-driven turns. Missing middle development and closure agency; lyric reprise lifts slightly but cannot reach higher bands without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Bottled moonlight appears in setup, recurs in at least three beats (decorative rows, prismatic shadows, glowing shelf, counter arrangement), and is present in the closing image. It constrains her perception and charges the final understanding of "visual parole." However, its mechanics remain atmospheric; the vendor does not handle or use the bottles to alter tactics under pressure. Strong setup and payoff; moderate beat involvement and specificity; missing direct causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Glimmering parole" appears once in the middle third ("the visible language of stories not yet spoken") and is echoed in "visual parole" at the counter. It functions as a thematic label for the bottled light's potential meaning but does not shape on-page stakes or alter the vendor's tactics. Late arrival, ornamental use, and swappability (could be "nascent language" or similar) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Mindfully scattered" appears as abstract description ("her attention scattered across dozens of points simultaneously") and again in the final line as thematic closure. It does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait is told rather than dramatized through a trade-off (e.g., missing a detail due to divided focus). Label-only use and late thematic echo without middle development or causal pressure limit integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Incise" appears once in an expository passage ("Incise by quantifying absence") as part of her method but is never dramatized as a physical or tactical action. No key turn traces to this verb; it could be replaced with "measure," "trace," or "map" with no structural change. Summary-only use, no beat involvement, no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Quantifying absence" is signaled in the first third, explained in expository reflection, and echoed in the closing understanding. However, the method's mechanics never matter on the page; the vendor does not measure, count, or catalog in a way that alters her choices or the outcome. The method functions as thematic concept rather than dramatized means. Setup present, closure echo, but missing middle causal development and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The glass orchard library is anchored early, recurs across all major beats (aisles, branches, shelves, counter), and is present in the closing image. Its impossible architecture (floating on clouds, glass growing from obsidian) constrains her perception and supplies the bottles she arranges. The setting's nursery function directly shapes her final understanding. Strong setup, beat involvement, closure linkage, and irreplaceability; moderate causal pressure (no forced choice via environment).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"The lull on the store's very first opening day" is signaled in the opening and echoed twice ("lull of opening day meant vacancy, abundance of absence"; "The lull would end, customers would arrive"). It provides atmospheric justification for solitude and thematic resonance (vacancy = potential) but does not tighten decisions or create a ticking clock. Setup and thematic payoff present; missing middle causal pressure and tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the place where stories begin" is established in the first paragraph and resolved in the final epiphany ("she had found her purpose"). However, it is never dramatized through conflicted choice or visible friction between want and cost. The vendor's journey is exploratory and frictionless. Setup and closure participation present; missing middle friction and on-page trade-off that would lift into higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Integrated fragmentation" is coherent throughout: dissolving manuscripts, scattered attention, prismatic light, fragmented collection. The tone modulates slightly from observation to understanding but remains meditative and lyric. The fragmentation charges the final image (moonlight moving between three bottles, visual parole shimmering). Setup, development via recurring motif, and closure participation all present; moderate causal linkage and cost visibility prevent higher scoring.</comment>
