<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is densely rendered with concrete physical anchors (static electricity, paper texture) and her micro-choices show professional methodology translating to personal risk. The grief moment embodies contradiction—she maintains "affectionate detachment" even as sorrow "rearranges the furniture of her interior world"—yet the final surrender ("she already knew what she would do next") reverts to comfortable professional stance without visible cost that forecloses a path. The transformation feels observed rather than suffered; no prior option is closed by her epiphany about "whole lies," only suspended, which reads as Earned Stasis but the price remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, what by first paragraph). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the compound's completion supplies the inciting pressure, the scent triggers immersion, and the final realization about "half truths had always been whole lies" reweights her professional stance. Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing with cost implied in "necessary ones, the kind that allowed people to feel what they needed to feel when the raw truth was too much to bear"—she accepts complicity. One tightening (compound test → grief subsumption → acceptance of her method's moral cost) is sufficient at this length, but the cost reads more philosophical than visceral, keeping this out of the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The amber grotto is vivid ("honeyed whiskey," "ethanol and old secrets") and the blotter petal's dampness and static charge become tactile anchors. Micro-setting qualifies: the workbench, the paper, the olfactory trigger all constrain her method and charge the transformation beat. Dusk deepening to night tracks the emotional arc. The compound's scent description ("amber and grief, a melancholy that tasted of autumn leaves and letters never sent") is lush but does not materially alter a present choice; it mostly enables introspection, so setting pressures mood more than tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: will the compound work, and will Vera risk genuine feeling to validate it? The transformation beat deepens pressure—she must experience what she designed for others—and her decision to inhale represents agency with risk. The grief "subsumed her gently" and she "exhaled slowly, releasing" it, which closes the cycle, but no live alternative is visibly foreclosed; she returns to "the work was never finished, only suspended." Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful intensification suffices, and the cost is conceptual (accepting her method's moral ambiguity), placing this in the 7–8 range but shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—truth versus useful fiction, the ethics of manufactured empathy—emerges through concrete action (compound design, self-testing, the static-reading method) rather than declaration until the final beat. The realization "her half truths had always been whole lies if she was honest, but useful ones, necessary ones" reweights her professional ethos without moralizing; the final image (exhale, suspension of work) offers a resonant non-literal answer. The piece resists tidy resolution and invites ambiguity about whether her "affectionate detachment" is compassion or evasion. Minor slip: "what people needed was not absolute honesty but useful fiction" leans slightly didactic mid-paragraph, nudging this below 8.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Vera's professional vocabulary ("compound," "olfactory channels," "fusion of her analytical insight"), her method of reading static electricity, and her self-aware reflections create a coherent voice. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—zooms into sensory immersion during the scent beat, pulls back for professional assessment. One weakness: the final third drifts toward explanatory interiority ("she understood at last that her half truths had always been whole lies if she was honest") that slightly over-articulates what the scene already shows, and "professionally thorough" recurs as a tic four times without fresh angle.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied syntax and strong sensory anchors ("static electricity rise against her fingertips like tiny electric admissions"). Information density is high; most lines advance character or concept. However, the final paragraph contains paraphrase loops: "her half truths had always been whole lies" is immediately glossed as "useful ones, necessary ones," and "professionally thorough" and "the work was never finished, only suspended" restate prior content. Template cadence appears in repeated "she had [past perfect]" openers across multiple sentences. These artifacts dull the closure beat's sharpness, triggering cumulative deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The counterfeit-emotion-dealer premise and the method (fragrance chemistry meets empathy transfer) offer a fresh synthesis. The "half truths" motif and the exploration of professional detachment versus genuine feeling add thematic depth. However, the core emotional arc—artisan tests own dangerous creation and gains self-knowledge—is a familiar template, and the piece does not transform it through bold risk or lived specificity that would make the outcome non-obvious. The amber grotto and static-electricity method supply surface novelty but remain ornamental rather than forcing irreversible choices. Middle-ground hedging: Vera's final stance ("the work was never finished, only suspended") avoids a definitive moral position.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vera is present throughout. Setup: established as emotion dealer by opening line. Development: her decision to test the compound on herself (midpoint agency). Payoff: she inhales, experiences grief, and concludes the work continues. Two gates clearly met; closure participation is conceptual—she accepts her role—but her final choice (to continue) does not narrow prior options with visible cost, only reaffirms her professional stance. Causal pressure is moderate; swapping her for another artisan-tester would leave the arc intact. Score in the 5–6 range per gate model and replaceable-arc test.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Blotter petal appears early ("on her workbench lay a fragrance chemist's blotter petal, its paper surface still damp"), is handled mid-beat ("She lifted the blotter petal, feeling the static electricity rise"), and is used at the climax ("she brought the blotter to her nose"). Three-gate integration. The object enables the transformation and its dampness/static charge constrain her method (she must read residue tactilely). Closure linkage: the scent from the petal triggers the grief experience and the final exhale. Specificity high—a generic vial or applicator would not supply the static-reading detail. Cost connection moderate (the petal's use risks genuine emotion). Solid causal work across beats justifies low-7 range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Half truths as concept is seeded early ("her profession required her to be half truthful"), developed mid-paragraph ("Half truths were her medium"), and paid off explicitly at closure ("her half truths had always been whole lies if she was honest, but useful ones"). Three gates met. The concept shapes her professional ethos and the final moral reckoning reweights it as "whole lies…necessary ones," which alters her self-understanding. However, it does not constrain a prior tactical choice on the page—it functions more as theme than stake—and the final articulation is told rather than dramatized through decision. Lyric reprise with thematic repricing; eligible for low-6 band per gate model and conceptual-RR allowance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Professionally thorough" is mentioned four times but functions as label rather than constraint. Setup: "she took her counterfeit very seriously" and "she was professionally thorough in all things." Development: "she had designed this compound to work on others, but she had designed it on herself first, as was her way." Payoff: "she was professionally thorough, and the work was never finished, only suspended." The trait motivates self-testing (one choice) but the repeated phrasing reads as tic without visible tradeoff or cost. Missing middle-development gate (no choice where thoroughness forecloses an easier path). Label-only use and synonym churn lower the score; cap at 4.8 per missing-gate and swappability tests.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Subsume" appears at the transformation beat: "The scent was amber and grief, a melancholy that tasted of autumn leaves and letters never sent. It subsumed her gently, drawing her consciousness toward something larger than herself." Setup: the compound is designed "to make people feel what others felt, genuinely." Development: she inhales, grief subsumes her. Payoff: she exhales, releasing it, and accepts the work's moral cost. Three gates met; the action is irreplaceable—swapping "subsume" for "overwhelm" would flatten the nuance of willing surrender versus being overtaken. The subsuming moment is the pivot where professional detachment meets genuine feeling, directly shaping closure. High causal linkage and specificity justify low-8 range.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Static electricity method is mentioned early ("sensing through static electricity, which sounds like mysticism but was actually quite mundane") and demonstrated once ("She lifted the blotter petal, feeling the static electricity rise against her fingertips like tiny electric admissions"). Setup gate met. Missing middle-development gate: the method does not constrain a choice or shape tactics beyond the single lift-and-read beat. Missing closure participation: static does not recur or reweight the ending. Functional but swappable—Vera could use any sensory-reading method (heat, texture, color change) with minor edits. Ornamental explanation without causal pressure caps score at 3.4 per gate model.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Amber grotto appears in opening line ("In the amber grotto at dusk") with vivid detail ("glass walls the color of honeyed whiskey"). Setup gate met. The space does not constrain any choice or provide a resource that alters outcome—it functions as atmospheric backdrop. Missing middle-development and closure-participation gates. The final sentence notes "The grotto glowed amber around her, the dusk outside deepening to true night," which is descriptive reprise without reweighting stakes. Postcard function with lyric tone; eligible for low-5 per two-gate allowance and lyric-resonance guidance, but lacks causal work to rise higher.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"As the transformation completes" frames the opening pressure and recurs mid-beat ("The transformation was complete now, she could feel it"). Setup and development gates met. Time is tracked (dusk deepens to night) but does not tighten decisions—no clock forces urgency or alters tactics. The transformation's completion is a passive environmental cue rather than a deadline Vera races. Missing clear closure linkage where time pressure charges the final choice. Functional in one beat (signals readiness to test) but replaceable with any readiness indicator. Score mid-5 per two-gate allowance and moderate beat involvement without cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation to fuse insight with empathy is seeded ("the fusion of her analytical insight with genuine feeling, the point where her professional knowledge became personal experience") and tested on the page (she inhales the compound to experience what she designed). Three gates met: setup in the premise, development in the inhalation choice, payoff in the realization that her detachment and empathy coexist as "affectionate detachment." The desire is dramatized rather than told-only, and friction exists (risking genuine feeling threatens her professional stance). However, the cost is conceptual—she accepts the paradox—rather than a visible tradeoff that forecloses a safer path. Solid integration with moderate pressure justifies mid-6 range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Affectionate detachment is established early ("she was professionally detached and that detachment was its own kind of love, the love of the craftsman for her craft") and modulates through the grief beat (she feels "affection for it even as it moved through her"). The tone is consistent across turns and charges the final image: she exhales, releasing the grief, and returns to work with the same stance—"professionally thorough"—intact. Coherent through pressure and the ending reweights the paradox (detachment *is* a form of care). Purposeful modulation without static flatlining. Strong execution of tonal control under the Accumulative lens; eligible for high-7 per tone-charging-closure criterion.</comment>
