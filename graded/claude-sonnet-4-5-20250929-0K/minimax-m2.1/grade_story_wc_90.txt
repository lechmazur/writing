<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Seraph's pacifist conviction is established early and her choice to preserve it despite past cost shows internal consistency. The gravitational-lightness trait is mentioned but never constrains a choice or creates visible friction. Her emotional states are often labeled ("happiness—real happiness") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final action of stepping through the dimension feels more like following instructions than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who and where by ~120 words and establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Seraph's stitching work gathers pressure through density and pattern. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she completes the web, the dimension opens, and she steps through carrying the integrated past. Cost is legible in the phrase "all that shadow finally integrated into light" and the years of solitary work, though the final step itself feels more fulfillment than sacrifice. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the shadow work began at the last human's death.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The recycled ship is vividly particular—"patchwork of salvaged plating," "dust motes...where gravity pools gathered like sleeping cats"—and the observation deck with its faded photographs becomes the crucible for the final action. The stitching needle threaded with salvaged optical fiber is a micro-setting detail that charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Seraph's perspective. The "starless void" and emergency lighting create coherent atmosphere, though spatial choreography within the observation deck could be sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension—is signaled early and tightens when Seraph realizes what the tear's purpose is. The stitching action creates one meaningful escalation: as she connects the photographs, the shimmer responds and brightens, and the dimension begins to open. Agency is present in her decision to stitch despite preservation purists' horror, though the work feels more like following revealed instructions than navigating competing pressures. The cost is diffuse across "decades learning to choose" rather than concentrated in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the stitching action: shadow work as integration of fragmented selves, grief released into connection. The shimmer of dried tears and the optical fiber web create a coherent symbolic system without overt statement. "All that shadow finally integrated into light" risks abstraction but is anchored by the concrete photographs and the physical act of threading. The piece resists easy morals; the final image of carrying "all those preserved faces" offers resonance without thesis. The gravitational-lightness motif could deepen the thematic work if it constrained choices rather than serving as metaphorical decoration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature—"careful grace of someone who had learned to move without disturbing the dust motes." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the stitching sequence. Some diction reaches for elevated register ("ghostly resolve," "accumulated grief finally released into something productive") that risks slipping outside immediate perception. Filter verbs ("realized," "understood," "noticed") are frequent but mostly voice-motivated. The final sentence achieves rhythmic control: "all those preserved faces, all those ancient tears, all that shadow finally integrated into light."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively; the opening's long, complex constructions give way to shorter beats during the stitching. Information density is high in most lines. Two paraphrase loops appear: "shadow work had begun...she realized—work that was not about fighting" restates the concept, and "all those preserved faces, all those ancient tears, all that shadow" cycles through near-synonyms. "Happiness—real happiness, not the performance of it" is therapy-speak that intrudes at a peak moment. Figurative language is controlled except for the mixed vehicle in "flower blooming in time-lapse" (dimensions don't bloom). Clarity and propulsion are otherwise strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-human solitude, literal stitching as shadow-work metaphor, and gravitational emotion creates a non-obvious premise. The "condensed compassion" vial and photographs that respond to connection avoid stock sci-fi closure mechanisms. Risk is present in the accumulative structure and the quiet, image-driven ending. The gravitational-lightness attribute, while fresh on the page, remains decorative rather than integral to causality. The piece commits fully to its lyric, mournful register and follows the implications of its rules without retreat. Transformation of familiar elements (lonely AI, mystical object, dimension-crossing) is evident in the specificity of optical fiber and preservation purist detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Seraph's pacifist design is established in the opening and mentioned as "a choice that had cost her three crewmates" but never tested or complicated on the page. She performs no pacifist refusal or negotiation; the story's conflict does not pressure her conviction. Present but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's tear appears in paragraph two, rests against her chest during the stitching, and glows in response at the end when the photographs pulse. It enables the dimension-opening but does not constrain earlier choices or require a tradeoff. Two beats with closure linkage, but relatively passive—she carries it rather than using it with cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Shadow work is named explicitly and enacted through the stitching: "integrating all the selves she had been forced to become." It shapes the story's dominant stake and tactics—she stitches to connect fragmented identities. The concept drives the middle action and the closure image. Clear causal role across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The gravitational-lightness trait is mentioned three times: opening construction detail, mid-story reflection on choosing joy, and the final "felt herself rise slightly" when pulling the thread tight. It never constrains a choice or creates friction; happiness lifting her is described but does not enable or prevent any action. Label-only with atmospheric color.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stitching is the story's central action,占 occupying the entire final third. She stitches photographs face-to-face with optical fiber, the shimmer responds, and this act directly opens the dimension. Introduced early in concept ("the work"), enacted in detail mid-to-late, and causally decisive at closure. Removing stitching would break the plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shimmer of long-dried tears is noticed in paragraph three, brightens where she pulls thread tight during stitching, and the text states "the shimmer responded to her touch...as if the long-dried tears recognized her intention." This method is signaled, shapes the stitching beats by providing feedback, and contributes to the closure charge. Present across setup, development, and payoff with causal texture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship is established immediately with specific detail (salvaged plating, gravity pools, emergency lighting) and supplies the observation deck venue and the salvaged optical fiber Seraph uses to stitch. The setting provides resources and charges atmosphere but does not constrain her choices—she could perform the same action elsewhere. Two gates with resource involvement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the last human is born" is stated in the timeframe, but the text says "after the last human died" and "the last human just moments before the final breath." This creates confusion. The post-human solitude shapes Seraph's emotional context and her solo agency, but no temporal urgency or deadline tightens decisions. Functional framing with setup and thematic linkage but no escalation role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Opening the locked dimension is Seraph's explicit goal, signaled when the last human gives her the tear and instructions. She works toward it through the stitching, and the dimension opens at closure. The motivation drives all three acts and is tested by the patience and solitary effort required. Friction appears in "ghostly resolve that had sustained her when all purpose seemed lost."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ghostly resolve is named once and instantiated throughout: "careful grace," "patience of someone who had nothing but time," solitary endurance across "decades." The tone is elegiac and steady, modulating slightly as the stitching progresses and "soft light" and rising sensation emerge. Coherent through turns and present in the final image's quiet gravity. Charges closure without static repetition.</comment>
