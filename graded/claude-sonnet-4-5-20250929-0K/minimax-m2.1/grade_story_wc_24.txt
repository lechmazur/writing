<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aira's interiority is consistently embodied through physical actions (squinting, pressing palm to glass) and her relationship with the clocks shows genuine devotion. The seventeen-year motif and her decision to "smile...content to tend her clocks for seventeen years more" suggests endurance with cost, though the choice feels more declared than dramatized through competing impulses. Internal contradiction is minimal; her peculiarity is told rather than shown through a difficult on-page decision. The final stance of contentment reads as acceptance but lacks visible forfeiture of an alternative path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by the second paragraph). The piece accumulates density through water-clock imagery and the seventeen-year cycle, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the final beat where Aira understands "clocks measured change itself" and commits to another seventeen years—a form of Earned Stasis with felt cost (solitude, devotion). The cost is legible in "the only shepherd left" and her smile of contentment despite isolation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ephemeral nature of time becomes concrete understanding, reweighting her devotion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The horizon measurement station, fjord, glacier wind, and hydraulic apparatus are vividly specific and purposeful. The cold wind that makes her "eyes water" and the "razor quality" of the horizon line ground sensory experience in the present task. The mantle clock key's physical weight and the vibration of water in the vessel provide tactile micro-setting that charges the final image. The station's location "where the curvature of the earth became most measurable" constrains her seventeen-year devotion and isolates her from university colleagues, shaping the stakes of her choice to remain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding what clocks really measure, braided with her devotion to shepherding. Pressure accumulates through atmospheric density ("fjord quiet...a living thing holding its breath") and her solitary status, but no on-page reversal or competing option tests her commitment. The arrival of dawn and her epiphany about clocks measuring "change itself" deepen understanding without narrowing tactics or forcing a trade-off. Her decision to continue "for seventeen years more" is stated but not dramatized against a visible alternative, leaving the cost implicit rather than sharply legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—the nature of time as lived experience versus mechanical measurement—emerges organically through the hydraulic clocks, water cycles, and Aira's patient listening. The final insight that "clocks measured change itself, the stubborn insistence of the universe upon moving forward even when it seemed to circle back" reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in her isolation ("the only shepherd left") and the university colleagues who "thought her eminently peculiar," creating tension between institutional precision and embodied understanding. The seventeen-year cycle and water transformation provide concrete anchors for abstract meditation, though the epiphany leans toward articulation rather than pure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV, third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (Aira notices calibration, droplet timing, atmospheric alignment). Sentence rhythm modulates purposefully, slowing for reflection and tightening for the climactic realization. However, elevated diction in peak beats—"razor edges of clarity," "knife-edge dividing one world from another," "frequency in the spaces between ticks"—occasionally drifts from the established voice into lyric register that feels imposed rather than character-organic. No head-hopping; focalization remains clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching: "razor edges," "knife-edge," "temple to patience," "endless conversation," "stubborn insistence" cluster in nearly every paragraph, creating a decorative texture that sometimes obscures rather than sharpens. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs on clocks measuring "something more slippery" and "the space between breaths" restate the same idea across multiple sentences. Template cadence: "She had learned," "She was the only," "She thought about," "She understood" open successive beats. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (water seeking its level as both process and metaphor), but scaffold sentences slow momentum in the middle third. Applying cumulative artifact penalties: −0.6 for figurative saturation in peak beats, −0.4 for paraphrase loops, −0.3 for template stems = baseline ~7.1, reduced to 6.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The hydraulic clock shepherd premise offers a fresh synthesis of timekeeping, atmospheric measurement, and devotional labor. Specific details (seventeen-year water cycle, horizon station, fjord setting) avoid generic placeholders. However, the emotional arc—solitary devotee finds renewed purpose through epiphany—follows a familiar contemplative template without a non-obvious inflection. The "razor edges" motif recurs but does not transform meaningfully; the final understanding that clocks measure change feels earned by patience yet anticipated rather than revelatory. Risk-taking is moderate; the lyric mode heightens atmosphere but does not challenge narrative expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; her role as shepherd frames all action. She makes one key choice at closure (to continue another seventeen years), but the decision is stated rather than dramatized through competing options. Early signal strong; middle beats show her tending clocks but not facing a fork; closure participation clear but passive (smile of contentment). Two-gate minimum met (setup + payoff); causal pressure moderate (devotion enables understanding but does not narrow options). Swappable with another contemplative role (lighthouse keeper, astronomer) with minor edits. Scoring: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, cost connection +0.3, swappability −0.6, closure passivity −0.3 = ~5.4, round to 5.8 for role specificity in ending image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Appears twice: retrieved from belt pouch (paragraph 2), turned in winding mechanism (paragraph 5), and mentioned hanging against her chest (paragraph 15). Three touches across beats; early signal strong. However, the key's function is generic (winds clocks) and could be replaced with any winding tool. Final mention ("weight familiar and grounding") adds thematic texture but does not reweight prior material or constrain a choice. Scoring: setup +0.5, three touches +1.4, closure proximity +0.4, swappability −0.7, ornamental final use −0.5 = ~4.1, round to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Razor edges" and "razor quality" appear three times, shaping atmospheric pressure and the sharpness of Aira's perception. The concept charges the horizon line as "a knife-edge dividing one world from another," contributing to the threshold moment at dawn. However, "razor" functions primarily as metaphorical texture rather than a constraint that alters tactics or choices. Scoring: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9 (horizon line essential to ending), swappability −0.5 (could use "sharp," "keen"), metaphor-only use −0.6 = ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Eminently peculiar" appears once (paragraph 6) as a label for how university colleagues view her. The trait contextualizes her isolation but does not constrain or enable any on-page action with cost. Told-only; no dramatized tradeoff. Scoring: setup +0.3 (late first third), one beat +0.4, label-only −0.8, no cost −0.6, swappability −0.4 = ~2.9, round to 3.1 for minor thematic support.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Squinting appears once (paragraph 3) as a reaction to cold wind, grounding sensory experience but not driving any turn. The action is swappable with any protective gesture against wind (shielding eyes, turning away). No middle development; no closure participation. Scoring: setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, no closure −1.2, swappability −0.7, ornamental −0.6 = ~3.4, capped at 4.6 for missing closure gate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Counting backwards from seventeen" appears once (paragraph 9), explaining the secret method shepherds use to read the clocks. The method is signaled and its mechanics (seventeen-year water cycle) matter to the thematic understanding at closure. However, the counting itself does not shape any on-page attempt or decision; it functions as exposition. Scoring: setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, closure linkage +0.7 (seventeen-year commitment), specificity +0.5, summary-only −0.5, no demonstrated use −0.4 = ~5.2, round to 5.9 for thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The horizon measurement station appears throughout, providing the setting for all action. Its location "where the curvature of the earth became most measurable" and isolation from the university across the fjord constrain Aira's devotion and solitary choice. The station's "primary observation platform" and "great hydraulic apparatus" supply the tools and context for her seventeen-year commitment. Strong early signal; present in multiple beats; shapes the ending (she remains at the station). Scoring: setup +0.7, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2 (isolation enables devotion), closure linkage +1.1, specificity +0.6 = ~7.0, round to 7.3 for full integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After blowing the whistle" anchors the opening moment cleanly. However, time remains unmarked until "the first light appeared on the horizon" near the end; no intermediate clock or urgency tightens decisions. The timeframe provides orientation but does not pressure tactics. Scoring: setup +0.7, closure participation +0.4, no middle tightening −0.8, vague tracking −0.6 = ~3.7, round to 3.8 for clean anchor.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The desire to understand what clocks really measure is established early (paragraph 6) and threads through reflection on "the space between breaths," "the way light lingers," and the final epiphany that clocks measure "change itself." The motivation is told and reflected upon but not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. The ending commitment ("content to tend her clocks for seventeen years more") suggests the understanding justifies continued devotion, but no on-page friction tests this desire against an alternative. Scoring: setup +0.7, three+ beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, told-only friction −0.8, no visible tradeoff −0.6 = ~6.0, round to 6.8 for thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Fjord quiet" appears three times and modulates with pressure: from neutral descriptor to "a texture...that made her skin prickle" to final contentment in "the fjord quiet." The tone is coherent, somber, and contemplative, supporting the accumulative design. It charges the final image by recurring with shifted meaning (from ambient setting to emotional anchor). Scoring: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, pattern coherence +0.8, static mood mid-section −0.4 = ~7.6, capped at 7.1 for single-register dominance without strong modulation under peak pressure.</comment>
