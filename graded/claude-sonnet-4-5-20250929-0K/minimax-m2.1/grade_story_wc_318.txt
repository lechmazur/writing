<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist lacks on-page interiority and embodied emotion; we observe ritualized action but never access contradictory impulses or a hierarchy of values under pressure. The character exists as a symbolic conductor performing a predetermined role rather than making choices that foreclose paths. The "mournfully eager" attribute is asserted but never dramatized through micro-decisions with visible cost. No meaningful change or credible endurance is earned—the work simply continues as it always has.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is heavily delayed: who this person is, where the household stands in relation to the tunnel, and what specific loss occurred remain abstract past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost—the work "continues, as it always had, as it always would" is a declared stasis without visible forfeiture or crystallized options. The drive lens is ambiguous (attempts at Accumulative/Textural but no cadence shift or density break reweights the stake), and causality is circular: sound is generated to restore laughter, but no on-page event tests whether it works or what price the conductor pays.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel is named and its acoustic function explained, but spatial choreography remains vague—how far, what materials, how the household connects to the tunnel are never anchored. Sensory detail leans heavily visual/aural without embodied particulars (temperature, texture, exertion). The setting does constrain the method (amplification) but does not alter a choice or charge the final image with new meaning, capping the score in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring lost laughter—is signaled early but never tested on the page; no reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options or forces a trade-off. Pressure is asserted ("mournfully eager," "delicate nature of the work") but remains static across all beats with no escalation or visible cost. The ending declares continuity without consequence, and no agency forecloses a path. Coincidence does not resolve because nothing resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—tending to unspoken grief through sound—is overtly stated rather than emergent from particulars: "tending to the unspoken," "restoring lost laughter," "macerate the stillness" are abstract labels repeated without scene pressure. The final paragraph moralizes the work's purpose ("planting seeds of remembrance") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer. No epiphany is earned; the piece tells its thesis rather than dramatizing cost or transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, but psychic distance is inconsistent: the narrator claims "he understood" and "he had learned" without showing the contradictions or limits that would ground interiority. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("calcified around this household's heart," "acoustic memory") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic—what this conductor notices could belong to any caretaker archetype. No dialogue is present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "unspoken grief," "unspoken sorrow," "unspoken" recurs without reweighting; "macerate the stillness," "macerated the stillness" repeats the same concept. Template cadence runs: "He did not rush. Mourning required..." / "He moved through..." / "He pulled the cord again..." Figurative language stacks without pattern-teaching: "echo chamber tunnel," "symphony conductor," "mechanical resurrection," "acoustic memory" blur into abstraction. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack (−1.0) and clarity drag across high-pressure beats (−0.6).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—leaf blower as ritual to restore joy—offers surface novelty but executes as a static tableau without transformation or specific lived detail. The work is described rather than tested; no turn or intensification grows from prior particulars. The "after the final grain slips through the hourglass" frame is invoked once without consequence. Tropes (grief as dust, sound as healing) are unmodified templates, and the ending retreats to safety: "the work continued, as it always had."</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "leaf blower symphony conductor" is named and performs ritualized actions across multiple beats, but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Observation and performance dominate; decisions are absent. Swappable with "caretaker" or "healer" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The pull cord handle appears in three beats (setup, first pull, final pull) and its worn texture is noted, satisfying setup and development. It enables the method but does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure—it simply activates the machine again. Functional across beats but replaceable with any ignition mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Tending to the unspoken is labeled repeatedly as the core concept and frames the work's purpose, but it never shapes an on-page choice or alters tactics. It remains thematic assertion rather than dramatized stake. Present across beats as a summary claim, not a causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Mournfully eager" is named once in the opening third and asserted as an approach, but it constrains no action and generates no visible tradeoff. It could be removed without affecting any beat. Label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Macerate" is used twice (verb and past-tense) to describe breaking down stillness and sorrow, framing the method's intention. It does not drive a turn or redefine options—any synonym (dissolve, erode, soften) would serve equally. Present and thematic, but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Half-sung lullabies carried on off-key wind are introduced in the setup, enacted in the first pull beat, and referenced again at closure. The method is signaled and its mechanics (imperfection allows slippage) are explained, shaping the attempt across beats. However, no on-page consequence tests whether it works, capping the score in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel is named early, its acoustic function (amplification, bouncing sound) is explained, and it recurs across all beats as the spatial frame. It enables the method by multiplying sound but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Micro-setting that pressures the work's mechanics without charging the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After the final grain slips through the hourglass" is invoked once in the opening third to establish a post-loss timeframe, then never referenced or used to tighten decisions. Time is vague and untracked; no clock or deadline shapes tactics. Ornamental frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Restoring lost laughter is named as the explicit goal in the opening and closing beats, framing all action. It is told rather than dramatized—no friction between this want and a competing cost appears on the page. The desire is static and never conflicted in a choice. Present and coherent, but swappable with any restorative mission.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"True haunting" tone is established through diction (dust, silence, shadows, grief) and sustained across beats with consistent solemnity. The tone modulates slightly (mechanical rumble, throaty rumble, "desperately, beautifully alive") in the final beat, attempting to charge the closure image. Coherent and purposeful, but the static emotional register limits the final lift.</comment>
