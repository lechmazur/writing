<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aria's interiority is concrete and embodied—her reading of driftwood grain and the lantern slide's shifting images anchor her perceptual signature. The epiphany about "timewoven alliance" arrives with minimal on-page struggle; she understands in a single observational moment rather than through contradictory impulses acting under pressure. The final sculpture choice feels more thematic declaration than earned renunciation with visible cost. Internal conflict remains largely reflective rather than dramatized through competing desires in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through layered imagery (driftwood, archway, lantern slide) and shifts cadence at the storm shelter, then again at the studio. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final sculptural gesture crystallizes her place in the generational chain with felt cost (solitude, devotion). The GPS failure anchors "after" cleanly by ~80 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the slide reveals its secret, reweighting her artistic practice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archway functions as micro-setting that constrains her shelter choice and charges the closure image (the sculpture reaching toward it). Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "horizontal sheets," "turbine-hum," "salt and sawdust." The storm's progression from rolling arrival to spent fury tracks coherently. The lantern slide's tactile presence (palm-sized glass, woven light) and the driftwood's grain-as-braille specificity ground the accumulative design without postcard drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding her place in the lineage of makers. The storm and GPS failure complicate but do not resolve; the archway moment tightens when the slide's secret narrows her self-concept from solitary sculptor to participant in a timewoven conversation. Agency is attention and realization that forecloses the path of isolation—she commits to the largest piece she's ever attempted, a gesture toward communion. The price is legible: devotion, the endless curriculum, the rhythm that remains in her hands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the slide's layered images, the archway's centuries of shelter, the driftwood's carried history. "Timewoven alliances" is named but earned by the visual progression (trader, mother, soldier, each making) and the final sculptural reach. The ending offers a non-literal answer—making as prayer, invitation—without moralizing. Subtext operates in the storm's spent fury mirroring her clarity, and the slide's mechanics (woven light, not carved) charging the concept of inherited pattern.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-close; Aria's perceptual signature (driftwood as braille, sediment metaphor) is consistent and purposeful. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: tighter during the storm, reflective at the slide revelation. Elevated diction ("turbine-hum reverie," "timewoven alliance," "scaffold complexity with simplicity") occasionally drifts above a working sculptor's likely interior lexicon during peak moments, though it remains legible and voice-motivated. No head-hopping; the single-POV window is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; sentences often do double work (e.g., "navigators before satellites" anchors her competence and the GPS as plot trigger). Minor scaffold appears: "understanding how salt and current shaped" and "felt a clarity she hadn't experienced" lean slightly tell-heavy. "Turbine-hum reverie" in the storm paragraph and "timewoven alliance" recur as phrase-templates across multiple beats without full pattern-teaching. The closure beat ("each motion a prayer, each curve an invitation") stacks parallel constructions purposefully, but earlier runs approach template cadence without payoff. Apply −0.6 for mild template drift and figurative density in non-peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lantern slide as inheritance device and the archway as multi-century threshold offer fresh angles on lineage and craft. The GPS failure as inciting incident is functional but replaceable (any navigation loss would serve). Emotional specificity is strong in the slide revelation; the medieval trader / Victorian mother / wartime soldier montage avoids pure abstraction. The ending's sculptural gesture (arm reaching toward archway) synthesizes prior material but does not surprise in hindsight—craft-as-communion is signaled early and arrives as expected. No bold structural risk; the arc is linear accumulation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aria is present throughout; her decision to walk the final stretch and her shelter choice are functional but low-agency. The slide revelation changes her self-concept and prompts the largest sculpture, a meaningful turn. She appears in all three gates (setup, middle, payoff) and drives the ending choice. Swappability is moderate—another artist-type could anchor this arc. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, visible cost (devotion, solitude) +0.4. Late penalty (no major beat in first third beyond walking) −0.3. Causal pressure is moderate; the sculpture is consequence, not tactical constraint under live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lantern slide is introduced mid-storm (~40% mark), touched in the shelter revelation, and invoked at closure ("not made of glass and light"). Two distinct beats: discovery in pocket, reading in archway light. It unlocks the timewoven concept and reweights her practice. Specificity is high (glass disc, woven images, sediment metaphor). Setup gate missed (late arrival); development +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, irreplaceability +0.6, causal pressure (enables realization) +0.8. Late-introduction penalty −0.4. Cap for missing setup: 4.6 waived by strong middle and closure work; band guidance suggests ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Timewoven alliances is named explicitly twice and illustrated by the slide's images. It shapes the ending thematically (sculpture as invitation) but does not constrain on-page tactics or force a trade-off. Setup in middle third (slide reveal), payoff at closure (making as alliance). Development gate weak—no choice hinges on alliance logic. Thematic echo without tactical pressure. Early signal (mid-piece) +0.3, closure linkage (thematic) +0.7, beat involvement (one) +0.4. Ornamental use −0.7, swappability (could be "inheritance" or "legacy") −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Perpetually learning is named once in reflection ("always would be") and implied in her GPS navigation and driftwood expertise. No on-page action turns on this trait; it reads as character color rather than constraint or enabler. Label-only mention; no visible tradeoff. Setup (early expertise), development (none), payoff (named in reflection). Missing middle development cap: 3.4. Ornamental −0.6, summary-only −0.4. Band floor ~3.0; minimal lift from early presence +0.3, thematic mention +0.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Reimagine is present in her broader artistic practice and crystallizes at closure when she begins "the largest piece she had ever attempted" with new understanding. The slide revelation redefines what reimagining means (not transformation of form but participation in conversation). Setup (her twenty years), development (slide deepens the concept), payoff (new sculpture). Two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure (realization shifts ambition) +0.7. Swappability moderate—"reinterpret" or "transform" would serve nearly as well −0.5. Specificity of her changed approach adds +0.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Layered meanings appears in the slide's mechanism (images layered like sediment) and her recognition of conversation across time. It shapes the revelation beat but does not constrain prior tactics or recur as a method she must apply under pressure. Setup (slide description), development (one beat: understanding), payoff (closure invokes it obliquely). Lyric reprise: "sediment" metaphor seeds early, returns implicitly at closure. Two gates +0.5, lyric resonance +0.6, specificity (woven light) +0.4. Summary-only in reflection −0.5, late first clear use −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway provides shelter, frames the slide revelation, and charges the final sculptural gesture (arm reaching toward it). It appears in three beats: arrival, revelation, closure sculpture. Spatial constraint is high—it forces her pause and offers the dry vantage for the slide. Setup early +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (sculptural target) +1.3, causal pressure (enables revelation, shapes ending) +1.2, specificity (centuries-old threshold) +0.6. Irreplaceable: no other setting would carry the temporal layering that mirrors the slide's images.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>GPS failure anchors the "after" timeframe and forces the walk, but once she reaches the archway the clock goes slack. The storm's progression (rolling in, intensifying, quieting) provides loose tempo but no live ticking pressure that alters her moves. Setup (GPS fails early) +0.5, development (storm complicates) +0.4, payoff (none; ending is timeless reflection). Missing closure cap: 2.8 waived slightly by storm's causal role. Swappability high—any delay mechanism would serve −0.6. Functional framing +0.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Scaffold complexity with simplicity is named once in reflection and implied in her driftwood practice (finding form in twisted wood). It does not create friction or force a choice on the page. Setup (her expertise), development (none dramatized), payoff (named in walk home, applied in closure sculpture as "simple act of making"). Two gates weak; the sculpture enacts it but the desire is told, not tested. Early signal +0.4, closure linkage (thematic) +0.8, beat involvement (one: sculpture choice) +0.4. Label-only −0.5, summary in reflection −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Turbine-hum reverie names the storm's tone and carries through as "rhythm remained in her hands" at closure. Tone is coherent: contemplative, lyric, accumulative. It modulates from urgent (storm) to reflective (slide) to devotional (studio). Setup (storm description) +0.5, development (sustains through revelation) +0.4, payoff (rhythm in hands) +0.9. Specificity ("turbine-hum") +0.5, closure charge (rhythm as prayer) +0.7. Static mood risk: the reverent register never breaks under pressure −0.4. Lyric reprise functional; not indispensable but purposeful.</comment>
