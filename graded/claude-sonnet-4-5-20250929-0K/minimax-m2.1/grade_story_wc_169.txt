<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is described exclusively through abstract labels—"logical dreamer," "meticulous precision," "imaginative spirit"—without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her interiority consists of philosophical assertions about hope's methodology rather than concrete, character-particular thought under pressure. No micro-choices with visible cost appear; she continues her research in a flatline of serene confidence without struggle, blind spots, or genuine stakes. The piece reads as a character sketch rather than a person facing contradictory demands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No on-page closure unit exists: Elara begins her research and ends preparing for another session with identical confidence, producing neither Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, nor Conceptual Repricing. The narrative is purely expository summary across an unspecified duration ("days," "years," "late afternoon") without a single causal beat or tightening that narrows options. The stated stakes—understanding hope across parallel timelines—remain abstract declarations never tested by dramatized events. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (grotto location unclear until paragraph 13) but the effect does not serve closure, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty and the Q3 cap at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The tide-polished grotto is vividly described with sensory specificity (sound of water, smell of salt, rippling light patterns) and its erosion metaphor is thematically purposeful. However, orientation anchors arrive late—spatial layout and relationship to the sea remain vague until deep in the text—and the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page. The grotto functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than an active pressure on Elara's work, keeping it in the functional but non-essential band despite strong descriptive texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding hope's dynamics—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or cost. No escalation, reversal, or tightening occurs; Elara's methodology remains unchanged from opening to close, and her "serene upheaval" produces no visible friction, sacrifice, or trade-off. The narrative summarizes her research process without dramatizing a single trial that fails, succeeds differently than expected, or forces a tactical adjustment. Agency is absent: she observes and theorizes but makes no decision that forecloses a path or changes her situation with legible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of hope-as-methodology emerges clearly through the altitude gauge, trial balloons, and erosion metaphor, but it is repeatedly stated rather than enacted: "hope required rigorous methodology," "revitalization of hope required sustained effort," "hope's mathematics required precision and imagination." The final paragraph explicitly sermonizes the thematic thesis rather than offering a resonant image that reweights prior material. The parallel-timeline premise remains abstract decoration; no particular choice or observation grounds the concept in embodied experience, leaving the theme as asserted philosophy rather than earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains stable third-person limited focalization with consistent elevated diction and a contemplative register appropriate to the reflective mode. However, voice lacks perceptual signature—Elara's way of noticing is generic rather than character-specific—and the narrative distance never modulates with emotional intensity because no emotional intensity appears on the page. Syntactic variety is present but the texture reads as polished essay rather than lived interior experience. No dialogue is present to evaluate. The register remains internally consistent but feels authorial rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is clean with varied syntax and no grammatical errors, but information density is low: most sentences restate the research premise in synonym variations without advancing situation or knowledge. Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent paragraphs (e.g., paragraphs 2, 5, 12, and 18 all rephrase "hope requires methodology"). Template cadence is visible in repeated "she understood that" and "her work" constructions. The prose is polished but weighted with conceptual redundancy and scaffold phrasing that dulls momentum. Reading aloud reveals rhythmic competence but a drumbeat of similar-length declarative sentences that flatten propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The parallel-timelines research premise and altitude-gauge-as-emotional-instrument offer a surface novelty, but the execution retreads familiar "artist-scientist in solitude" templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious stakes. The trial balloons, grotto setting, and hope equations remain conceptual ornaments rather than irreplaceable particulars that drive choice. Emotional specificity is absent; Elara's "serene upheaval" could describe any contemplative researcher. The transformation test fails: swapping names and changing the research subject would leave the arc (confident researcher continues confident research) intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout as the focalizer but makes no on-page decisions that alter tactics or stakes. The "logical dreamer" trait is label-only; her methodology remains static from opening to close. She observes and theorizes but does not choose between competing paths with cost. Setup is present, but no middle development or closure participation involving a consequential choice occurs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The brass altitude gauge appears in paragraph 2 (setup) and returns as a watching presence in paragraph 16, providing a lyric reprise that reweights the measurement theme. However, it is never handled, used, or consulted in a beat that constrains choice. The object functions as thematic symbol rather than causal instrument. Two-gate presence (setup + closure vicinity) with thematic resonance places it in the functional but replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Trial balloons" anchor the research method and appear across multiple paragraphs (3, 11, 14) as both literal paper vessels and thematic metaphor. Setup is early and development is present through repeated decoration-and-release cycles. However, no on-page trial produces a result that alters Elara's approach or understanding; the balloons illustrate her theory without testing it under pressure. Closure participation is summary-only. The concept shapes the premise but not the stakes or tactics in dramatized beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" appears once in paragraph 4 as a descriptor for Elara's observational state. It does not constrain or enable any on-page action, nor does it create a visible trade-off or cost. The trait is label-only and could be removed without altering any beat. No middle development or closure participation; setup is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Revitalize" appears in paragraphs 5 and 12, describing Elara's motivation to restore hope's understanding. Setup is present and thematic integration is clear, but the action never drives an on-page turn or choice. No scene dramatizes the revitalization attempt succeeding, failing, or forcing a tactical adjustment. Closure participation is summary-only (paragraph 18 restates the goal without enacting it). The action is swappable with "restore," "renew," or similar verbs without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Creating patterns with decorations" is introduced in paragraph 3 and developed across paragraphs 11, 14, and 17 as Elara's hands-on methodology. The mechanics—decorating paper vessels with color and fold—are signaled early and the method is present in multiple beats. However, no specific pattern choice (e.g., this color vs. that angle) alters an outcome or forces a decision. The method illustrates her process but does not shape a turning point or closure moment with causal pressure. Three-gate presence with middling causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tide-polished grotto is introduced in paragraph 1 (setup), its erosion metaphor is developed in paragraph 13, and its sensory details (rising tide, sound, smell) return in paragraph 17 near closure. The setting provides vivid atmosphere and thematic resonance, but it never constrains a choice—Elara could conduct identical research elsewhere with minor edits. Three-gate presence with strong descriptive work but no causal pressure on tactics places it in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Across parallel timelines" is mentioned in paragraphs 4 and 9 as the conceptual frame for tracking balloons' behavior, but the mechanism is never dramatized or made concrete. No scene shows a timeline branch, a comparison of outcomes, or a choice enabled by cross-timeline data. The timeframe remains abstract explanation rather than a live constraint that tightens decisions. Setup is present; middle development and closure participation are absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated in paragraphs 6 and 18 and thematically anchors the research premise. However, it is never dramatized as a conflicted desire tested by cost or friction. Elara pursues the goal with unbroken confidence; no scene shows her doubt, sacrifice, or trade-off between this want and another need. The motivation is told rather than enacted in choices. Setup and thematic closure mention are present, but no middle development with friction occurs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" is named in paragraph 7 and implied throughout via the tension between calm description and transformation language. The tone remains stable—contemplative and elevated—without modulation under pressure, because no pressure appears on the page. The oxymoron charges the thematic frame but does not escalate or deepen through the narrative; the final image maintains the same serene register without upheaval made visceral. Three-gate presence with coherent execution but static affect keeps it in the mid-band.</comment>
