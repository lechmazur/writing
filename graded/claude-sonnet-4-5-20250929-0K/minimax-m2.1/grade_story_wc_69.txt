<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's interior life shows texture through the worn rosette gesture and her past trauma, but her choices in the present scene remain largely observational—she positions her fingers, asks a question, begins a scale. The young man's shift from detached resignation to engagement is told rather than shown through micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values. The backstory operates within BRR allowances and anchors present stance, but the protagonist's agency at closure reads as witnessing rather than deciding with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates through layered reflection and a charged final image that reweights the rosette motif and Eleanor's long unlearning. Orientation anchors early (Eleanor, velvet library, autumn, zither). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the rosette "held its worn flower steady, as it always had, as it always would, for as long as someone remembered to look" crystallizes endurance with implied cost (the conditional "for as long as"). The final image charges prior material, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The velvet library and autumn light supply vivid, selective anchors filtered through Eleanor's musician's perception. The zither's soundhole rosette functions as micro-setting, recurring across beats and charging the final image. Sensory detail (amber leaves, leaded windows, worn petals) reflects urgency and familiarity without catalog padding. The rosette constrains Eleanor's ritual gesture and becomes the story's final anchor, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for object-as-setting that charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving vanishing arts through patient teaching, signaled early. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through Eleanor's reflection and the young man's postural shift, but the tightening remains mild—his hands emerging from pockets and breathing steadying are micro-signals rather than a choice that forecloses options. The story deepens understanding of the stake but lacks a visible trade-off or price paid at closure that would push escalation into the 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the braid metaphor, the worn rosette, and Eleanor's unlearning of hatred through subtraction of noise. The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: art survives through patient attention. Subtext operates cleanly in "the spaces between" and the young man's swallowed consonants. One slip: "vanishing arts" is named too often, edging toward thematic echo rather than remaining fully implicit in particulars. Still, the ending reweights prior material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Eleanor with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: musician's ear, worn gesture, recognition of accent-as-wound. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("expectantly resigned despair," "traveled stillness") in ways that read more authorial than character-filtered under pressure. No dialogue is present beyond Eleanor's single question, which fits the contemplative mode. Compression and reflection are purposeful, and the final image holds Eleanor's lens cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high, and rhythm modulates well between reflection and present action. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the same gesture" recurs, "vanishing arts" is restated across paragraphs, and the template "She had..." opens multiple reflection beats. Filter verbs ("she could tell," "she recognized," "she knew") cluster in the middle third, dulling immediacy during key observation beats. The figurative language (rosette as patient eye, leaves settling) is coherent but leans decorative in high-density passages. Artifacts touch but do not obscure closure, so penalties remain moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—exile musician teaching harmony as unlearning hatred—synthesizes familiar material (art preservation, refugee trauma) through specific lived detail (wrong-key singing as political offense, braid method, soundhole rosette). The turn from hatred to listening is earned in hindsight but follows a recognizable arc without a sharp inflection. The rosette motif and "subtracting noise" method offer fresh angles, yet the overall emotional trajectory reads as a well-executed template rather than a bold synthesis that transforms convention.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Eleanor is present throughout and her teaching stance frames the scene, but her on-page choices are limited to positioning her fingers and beginning a scale. Her observation of the young man's shift drives thematic understanding but does not create a key turn through her decision. Setup and closure participation are clear; middle development as active choice is thin.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rosette appears in beat one (traced gesture), returns thematically in reflection on worn petals, and anchors the final image as "patient eye" and "worn flower steady." It constrains Eleanor's ritual gesture and charges the ending with continuity and cost. Three distinct beats, closure linkage, and charged reprise. Swappability is low—its wear and flower detail are specific—but it does not narrow a tactical choice under pressure, capping it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Vanishing arts frames the stakes and appears in two reflection paragraphs plus the ending. It shapes Eleanor's motivation and the story's thematic question but does not alter her tactics on the page—she would teach the same way regardless. The concept is named explicitly rather than demonstrated through a choice that fails or succeeds because of its vanishing status. Setup, thematic presence, and closure linkage are clear; causal pressure on action is absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The young man's "expectantly resigned despair" is dramatized through swallowed consonants, hands in pockets, and detached listening. His shift—hands emerging, breathing steadying—shows the trait loosening under Eleanor's influence. Two beats (arrival posture, gradual shift), and the change is visible. However, the trait does not constrain a choice with cost; it is observed and altered by external pressure rather than forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Denote" appears once in Eleanor's teaching principle: "the principle she denoted to every student." It labels her method but does not create a turn or drive escalation. The actual teaching action (beginning the scale) is generic and could be any pedagogical move. The term feels ornamental, present to satisfy a prompt requirement rather than integral to story logic. Setup only; no middle or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Subtracting noise" is signaled explicitly in Eleanor's teaching method and implicitly in her unlearning of hatred. It appears in two beats: the exposition of her principle and the young man's gradual shift (posture change as noise removal). The method shapes the thematic answer but does not alter Eleanor's tactical choices on the page—she applies it consistently without friction or discovery. Setup, thematic linkage, and closure presence are strong; causal pressure on action is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The velvet library and autumn light supply vivid anchors and recur in the opening and final image. Setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—the teaching would succeed in any quiet room. Micro-setting (the rosette, leaded windows) charges atmosphere and closure image but does not pressure tactics. Setup, lyric reprise, and tonal coherence are strong; causal integration is thin.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Across unlearning hatred" frames Eleanor's long arc (thirty years, first years of exile, decades of students) but the present scene unfolds in an untracked single afternoon. The timeframe supplies backstory weight and thematic depth but does not tighten present decisions—no clock or deadline alters Eleanor's approach. The long view charges the ending's continuity claim but remains structural context rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Eleanor's desire to braid diverse voices is stated explicitly and dramatized through her teaching method and recognition of the young man's accent-as-wound. It drives her choice to begin the scale and frames the young man's response. Two beats (exposition, scale moment) and closure linkage. Friction between want and cost is implied (her own unlearning) but not tested in the present scene through a choice that risks failure or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" is named once and embodied consistently through diction (patient afternoons, soft footfall, breath steadying, settled leaves), Eleanor's controlled gestures, and the modulated pacing. Tone remains coherent across reflection and present action, supporting the accumulative design. It charges the final image's assertion of continuity. The tone does not modulate sharply under pressure—there is no peak stress to test it—but its consistency and closure contribution are strong.</comment>
