<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's interiority shows contradiction—grief paired with emerging understanding—embodied in physical signing that maps emotion. The "old man" serves as catalyst but remains an abstraction; his departure is unmotivated and his actual influence on Marina's choices unclear. Elena's arrival feels coincidental rather than earned by Marina's agency, and the final "translate" declaration asserts transformation without showing what specific path she's foreclosing or what cost she's paying beyond continued grief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding silence-as-language), but the cost remains abstract—Marina was already signing grief, and the story doesn't establish what she could do before versus after. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural (grief + moonlight + grandmother's absence building toward the signing moment), but the final image "began—finally, fully—to translate" announces arrival without dramatizing the before/after stakes or what translation now means differently. Orientation is prompt (harbor, interpreter, grandmother's death) by the first paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The harbor's moonlight and boats function consistently as stage and witness. The vintage camera recurs (chest, heart, "empty and patient") with shifting weight, constraining nothing but charging the final image as a symbol of unrecorded memory. Spatial choreography is clean (Marina at edge, Elena in boat, approach, hands held). The "luminous" quality modulates from beauty to "presence," purposefully elevating tone at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: translating/mapping her grandmother's silence into communicable form. One tightening occurs when Elena appears and Marina must move from practiced tales to spontaneous grief-signing, but this shift feels coincidental (Elena drifts in) rather than driven by Marina's prior choices. The cost of this new signing is asserted ("love folded into shapes her grandmother had never taught") but not demonstrated as a foreclosed alternative or tactical trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—loss as untranslatable yet transmissible through embodied gesture—emerges organically from the camera (designed to capture, never loaded) and sign language (mapping silence). The old man's aphorisms risk moralizing but are absorbed into Marina's physical discovery. "Joyful sorrow" avoids sentimentality by anchoring in Elena's crying and Marina's simultaneous smile. The final image (hands held, camera as weight of memory) offers a resonant non-literal answer without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature filters the harbor through Marina's interpreter lens (gesture, silence, pattern). Vocabulary occasionally inflates ("unreasonable beauty," "particular rhythm of loss") beyond naturalistic interiority, nudging into essayistic register. The phrase "the shapes that living makes when no one is watching" reads as authorial philosophy rather than Marina's lived thought. Otherwise, psychic distance modulates purposefully and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and most sentences advance image or emotion. Several loops appear: "silence" recurs seven times, "translate/translator/translating" eight times, with near-paraphrase in adjacent lines ("grief mapped in curves," "love folded into shapes"). The old man's dialogue ("You translate silence into music" / "to translate silence into music is to find the rhythm") reads as thematic echo rather than distinct speech. Template cadence in reflection blocks ("She thought of…and she understood…"; "The harbor seemed…the night itself had come…") flattens momentum mid-beat. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—sign language interpreter mourning through embodied gesture, vintage camera as metaphor for unrecorded transmission—is specific and non-obvious. The "whispering advisor" and moonlit witness-moment risk archetype (wise elder, transformative night), yet the camera's deliberate emptiness and the focus on sign's untranslatability offer fresh angles. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulation is genuine, though the closure's declaration ("began—finally, fully—to translate") retreats from the boldness of leaving translation incomplete.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The old man appears in setup (three weeks of evening advice), development (his aphorisms return to Marina mid-scene), and is present at closure (vanishes as Marina finishes). He enables Marina's conceptual frame ("map silence") but makes no choices that alter her tactics; his disappearance is ornamental rather than causal. Swappable with any memory or earlier teaching.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Camera appears in setup (worn leather, never loaded), development (implicit anchor against Marina's chest), and closure ("lay against Marina's heart, empty and patient, holding space for nothing except the weight of memory"). The empty-camera motif reweights the premise (unrecorded = truly remembered) and charges the final image with conceptual cost. Lacks middle-beat causal pressure; its role is primarily symbolic reprise rather than constraining choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sign language shapes stakes (interpreter identity, grandmother's untranslatable tales) in setup, drives the central action (Marina signing grief to Elena), and anchors closure (hands as transmission, translation begun). It constrains Marina's method and supplies the idiom for her emotional breakthrough. The element is indispensable; removing it collapses both the dominant stake and the thematic answer.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Quietly charismatic" is mentioned once in setup as the old man's observation, paired with "unobtrusiveness." It neither enables nor constrains an on-page action; Marina's signing reads as expressive rather than restrained or magnetic. The trait remains a label without dramatized cost or tactical friction. Swappable with any descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Disrupt" appears in the old man's remembered aphorism ("to disrupt is not to break but to set free") during Marina's signing. It frames her shift from practiced tales to spontaneous grief-signing, but the disruption is asserted rather than shown as a tactical break—Marina does not refuse a prior method with visible cost. The concept colors interpretation more than it drives a major turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is signaled in setup (the old man's teaching), drives Marina's signing method in the climax ("grief mapped in curves and angles"), and recurs at closure ("the silence she had learned to speak"). The method shapes her approach but its mechanics remain abstract; the story does not show how mapping differs from ordinary signing or what specific constraints it imposes. Present across beats, causally soft.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The harbor frames all action, the moonlight intensifies to "presence" at closure, and the boats supply Elena's entrance and the final tableau. The setting charges the tone ("luminous…unreasonable beauty") and provides the stage for the witnessed signing. Micro-setting (empty boats, water's lap) subtly mirrors isolation and connection. The harbor's "breath" and "thickening" moonlight actively shape the emotional crescendo.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"When no one remembers you" does not appear as explicit timeframe. The grandmother died seven months ago; Marina practices nightly for three months. These durations contextualize grief but do not tighten the present scene's clock or alter Marina's tactics under time pressure. The element functions as backstory anchor rather than live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The desire to translate silence into music is named in setup (old man's words), dramatized in the climax (Marina signing grief to Elena, "something that could become music after all"), and fulfilled at closure ("began…to translate"). Friction appears in the impossibility ("entirely in signs…impossible to translate into words without losing something essential"), forcing Marina to abandon practiced tales for spontaneous gesture. The want faces cost and drives the final action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Joyful sorrow is embodied throughout: "absence feel both sharper and more bearable," Elena crying with "the particular joy that comes when sorrow finally finds its shape," Marina's final smile as "joyful sorrow settle[s] into its proper shape." The tone modulates with pressure (sharpness → loosening → settling) and charges the closure image without flattening into single affect. Coherent and purposeful across all beats.</comment>
