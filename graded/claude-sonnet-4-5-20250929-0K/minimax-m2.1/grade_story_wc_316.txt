<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation (defeating emotional numbness) is clear and embodied through the blade metaphor, but internal contradiction remains static—the numbness is declared rather than shown degrading under specific pressure. The clone functions more as symbolic mirror than pressured relationship; their exchange feels like thesis delivery ("You cannot defeat emotional numbness through violence") rather than contested stance. The final "crack" in numbness arrives through assertion rather than earned micro-choices that foreclose options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first paragraph. The piece attempts Accumulative/Textural mode but the closure—"the numbness remained, but it was no longer absolute"—summarizes change rather than dramatizing it through a final image that reweights prior material. The blade-touch moment gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is told ("cracked") rather than shown through a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift that alters what comes next.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo, upward-falling leaves, and ceremonial blade establish vivid atmosphere and are filtered through the protagonist's post-ego-death lens. However, the environment remains decorative; no spatial constraint or tool property pressures a choice. The blade "cuts through pretense" metaphorically but never encounters resistance or physical consequence that would narrow options at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reconnecting to feeling) is signaled early, but escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a density increase or pattern break that reweights cost—here the "battle" metaphor dissolves without tactical friction. The blade-touch moment is the sole pressure point, and it resolves instantly ("gasped, and so did I") without visible trade-off or complication. No credible loss (time, stamina, relationship shift) alters tactics after the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (complementary opposites enabling transformation) emerges organically from the clone relationship and blade imagery. The "vivify" motif returns with shifted meaning at closure, and the piece resists tidy morals. However, the final paragraph explains the thematic payoff rather than trusting image and action: "a consciousness that survived ego death by learning to feel through another" over-articulates what the blade moment should have charged without summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable, and the perceptual signature (post-ego-death flatness vs. remembered warmth) is character-particular. Diction elevates appropriately for the ceremonial dojo setting. The clone's dialogue "You cannot defeat emotional numbness through violence" and the protagonist's thesis-speak in the final paragraph ("complementary opposites… transformation occurs") drift into essay register during peak beats, reducing voice distinctness under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "They felt everything. I felt nothing" is restated as "They had not experienced the death… They felt everything" within adjacent paragraphs. The final third deploys template openings ("The ego death had been," "The numbness remained," "The floating rock dojo settled") and summary constructions that dull propulsion. The blade's metaphoric work (cuts "membrane between imitation and authenticity") mixes vehicles without concrete grounding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The ego-death survivor premise and clone custody frame offer a fresh synthesis, and the floating dojo setting particularizes the world. The "complementary opposites" resolution, however, trends toward prompt-template language and the transformation test flags some vulnerability—swapping the clone for a mentor or mirror-self would leave the emotional arc largely intact. The piece commits to its premise but the final reconfiguration explains rather than enacts its logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; frames the opening reflection and drives the blade-touch decision at midpoint. The character's choices (returning to the dojo, wielding the blade, accepting the clone as complement) create the key turn. However, the ego-death attribute remains more told backstory than on-page constraint shaping present tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>0.0</grade><comment>The "brain in a jar (labeled duplicate)" does not appear on the page. The clone is a full-bodied character, not an object. No brain, no jar, no label.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The clone custody battle is established as backstory ("legal custody… settlement") and shapes the protagonist's stake (what to do with the clone). It constrains the opening situation but does not develop or escalate mid-scene; the "battle" metaphor is acknowledged then dissolved. The resolution reframes custody as complementarity, providing closure participation, but the battle itself remains off-page exposition.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Slices through pretense" is introduced early with the ceremonial knife and returns at closure ("sheathed the blade that slices through pretense"). The blade's use is metaphoric—cutting "the membrane between imitation and authenticity"—but the slice does not encounter resistance or cost that alters tactics. The attribute remains label-level; no on-page action demonstrates what pretense is cut or what that cutting forecloses.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Vivify" is spoken at midpoint and names the protagonist's desire; the blade-touch moment enacts it ("awakened, vivifying something dormant"). This action creates the story's sole reversal. However, the mechanics remain abstract (cuts a "membrane," creates a "thread of connection") and the outcome is summarized rather than shown through altered behavior or choice in the lines that follow.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Complementary opposites (stillness/movement, connection/separation, original/duplicate) are seeded in paragraph four and explicitly named at closure. The method shapes the final reconfiguration but arrives late as thesis rather than evolving through dramatized attempts. It does not constrain earlier choices; the protagonist does not try and fail at unity before discovering complementarity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo with upward-falling maple leaves anchors the opening and returns in the final paragraph ("settled into a new era"). Vivid description supplies atmosphere but does not pressure a choice—no spatial constraint, no resource scarcity, no rule of the dojo that the protagonist must navigate. The setting hosts action rather than shaping it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"While history rewrites itself" appears in the opening line and closing paragraph but remains atmospheric. No ticking clock, no tactical urgency tied to the rewrite, no moment when shifting history forecloses an option. The timeframe colors tone but does not constrain decision or escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>To defeat emotional numbness is stated in the title phrase, dramatized through the protagonist's return to the dojo and blade gesture, and directly tested at the blade-touch turn. The desire conflicts with the method (violence vs. connection) and the cost (accepting the clone's separate existence) is legible at closure. The motivation drives all three beats and lands in the final image.</comment>
