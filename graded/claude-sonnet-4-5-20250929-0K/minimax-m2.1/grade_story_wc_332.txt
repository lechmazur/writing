<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's persistent choice to work odd hours and her sustained cataloguing effort ground her character, but the motivational arc—from patience to recognizing her own runaway dream—arrives through explanation rather than on-page contradiction. The moment she discovers her face in another's photograph feels asserted rather than earned by prior micro-choices that show her longing. Internal conflict exists but operates as sequential realization rather than simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene. The palette discovery and vitalization work are shown, but the final recognition that "this was her own" longing lacks embodied cost or visible foreclosure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through repeated vitalization attempts until the runaway dream arrives and Mira recognizes her own longing. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the end of paragraph one. The closure effect is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira captures her dream and hangs the photograph, settling into Earned Stasis ("in its glow she worked on")—but the cost is implied rather than undeniable on the page. The final image reweights prior material, yet the before/after emotional shift feels softer than the rubric's "felt cost" standard would require for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archipelago's whispering corridors, the cliffside library, and the sunrise window all anchor Mira's odd-hour schedule and supply the recurring light that enables vitalization. The watercolor palette functions as a micro-setting object, constraining her work to sunrise and charging the final image when morning light finds the hung photograph. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("wind carried voices through stone corridors," "palette whose wells held colors that seemed to absorb light"). Spatial choreography across the library stacks and her desk remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing dreams leaked from old photographs—is signaled early and sustained through repeated vitalization experiments. A single meaningful tightening occurs when the runaway dream arrives and Mira realizes it is her own, but the pressure feels more like accumulative density than a narrowing of options. The resolution shows her hanging the photograph and continuing her work, an Earned Stasis, yet the visible cost (what path is foreclosed, what she sacrifices to settle the dream) remains abstract. Agency exists in her choice to paint the photograph, but the trade-off lacks on-page specificity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the cipher of longing, the vitalization of captured images, and Mira's discovery that her own dream has been running. The final image—"the dream settled into the photograph and stilled, finally captured, finally home"—offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and image (the child's toy boat, the woman at the ship's rail), and the palette's colors "absorb light rather than reflect it" carries metaphoric weight without becoming allegorical. The piece resists tidy resolution, allowing Mira to continue working "in the hush of improbable beginnings" rather than declaring closure complete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization remains stable; perceptual signature is distinct (Mira notices marginalia, water damage, "the quality of being" rather than person or place). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("cipher of longing revealed itself slowly," "the evidence of dreams that had been dreamed and then lost"). The prose occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("sheer persistence and the willingness to work when others would not") but mostly stays anchored in Mira's patient, cataloguing intelligence. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance shifts purposefully between concrete action and reflection, though the reflection-heavy final third tests the reader's trust in present-moment pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high, and figurative language ("wind carried voices," "colors that seemed to absorb light") serves atmosphere without muddling clarity. Sentence rhythm varies, though several paragraphs open with "She + verb" or "The + noun" patterns that create mild template cadence. Paragraph three contains a paraphrase loop: "The image stirred. A woman...turned her head" followed immediately by "Then the light strengthened and she stilled again"—the turn and still are restated without added pressure. The final paragraph's "finally captured, finally home" risks stock phrasing but lands as voice-consistent closure. No severe scaffolding or synonym churn, but the density of abstract nouns ("cipher," "residue," "quality of being") in peak beats slightly dulls propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of watercolor palette, sunrise vitalization, and captured dreams offers a specific angle on longing and preservation. The turn—Mira recognizing her own dream in another's photograph—feels earned in hindsight by her sustained cataloguing and listening. The whispering archipelago and odd-hour schedule are particular to this voice and setting. However, the core emotional arc (solitary worker discovers self through helping others) follows a familiar template, and the final image of hanging the photograph beside her desk to continue work risks the safety middle. The piece transforms its materials through lived detail but does not take bold structural or perspectival risks that would elevate originality into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's odd-hour schedule frames her persistence and isolation from the opening, enables her sunrise work, and shapes the final choice to hang the photograph where morning light will find it. Her decision to begin vitalizing photographs in earnest appears in paragraph five, and the climactic act of painting the runaway dream is hers. The character constrains the timeframe and setting, but the on-page decisions feel more like patient accumulation than sharp turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The watercolor palette is discovered in paragraph two, handled accidentally in paragraph three when pigment bleeds into the photograph, used repeatedly across experiments in paragraph four, and applied deliberately in the climactic beat of paragraph six. Its "colors that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it" supply the unique mechanism for vitalization. Removing it would break the story's central logic. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but the palette's mechanics remain slightly ornamental—it enables rather than constrains Mira's choices with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cipher of longing names the pattern Mira learns in paragraph four and is explicitly invoked at the end of paragraph six when she sees her own face "in the mirror of another's capture." It shapes her motivation to vitalize photographs and charges the final recognition. However, it functions more as thematic frame than on-page constraint—Mira does not wrestle with competing interpretations of longing or pay a visible price to decode it. Present across beats and at closure, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is demonstrated in paragraph four ("applied in specific sequences during sunrise photography") and enacted in the climactic paragraph six vitalization. The attribute enables Mira's work and charges the sunrise constraint, but it does not visibly limit her or force a trade-off—she learns the technique and applies it successfully. Functional and present at closure, but the cost tied to this specific trait remains implicit.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vitalization is the core action: Mira accidentally discovers it in paragraph three, refines it across paragraph four experiments, applies it to the child's photograph in paragraph five, and performs it deliberately on the runaway dream in paragraph six. The action defines her motivation and delivers the closure effect (the dream "settled...finally captured, finally home"). Removing vitalization would eliminate the plot. Strong causal role, though the mechanics remain somewhat abstract and do not impose visible failure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sunrise photography is signaled in paragraph four ("certain colors, applied in specific sequences during sunrise photography"), constrains Mira's work to the hush before dawn, and is present in the climactic paragraph six beat ("while the sunrise worked beside her"). The method shapes timing and atmosphere, but its mechanics are told rather than shown—we do not see her fail during wrong light or adjust her technique under the sunrise constraint. Present across beats and at closure, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The whispering archipelago is named in the opening sentence, supplies the library's isolation and odd-hour schedule, and anchors the final image ("surrounded by the whispering archipelago's long-conversed secrets"). The setting enables Mira's patient work and charges the atmospheric tone, but it does not constrain her choices or alter tactics—she could perform vitalization in any isolated library. Purposeful reprise at closure lifts the score into lyric-resonance territory, but causal work remains light.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"The hush of improbable beginnings" names the pre-dawn timeframe in paragraph four, recurs in the final sentence, and constrains Mira's vitalization work to sunrise. The timeframe shapes her odd-hour schedule, limits when she can work the palette, and charges the closure image. Removing it would weaken the story's temporal logic. Strong early signal and closure participation, though the narrative does not track elapsed time or show Mira racing a clock—the constraint is atmospheric rather than tactic-forcing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The runaway dream is announced in paragraph six ("arrived like a half-remembered song") and recognized as Mira's own longing—"the dream she had been chasing since childhood without ever naming it." Her motivation to capture it drives the climactic vitalization and delivers the closure effect. The desire is dramatized through her sustained cataloguing and listening, though the friction between want and cost could be sharper—she captures the dream successfully without visible sacrifice. Strong closure linkage and causal role.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" names the tone of longing, faded photographs, and dreams that have leaked away. The palette's colors "absorb light rather than reflect it," the child's joy "leaked away through the thin paper borders," and the final image glows with settled dreams. Tone is coherent through turns and modulates from patient cataloguing to the "luminous moment" of recognition. The phrase itself does not appear on the page, but the tonal effect is sustained and charges the final image.</comment>
