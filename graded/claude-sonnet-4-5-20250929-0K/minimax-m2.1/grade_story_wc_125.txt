<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is dense and embodied through her rope-tracing ritual, but her central choice never fully crystallizes into contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she circles the threshold without dramatizing the tension between documenting transformation and joining it. The "ethically playful" attribute remains label-only; no on-page action tests boundaries with visible cost. The final decision to "remain on the threshold" reads as a refusal to choose rather than an earned renunciation that forecloses a path, muting the cost required at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (drifting poet, grotto, post-arrival world) land early. The piece accumulates layers through the spiral-drawing ritual and builds to a Charged Poise closure where Mira remains on the threshold—options are crystallized and pressure is undeniable. However, the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally paid on the page; the rope's glow and her renewed pattern-drawing suggest continuity without a legible forfeiture or transformation that alters her situation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The grotto's starlight, pool, and curved walls create a vivid liminal space. The rope—frayed fibers, rough texture, faint luminescence—functions as both tool and recurring motif that constrains her choice (marking patterns) and charges the final image. Sensory detail (silver threads, rust-colored clay) is purposeful and filtered through Mira's contemplative POV. The setting supports the threshold theme without becoming a postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to document transformation or join it. The tension is declared early but never tightened through a choice that narrows options—Mira circles the question across multiple paragraphs without a reversal or escalating pressure that forces a trade-off. The ending opts for perpetual liminality rather than an earned decision with visible cost, leaving the stake acknowledged but unresolved in a way that feels static rather than deepened.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of threshold, transformation, and impossible choice emerges organically through the spiral motif and Mira's pattern-drawing. The rope's shift from prison-escape tool to ritual instrument reweights its meaning. However, the final paragraph edges toward abstract philosophizing ("impossible tension before choice") rather than letting the image speak. The piece resists moralizing but stops short of offering a resonant, non-literal answer that transforms prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and layered with philosophical texture ("like watching a child attempt to describe color to someone who had only ever known sound"). Psychic distance and POV are stable; no head-hopping. The prose occasionally slips into elevated register ("ethically playful part," "accumulated layers of chalk and dust and intention") that feels slightly explanatory rather than embodied in peak moments, but the perceptual signature (pattern-seeking, liminal awareness) remains distinct throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, but multiple beats rely on synonym loops and paraphrase chains: "frayed coil," "rough fibers," "frayed end" recur without new pressure; "pattern-drawing," "spiral," "map," "translate" cycle across paragraphs. The third paragraph's "ethically playful part of Mira's nature—that curious impulse" is scaffold exposition. Template cadence in the opening ("had become," "had been," "had tried") flattens propulsion. These artifacts spread across the piece, totaling −0.8 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The post-arrival energy-beings premise and threshold choice offer a fresh speculative frame, and the spiral-as-map motif is specific. However, the "impossible choice" setup and liminal poet archetype lean on familiar SFF templates without a decisive transformation. The ending's perpetual-threshold resolution avoids risk by refusing to commit, reading as a median option rather than a bold synthesis. Specificity in world detail (terra-cotta, starlight pool) lifts the score above generic, but the emotional arc remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira (drifting roadside poet) is present throughout and her contemplation of the threshold drives the accumulative tension, but her final choice is to continue the pattern rather than a decision that alters tactics or situation. She observes and reflects more than she acts, and the ending renews the status quo rather than breaking it.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The rope appears in three beats: unwinding from shoulder (paragraph 2), pausing over the spiral (paragraph 4), and pressing to chest at closure (paragraph 5). Its properties (frayed, rough, luminescent) shift meaning from prison-escape tool to ritual instrument. However, its use remains largely static description; it does not mechanically constrain or enable a key turn beyond marking the pattern she was already drawing.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Impossible choices" is signaled early and frames the central question (document vs. join transformation). It shapes Mira's internal stake and is revisited at closure ("the moment of impossible tension before choice"). However, the concept remains thematic rather than dramatized through competing on-page options with visible costs—she never faces a concrete either/or that alters her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Ethically playful" is mentioned once in paragraph 3 as "that curious impulse to test boundaries," but no on-page action demonstrates this trait under pressure. The label exists to explain her presence in the grotto but does not constrain or enable a choice with cost. It is ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Pattern" (spiral-drawing) is present in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and 5; it anchors Mira's ritual and her attempt to map four-dimensional time. The final beat ("by beginning the pattern again") directly shapes the closure as Charged Poise. The action is irreplaceable—her spiral-tracing is the visible manifestation of her threshold stance and drives the accumulative structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"By uncovering layers" is seeded in paragraph 2 ("each repetition uncovering another layer of meaning") and returns at closure ("by uncovering one more layer"). The method is signaled and matters to Mira's process, but its mechanics remain abstract—what constitutes a "layer" or how uncovering works is not dramatized, leaving it more conceptual than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The terra-cotta grotto with starlight is anchored early and returns in each paragraph. The pool, curved walls, and starlight rhythm supply the liminal atmosphere essential to theme. The setting does not mechanically alter tactics, but the starlight's pulsing heartbeat cues the beings' presence and the rope's luminescence signals the threshold moment, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the energy beings arrived" anchors the post-transformation world and motivates Mira's wandering (third month) and the beings' patient watching. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—there is no deadline or escalating urgency. The beings' "invitation will expire" is mentioned but not tracked or tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is stated in paragraph 1 and revisited in paragraph 4 ("texture of time as both a line and a circle"). The desire shapes Mira's pattern-drawing and her months of translation attempts, but it remains told more than dramatized. Friction between the want (to understand) and cost (losing the ability to document) is present but not embodied in a concrete choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Passionate subtlety" coheres across the piece: contemplative yet charged, with layered imagery (starlight, frayed rope, spiral) and restrained diction that modulates with pressure. The tone supports the liminal theme and rises slightly at closure ("passionate, playful on the threshold"). The final image recharges prior material without breaking the established register, demonstrating coherent tonal control.</comment>
