<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to decode Marco's message is established early and drives her to the piano. Her interiority leans toward abstract reflection ("liminal hollow," "bridge between worlds") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The decision to stay and play reads as inevitable discovery rather than a choice with visible competing costs—she understands what to do and does it without meaningful internal friction. The final departure feels like ceremonial closure rather than a renunciation that forecloses a path with felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the flood rises, the program reveals notation, Elena plays, and the final image reweights the experience as transmission complete. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the conversation is complete, and Elena leaves with the knowledge received), though the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt—no tactic was altered by a constraint, no live option was visibly foreclosed. The ellipsis between "lately inspired" and her immediate understanding that Marco left a code skips a causal beat that would strengthen motivation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is vividly anchored with selective detail (gilded balconies reflected in black water, drowned lobby, piano on raised platform). Water level and lantern light track consistently across moves and supply spatial logic for the discovery. The pit as "liminal hollow" and the stage as "vast wooden plane" are generic elevations that don't constrain a micro-choice, but the raised piano platform does enable the final beat. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: Elena notices water creep and flickering rhythm during the playing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: decode Marco's hidden message. The program's water-damage revelation provides one meaningful deepening that narrows her path to the piano. However, escalation occurs through discovery rather than protagonist agency under pressure—she waits, the flood reveals, she plays. No visible trade-off or tactical constraint shapes her approach; the cost of staying versus leaving is declared but never tested in a choice that forecloses an option. The closure reconfigures meaning but does not demonstrate a price paid for this stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of connection across mortality through music emerges from particulars (water as revelation, notation between the lines, wordless conversation). The final image of Elena leaving with the transmission complete offers a resonant answer to the question of how the living commune with the dead. However, the ending paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("the only language that transcended everything except itself") rather than letting the image alone carry weight. The "spaces between" motif recurs but functions more as metaphoric decoration than a constraint that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (musician's vocabulary: "liminal hollow," "intervals," "vibration and resonance"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to slightly elevated reflection in the final paragraph. Some diction edges toward elevated register not strictly character-bound ("testimony of vibration," "transmission, connection") but remains mostly coherent. No dialogue present; internal voice is consistent and idiomatically Elena's throughout, though it leans poetic rather than grounded under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several beats carry abstract scaffolding. "Lately inspired, she had told herself it was coincidence" introduces an unexplained phrase that doesn't land as idiom or irony. The phrase "the water damage spread like living things" mixes vehicle (living things don't spread like stains). The final paragraph loops thematic summary across multiple restatements ("transmission, as connection, as the only language…"). Figurative density in middle beats (constellations, chemistry, vocabulary of vibration) is high but remains mostly coherent. No major loops or filter stacks, but some redundancy in the closure reflection lowers propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The flooded opera house and hidden musical code offer a specific synthesis, though the ghost-communication-through-art premise is familiar. The water-damage-as-revelation mechanic is purposeful and integrated. Emotional truth in grief and connection elevates above template, yet the discovery unfolds without surprise—Elena intuits each step in sequence without friction or wrong turns. The piece commits fully to its lyric register, but the final paragraph's thematic unpacking retreats from bold image into safer summary. Risk is present in the accumulative design but not enough to break free of gentle poeticism into sharper stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena (orchestra pit musician) is present throughout and makes the decision to stay and the choice to play the revealed notation. Her professional identity anchors the voice and supplies vocabulary (cello, pit, notation). However, her choices feel like steps in a revealed path rather than decisions that narrow live options with visible cost. She functions more as interpreter than agent under conflicting pressure. Two beats (staying, playing) with setup and closure participation, but swappable agency keeps the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The antique program appears early, is handled twice (opened in lantern light, water-damaged to reveal notation), and its transformation drives the middle turn. It returns at closure implicitly as the source of the music Elena plays. The program's water-damaged images supply the causal key to the code, making it essential to plot logic. However, it does not constrain a choice under pressure—it reveals, and Elena complies. Strong setup, development, and closure linkage, but the program does not impose a cost or force a tactical trade-off, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"In between spaces" is seeded early (orchestra pit as liminal hollow, music as bridge) and returns in the opera title and final reflection. The concept shapes Elena's perception and charges the thematic closure ("this night in the in-between spaces"). It does not, however, alter a tactical choice or narrow options under pressure—it functions as metaphoric frame rather than mechanical constraint. Strong lyric reprise that reweights the stake and contributes to closure resonance, eligible for mid-6s under the lyric allowance, but does not reach 7+ without forcing a decision.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Lately inspired" appears once in a confusing phrase ("Lately inspired, she had told herself it was coincidence") that does not read as character idiom or clear irony. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost; it seems to be a prompt artifact rather than an integrated trait. No setup, no development beats, no closure participation. Ornamental mention without causal role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Disrupt" does not appear as an explicit on-page action. If interpreting liberally as the flood disrupting the opera house, that event is backdrop rather than protagonist choice. If reading Elena's playing as disrupting silence, it arrives late (final third) and is not signaled early or developed through resistance. The major turn (water revealing the code) is revelation, not disruption driven by Elena. Missing setup and middle development; no clear causal link to closure as an action she chose to perform. Late and passive role caps below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Water damage creating images is signaled early (program slipped under door three weeks ago, water rising for three days), demonstrated in the key middle beat (water droplets form musical notation on yellowed pages), and its mechanic enables the closure (Elena plays the revealed notation). The flood as revealer rather than destroyer is purposeful and irreplaceable. However, the method does not constrain Elena's tactics—she waits and it happens. Strong setup, development, and closure linkage with high specificity, but passive mechanics and no visible cost tied to using this method keep it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Flooded opera house lit by flickering lanterns is anchored early and sustained throughout. Water level tracks across beats (reaching knees, rising to lowest piano keys) and the raised piano platform enables the climax. Flickering lanterns create rhythm cues during the playing. The setting pressures the choice to stay (others have left) and supplies the medium (floodwater) that reveals the code. Environment is integral to plot logic and closure, with spatial choreography clear. The flood does not force a tactical trade-off or visible cost, preventing a score above 8.0, but it is essential and specific.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Amid the hush of unstruck chords" appears as tonal descriptor but does not function as a legible timeframe. The three-day flood and the program's next-week date provide loose temporal anchors, but no live clock tightens Elena's decision to stay or play. Time does not alter tactics or impose urgency at the closure beat. Functional as mood but replaceable as constraint; missing middle development and no closure pressure from the temporal element itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to unravel Marco's code is established early (program with his handwriting, dead two years) and drives her to interpret the water-damaged notation. She understands what to do and acts on it across two beats (reading the revealed notation, playing it). However, the desire is not dramatized with conflicting friction—she intuits each step without cost or resistance. The motivation shapes the arc and participates in closure, but the lack of on-page struggle or trade-off between wants and competing costs keeps the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Wordless conversation" as tone is coherent and modulates purposefully: quiet interiority at the start, rising lyric intensity during the playing, reflective calm at the end. The piece commits fully to indirect, image-based communication and avoids overt dialogue. The tone charges the final image (conversation complete, message received). However, the final paragraph edges toward explanation rather than sustaining the wordless mode, and the tone does not impose a pressure that constrains Elena's choices. Strong coherence and closure contribution, but the late thematic summary softens the tonal discipline.</comment>
