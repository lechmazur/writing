<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's professional competence is consistently rendered through concrete actions (deploying anemometer, photographing stress marks), and her eleven-year career detail anchors her expertise. However, interiority remains primarily professional-observational without meaningful internal contradiction or vulnerability—she moves through the investigation like a skilled technician rather than a person under pressure. The patch functions as exposition rather than a lived contradiction, and no micro-choice reveals competing values or costs. The final paragraph's "hidden mathematics" epiphany reads cerebral but unearned by on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: environmental detail and wind-pattern documentation build toward the convergence-point realization. Orientation anchors clearly (port, fog, evacuation, investigator role) within the opening. The closure offers Conceptual Repricing—"some accidents were not accidents at all"—with the reweighting of the freighter disaster from mechanical failure to environmental design flaw. However, the cost remains conceptual and distant; Mira's stance doesn't visibly foreclose a path or impose felt sacrifice on the page, weakening the closure's charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly rendered with rust streaks, numbered paint, and wind-tunnel acoustics that ground spatial choreography. The amphitheater convergence point functions as both discovery site and physical constraint that shapes Mira's investigative path. Sensory selection is strong (fog pressing instruments, metal groans, particulate density) and filtered through professional priorities. The environment directly enables the plot turn—stacked containers amplifying airflow into a weapon—elevating it beyond backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding the freighter disaster cause) is signaled early and sustained. The convergence-point discovery provides one meaningful deepening of knowledge that reframes the accident as environmental design. However, no live options narrow, no visible tradeoff occurs, and Mira's agency is purely observational—she documents rather than decides. The evacuation and military return remain off-page threats without on-page consequence. Pressure accumulates through atmospheric density but never forces a choice with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of pattern recognition and hidden causality emerges organically from the wind-documentation work and convergence discovery. "Singular convergence" as thesis avoids didactic statement, arising instead from concrete stress marks and airflow measurements. The final image—"the world's hidden mathematics finally demanded payment"—offers thematic resonance but edges toward abstraction. The foresight/prediction motif charges the ending without overt moralizing, though it stops short of a non-literal answer that truly reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with Mira's professional lens coloring all perception (wreckage diagrams, anemometer deployment, "air left fingerprints"). Diction is controlled and technical without register breaks. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction—"the fog had settled over the port like a held breath," "sterile space"—that feels authorial rather than character-particular. The perceptual signature is consistent but lacks idiosyncratic texture; Mira's way of noticing reads competent-investigator rather than a singular mind under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (credentials/patch/rescue corps/inquiry compressed efficiently). However, several lines carry decorative weight without advancing pressure: "held breath," "soft insistence," "texture to it" function as atmospheric padding. The opening's flight-engineer patch receives an entire subordinate clause of backstory that stalls momentum. "Hazy precision" in paragraph four exemplifies the thematic reach but also the tendency toward abstract metaphor. No loops or scaffolding, but figurative language occasionally dilutes clarity in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—accident investigator discovers environmental design flaw through wind-pattern analysis—offers a fresh procedural angle and avoids cliché disaster-mystery templates. Specificity (anemometer, particulate density, stress marks) elevates the investigation beyond generic sleuthing. However, the convergence revelation and "hidden mathematics" thesis feel conceptually familiar, and the empty-town frame adds atmosphere without transforming the investigative core. Mira's professional competence lacks the friction or bold risk that would distinguish this from capable procedural fiction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; drives the investigation and discovery. However, Mira's choices are purely methodical (deploy, photograph, measure, document)—observation without decision that alters tactics or imposes cost. She enters, surveys, realizes, and plans to report; no turn results from her agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Mentioned once in the opening as backstory exposition ("faded rectangle of silk bearing the crossed propellers and lightning bolt") and reprised briefly in the penultimate paragraph ("catching what light filtered through"). Static description; no handling, no evolution, no causal pressure. The patch functions as résumé detail rather than charged object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Singular convergence is named as Mira's thesis in paragraph two, dramatized through the wind-vortex discovery in paragraph four, and reweighted in the closure ("some accidents were not accidents at all"). The concept shapes her investigative method, the freighter-disaster reframe, and the evacuation's rationale. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Rapidly adapting to conditions kicking in as the environment revealed itself meter by meter" appears once in paragraph three as label-only narration. No specific on-page action demonstrates the trait, no constraint or cost results from rapid adaptation, and removing it would not alter a single beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Survey structures the entire piece: Mira surveys between container stacks, deploys instruments every twenty meters, photographs stress marks, and begins "final survey of the perimeter" in the closing line. The action frames discovery and closure. However, any methodical investigation (inspect, analyze, document) could replace survey with minimal rewrite, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Introduced early (anemometer deployment in paragraph two), repeated through convergence-point measurements (paragraph four: wind vortex, particulate density), and explicitly tied to foresight in the closure ("seeing what the wind had written"). The method drives the discovery, shapes tactics, and charges the final image. Removing wind-pattern mechanics would break the plot's causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is established in the opening, provides spatial pressure (wind tunnels, amphitheater convergence point), supplies the causal mechanism (stacked containers amplifying airflow), and anchors the closure realization. The setting is irreplaceable—the freighter disaster and evacuation logic depend on this exact configuration. Vivid, functional, and essential across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eighteen-hour silence since evacuation is noted in the opening and provides context for Mira's solo investigation. However, time remains static—no clock tightens decisions, no urgency alters tactics, and the military's return is vague future threat. The timeframe sets atmosphere but does not constrain choices or participate in closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Cultivation of foresight in action" appears once in paragraph four as authorial interpretation of the evacuation, not as Mira's dramatized desire. Her on-page motivation is to document and understand the freighter disaster; foresight is thematic gloss rather than conflicted want that drives beats or imposes cost. Label-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Hazy precision is embodied throughout: fog obscuring instruments, "documentation with the hazy precision that came from working in conditions that obscured as much as they revealed," wind patterns inferred from indirect measurement. The tone modulates with discovery pressure and charges the final image (hidden mathematics, patterns in spaces). Coherent, consistent, and functional across setup and closure.</comment>
