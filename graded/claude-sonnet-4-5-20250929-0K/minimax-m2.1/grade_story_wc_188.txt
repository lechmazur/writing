<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and purposeful—her chanting ritual, the tactile handling of tools, and the embodied knowledge from her grandmother ground her motivation. However, the piece leans heavily on reflective summary about her "serious playfulness" and "fire's true purpose" rather than letting those contradictions act simultaneously in scene. The final lighting choice is earnest and legible, but the opposition is atmospheric (starless sky, quiet villages) rather than forcing a genuine internal conflict or micro-choice trade-off. Minor penalty for over-articulated philosophy ("controlled combustion was possible") that occasionally drifts toward label-speak instead of embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clean—who, where, and when anchor by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Mira gathers details (fortress, mosaic note, ritual preparation), and the final spiral of fire reweights the opening emptiness with a reversal ("deciding to wake up"). The closure lands on the page with a visible cost (she commits to the ritual, voices respond) and the lens holds. Mild deduction: the mosaic note feels convenient—it declares the premise rather than emerging from prior causality—and the "atmospheric disturbance" remains abstract, lowering the stakes' tangibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fortress blooms with evening primrose and creeping thyme, and the mosaic floor's phoenix is purposefully incomplete, charging the closure when Mira lights the spiral at its center. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's craft-oriented lens (the kerosene rag knot, the courtyard flagstones). Spatial choreography is coherent across moves—gates, inner courtyard, great hall, courtyard. The setting constrains Mira's choice to perform the ritual in the fortress courtyard rather than the villages below, meeting the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—pierce the darkness and remind people hope is possible—is signaled early and coheres through preparation beats. The mosaic note provides one meaningful tightening: Mira's wandering becomes purposeful invitation. The final lighting is protagonist-driven, forecloses her option to remain passive, and generates a visible cost (exposure, commitment to her role). However, the opposition is primarily atmospheric (starless sky, quiet villages) rather than an antagonist or dilemma that tests her values, and the villages' immediate response ("doors opening, footsteps approaching") arrives too quickly to fully demonstrate earned escalation or felt risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—defiance through controlled light, hope as deliberate craft rather than passive wish—emerges from the spiral knot ritual and Mira's family chant without overt statement. The kerosene rag knot's "waking spiral" and the incomplete phoenix mosaic are non-literal image payoffs that reweight the opening void. The final line ("sky full of stars deciding to wake up") offers resonance without moralizing. Minor deduction: phrases like "serious playfulness" and "hope itself had developed its own gravity" occasionally drift toward prompt-echo abstraction rather than staying rooted in scene particulars, and the thematic payoff is slightly softer than the setup promises.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Mira; perceptual signature is craft-specific (she "filtered color through flame," handles the oilcloth with reverence). Diction is elevated and lyric, consistent throughout, with purposeful compression ("catching, catching hold"). However, register occasionally slips into abstract philosophizing ("controlled combustion was possible even when the cosmos seemed to have gone dark") that reads slightly outside a working pyrotechnician's interior lexicon under pressure. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. The narrative distance remains controlled, but the prose leans explanatory in beats where image alone could carry meaning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but coherent—"hope itself had developed its own gravity," "nature's quiet rebellion against all those centuries of siege logic." However, multiple beats engage in paraphrase loops: the grandmother's knowledge is restated three times in different metaphors without advancing pressure, and "serious playfulness" is explicitly named after being shown. Template cadence appears in the preparation sequence: "She spread… she continued… she carried… she placed… she lit…" across five consecutive beats. The overwriting in high-density metaphor and the scaffold phrasing lower propulsion and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty, capping the category below 7.5 and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The fireworks designer as hope-bringer and the phoenix mosaic note offer a fresh synthesis of craft and spiritual defiance. However, the core frame—artist restores light/hope to a darkened world through ritual performance—is a familiar template, and the mosaic note ("Wake it with what you know") reads as convenient authorial invitation rather than organic discovery. The specific details (kerosene rag knot, waking spiral, grandmother's chant) add texture, but the emotional arc and ending remain within predictable bounds. Mild risk-taking in the lyric accumulation mode, but the closure does not surprise or transform the premise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her choices (interpreting the mosaic note, preparing the ritual, lighting the spiral) drive all major beats and the closure. She is introduced in the opening line, her preparation occupies the middle, and her lighting action shapes the ending. However, her choices are earnest and uncontested—there is no visible trade-off or cost that alters her tactics. The element is essential but not irreplaceable; another wandering craftsperson with similar knowledge could perform the same function. Causal pressure is moderate, and specificity (pyrotechnician lineage, chanting ritual) adds texture without forcing a high-stakes decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The kerosene rag knot is introduced in the opening paragraph (grandmother's legacy), unpacked in the preparation beat (oilcloth wrapping, spiral pattern), and lit in the climax to produce the "waking spiral." It appears in three distinct beats, constrains Mira's method (gradual combustion vs. explosion), and charges the closure image. Specificity is high—the spiral pattern and its symbolic function are integral to the story's logic. The element is nearly indispensable: the closure's resonance depends on this exact object and its mechanics. Minor deduction: the knot does not impose a visible cost or trade-off; Mira's use is successful without complication.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mosaic note ("The sky is only sleeping. Wake it with what you know") is introduced at the midpoint and reframes Mira's wandering as purposeful invitation, shaping her decision to perform the ritual. It participates in setup (mosaic discovery), development (motivation shift), and payoff (she enacts the note's call). However, the note feels convenient—it declares the story's thesis rather than emerging from prior material—and its mechanics (who left it? why now?) remain opaque. Swappability is moderate: another trigger (overheard plea, childhood memory) could serve a similar function. The concept is present and functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The chant ("one, two, three, breathe; one, two, three, believe") appears in the opening paragraph and again during the powder-mixing preparation, guiding Mira's rhythm and grounding her in family tradition. It shapes two beats and reinforces her identity as keeper of craft knowledge. However, the chant does not constrain a choice or impose a cost—Mira never struggles with its rhythm, and its presence is atmospheric rather than mechanically decisive. The trait is present and consistent but could be swapped for another ritual gesture (specific hand movements, silent counting) without altering story logic. Closure participation is indirect: the chant primes the ritual but does not appear in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Filter" does not appear as an on-page action. The text mentions Mira "filtered color through flame" and "filtering the message from its medium" in metaphorical summary, but these are reflective labels rather than dramatized beats. The trait does not constrain a choice, enable a tactic, or shape the closure. Ornamental use without causal pressure. Late-appearing metaphor with no setup or payoff in action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Ambient awareness" appears once in summary ("let the words filter through her ambient awareness") without mechanics or consequences. The method is not signaled early, does not shape Mira's preparation or execution, and plays no role in the closure. Swappable with "careful consideration" or "focused attention" with no structural impact. The trait is ornamental, introduced late (second third), and disconnected from the story's causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fortress is introduced in the opening line and anchors all beats: gates, inner courtyard, mosaic floor, courtyard flagstones. The blooming flowers and crumbling stones contrast with the starless sky, and the incomplete phoenix mosaic directly motivates Mira's ritual choice. The courtyard provides the physical stage for the climax, and the fortress's abandonment allows Mira to act without interference. The setting constrains her choice (she performs the ritual here rather than in the villages) and charges the final image (spiral rising from ancient flagstones). The element is indispensable—removing the fortress would break the story's logic and symbolic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The starless night is the inciting condition, introduced in paragraph two ("stars had vanished three nights ago") and sustained through the preparation ("starless dark") to the closure. The timeframe tightens Mira's decision: the hush and darkness create urgency for her defiant light. The night shapes two beats (initial motivation, final lighting) and is present in the ending image ("one small light… sky full of stars deciding to wake up"). However, the time element does not impose a live clock or escalating deadline—Mira's preparation proceeds at her own pace. Cost is conceptual (waiting longer means more hopelessness) rather than immediate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "defy the gravity of hopelessness" is dramatized through Mira's journey, her ritual preparation, and the final lighting. It is signaled early ("hope itself had developed its own gravity," "darkness could be pierced") and drives her choice to perform the ritual despite the starless sky. The motivation shapes three beats (inciting condition, mosaic discovery, climax) and is present in the closure ("defiance made visible"). However, the motivation is earnest and uncontested—Mira never doubts her purpose or faces a trade-off between competing goods. Friction is external (atmospheric disturbance) rather than internal, lowering the felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Serious playfulness" is explicitly named in the preparation beat ("the serious playfulness that had sustained her") and implicitly present in the contrast between deadly craft and hopeful ritual. The tone modulates from lyric description (opening) to focused preparation (middle) to earnest culmination (ending), cohering through Mira's reverent yet defiant stance. However, the tone is declared rather than fully embodied—phrases like "simultaneously hopeless and magnificent" tell the paradox instead of letting it act in scene. The tone charges the final image (spiral as "question mark, like a reaching hand") but could be sharper if the playfulness materialized in a micro-choice or complication. Present across beats with moderate causal pressure.</comment>
