<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Varn's interiority reads as abstraction rather than embodied pressure: "turning questions into destinations" and "conflict into illumination" are philosophical labels, not contradictory impulses acting in scene. The younger scholar remains a convenience antagonist with no internality—his "desperate intensity" and "absolute certainty" are told traits. The mechanical arm backstory ("three years past," "limitation could become advantage") is summary-only reflection that does not anchor in present stimuli or tilt a present choice. Varn's final action—redirecting momentum with "superior understanding"—is asserted, not dramatized through micro-choices with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored by ~120 words (Varn, glass atrium, afternoon), but the narrative immediately switches to backstory about the mechanical arm without dramatizing the present confrontation. The closure unit—Varn's "breakthrough" via "superior understanding"—occurs off-page as summary: "he saw an opening... and with a precise movement that spoke volumes, he turned the younger scholar's momentum back upon itself." No decisive action or felt cost is legible; the scholar's "defeat" is abstract ("not in his body but in his certainty"). Lens ambiguity: the piece oscillates between causal (physical duel), accumulative (philosophical reflection), and situational (waiting), but the ending relies on assertion rather than dramatized transformation. Apply −0.4 for lens ambiguity and −0.5 for closure by summary rather than on-page cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The glass atrium, brook, and half-painted sundial are described but remain postcard scenery—none constrains a choice. The sundial's "coded angles" are mentioned three times but never decoded or used in tactics. The brook "continues its quiet flow" as ambient texture without affecting action. The mechanical arm is the only object with tactile presence ("caught and redirected"), but its function is asserted rather than shown constraining Varn's moves under pressure. Spatial choreography is vague: "circled each other" and "the opening" lack concrete positions or distances.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"whether knowledge remained a living process of discovery or calcified into rigid doctrine"—is abstract and never tested through on-page choice. The physical duel is summarized in one paragraph ("parried the first thrust," "their conflict escalated") without beats that narrow options. The "breakthrough" arrives via declaration ("he saw an opening") rather than earned escalation; the younger scholar lowers his weapon without visible cost or trade-off. No tightening under any lens: the confrontation is framed, summarized, then resolved by narrative fiat. Agency is summary-only.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme—questions as destinations, conflict as transformation—is stated four times in near-identical phrasing ("turning questions into destinations," "properly pursued, indeed became destinations"). The half-painted sundial and danish tin card are symbolic convenience, mentioned but never used to constrain choice or charge the closure. The ending offers no resonant reconfiguration: "Questions, properly pursued, indeed became destinations" is thesis echo, not earned wisdom from particulars. The "hidden overture" and "deeper truth beneath the surface dispute" are announced rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Narrative voice is stable but elevated to academic register throughout ("diplomatic intellectual," "philosophical discourse made manifest") without modulation under pressure. The danish tin card is withheld knowledge: "he had not yet needed to deploy its sharp edges" teases without payoff, violating POV modesty. Dialogue is absent. The younger scholar's interiority is asserted ("his certainty absolute") without access, creating a single-POV leak. Register drift: "veneer of scholarly politeness" and "rehabilitation teaching him that limitation could become advantage" read as narrator gloss rather than Varn's lived perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "turning questions into destinations" appears in paragraphs 2, 8, and 9 with minor variation; "the brook's quiet [murmur/conversation/flow]" recurs three times without added pressure. Synonym churn: "conflict" / "confrontation" / "struggle" cycle across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence in paragraph 5: "The mechanical arm had been... those early months... Now it served... its response time... its strength..." Filter-verb stack in paragraph 4: "understood," "learned," "responded." The closure paragraph stacks generic abstractions: "ongoing conversation between water and stone, between questions and answers, between what we know and what we have yet to discover." Apply −1.2 for loops and cadence runs, −0.3 for filter stacks in a high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core premise—dueling philosophers in a glass atrium—gestures at fresh synthesis but relies on template execution: mechanical arm as metaphor for transformation, half-painted sundial as wisdom symbol, younger scholar as foil with "absolute certainty." The duel is summarized rather than made specific through world logic or moral calculus. The danish tin card is Chekhov setup with no payoff, signaling checklist compliance over organic integration. The "hidden overture" and philosophical stakes remain abstract. Transformation test fails: swap "philosopher" for "scientist" and the arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Varn is present throughout and his philosopher identity frames the stakes, but his mechanical arm drives only one summarized action ("caught and redirected"). His decision-making is told ("he saw an opening") rather than shown through micro-choices. The arm appears in setup (paragraph 1), middle (paragraphs 4–5), and closure (paragraph 9), satisfying all three gates, but causal pressure is weak: the arm is described as advantageous yet never constrains tactics or creates visible cost. Swappability: replace "mechanical arm" with "refined technique" and the plot holds. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (cameo only) +0.3, minus swappability −0.6 and ornamental use −0.7 = 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The danish tin sewing needle card appears twice: setup (paragraph 1) and middle (paragraph 5), both as withheld knowledge ("in his pocket," "he had not yet needed to deploy"). It never returns at closure and does not constrain any on-page choice. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, minus late middle (paragraph 5 is ~55%) −0.3, ornamental use −1.0, resolves nothing −0.0 (it doesn't resolve) = 1.1. The withholding itself is a POV flaw scored in Q6; here it is simply non-functional. Adjusting for two-gate presence (setup + middle mention) yields 1.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Hidden overture" is named in paragraph 8 ("The hidden overture of their conflict—the deeper truth beneath the surface dispute—had been revealed") but never shapes stakes or tactics on the page. It is thematic label only, not a constraint or mechanic. Present in closure paragraph as echo ("ongoing conversation... what we have yet to discover"), but ornamental. Setup (implied in paragraph 2 "schism representing fundamental disagreements") +0.3, closure echo +0.4, minus label-only −0.8 and late explicit naming (paragraph 8) −0.5 = 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Diplomatically fierce" is introduced in paragraph 2 ("His reputation as a diplomatically fierce intellectual") and shown once in paragraph 4 ("Varn responded with the measured grace"). No visible tradeoff or cost tied to this trait; it is label plus one illustrative summary. Setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, closure linkage (implied in final image of "carrying forward the ongoing conversation") +0.3, minus label-only −0.5 and swappability (replace with "tactful yet unyielding") −0.6 = 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Fence" appears in setup (paragraph 2, "fenced with ideas"), is literalized in paragraph 4 ("parried the first thrust, metal catching metal"), and recurs in paragraph 8 ("he had fenced not to conquer but to convert"). It drives the central action but is summarized rather than dramatized in beats: "their conflict escalated" lacks on-page moves. Setup +0.6, two beats (paragraph 4 summary, paragraph 8 reflection) +0.9, closure participation (paragraph 8) +0.9, causal pressure (weak, since the duel is told) +0.5, minus summary-only −0.8 and swappability (any combat verb would work) −0.6 = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"Coded angles in a half-painted sundial" is introduced in paragraph 1, recurs as static image in paragraphs 3, 4, and 7, but is never decoded or used in tactics. Paragraph 7 claims "The half-painted sundial's shadows shifted, revealing patterns that had been hidden in plain sight" but does not show what was revealed or how it mattered. Setup +0.6, three ornamental beats +1.4, closure cameo (paragraph 9 "the half-painted sundial completing its silent instruction") +0.3, minus ornamental use −1.0 and resolves nothing it helped create −0.7 = 1.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The glass atrium and brook are anchored in paragraph 1 and recur in paragraphs 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9, but function as ambient scenery. Neither constrains choice or supplies resources: the atrium's glass and the brook's murmur are texture only. Setup +0.7, five beats (ornamental) +1.4, closure participation (paragraph 9 "The brook's quiet murmur continued") +0.5, minus ornamental use −1.0 and no tactical impact −0.8 = 3.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"While waiting" is signaled in the title phrase "Professor Aldric Varn waited" (paragraph 1) but time is not tracked or used to tighten decisions. The duel occurs in a vague "afternoon" with no clock pressure. The younger scholar "emerged from the treeline" (paragraph 3), ending the wait, but no tactic or cost is tied to elapsed time. Setup +0.4, one beat (end of wait) +0.4, minus vague/untracked time −0.7 = 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"To turn questions into destinations" is Varn's stated motivation (paragraph 2, "turning questions into destinations was the essence of his philosophical approach") and recurs in paragraphs 8 and 9. It is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices: Varn's actions are asserted as illustrating this desire without on-page friction between cost and want. Setup +0.6, three beats (paragraphs 2, 8, 9) +1.4, closure participation (paragraph 9) +0.7, minus told-only −0.9 and no visible friction −0.6 = 3.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Dignified chaos" is implied through juxtaposition of "measured grace" (paragraph 4) and "profound struggle" (paragraph 6), and the contrast between the "quiet brook" and "mounting intellectual hostility" (paragraph 3). Tone modulates across setup, conflict, and resolution, charging the final image of "quiet murmur" continuing. Setup (paragraph 1 "diffused afternoon light" vs. "distant thunder") +0.6, modulation across three beats +0.9, closure participation (paragraph 9 "quiet murmur continued") +0.8, coherence through turns +0.7, minus single implied rather than sustained tension −0.5 = 4.7.</comment>
