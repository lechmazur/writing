<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's pacifist stance is declared but not tested through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—she simply refuses violence without internal friction. The cellular-memory mechanism arrives as exposition rather than emerging through embodied choice. Kael's resentment is told ("calcified his heart") rather than shown through micro-choices that reveal competing values. The final release feels asserted by authorial fiat rather than earned through prior dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The closure—pin reappearing when grace settles—lands on the page with a clear before/after, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt; we see no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (reality-shifting imagery accumulates until the final settling), held consistently. Orientation is delayed: "where light bent at impossible angles" establishes place only atmospherically; who Mira is and what she's doing remain unclear past the 120-word mark, triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The "grace" mechanism is explained late rather than demonstrated through prior constraints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sanctuary's soundless property and shifting boundaries are vivid but function as backdrop rather than constraining choices—Mira and Kael converse freely despite "all vibration" being consumed. Spatial choreography is impressionistic (corner "ceased existing," garden "suddenly" appears) without consistent rules that shape tactics. The music box as micro-setting object does charge the final image, lifting the score slightly, but the larger environment remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—convince Kael to release resentment—is signaled early but escalates through exposition rather than protagonist agency under pressure. The shifting intensifies around them, yet neither character's choices narrow options or force trade-offs; Kael simply closes his eyes and the world responds. No visible price is paid: the pin "gleamed as grace settled" without sacrifice or foreclosed alternative. The tightening is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (resentment as self-built cage, grace that shifts and redistributes) emerges from the central image rather than direct statement, which is strong. However, the ending resolves into a tidy moral—release resentment and the world heals—without ambiguity or cost that complicates the lesson. The cellular-memory conceit and shifting-grace metaphor remain parallel rather than interpenetrating. The garden-roses resurrection offers a resonant image but one that grants symmetric satisfaction without undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic: "light bent at impossible angles," "walls breathed with borrowed time" could belong to any narrator in speculative settings. Dialogue carries some subtext ("That seems pointless now") but Kael's lines often explain rather than pursue goals. The prose rhythm is controlled, yet diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("谋划" insertion feels like an artifact; "calcified his heart" and "architecture" as metaphor read strained). Filter verbs ("She had studied," "She touched") are present but not excessive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops: "Reality is falling apart" echoes the prior paragraph's "fracture in reality"; "not in my mind—in my cells" restates the cellular-memory claim in adjacent beats (−0.4). Mixed metaphor: "resentment calcified his heart into something the changing world could not touch"—calcification implies brittleness, yet "could not touch" implies imperviousness (−0.5). Template cadence in mid-section: "The space where...gaped," "You are broken," "Was made out of..." (−0.3). Cumulative line-level debt totals −1.2. The closure beat is clean, so non-closure cap applies: base ~7.1 reduced to 5.9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core premise—shifting grace and cellular memory—combines familiar speculative tropes (reality bending, memory-as-mechanism) without a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable. The emotional arc (sibling reconciliation via magical forgiveness) follows a template path with the music box serving as convenient magic rather than a constraint the characters must work within. The "scheming pacifist" frame is declared but not explored through contradictory action. One fresh inflection: the "grace shifts to you, then to me" reframes parental favoritism, but it arrives as explanation rather than discovery.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is labeled a "scheming pacifist" in the opening, but her schemes are recounted ("she had been scheming since the first fracture") rather than shown through on-page tactical choices. Her pacifism constrains rhetoric ("I refuse to fight you") but does not force a visible trade-off or narrow options—she simply talks and Kael listens. She appears in setup, middle dialogue, and closure, satisfying two gates, but her decisions do not drive key turns; Kael's internal shift and the world's response happen around her rather than because of specific choices she makes under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken music box and missing cylinder pin appear in setup (paragraph 1), middle (Mira holds it out, Kael examines the gap), and closure (pin reappears, box plays). The object's brokenness creates the central problem and its repair signals resolution, placing it causally. However, the pin's return is passive—grace settles and it "gleamed"—rather than earned through character action tied to the object's properties. Swappability is low (the specific mechanism matters to the cellular-memory conceit), lifting the score, but the object does not constrain tactics in the middle beats; it is discussed more than used.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Shifting grace" is named and visualized repeatedly: walls become sky, doorway becomes window/mirror, garden reappears. It provides atmospheric pressure and is described as moving "without warning or mercy," yet it does not force Mira or Kael to adapt tactics or make hard choices—they stand and talk while reality reorganizes around them. The concept participates in closure (grace "settled" and "distributed"), but as passive backdrop rather than active constraint. Present across all three gates but primarily thematic rather than stake-shaping.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Reappears when needed" is articulated by Mira ("objects and people reappeared when needed elsewhere in the sanctuary") and demonstrated once at closure when the cylinder pin reappears. The rule is explained rather than discovered through failed attempts or visible cost. It does not constrain middle choices—no one searches, trades, or sacrifices to trigger reappearance; the pin simply materializes when Kael releases resentment. Functional in one beat (closure) but swappable with any convenient magic rule.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Convince" is the explicit action driving the scene: Mira says "I need to convince you of something" and the dialogue that follows is structured as persuasion. The final turn—Kael closing his eyes and the pin reappearing—follows her argument about cellular memory. However, the convincing succeeds through exposition rather than through dramatized pressure that forces Kael to choose between competing goods. The action shapes the scene's structure and participates in closure, satisfying all three gates, but could be replaced with "heal," "remind," or "forgive" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Cellular memory" is named explicitly in the second half ("The music lives in you still... in your cellular memory") and provides the logic for the pin's return, linking it to closure. However, it appears only as explanation—Mira tells Kael the mechanism rather than demonstrating it through prior attempts or embodied sensation. No middle beat shows cellular memory constraining or enabling action; it is invoked once to justify the ending. Present in setup (implicit: "pulse beneath skin that had been someone else's arm") and closure but absent from development, capping at 4.6; swappability and summary-only use reduce further.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The "soundless sanctuary" is named and its properties (consumes vibration, walls are boundaries between what-was and could-be) are established early. It provides atmospheric texture and the shifting-grace effect occurs within it, but the setting does not constrain choices—Mira and Kael speak freely despite the claim that "no sound emerged." The sanctuary's rules (objects reappear when needed) are told rather than tested. It frames all three gates but functions more as backdrop than tactical pressure, though its final "held its breath" moment charges the closure image slightly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"While reality shifts" structures the entire scene—the shifting begins before the story opens ("since the first fracture"), intensifies during the conversation ("shifting slowed, then stopped"), and resolves at closure. The timeframe creates urgency (reality is falling apart) and is dramatized through changing setting details (corner vanishes, garden appears). However, no live countdown or ticking consequence forces faster decisions; the shifting happens around the characters without altering their tactics. Present across all gates and causally linked to closure (world stabilizes when Kael releases resentment), but pressure is atmospheric rather than decision-shaping.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach resentment to release" is articulated by Mira and drives her dialogue: she explains how resentment "served no purpose, changed nothing, only poisoned the vessel." Kael's arc moves from "resentment calcified his heart" to releasing it at closure. However, the desire is declared rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—Mira wants to convince, and she does, with no visible cost or friction between competing values. The motivation shapes the conversation's content but does not generate trade-offs or tactics under pressure. Present in all gates but execution is tell-heavy.</comment>
