<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aldric's weariness and professional dedication are embodied through his stubborn adherence to old mortuary methods and the "persistent ache behind his ribs." His choice to engage with the souls shows motivated action, and the revitalization he feels ("The ache behind his ribs was beginning to fade") demonstrates earned change. However, the transformation feels somewhat rushed—his shift from tired to "ready" lacks intermediate micro-choices that would ground the internal contradiction more deeply. The final stance crystallizes cleanly but the path there could show more struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a causal-situational hybrid lens: the package arrives → Aldric touches the lens → he is transported → he performs his work → the lens repairs → he returns changed. Orientation anchors (Thursday, Pemberton Street, undertaker) land early. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Aldric's long-chased stillness "finally found him" and he shifts from tired to ready, with the lens now a permanent tool. The cost is visible—he has committed to an impossible vocation—but the ending's "he was ready" declaration feels slightly告知-like rather than fully embodied in a final image or action that makes the cost undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The underwater library is vividly rendered ("Bookshelves rose like ribs from the seafloor") and the impossible throne-chair provides a concrete constraint for the ritual work. Sensory details—sand that "smelled of salt," water to his waist, "gray-green and forgotten" light—are specific and filtered through Aldric's professional lens. The lens itself functions as a recurring object that charges the closure. However, spatial choreography in the underwater scene could be tighter, and the transition mechanics (how he moves between worlds) remain vague, limiting the setting's pressure on his choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—helping lost souls find rest—is signaled by the distress-signal framing and Aldric's profession. Pressure coheres: he recognizes the need, engages with each soul individually, and the work restores his own sense of purpose. One meaningful deepening occurs when "the ache behind his ribs was beginning to fade, replaced by something that felt almost like purpose restored." The cost is implied (he now bears this impossible responsibility permanently) but lacks a visible on-page price at the closure beat—no forfeited option or trade-off is dramatized in the final paragraph, only the calm acceptance of waiting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—finding rest, both for the dead and the living; the reciprocal nature of care—emerges organically from Aldric's work and is charged by the lens repair as souls pass through. The image of the lens "glowing softly with a light that would never go dark" offers a resonant answer to the question of how to honor the unrecovered. Subtext operates in "the ways that required him to spend real time" and the shift from weariness to readiness. However, the final phrase "he discovered that he wasn't tired anymore" edges toward direct statement rather than letting the image alone carry the thematic weight, and "He was ready" feels slightly thesis-like.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and distinct: "a man who had spent thirty years helping the departed find their way to whatever came next" establishes Aldric's measured, professional cadence. The prose modulates effectively under pressure ("translucent and confused, their memories tangled with salt and storm"). Psychic distance remains stable in close third. One minor slip: "bubble-doubled" is a creative coinage that slightly disrupts the established register without clear voice motivation. Dialogue ("I'm here") is minimal but apt. The perceptual signature—seeing through an undertaker's lens—shapes what is noticed and valued throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. The opening "which was unusual because nothing ever arrived for Aldric Vane anymore" efficiently establishes isolation and stakes. However, several template stems recur: "His hands had grown steady... his eyes had grown tired... his heart had grown something else" creates parallel scaffolding that feels mechanical. "A sound like a foghorn, distant and mournful" and "swollen and strange" lean toward stock phrasing. The phrase "wasn't quite a chair, wasn't quite a throne, but occupied both states at once" is clever but the repetition of "impossible" (impossible space, impossible light, impossible throne-chair, impossible lens) in close proximity becomes a minor loop. The closure paragraph is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of undertaker + lighthouse disaster + underwater library + soul-guiding is specific and non-obvious. The lens as both literal and metaphorical tool avoids easy symbolism through its tactile presence and repair mechanic. Aldric's stubborn adherence to old methods gains fresh resonance when applied to impossible work. However, the underwater-library-as-liminal-space and the wise-tired-professional-finds-renewal arc both draw from familiar templates. The piece transforms these through Aldric's occupational specificity and the lens's concrete function, but the emotional arc (weary → revitalized → ready) follows a predictable trajectory without a sharp turn that redefines expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aldric's weariness shapes his recognition of the distress signal and his willingness to engage. His professional skill (listening to each soul individually) drives the middle work. His final choice to "wait" with the lens establishes the new vocation. Present in setup (introduced paragraph one), development (his listening work), and payoff (sitting to wait). Two beats: recognition/transport and the sustained work. Causal: his expertise enables the resolution. Closure: "sitting by the window to wait" is his active stance. Cost: implicit (permanent responsibility) but not sharply visible. Strong integration with minor cost-visibility gap.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lens appears in setup (opens the package), development (sits in his lap throughout the work, "pieces slowly knitting together"), and payoff (whole and glowing, "a signal that would call him"). Three distinct beats: arrival/触发 transport, repair-as-progress-tracker, transformed tool at closure. Causal: its brokenness signals the unfinished work; its wholeness marks completion. Irreplaceable: the parabolic lighthouse shape and repair mechanic are specific. The lens directly shapes the final image. Strong integration across all gates with visible cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "distress signal, not for ships but for something else" explicitly names the concept in paragraph four. Development: the concept motivates Aldric's understanding and frames his work. Payoff: the repaired lens becomes "a signal that would call him when someone needed help." Two beats: recognition and closure tool. The concept shapes his tactics (listening, helping souls find "permanent address") and alters his vocation. Moderate causal pressure. Solid integration but slightly abstract—its presence is more thematic than a lived constraint that narrows options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "inadvertently stubborn in his methods, refusing the new chemical embalming techniques" appears early. Development: the trait enables his recognition of the souls' need (old ways = real time with the dead). Payoff: implied in his acceptance of the impossible work, though not explicitly invoked. One clear beat: his professional stubbornness qualifies him. Modest causal role—it explains why he was chosen but doesn't constrain a choice under pressure in the underwater scene. The trait is told rather than shown through a difficult decision. Present in two gates with limited mid-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: hinted at ("the ache behind his ribs") and his sense of being drained. Development: "It was revitalizing in a way he hadn't expected—not for them, though for them too, but for himself. The ache behind his ribs was beginning to fade, replaced by something that felt almost like purpose restored." Payoff: "he discovered that he wasn't tired anymore. He was ready." Three beats: initial weariness, mid-work revitalization, final readiness. The action redefines his stake from passive weariness to active purpose. Strong causal and closure linkage. The transformation could be more embodied—it's largely told—but it drives the arc and is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: the lens triggers the transport ("when he looked up, he was standing in water"). Development: the underwater library and throne-chair are impossible spaces where his work occurs; the space "somehow held both him and them at once." Payoff: he returns to Pemberton Street, the package gone. Two beats: entry and sustained work in the impossible space. The method is signaled and its mechanics (overlapping states, suspension) matter thematically. Moderate causal role—the space enables the work but doesn't force tactical choices. The impossibility is more atmospheric than constraining. Solid integration with room for sharper mechanical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: introduced paragraph four, described paragraph five ("bookshelves rose like ribs," "swollen and strange" books, throne-chair). Development: the library provides the venue for Aldric's work; the throne-chair "held both him and them at once." Payoff: setting detail (the glowing lens, the cold coffee back on Pemberton Street) brackets the closure. Two beats: arrival/description and the sustained work environment. Causal: the setting enables the ritual but doesn't sharply constrain choices—Aldric could theoretically do this work elsewhere. The library is vivid and thematically resonant (knowledge, preservation, forgetting) but functions more as backdrop than tactical pressure. Strong atmospheric integration with moderate causal force.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: "The package arrived on a Thursday" and "after the mysterious package arrives" frame the temporal window. Development: "By the time the last soul had passed through" marks progression but no live clock tightens decisions. Payoff: "When Aldric returned... his coffee had finally gone cold" provides a subtle time marker. One beat: the cold coffee implies elapsed time and closure. The timeframe is present but largely passive—no urgency or countdown pressures Aldric's choices. The "Thursday" and "morning that had already stretched into afternoon" establish tone more than tactical constraint. Present in two gates with minimal pressure application.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: the souls "had been searching ever since for someone to help them find their way." Development: Aldric helps each soul "release" their stories and "pass through—on to whatever came next, given the permanent address Aldric had helped them find." Payoff: the lens "would call him when someone needed help finding their way." Three beats: recognition, sustained work, permanent vocation. The desire is dramatized through action (listening, helping) and the cost is felt (he's now committed forever). The "permanent address" phrase recurs with reweighted meaning. Strong causal and closure linkage with visible cost and embodied pursuit. Minor gap: the souls' desire is more present than Aldric's internal friction about taking on this burden.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: "The stillness he had chased for so long" and the "persistent ache" establish his weary pursuit. Development: the underwater work brings revitalization; "the ache behind his ribs was beginning to fade." Payoff: "The stillness he had chased for so long had finally found him." The tone shifts from weary searching to calm readiness, modulating with the arc. Two beats: opening weariness and closure stillness. The phrase "chased stillness" is specific and the reprise charges the final image. Moderate causal role—the tone reflects rather than drives choices. Solid lyric integration with purposeful modulation, though the tone is more decorative than a constraint that narrows options under pressure.</comment>
