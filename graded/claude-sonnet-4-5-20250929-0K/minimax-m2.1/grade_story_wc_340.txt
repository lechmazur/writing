<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's "warmly inquisitive" trait is established early and drives the central choice to examine the goggles, though her decision to read the diary feels under-motivated given seven years of service discipline. Her interior response to discovering Jansen's grief and hidden daughter is embodied and particular ("a strange tenderness"), and the final choice to keep the secret carries visible renunciation cost. The character arc from dutiful servant to compassionate keeper-of-secrets is clean, but the violation-of-privacy beat passes without sufficient internal friction to justify the breach.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening lines. The elevator's ascent structures pressure as a tightening window, and the diary discovery deepens Mira's understanding in a single meaningful intensification. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira's decision to return the goggles silently forecloses the path of confrontation or revelation, and the final image—"this one small errand of mercy"—reweights her role with felt cost (she now carries unspoken knowledge). The cost is conceptual and relational, made legible in the closing beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The brass elevator, frosted glass panels scattering light, and the observation deck's "frozen splendor of the clouds" create a coherent airship-era atmosphere. Spatial choreography is clean: Mira holds goggles, pries open the compartment, reads while ascending, then steps onto the deck. The elevator's groaning cables and the shuddering at the sixth floor embed tactile detail without postcard excess. The setting constrains choice via the ascending timeframe and the light shift that enables cipher-breaking, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to intrude on Jansen's privacy or honor the accidental discovery. The diary's hidden compartment and Mira's choice to open it constitute the inciting pressure; the cipher's unfolding and revelation of grief/joy deepen her understanding in one meaningful turn. Agency is renunciation: she closes the diary, returns it with "nothing more than her usual brief nod," and accepts the burden of silent knowledge—a visible cost (carrying unspoken intimacy) that alters her stance toward Jansen. The escalation is modest but coherent under the Accumulative lens, and the final choice forecloses confrontation with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the interplay of duty, curiosity, grief masked by command, and the choice to honor another's hidden joy. The final image—"this one small errand of mercy"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing: service can be witness, and compassion can live in silence. The "joy beneath anguish" motif seeds early (Mira's trait) and pays off when she grasps Jansen's dual states (loss/hope) and decides to carry his secret. No thematic echo or explicit thesis mars the ending; the reconfiguration is implicit and earned through Mira's interior shift and the charged final line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited with stable distance and a clear perceptual signature: Mira notices "the groans of the old airship" and filters light through her context ("warmly inquisitive by nature"). Psychic distance modulates cleanly as emotion rises. However, two sentence-opening patterns recur heavily: "The [noun]" openers (brass elevator, entries, elevator again, observation deck doors) and participial constructions ("wondering if," "feeling as though") that create mild template cadence. The voice remains coherent and the POV is modesty-controlled, but the syntactic uniformity slightly dulls the rhythmic variation expected at 7.5+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are mostly strong, with sentences doing double duty (e.g., "She held the captain's goggles in her hands—Jansen had forgotten them in the mess hall again" anchors object, character, and motive). However, line-level issues accumulate: (1) Paraphrase loop in the opening two sentences (both note the elevator's groaning; the second adds "ancient cables" but restates the climb). (2) The penultimate sentence runs 68 words with stacked subordinate clauses that slightly obscure the core action. (3) Mixed metaphor: "stepped into the light...into the quiet space where a man had trusted his sorrow to leather and brass"—the spatial metaphor (stepping into light/space) clashes with the trust metaphor (confiding to materials). These artifacts do not touch the closure beat directly but spread across mid-story and penultimate lines, warranting a −0.8 cumulative deduction per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The airship setting and encrypted-diary premise offer a steampunk-adjacent frame that is competently executed but familiar. The transformation lies in the specific emotional stakes—Jansen's hidden daughter and the servant's choice to honor secrecy—which personalizes the template. The final reconfiguration (servant as silent witness/mercy-bringer) is earned but not entirely non-obvious; the "errand of mercy" closing phrase borders on overt articulation. No close echoes of famous scenes, and the cipher-as-metaphor for hidden emotion is deft. Risk-taking is modest: the story commits to its premise without structural boldness, landing in the solid mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira ("ascending servant") is present throughout, makes the key choice to read and then to keep the secret, and the final image centers her realization of mercy. Setup clear, middle choice (to read) and ending choice (to return silently) both hinge on her role. Specificity is moderate: "servant" could be slightly more irreplaceable, but "ascending" ties to the elevator motif and her internal climb. Two distinct beats, closure linkage strong, cost visible. No major frictions; band guidance suggests 6.5–7.0 range.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The goggles appear early (opening paragraph), house the hidden diary (middle beat), and Mira "pressed [them] to her chest" in the final image, reweighting them from forgotten item to vessel of trust. Three distinct beats, causal pressure (discovery enables the arc), closure linkage (final embodied gesture), and specificity (only goggles with temple compartment could hold the diary). Setup/development/payoff all present. Strong integration; nearing 8.0 but slightly below indispensability since the vessel could theoretically be another forgotten object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The diary's encryption and Mira's decoding shape the middle revelation beat and enable her understanding of Jansen's dual grief/joy, which drives the ending choice to honor his secret. Setup (discovery at beat 2), development (cipher breaks in rising light), payoff (knowledge informs final mercy). Causal role in two beats, closure participation indirect but necessary (she couldn't honor a secret she didn't read). Moderate irreplaceability: a plain diary would reduce the ingenuity angle. Two-of-three gates met, nearing three.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Warmly inquisitive" is named early, enables the choice to pry open the compartment ("a trait that had gotten her into trouble more than once, but one she could not seem to shake"), and the closing reflection on understanding Jansen echoes the warmth. Setup and payoff present; middle cost is implicit (violating privacy) but not sharply dramatized as a visible price tied to the trait itself. One strong beat (opening the compartment), lyric reprise at closure. Label-only mention in opening clause lowers impact slightly; −0.3 for partial telling rather than full embodiment of cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Unfold" governs the central action: "the pages seemed to unfold beneath her touch of their own accord" and she reads as symbols "began to rearrange themselves in her mind." The unfolding structures the middle revelation and enables the ending choice. Setup implicit (holding the diary), development strong (reading/decoding), payoff indirect (knowledge carried forward). One major beat with strong causal role; closure participation is knowledge-based. Moderate swappability ("open" or "reveal" could substitute with edits). Two gates clear, nearing three.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through scattered light" appears early ("sunlight fractured into a thousand fragments, scattering across the elevator walls") and recurs at the decoding beat ("as the elevator climbed higher and the light grew stronger...the symbols began to rearrange themselves"). Setup and development clear; method shapes the cipher-breaking tactic. Payoff weaker: the final observation-deck light is atmospheric but doesn't causally hinge on scattering. Two beats, moderate causal pressure, partial closure linkage. Lyric reprise (light → light) adds resonance but not irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "icebound spire above the clouds" is named in the opening ("Meridian Spire") and the observation deck's "frozen splendor of the clouds" closes the piece, framing the ascent. The spire itself doesn't constrain a middle choice—the elevator interior does the spatial work—but the icy, cloud-bound atmosphere charges the final image. Setup and payoff present; middle development absent (the elevator, not the spire, is the active setting). Lyric reprise across first and last paragraphs reweights Mira's climb as metaphorical. One gate missed; lands mid-6s per band guidance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The elevator's ten-floor ascent structures the narrative clock: "sixth floor" shudder mid-read, "tenth floor" chime at decision point, creating urgency for Mira's choice to finish reading before arrival. Setup clear (opening line), development (time pressure during decoding), payoff (doors open, forcing closure of the reading window). Three beats, strong causal shaping of tactics, live clock. Specificity high (ten floors = ~minutes), cost tied to deadline. All three gates, strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To seek out the joy beneath anguish" is articulated in the penultimate paragraph ("she too knew what it meant to seek out the joy beneath anguish") and governs the thematic throughline: Mira discovers Jansen's joy (hidden daughter) beneath his grief (wife's death) and chooses to honor both. Setup implicit (her inquisitive nature), payoff explicit in the reflection. Development weaker: the motivation is told rather than tested by a visible friction between wanting to know and fearing the cost. One strong beat (ending reflection), partial causal role. Two gates (setup/payoff), nearing 7.0 but told-heavy lowers embodiment score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" is sustained throughout: warm attention to Jansen's plight without melodrama, and the narration maintains reflective distance even during emotional discovery ("a strange tenderness"). Tone modulates slightly (grows warmer at the daughter revelation) and charges the final image ("this one small errand of mercy"). Setup (opening professional distance), development (warmed by discovery), payoff (mercy framed with restrained affection). Coherent across beats, modulates under pressure, shapes closure. Strong tonal control; nearing 7.5 but not quite indispensable since a similar restraint could be achieved with alternate phrasing.</comment>
