<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren's core motivation to understand emotion through "borrowed personalities" is established, but her interior life remains abstract—we see her method described more than we feel contradictory impulses acting in scene. The borrowed-personality mechanism is explained rather than dramatized with embodied cost; when she holds the halo fragment and "felt her own personality begin to borrow," the moment tells us the process rather than showing a specific emotional collision. The final smile "with seventeen borrowed personalities and her own" reads as a summary label rather than earned transformation with visible internal cost. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship dynamics cannot be evaluated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens—stars vanish, the halo fragment appears, Maren's workshop continues—building density through repeated cosmic imagery and the mathematics-of-emotion premise. Orientation is delayed: we learn "Maren" and "topaz workshop" early, but "where" and "when" remain dreamlike; the disorientation feels purposeful (supporting the "deliberate ambiguity" method) and coheres with the tone, so I waive the Orientation Test penalty. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren becomes transparent, the fragment dissolves, and her work "continued...an endless transcription of questions"—but the cost is conceptual (she becomes light) rather than a visible forfeiture that alters prior options on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification suffices, and the final paragraph does reweight the opening's sorrow and patience; however, the Cost Proof Test reveals no exact sentence where Maren loses a concrete capability, relationship, or choice—she gains liberation, which reads more as reward than cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The topaz workshop, amber light, and roofless space are vivid and purposeful, filtering perception through Maren's seventeen-year familiarity and the cosmic event. The halo fragment as micro-setting object constrains her final choice (she holds it, borrows from it, becomes transparent). Spatial choreography is clean within the single location, and the vanishing stars create a temporal-atmospheric frame that charges the ending. The 9+ gate (environment/object constrains choice or charges final image) is met by the fragment's dissolution, lifting the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the mathematics of emotion—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the vanishing stars and the halo fragment's arrival, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows Maren's options; she continues her transcription work without visible obstacle or trade-off. The ending crystallizes her methodology ("endless transcription of questions") but does not foreclose a path or impose a felt cost—she smiles and her workshop glows, which reads as confirmation rather than renunciation or decisive change. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices, and the stars' final vanishing does reweight the opening's condition; however, the lack of a visible price (time, tool, social credit, or internal contradiction forcing a hard choice) keeps this in mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (the mathematics of emotion, the necessity of empathy through self-erasure) emerges organically from Maren's methodology and the cosmic frame. The halo fragment and vanishing stars function as motifs that reweight at closure: the fragment dissolves, the stars finish disappearing, and Maren's smile signals understanding—"not a single answer but an endless transcription of questions." The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, phrases like "disorient through deliberate ambiguity" and "arithmetic of the soul" veer toward abstract philosophizing rather than arising solely from scene particulars, and the seventeen-personalities detail is told rather than dramatized with specific emotional friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; Maren's perceptual signature (amber light as "condition of perception," emotions as mathematics) is consistent and purposeful. The prose carries a distinct lyric-intellectual texture, and non-standard compression ("The process disorient through deliberate ambiguity") is pattern-taught and legible. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("transposed empathy," "emotional signatures," "interior architecture") that, while voice-motivated, risks register mismatch with embodied scene work. No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and sentence openings vary, but several passages loop conceptually: "mathematics of emotion" appears in multiple forms (arithmetic of the soul, emotional signatures, transposed empathy) without advancing new pressure. The line "The process disorient through deliberate ambiguity" omits a verb ("disorients"), reading as either purposeful compression or a grammatical slip; if intentional, the effect is not taught early enough to feel confident. Stock metaphors appear ("tear from something that could no longer hold its sorrow") and figurative density is high in the opening paragraph without pattern-teaching or strong payoff. Information density is present but scaffold sentences ("She had discovered what she set out to find") summarize rather than dramatize the closure beat, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—cosmic event as metaphor for epistemic labor, "borrowed personalities" as craft method—is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template plotting. The topaz workshop, halo fragment, and vanishing stars combine into a coherent fantastical frame. However, the core emotional arc (solitary figure achieves understanding through methodical work) is familiar, and the piece does not transform it with grounded interpersonal friction or a visible cost that forces a hard renunciation. The final image (Maren smiling, workshop glowing) feels more like arrival than struggle, which lowers ingenuity in character stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Maren operates the letterpress (opening line), but the press itself does not drive a key turn or choice—she produces "proofs...encoded in symbols" as ongoing work, not as a decision point. Present across setup and development, but ornamental to escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears in setup (night three), is handled at the midpoint ("picked up...held it against her chest"), and dissolves in the closure image, reweighting its initial sorrow into liberation. It appears in three distinct beats and its properties (glowing, warming, dissolving) matter causally. Strong integration, though the dissolution is more symbolic confirmation than a choice it constrains.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Transposed empathy is explained in the second paragraph ("temporarily inhabiting emotional signatures") and mentioned at closure ("empathy could be transposed"), but the mechanics do not shape an on-page choice or tactic—Maren describes having done it, rather than doing it under pressure. Present in setup and thematic payoff, missing middle causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The trait is introduced early ("learned to borrow personalities") and counted at the end ("seventeen borrowed personalities"), but we never see a specific personality borrowed in scene with a visible cost or constraint. Functional setup and thematic closure mention, but no middle beat where the borrowing alters a tactic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Disorient" appears as a method label ("The process disorient through deliberate ambiguity") but is not dramatized as an action Maren performs; we are told she "learned to navigate that disorientation," which is summary, not scene. The action itself does not drive a turn or redefine options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Through deliberate ambiguity" is signaled in the third paragraph as Maren's navigation method, and the piece's own tonal and syntactic ambiguity enacts it. However, the method does not shape a specific attempt or choice under pressure—it describes her past learning and present style, not a tactical decision. Present as frame, weak as causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The topaz workshop is named early, its roofless condition and amber light constrain perception, and it "continued to glow" in the closure image. The workshop frames all action and its properties (light, presses, roofless exposure to stars) shape the stakes. Strong setup and closure participation, though it does not force a middle choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Between vanishing stars" bookends the story (paragraph two and five) and the timeframe tightens as "the last star vanished." The temporal frame is poetic and shapes the ending's charge. Present in setup and payoff with tonal weight, though it does not tighten a middle decision in real-time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Maren's desire "to understand the mathematics of emotion" is stated in the second paragraph and dramatized through her methodology (widow's ring, child's toy, soldier's tag). The ending declares she "discovered what she set out to find," fulfilling the motivation. Present across all three gates, but the fulfillment is told ("she had discovered") rather than shown through a conflicted choice with friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Lucid turbulence" is enacted through controlled syntax carrying cosmic imagery and emotional abstraction; tone remains coherent and modulates with the stars' disappearance. The final paragraph's calm glow contrasts with earlier sorrow, and the turbulence-to-clarity arc charges the ending. Tone shapes atmosphere and final image without explicit declaration, meeting setup, development, and payoff.</comment>
