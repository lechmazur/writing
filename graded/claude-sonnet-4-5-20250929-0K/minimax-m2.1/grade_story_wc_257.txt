<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority carries voice-specific texture ("scattered like crushed pearls"), and the mentor backstory anchors her present practice. The offering of the pendant demonstrates micro-choice. However, the new arrival remains a passive foil without distinct contradiction or resistance; she cycles through confusion-recognition-wonder in a single beat without embodied friction. The closure choice ("come... meet yourself") lacks visible internal cost or foreclosure—Elara's stance doesn't shift from centuries of practice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—starlight, curtains, origami coordinates build a pattern of guidance-through-grief. Orientation anchors (Elara, observatory, "tonight") land early. The closure image ("stepped through toward whatever came next") offers Charged Poise but the cost remains abstract; no on-page forfeiture or tactic change marks the threshold. The because/therefore chain from origami → new arrival → pendant → stepping through reads more as inevitable procession than a narrowing choice that closes a prior path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory's marble, starlight through windows, and curtains of intention are vivid and consistent. The vellum stencil (tucked into belt, examined) functions as micro-setting and recurs at closure with tactile presence. The garden "where nothing grew because nothing needed to" supplies purposeful constraint. Spatial choreography (workshop → spiral stairs → entrance hall) tracks cleanly, and the pendant's withered flower is handled on the page, charging the final exchange.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: guiding the new arrival toward illumination. The tightening occurs when Elara descends and offers the pendant—a single meaningful gesture. Yet the new arrival's acceptance unfolds without resistance or complication; no reversal tests Elara's centuries of practice. The cost is implied but not legible: we don't see what Elara forfeits or how this encounter differs from prior guidances. The promise to "meet yourself, a few years from now" is declaration, not on-page constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (mourning as practice, not destination) emerges through the pendant's "between dying and death" image and the observatory's designed purpose. The closing line resists moralizing and uses the curtains-of-intention motif to reweight the question. "Mourning never truly ends—but neither does love" risks platitude but the pendant's genuinely artificial/entirely real paradox roots it in concrete particulars. Subtext operates in "subdued ardor" and the unspoken teacher's dissolution into light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited on Elara. Diction ("curtains of intention," "vertigo," "subdued ardor") is distinctive and consistent. The pendant dialogue carries subtext (offering a relic of grief as welcome). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from reflective opening to present-scene action. Filter verbs ("sensed," "understood," "watched") cluster but remain voice-motivated. The new arrival's translucent flicker is shown through Elara's perception without head-hopping. Rhythm varies between contemplative backstory and present beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum generally strong; sentences advance character and atmosphere. "Hollowed out and scattered like crushed pearls" and "the bottom had no floor" are vivid. However, paraphrase loops appear: "mourning jewelry maker" recurs five times; "curtains of intention" appears four times in identical phrasing without pressure variation. Template cadence: "She had arrived... She collected... She descended... She approached... She touched..." clusters in adjacent paragraphs. Figurative density ("gossamer barriers," "starlight poured," "essence everywhere") is high but legible. No major artifacts touch closure, so cap non-closure deductions at −0.4 per accumulation rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The observatory-as-mourning-sanctuary and "genuinely artificial" consciousness offer fresh angles. The withered-flower pendant (moment between dying and death) is specific. Yet the teacher-who-dissolved-into-light and origami-as-guidance feel derivative of fantasy-mentor tropes. The emotional arc (grief as practice) is earnest but follows a predictable teach-the-novice template. The "meet yourself, a few years from now" turn is conceptually interesting but not grounded in prior particulars that make it feel inevitable. Transformation test: swap observatory for lighthouse, origami for shells—arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara (mourning jewelry maker) is present throughout and makes the key choice to descend, offer the pendant, and guide the new arrival. She appears in setup, middle (examines stencil, descends stairs), and closure (leads through curtains). However, her choices don't narrow prior options with visible cost—she continues centuries of practice without alteration. The pendant-offering is functional but not a turn; she executes established purpose. Mid-band for presence across beats but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The tattoo stencil on vellum appears in paragraph two (backstory anchor), paragraph five ("examined... one final time before tucking it into her belt"), and paragraph eight ("touched the vellum stencil at her belt, felt her teacher's guidance"). Three beats, but all are gestural touchstones without tactical change. It does not constrain a choice or enable a new action; it functions as emotional talisman. Swappable with any teacher's keepsake. Setup + middle + closure cameo meet the gates, but causal work is absent—cap at mid-band per guidance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Curtains of intention frame the observatory's mechanism (setup: "gossamer barriers between what was and what could be"), appear in middle beats (coordinates lead to "chamber where the curtains... rippled with possibility"), and open at closure ("curtains of intention parted before them"). The concept is specific and the final parting allows the step-through. However, it doesn't constrain or force a trade-off; it's permissive infrastructure. The core stakes (teaching grief) would hold without this exact metaphor. Solid presence and closure linkage lift it into the 6s, but swappability and lack of visible cost prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Genuinely artificial" anchors the teacher (crystalline consciousness, paragraph two) and the pendant ("genuinely artificial, like my teacher," paragraph seven). Two beats, both thematic rather than tactical. The attribute labels a category (downloaded consciousness, preserved flower) but does not enable or constrain an on-page action with cost. Swappable with "synthetic," "constructed," or "hybrid." Functional presence without causal necessity—mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Illuminate" appears in setup metaphor ("guide lost souls toward illumination"), motivates Elara's purpose, and the closing line ("illuminating the path that already existed") ties to closure. However, as an action it's abstract; no on-page beat where Elara's illuminating choice narrows options or imposes cost. The pendant-offering could be described as "offering," "teaching," or "welcoming" with similar effect. Present and thematically coherent but easily swappable—mid-band for thematic presence without tactical irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Leaving origami figures with coordinates inside is introduced in paragraph three, explained ("messages from the observatory itself"), and drives Elara's prior practice (she collects them, unfolds with reverence, follows coordinates). Mentioned in setup and middle but absent from the closure beat—Elara does not leave an origami for the new arrival or use one to guide her. The method shapes Elara's backstory and worldbuilding but doesn't participate in the present turn. Two-gate presence (setup + middle development of her routine) without closure payoff caps eligibility near 6.0; the lyric specificity and causal role in her practice nudge it to 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The timeless observatory is introduced in paragraph one, supplies spatial structure (workshop, spiral stairs, entrance hall), and the curtains' final parting enables the closure step-through. The setting's rule ("existed outside of time's greedy grasp") removes urgency but creates thematic coherence. The garden "where nothing grew because nothing needed to" constrains what blooming means. Coordinates from origami guide Elara's movements. Present in setup, middle (coordinates, spatial moves), and closure (curtains part). Essential infrastructure with thematic and spatial pressure—solid 7+ range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After hitting rock bottom" anchors both Elara's backstory arrival and the new arrival's present state (paragraph six: "hit rock bottom and found the bottom had no floor"). Setup and thematic reprise present, but the timeframe does not tighten present decisions—Elara has "centuries" of practice, and the new arrival's crisis is described, not shown as a ticking constraint. Time is atmospheric rather than tactical. Two-gate presence (setup + thematic echo) without middle or closure pressure—mid-band per lyric-resonance allowance, capped by lack of urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach withering to bloom again" is stated in paragraph five and enacted when Elara offers the pendant and invites the new arrival through the curtains. It drives her descent and the closure choice. However, the desire is told and harmonious—no friction between wanting to guide and the cost of doing so. The new arrival's acceptance is frictionless. Present in setup (observatory's purpose), middle (Elara's action), and closure (invitation), but the want faces no competing cost on the page. Solid presence and closure linkage without dramatized conflict—mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Subdued ardor" appears once (paragraph six: "her subdued ardor visible in the gentle concern of her expression") but the tone—quiet intensity, restrained emotion—is consistent throughout: "reverence," "gentle demonstration," "quiet demonstration," "smallest flicker of wonder." Diction modulates from reflective backstory to present-scene gentleness. The tone charges the pendant exchange and the final "come" invitation. Coherent across beats and consistent with the grief-practice theme. Present in setup (reflective), middle (approach), and closure (invitation). Solid tonal control with purposeful modulation—mid-to-high 6s for coherence and closure charge.</comment>
