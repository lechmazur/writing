<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elira's motivation—writing fortunes from unlived memories—is established but remains abstract throughout. The protagonist performs tasks (tracing the shell, mapping memories, writing the fortune) without visible internal conflict or embodied stakes that force difficult micro-choices. The condition "chronologically homesick" is labeled via clinical language ("temporal displacement syndrome") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. No meaningful choice forecloses a path with felt cost; she completes the assigned prophecy without struggle or renunciation on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (memory-mapping, image-layering toward a thematic fortune). Orientation anchor appears late: the glass spire, frozen lake, and council summons emerge gradually without clear who/where/when by ~120 words, though disorientation does not later pay off at closure—apply Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and cap Q3 at 7.0. Closure unit is Conceptual Repricing: the final fortune reweights the premise of "unheard music" as already real. However, cost is asserted rather than legible on the page; Elira dissolves into dawn without visible forfeiture, endurance price, or tactical change. The fortune arrives as declaration, not earned pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The glass spire, frozen lake, mirrored horizon, and nautilus shell are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (crystalline transparency, amber spiral, ginger-and-snow scent merger). The nautilus shell appears in two beats (desk touch, pulse recognition) and charges the final image by suggesting home-recognition, meeting the micro-setting threshold. Spatial choreography is clear within the single location. However, orientation debt applied in Q2 caps this category at 7.0 per global rule.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—write one final prophecy before exhaustion/fragmentation—is signaled early. Yet no on-page escalation occurs: Elira maps memories and writes the fortune in a smooth, uninterrupted sequence with no reversal, tightening choice, or visible cost that alters tactics. The council's urgency and the dawn deadline remain external pressures never tested by a pivot or sacrifice. Agency is absent; the protagonist completes the assigned task without renunciation or endurance that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme—permission for unheard symphonies, temporal homesickness as soul-recognition—emerges from concrete images (nautilus chambers, mirrored horizon, ginger-snow fusion) rather than thesis statements. The final fortune "The symphony you hear in silence is not a rehearsal" offers a non-literal answer to the premise. However, it arrives as authorial declaration rather than earned from on-page friction; no complexity or counter-reading exists because the protagonist never doubts or struggles with the insight, reducing resonance to gentle affirmation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "light that existed somewhere behind her eyes," "mathematics of time folded into something organic." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close interior, then lyric zoom to mirrored horizon). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("logarithmic curve," "temporal displacement syndrome") that edges away from embodied perception, though it remains legible. No dialogue present. Elision of the council and exhaustion mechanics is purposeful compression that supports the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "crystalline song," "upturned silence," "frost forming on glass." However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The structure rose… its walls transparent" restates boundary-blurring in adjacent clauses; "missed her childhood not as a single place but as a continuous stretch of light" then "always present yet perpetually out of reach" recycles the same abstraction. Template stems recur: "She traced… She understood… She began… She wrote… She felt." Apply paraphrase-loop (−0.2) and template-cadence (−0.5) penalties totaling −0.7 in Q7. Minor proprietary-word issues ("upturned silence" lacks clear physical anchor) reduce clarity at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of fortune-cookie writer, nautilus-shell geometry, temporal homesickness, and mirrored-horizon imagery is inventive on paper but feels stitched from prompt elements rather than inevitable. The emotional arc—chronological homesickness resolved via permission-granting fortune—lacks friction or non-obvious moral calculus; it reads as gentle affirmation without cost or transformation. Specific details (ginger-and-snow scent, glass dissolving into dawn) provide texture, yet the core insight arrives pre-formed rather than discovered through struggle, limiting freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elira is present throughout and her role frames the premise. She maps memories and writes the fortune, but these are executed tasks without on-page decision points that narrow options or alter tactics. No choice creates a key turn; she completes the council's assignment smoothly. Present by setup, absent in middle development (no choice under pressure), cameo in closure (writes the fortune as assigned). Two gates yield eligibility ~6.0, but swappability (any seer/prophet could perform the same arc with minor edits) and lack of causal pressure lower the score. Late-penalty does not apply (present from opening), but ornamental execution (−0.6) and swappability (−0.6) bring the band to mid-3s. Causally passive role; the character enables the premise but does not drive turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The nautilus shell appears in two distinct beats: Elira traces it on her desk (paragraph 2) and it "seemed to pulse with recognition" near closure (paragraph 6). Each chamber represents a growth stage, and the spiral's "mathematics of time" seeds the temporal-homesickness motif. The shell's return charges the final image by suggesting belonging. Setup gate met (early), development gate weak (no middle choice constrained by it), payoff gate met (reweighted meaning at closure). Two-of-three gates yield eligibility ~6.0; lyric early-to-final reprise adds +0.3. However, the shell is described rather than handled in causal action (−0.5 ornamental use), and swappability is moderate (another growth-symbol could serve with minor edits, −0.4). Total adjustments net to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The mirrored horizon appears in setup (paragraph 4: "mirror-lake reflected the spire in perfect inversion") and at dawn (paragraph 6: "mirrored horizon split along its center line"). It frames the setting and provides a lyric image for duality/boundary-crossing. However, it does not shape tactics, narrow options, or enable a middle choice; Elira never interacts with it or uses it as a constraint. Setup and payoff gates met (early mention, closure image), middle development gate missing. Two gates yield eligibility ~6.0, but swappability (any symbolic boundary could replace it, −0.7) and ornamental use (−0.6) lower the score to low-4s. The concept enriches theme but does not drive plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Chronologically homesick" is named and described (paragraph 3: "temporal displacement syndrome," missing childhood "as a continuous stretch of light") but functions as backstory exposition rather than on-page constraint. It motivates the writing task thematically but does not enable or foreclose a single visible action with cost. Setup gate met (early label), development and payoff gates missing (no middle choice or closure action hinges on this trait). One gate caps eligibility at 4.6. Label-only use (−0.3), summary-only (−0.3), and swappability (any melancholy/dislocation could serve, −0.4) bring the score to mid-3s. The attribute colors mood without driving pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dawn anchors the timeframe ("given her until dawn," "first light of dawn touched the frozen lake") and marks the moment Elira writes the final fortune and the spire dissolves. Setup gate met (introduced paragraph 4), development gate weak (no middle pivot tied to dawn's approach), payoff gate met (closure action occurs at dawn). Two-of-three gates yield eligibility ~6.0. Dawn provides temporal bracket and charges the final image with gold-bleeding-into-silver light (+0.7 closure linkage). However, the deadline is not tested by a choice or tactic adjustment; Elira completes her task on schedule without visible urgency or cost tied to the dawn arrival (−0.3 causal pressure absent). Net mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"By mapping childhood memories" is signaled in paragraph 5 ("She began by mapping childhood memories, not chronologically but by their emotional resonance") and executed on the page (ginger-snow fusion, grandmother's kitchen merged with spire). Setup gate met (second-third introduction, −0.3 late signal), development gate met (one beat of active use), payoff gate met (the fortune emerges "from the mapping of all her remembered moments"). All three gates yield eligibility ≥6.1. However, the mechanics are summary-only (we are told she maps, not shown discrete steps or constraints, −0.5), and swappability is moderate (any introspective method could yield the fortune, −0.5). Net low-5s. The method is present and purposeful but lacks granular causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The glass spire by the frozen lake frames every paragraph: opening image, mirrored inversion, dissolving into dawn. Setup gate met (opening line), development gate weak (no middle choice shaped by the setting's properties), payoff gate met (spire dissolves at closure). Two gates yield eligibility ~6.0. The spire's transparency and the lake's mirror charge the final image (+0.8 closure linkage), and the setting is irreplaceable (removing the spire breaks the lyric structure, +0.5 specificity). However, the setting remains descriptive rather than tactically constraining; Elira does not navigate or manipulate the space to solve a problem (−0.6 ornamental pressure). Net mid-5s. The setting is vivid and integral to tone but does not pressure choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Before exhaustion hits" is stated in paragraph 4 ("until dawn, before exhaustion hit and her mind fragments") but never dramatized as a live constraint. Elira does not race the clock, adjust tactics under time pressure, or show fatigue encroaching. Setup gate met (early mention), development and payoff gates missing (no middle tightening, no closure cost tied to the timeframe). One gate caps eligibility at 4.6. The deadline is told rather than shown (−0.6 summary-only), and it resolves a problem it did not create (dawn arrives on schedule without consequence, −0.7). Net low-4s. The timeframe is declared but inert.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"To become the conductor of unheard symphonies" appears only in the final fortune (paragraph 6: "she had always been the conductor of unheard music"). It is not Elira's stated motivation; the council wants her to write a prophecy (paragraph 1), and she obliges. The conductor image is the message she writes for a distant child, not a dramatized desire that drives Elira's choices. Setup gate missing (motivation introduced at closure), development gate missing, payoff gate met (final fortune). One gate caps eligibility at 4.6. The motivation is told-only (−0.6), arrives late to resolve thematically (−0.8 late introduction), and is swappable (any aspirational message could serve, −0.5). Net low-2s. The element is present as theme, absent as driver.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Upturned hush" as tone: quiet, reflective, accumulative rather than confrontational. The piece maintains hushed lyricism (nautilus spiral, ginger-snow, mirrored silence) across all beats without jarring shifts. Setup gate met (tone established in opening paragraphs), development gate met (sustained through memory-mapping), payoff gate met (tone charges "infinite reflected hush of upturned silence" at closure). All three gates yield eligibility ≥6.1. Tone modulates subtly with dawn's arrival (gold bleeding into silver) and supports the accumulative lens (+0.5 coherence). However, "upturned" as a modifier of "hush" lacks clear physical anchor and edges toward forced poeticism (−0.4 register drift at closure beat). Net low-6s. Tone is consistent and purposeful but the signature phrase is slightly opaque.</comment>
