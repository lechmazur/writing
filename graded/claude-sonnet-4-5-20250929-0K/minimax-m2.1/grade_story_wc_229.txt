<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority shows commitment and embodied tension ("pressed her palm," "remembered her grandmother's words"), and her choices drive the resolution. Internal contradiction is present in the tension between wanting recognition and needing to purify intention, though this could be sharper. The purification process feels somewhat abstract ("vibration that had no name") and the cost of her choice—renouncing ego—is more told than dramatically tested on the page. The grandmother's teaching and Thessaly's gift provide motivation, but the climactic moment leans toward epiphany without visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (assistant keeper, cobalt lighthouse, dawn, post-heat-wave). The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: the heat breaks, the garden blooms, Mira studies the logs, uncorks the vial, and sends her intention—building density toward a final image where "whispers were right." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the first ship turns, sailors speak in hushed voices, and the logbook entry reweights the premise with felt cost (Mira's solitary vigil and renunciation of recognition). One meaningful deepening is present. Cost is legible in the final image, though the turn itself is quiet and relies on accumulation rather than a sharp reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, salt-worn granite, night garden hollow, and great lens are vivid and selective. Sensory detail—jasmine scent "sweet and green as a promise," thermal currents, flares "like wounded stars"—filters through Mira's urgent attention. The cork carved from the ancient oak and the vial's scent function as micro-setting that charges the closure. Spatial choreography (spiral stairs, lens housing, keeper's quarters) tracks cleanly. The environment subtly constrains: the hollow protects flowers, the lens channels intent, the heat wave's end enables the garden's bloom—all pressuring Mira's choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: guide the sailors safely using the old technique Thessaly entrusted to her. The heat wave's thermal currents create urgent pressure; sailors' signals grow desperate. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira uncorks the vial and must purify her intention without needing recognition—a credible internal escalation under the Accumulative lens. The first ship turning within the hour provides an on-page result, though the reversal is understated. Agency is present (Mira's choice to send the vibration), but the climactic act feels more like enactment of learned wisdom than a decision under competing pressures. Cost is implied (solitude, ego renunciation) but not viscerally tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—whispers reach where shouts cannot, intention over volume—emerges through the jasmine, the beckon technique, and the logbook's validation. The final line "The whispers were right" reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in Thessaly's gift, Mira's secret study, and the sailors' hushed voices. The grandmother's teaching and the lighthouse's frequency anchor the concept in specifics. However, the phrase "screaming tenderness" in the penultimate beat ("the screaming tenderness of her belief") flirts with thematic echo, articulating the paradox rather than embodying it entirely through image. The ending offers resonance but borders on thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Mira's perception. Diction is elevated and consistent ("bruised clouds," "frequency that could reach into troubled waters"), though some phrases verge on writerly self-consciousness ("the verbal equivalent of grasping hands"). The line "she sent instead a vibration that had no name, a frequency of pure wanting-them-safe" compresses the climax into abstraction rather than embodied action. Psychic distance is controlled, but at peak pressure the prose leans toward summary of interior state rather than dramatized micro-choices. No head-hopping; voice is distinct but occasionally slides toward poetic commentary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high, but figurative density spikes without full payoff: "bruised clouds," "fever" stone, hearts "smooth[ed] like stones in a river," flares "like wounded stars," jasmine "bloomed outward like a confession," intent "like a blade of light through fog." Mixed metaphor appears in "screaming tenderness"—a charged oxymoron that works thematically but stretches coherence. The phrase "珍贵 as gold" drops untranslated Chinese mid-sentence, likely a generation artifact, breaking flow. Template cadence is minimal, but some stems repeat ("she had come," "she understood," "she thought"). Clarity and momentum hold, but overwriting in high-pressure beats (the sending of the vibration) dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—lighthouse keeper uses scent and intention rather than volume to guide ships—offers a fresh angle on the beacon trope. The heat wave, night garden, and cork from the ancient oak are specific and grounded. The emotional core (purifying ego to help) is universal but executed with care. However, the "whispers vs. shouts" thesis and the mystical frequency concept lean toward familiar writing-prompt territory: gentle magic, apprentice alone for the first time, elder's gift, logbook validation. The piece transforms the template through sensory detail and Mira's interiority, but the arc remains recognizable. Risk-taking is moderate; the quiet ending fits but does not surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira (assistant keeper) is present throughout, drives the uncorking and the sending of intention, and the first ship's turn traces to her choice. Setup early, middle beat (studying logs, uncorking vial), and closure (ships guided, logbook entry). Causal pressure is moderate; her choice enacts learned wisdom rather than a contested decision under competing options. Specific cost (renouncing recognition) is present but not viscerally tested. Swappability is low; removing Mira's specific role and her grandmother's teaching would break the arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The vial cork "carved from the same ancient oak that once grew where the lighthouse now stood" is described in the first third, uncorked mid-story ("She uncorked the vial, and the jasmine scent bloomed outward"), and the scent enables the climactic sending. Two beats (receiving the box, uncorking), and the cork's origin ties to the lighthouse's history. However, the cork itself is not returned to or reweighted; the vial and scent dominate. The cork's specificity (ancient oak) is ornamental unless the oak's former presence matters to the lighthouse's power—hinted but not dramatized. Functional but somewhat replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Vibrations of intent" is introduced early (lighthouse "sang a frequency that could reach into the troubled waters of human hearts"), studied in the logbooks ("vibrations of intent, the principle that a pure intention sent deliberately could travel farther than any shout"), and enacted at the climax ("she sent instead a vibration that had no name"). The concept shapes Mira's tactics: she must purify intention, use the jasmine to cut through ego, and send via attention rather than volume. The first ship turns as a result. Closure linkage is strong. The concept is indispensable to the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Purifies intentions" appears mid-story ("one had to purify intentions until nothing remained but the pure desire to help") and the jasmine "helped, cutting through fear and ego like a blade of light through fog." The trait constrains Mira's approach (she must renounce recognition) and enables the vibration. Cost is conceptual (ego renunciation) and present but not sharply tested in a moment of temptation or failure. One beat (the sending), and the trait is causal. Closure linkage is moderate; the logbook implies success but does not dramatize the purification's cost. Functional and purposeful but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Beckon" is taught by the grandmother ("her grandmother teaching her to beckon—not with words or gestures, but with the quality of attention"), studied in the logs, and executed at the climax ("she sent instead a vibration… a frequency of pure wanting-them-safe"). The action is the story's hinge: Mira beckons, the ship turns. Two beats (learning, doing) and strong closure linkage. The beckoning is distinct from shouting or signaling and irreplaceable; removing it collapses the premise. Causal pressure and cost are present. The action redefines what "guiding" means.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"By the scent of a garden at night" is signaled early (night garden in the hollow), blooms mid-story after the heat breaks, and the jasmine essence is uncorked and used to enable the beckoning ("The jasmine helped, cutting through fear and ego"). The scent is mechanically essential: without it, Mira cannot purify her intention. Setup, middle development, and closure participation are all present. However, the garden itself is somewhat backgrounded; the vial (containing jasmine essence) does more work than the garden's blooming. The method is purposeful and causal but feels slightly secondary to the vial and the beckoning itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse is present from the opening line, provides spatial anchors (spiral stairs, great lens, keeper's quarters, hollow for the garden), and its structure (the lens) channels the vibration at the climax. The lighthouse's history (oak, logbooks, frequency) underpins the story's logic. Dawn anchors the timeframe and the closure ("catching the morning light"). Micro-setting (lens housing, brass, salt-worn granite) grounds Mira's tactile engagement. The lighthouse is indispensable; it supplies resources (lens, logs, protected garden) and its "song" is the story's central metaphor. Strong setup, middle use, and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After the heat wave breaks" anchors the opening ("three weeks of relentless heat," "heat wave had broken sometime in the small hours") and enables the night garden to bloom, which provides the jasmine. The timeframe tightens: Mira is alone for the first time, the sailors are desperate now, and the heat's end is the catalyst. However, the clock is not live during the climax; "within the hour" marks the result but no moment-to-moment pressure tracks elapsed time. The timeframe is causal and purposeful but does not continually pressure choices. Setup and middle development present; closure participation moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—to prove whispers travel farther than shouts—is implied in her secret study of the logs, her reception of Thessaly's gift, and the climactic sending ("the screaming tenderness of her belief that whispers could reach where shouts could not"). The logbook entry at the end ("The whispers were right") validates the desire. The motivation is dramatized through her actions (uncorking, purifying, sending) and the cost (renouncing recognition, working alone). Friction between wanting to help and needing to purge ego is present but understated. Two beats and strong closure linkage. The motivation is specific and drives the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Screaming tenderness" appears explicitly near the climax ("the screaming tenderness of her belief") and implicitly structures the tone: desperate sailors (screaming) met by Mira's gentle beckoning (tenderness). The oxymoron charges the final image (sailors speak in "hushed voices," the lighthouse sings on). However, the phrase itself is somewhat on-the-nose, articulating the paradox rather than fully embodying it through tonal modulation. The story's emotional register is mostly tender and reflective; the "screaming" is attributed to the sailors' flares and horns, not Mira's voice. Tone is coherent but the fusion of urgency and gentleness could be more seamlessly woven. Moderate closure linkage.</comment>
