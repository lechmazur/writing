<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eliorn is characterized through her patience and specialized knowledge, but her interiority remains largely abstract—"learned patience that transcended mortal waiting" tells rather than shows contradiction. The motivation is clear (restore the town's resonance), yet no meaningful internal conflict emerges; she walks with unwavering conviction across the entire arc. The piece offers embodied detail (fork pressed to sternum, warm from use) but lacks micro-choices under pressure that would reveal competing impulses or a hierarchy of values with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Eliorn's repeated walking circuits are meant to deepen pressure toward a tipping point. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the cobblestones hum in response, and she states "two thousand footsteps left" before full revival. The cost is conceptual (time, effort, solitary endurance) but legible in "legs ached" and "three seasons" of solitary labor. One structural weakness: the ending recounts the hum rather than dramatizing a decisive tightening choice or reversal that forecloses a path; the "perhaps two thousand footsteps left" undercuts finality and makes the closure feel provisional rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archway, cobblestones, and ironwood fork are vivid and purposefully detailed; sensory selection (humidity, velvet moss, buzz through boot soles) is specific and filtered through Eliorn's professional attention. The micro-setting (tuning fork, cobblestones) constrains her method and charges the final image when the stones respond. Spatial choreography is clear across her repeated circuits, and the world rules (resonance, blight, mute bells) remain consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—revive Vellachen to heal the wider network of towns—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the repetition of her walking and the slowly emerging hum, consistent with the Accumulative lens. However, escalation is muted: no meaningful reversal or tightening choice narrows her options; she begins the story walking and ends still walking with the same conviction. The stated "seven thousand repetitions" and "perhaps two thousand footsteps left" imply a future climax rather than an on-page cost that alters tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme—community health as interconnected resonance, revival through patient accumulation—emerges organically from Eliorn's method and the town's decay. The piece resists overt moralizing; wisdom arises from her specialized practice rather than platitudes. The final image (cobblestones humming, two thousand steps remaining) offers a resonant non-literal answer to the central question of how silence is healed. One slip: "shared balance" and "web of settlements" edge toward thematic summary rather than letting the particulars speak fully for themselves.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable and clean; perceptual signature is consistent (professional attention to vibration, resonance, rhythm). Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "system of resonance," "sympathetic vibrations," "tuning peg." No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Under peak moments (cobblestones beginning to respond), the prose maintains its measured, technical texture without collapsing into generic excitement. Psychic distance is consistent; the narrator's certainty matches Eliorn's expertise without unwarranted leaps.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with purposeful variation in sentence length and structure. Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or atmosphere. Minor scaffolding appears in the form of repeated explanatory phrases—"not merely a collection of buildings but a system of resonance" and "not to invoke spirits but to remind the buildings" follow identical syntactic templates. The metaphor density is high but mostly coherent; "feeling—a vibration that settled into the marrow" and "wound in the landscape" work without contradiction. One loop: "she walked" and variations appear frequently enough to create mild redundancy, though the repetition mirrors the character's method and may be purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—revive a ghost town through rhythmic walking and tuning—offers a fresh angle on urban decay and community healing. Eliorn's cryptic profession and the specific mechanics (ironwood fork, sympathetic vibrations, seven thousand footsteps) avoid generic templates. However, the emotional arc and resolution feel familiar: patient expert performs solitary ritual, incremental progress confirmed, work continues. The transformation test is borderline: swap names and the ritual's particulars, and the core "gradual healing through repetition" structure remains unchanged. Bold choices (no antagonist, no reversal) suit the Accumulative lens but limit dramatic ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eliorn (cryptic bell tuner) is present throughout and her specialized knowledge frames the method. She makes one implicit decision—to continue walking the circuits—but no on-page choice creates a key turn or alters tactics under pressure. Her role is more observer-practitioner than decider; the town's response (cobblestones humming) is the primary event. Introduced early, appears in closure, but lacks beat-level causal pressure where her choices narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ebony tuning fork is introduced early ("pressed against her sternum"), used in at least two beats (initial description, "struck it against her palm," "grown warm from continuous use"), and present in the closure moment. It constrains her method (must produce "a feeling—a vibration") and its warmth signals accumulated effort. Strong setup and development; closure participation is indirect (she has used it continuously, but the final hum comes from the stones, not the fork itself). Irreplaceability is high (carved from the town's ironwood tree), but causal pressure is modest—removing it would require narrative adjustment but not fundamentally break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the story's central concept, shaping stakes (Vellachen's silence spreads illness to surrounding villages) and tactics (repeated walking to restore resonance). It drives the dominant conflict and frames the closure image (cobblestones hum, revival underway). The concept is indispensable: without it, the narrative lacks both goal and stakes. Early signal, beat involvement across the arc, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Infinitely patient" is stated early ("learned patience that transcended mortal waiting") and demonstrated through the seven-thousand-step commitment and three-season timeline. It enables her method (no dramatic gestures, only accumulated pressure) and constrains her tactics (she will not rush). However, the trait is mostly told and does not create an on-page tradeoff or visible cost—no moment where impatience tempts her or where patience forecloses another path. Present across beats, but label-heavy and lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Rebuild" as action is implicit throughout (she walks to revive the town) but not dramatized as a discrete turning-point event. The story centers on preparatory repetition rather than construction or repair. The hum at the end signals progress toward rebuilding, but the rebuild itself remains off-page and future. Setup and development are present (the method is rebuilding through resonance), but closure participation is provisional ("perhaps two thousand footsteps left"). Swappable with "restore" or "revive" with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The method—rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones—is signaled early ("each footfall a question posed to the sleeping stone"), used across multiple beats (walking circuits from market to well to baker's lane), and shapes the closure image ("buzz that rose through the soles of her boots"). The mechanics matter: her footsteps create sympathetic vibrations that teach the stones to remember. High specificity and irreplaceability; removing the footstep-rhythm would require a different method and break the story's resonance logic. Causal pressure is strong, and the method is indispensable to both escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ancient archway is introduced in the opening line and identified as "the tuning peg, the point against which the entire town's frequency could be adjusted." It appears in the closure beat ("The ancient archway above her hummed with recognition"). Setup and payoff are clear. However, the archway does not constrain a mid-scene choice or alter tactics; it functions as symbolic anchor and resonance node rather than active pressure. Strong thematic role, but causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Before the collapse" appears in the opening phrase ("wild hush before the collapse") and frames the stakes (the town is on the brink). However, the timeframe does not create visible urgency or tighten decisions—Eliorn has already been walking for three seasons, and she projects "perhaps two thousand footsteps left" without a deadline. The collapse is invoked but not dramatized or pressing. Present in setup and thematically, but lacks development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Restore shared balance" is stated explicitly ("understanding of shared balance") and dramatized through Eliorn's commitment to heal the interconnected network of towns. It drives her solitary labor and frames the stakes (Vellachen's silence spreads illness). The motivation is present across beats and shapes the closure image (the town beginning to wake). However, it is told more than conflicted—no on-page moment where restoring balance costs her personally or forces a trade-off. Strong setup and development; closure linkage is clear, but friction between want and cost is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Wild hush" opens and closes the piece, modulates appropriately (quiet attention, gathering dark, "smile in the gathering dark"), and charges the final image (the hum emerging from silence). Tone is coherent and consistent with the Accumulative lens; no jarring shifts. The hush intensifies as the cobblestones begin to respond, creating a charged contrast. Strong setup, development through the repeated quietude, and closure payoff. High tonal control and purposeful modulation under pressure.</comment>
