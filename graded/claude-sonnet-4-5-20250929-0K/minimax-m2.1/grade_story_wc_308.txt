<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The stone skimmer's interiority is detailed but static: centuries of meditation and observation yield no genuine internal contradiction or struggle. The "pulse that had been left wandering in her chest" and her mastery through stillness are established early but never tested by conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. No micro-choices under pressure materially alter her stance; her navigation is described rather than dramatized as a choice with visible cost. The final acceptance of peace reads as assertion rather than earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: dust layers, bird patterns, and the wandering pulse build density toward a final cadence shift. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost lands on the page. The ending offers thematic reflection ("true navigation was not about the movement of the body") but does not reweight prior particulars with felt or conceptual cost; it summarizes rather than enacts closure. The cost-proof test fails: no sentence in the final beat makes a price legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bone towers, canyon echoes, dust layers, and bird flights are vivid and selective, filtered through the protagonist's centuries-long vigil. Spatial choreography remains coherent; the tower interior, hollow windows, and ledges track cleanly. The arrowhead in her palms and the settling dust constrain her stillness and charge the navigation imagery. The environment subtly mirrors her stasis and expansion of awareness, meeting the 9+ gate criterion (environment constrains choice and charges the final image) but pervasive ornamental description in the final third lowers momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and sustained. Yet no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the protagonist's mastery is presented as complete from the outset. The birds' patterns and the warming arrowhead describe her navigation but never test it with conflicting pressures or trade-offs. The resolution ("she had found something like peace") is asserted rather than earned by a prior choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a meaningful density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake; here the final paragraph restates theme without demonstrable cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges clearly from the particulars: stillness as navigation, the wandering pulse, geological patience. The arrowhead, dust, and bird patterns recur and deepen meaning. However, the final paragraph ("true navigation was not about the movement of the body through space") articulates the thesis in prompt-like language rather than allowing it to resonate through image alone, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty (−0.5). The piece invites reflection and resists tidy morals, but the explain-everything ending reduces resonance at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: geological time, reverent patience, sensory expansion through the pulse. Diction ("historically reverent," "canyon of endless echoes") is voice-motivated and consistent. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood," "sensed") are frequent but voice-appropriate and do not dull immediacy. Narrative distance modulates purposefully with her expanding awareness. No head-hopping or unmotivated shifts; free indirect style is clean. Minor penalty for elevated register ("appraised its weight and balance ten thousand times") that occasionally drifts above the character's lived lexicon under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmic with high information density. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She had not moved from this place in so long that the dust had learned her shape" is echoed by "her body had grown stiff and ancient in its stillness." Template cadence runs in the fourth paragraph ("When they spiraled… When they scattered… When they flew…") without taught payoff, triggering −0.4. Stock metaphors ("like the ribs of some fallen god," "thin across the canyon") lack fresh particularity. No filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats; figurative language remains coherent. Applying paraphrase-loop and template-cadence penalties totaling −0.6 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—navigation through stillness, mediated by a wandering pulse and bird patterns—offers a fresh angle on contemplative fantasy. The bone-tower setting and geological patience are specific and memorable. However, the core arc (ancient meditator achieves mastery and reflects on meaning) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived friction or non-obvious moral calculus. The emotional truth is present but the resolution into "something like peace" trends toward abstraction. No close echoes of famous lines; the synthesis is competent but lacks the bold, risky specificity that would elevate it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The harmonic stone skimmer is present throughout and her observations frame the narrative, but she makes no key on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her navigation is described as complete mastery; no reversal or decision changes her state. Setup, development (observation), and payoff (reflection) gates are met, but causal pressure and cost connection are absent. Late-element and swappability penalties do not apply; ornamental-use friction (−0.5) does. Starting at 3.0 + early signal +0.3 + closure linkage (thematic, not causal) +0.4 − ornamental use −0.5 = 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The stone arrowhead appears in the opening, the midpoint warming beat, and the cooling closure, meeting the three-gate requirement. It is handled across multiple beats (palms, warming, cooling) and its warmth signals the pulse's apex, shaping her navigation cycle. However, it does not narrow options or enable a distinct choice with cost; its role is atmospheric and symbolic rather than causal. Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (two distinct beats) +0.9, closure linkage (image, not causal) +0.5, specificity (ancient, smooth, guiding) +0.4, minus swappability (could be any focus object) −0.4 = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The wandering pulse is central to the protagonist's navigation method and appears across all three gates: early ("pulse that had been left wandering in her chest"), middle (expansion through canyon), and closure (return to resting rhythm). It shapes her tactics (letting the pulse expand, reading echoes) but does not change options or impose visible cost on the page. The concept is atmospheric and thematic rather than a live stake that narrows choices. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (three beats) +1.4, specificity +0.5, minus ornamental use (descriptive, not pressure-creating) −0.7, minus swappability (near-synonym "awareness" could replace it) −0.5, minus summary-only (key work recounted, not dramatized) −0.5 = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Historically reverent" appears once in the fifth paragraph as a label for her gift's understanding. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost; no choice or tactic is altered by this trait. Setup gate is missing (appears past midpoint), development gate is missing (label-only), payoff gate is missing (not present in closure). Late appearance (second third) −0.3, ornamental use −0.7, label-only trait −0.3, swappability (could be "deeply respectful" or "humbly aware") −0.6. Starting at 3.0 + early signal 0.0 (late) − 1.9 cumulative frictions = 1.1, floored at cap 2.4 for missing setup.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Appraise" appears early ("appraised its weight and balance ten thousand times") and frames her meditation practice. It recurs implicitly in the warming/cooling cycle as she assesses the pulse's apex. However, no major turn traces to this action; the appraisal is static ritual rather than a decision that redefines options. Setup gate met, development gate weak (no choice altered), payoff gate met (implicit in final cooling). Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (two touches) +0.9, closure linkage (implicit in final rhythm) +0.4, minus swappability (could be "felt," "measured," "contemplated") −0.6, minus summary-only (recounted, not dramatized) −0.6 = 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Bird patterns are signaled early (paragraph four) and their mechanics matter: spiraling signals clear passage, scattering signals disturbance, low flight signals danger. The method shapes her navigation attempts across multiple beats and appears in the closure (birds settled, resting). Setup, development (reading trajectories alters her awareness), and payoff gates are met. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (three distinct beats) +1.4, causal pressure (enables navigation tactics) +0.8, closure linkage (birds resting frames final stillness) +0.9, specificity (thermal currents, dispersions, contours) +0.5, minus swappability (patterns could be wind, echoes, shadows) −0.5 = 6.8, rounded to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon are present throughout, constraining her stillness and supplying the echo chambers that carry her pulse. The setting shapes her navigation method (vertical tower vantage, hollow windows, endless passageways) and charges the final image (tower as prison and sanctuary). Setup, development (tower height and echoes enable perception), and payoff gates are met. Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (three beats) +1.4, causal pressure (tower position enables bird-reading and pulse expansion) +1.0, closure linkage (tower framing final peace) +1.2, specificity (bone spire, fossil cathedrals, ledges) +0.6, cost connection (confinement/sanctuary duality) +0.4 = 7.2, rounded to 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Centuries and dust layers are established early and frame the protagonist's endurance. However, time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the narrative is timeless stasis rather than a live clock. The phrase "through centuries of layered dust" signals duration but imposes no urgency or cost. Setup gate met, development gate weak (no choice deadline), payoff gate met (final afternoon light marks one cycle). Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (two touches: opening stasis, closing cycle) +0.9, closure linkage (afternoon light frames return) +0.5, minus ornamental use (duration described, not pressure-creating) −0.7, minus swappability (could be "ages," "eons," "lifetimes") −0.5 = 4.7, capped at 4.6 for missing middle development gate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The desire to navigate without moving is signaled early ("learned to navigate without moving through decades of patient observation") and frames the entire arc. It is dramatized through the pulse expansion and bird-reading, though no friction between want and cost appears on the page; mastery is complete. Setup, development (navigation method shown), and payoff (final reflection on navigation as spiritual movement) gates are met. Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (three beats) +1.4, causal pressure (shapes all tactics) +0.9, closure linkage (final thematic statement) +0.8, minus told-only (stated, not tested with conflict) −0.5, minus friction absence (no competing desire) −0.4 = 6.3, rounded to 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Weathered resolve is coherent throughout: dust-layered stillness, patient observation, geological patience, acceptance of confinement. Tone modulates subtly with the pulse's expansion (midmorning birds, afternoon return) and charges the final image ("weathered and ancient as the bones that surrounded her"). Setup, development (tone sustained through navigation cycle), and payoff (final peace resonates with weathered texture) gates are met. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (three beats) +1.4, closure linkage (final line echoes opening tone) +1.1, specificity (dust, bone, geological time) +0.6, minus static mood (no sharp modulation under pressure) −0.3 = 7.6, rounded to 7.6.</comment>
