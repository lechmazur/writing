<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore trust is clear and drives her final action, but interiority leans heavily on elevated metaphor ("symphonies of truth," "unsnarling meaning") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The trembling hands and hesitation gesture toward internal conflict, but the prose often tells us she "understood" rather than dramatizing competing impulses in real time. Elian's arrival and tears feel somewhat convenient; his three-year silence and sudden reappearance lack on-page friction or cost that would make the reconciliation earn its weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who, where, and when early and follows a clear causal arc: Elara translates the final passage, which leads to Elian's arrival and their reconciliation. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (restored trust, Charged Poise at "a place before paths diverge"), and the cost is legible in the three-year silence and Elara's sustained effort. However, the final paragraph's "cautious exuberance" and "place before paths diverge" language drifts into abstraction, softening the closure image's punch. The inferred lens is Causal, and it holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The archive, manuscript, and glass ink well anchor the setting with vivid sensory detail (glyphs "like braille written for the dead," amber lamplight, crystalline walls). The extinct-language archive functions as both location and thematic container, and the ink well recurs with shifting resonance (gift, pulse of borrowed light, warmth after writing). Spatial choreography is coherent, though the archive itself remains somewhat abstract—thousands of shelves whisper, but no specific access constraint or physical layout pressures Elara's final choice. The ink well charges the final image weakly (still warm), just enough to lift the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring trust with Elian by completing their shared work—is signaled early and drives the climax. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara uncorks the ink well and begins writing, narrowing her options and committing to the final interpretation with visible cost (years of trust risked on "one false interpretation"). The resolution is earned by her eleven-year effort and the on-page act of translation. However, Elian's arrival immediately after she finishes feels convenient rather than causally compelled, and no secondary pressure complicates her decision in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—truth, trust, and the cost of honesty woven through language—emerges clearly from particulars (the extinct tongue "could only be spoken truthfully"). The final image of "a place before paths diverge" and "symphonies of truth" continuing their resonance offers a non-literal answer to the central question, but the language leans abstract and prompt-like ("interconnected promises," "unflinching honesty") rather than embodied. The glass ink well's recurrence charges the ending weakly; its shift from gift to vessel of renewal is legible but not indispensable. No overt moralizing, yet the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and poetic throughout ("unsnarling meaning," "held-breath," "anticipation waiting to become fact"), which fits an arcane-linguist focalizer but occasionally drifts into uniform lyricism that obscures Elara's perceptual signature under stress. Elian's single line of dialogue feels natural and carries subtext, but the surrounding narration ("rough with disuse and wonder") tells emotion rather than letting the line breathe. Free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("she understood," "she realized," "she knew") stack in the final paragraph, dulling immediacy at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong individual images ("braille written for the dead," "musicians finding their entrance"), but figurative density pervades most sentences without pattern-teaching or escalation, flattening propulsion. Repeated phrase stems ("she understood," "she had," "she knew") and synonym loops ("silence," "held-breath," "absence but anticipation") create mild scaffold drag. The final paragraph contains a paraphrase loop: "silence that followed was not emptiness but held-breath, was not absence but anticipation waiting to become fact" cycles the same idea without new pressure. Grammar and syntax are clean, but the elevated register holds constant across emotional peaks, missing opportunities for rhythmic variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—extinct language requiring truth, arcane-linguist restoration work—offers a fresh angle, and the "symphonies of truth" concept is specific. However, the core emotional arc (estranged mentors reconciled through scholarly breakthrough) follows a familiar template, and the resolution (protagonist completes the work, mentor arrives moved to tears) feels anticipated. The glass ink well and interconnected-promises motif add texture but do not fundamentally transform the genre convention. Specificity in linguistic detail elevates, yet the final beat retreats to safe abstraction ("place before paths diverge") rather than taking a bolder conceptual risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara (arcane linguist) is present throughout, and her on-page choices—uncorking the ink well, writing the final passage—drive the climax and resolution. Elian (also an arcane linguist) appears only in the final paragraph; his arrival validates Elara's work but is reactive rather than decision-driven. The attribute scores the character whose choices create turns; Elara's translation is the key causal act, shaping closure directly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The glass ink well appears in three beats: introduced as a gift in paragraph one, described as pulsing with borrowed light in paragraph two, and uncorked/used in paragraph three. Its shift from memento to active tool that "seemed to pulse" and remains "still warm" at the end reweights meaning, but the object's specific properties (crystalline walls, amber light) do not constrain Elara's choices or alter tactics. Present across beats and linked to closure, yet swappable with another symbolic vessel.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" shapes the central stake (translating a language requiring honesty) and motivates Elara's eleven-year study. The concept is invoked repeatedly ("harmonic resonance of meaning," "first chords of the symphonies of truth beginning to sound") and drives her final action. However, the mechanics remain abstract; the text tells us the language "could only be spoken truthfully" but never dramatizes a false interpretation's consequence or shows Elara navigating a specific harmonic puzzle on the page. Present in setup, middle, and closure, yet its tactical impact is metaphorical rather than concrete.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Carefully reckless" is applied once in paragraph one ("She was carefully reckless in her approach to the final passage") to describe Elara's method, but the trait is label-only. The text does not dramatize competing impulses—caution and recklessness acting simultaneously—with visible cost. Her trembling hands and hesitation suggest care; her commitment suggests boldness; but no on-page choice hinges on this duality or foreclos a safer path. The phrase is ornamental rather than structural.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" anchors the climax: Elara "unsnarl[s] meaning from the knot of centuries" in paragraph three, and Elian's line "You unsnarl it" confirms the action's completion. The verb is unique to this story's linguistic premise and cannot be swapped without losing specificity. It appears in setup (paragraph one: "unsnarling a grammatical puzzle") and payoff, driving the turn from isolation to reconciliation. However, the act itself is summarized rather than shown beat-by-beat, and no false attempt or mid-scene friction tests the action's difficulty.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Interconnected promises" is named in paragraph one ("that interconnected promise had guided her") and paragraph two ("each clause dependent on the truth of the one before"). The concept motivates Elara's persistence and structures the extinct language's logic (interlocking declarations). The final act of writing fulfills prior promises, but the method's mechanics—how promises constrain her translation choices on the page—remain abstract. Setup and thematic presence are clear; middle development and tactical specificity are weak.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The extinct language archive is introduced immediately and provides resources (the manuscript, shelves of dead languages) that enable Elara's work. The setting's atmosphere ("held its breath," "thousands of dead languages whispering") supports tone and stakes. However, the archive does not constrain her choices or supply obstacles; no access issue, time limit enforced by the space, or physical layout pressures her decision. The door opening behind her in the final beat is the only spatial move. Present across all beats and thematically apt, but passive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Before paths diverge" appears only in the final paragraph as a thematic phrase, not as a ticking clock or deadline that shapes Elara's tactics. No on-page urgency (e.g., archive closing, Elian leaving, manuscript deteriorating) tightens her decision to write now. The three-year silence establishes duration but not imminent consequence. The timeframe is ornamental, introduced too late to pressure the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Restoring trust after silence is the dominant motivation, seeded early ("the silence between her and... Elian had begun three years ago"), developed in paragraph two ("she had promised him"), and fulfilled in the climax (Elara completes their work, Elian returns, "promises kept and trust restored"). The desire drives on-page action (writing the final passage) with visible cost (risking years of trust on one interpretation). Friction between want (reconciliation) and fear (shattering trust) is present but under-dramatized; her trembling and hesitation are brief.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is named explicitly in the final line and reflected in Elara's trembling hands, hesitation, and final choice to "let hope rise." The tone is coherent across the piece—careful scholarship meeting emotional breakthrough—and modulates with pressure (held breath, quiet resonance, tears). However, the label is stated rather than fully embodied in rhythm and diction; the prose remains uniformly elevated and lyrical throughout, missing opportunities for syntactic acceleration or compression that would charge "exuberance" against "caution." Present in closure, signaled in setup via "carefully reckless," but static in execution.</comment>
