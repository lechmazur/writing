<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira shows competence and observational discipline, but her interior contradictions remain muted. The shift from fragment-collector to truth-finder operates more as professional stance than embodied conflict. Her choice to stay through the dust storm reads as symbolic closure rather than a decision that forecloses options with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak, but interiority leans toward summary of professional method rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates through investigative fragments toward a conceptual repricing (the diamond as data, not curse). Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph. The closure unit—Mira's realization and her decision to stay—reconfigures the stillpoint metaphor, but the cost remains abstract; the final image asserts patience and fragment-reassembly without showing what path she foreclosed or what tangible price she paid. The weeks of letter reconstruction are summarized rather than dramatized, weakening causal density.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard-as-paradox (thriving canopy amid radioactive dust) recurs and charges the final image when Mira watches the trees sway without breaking. The flawed diamond's inclusions constrain the investigative turn by encoding data. Micro-setting of shredded letters provides tactile detail ("archaeological rhythm of reconstruction, matching paper fibers"). The wasteland perimeter and dust storms frame pressure but do not alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: excavate truth from competing narratives. The orchard keeper's arrival and the letter reconstruction provide one meaningful tightening, but both events are told in summary ("over the following weeks") rather than dramatized with reversals. Mira's transmission of findings and decision to stay do not visibly narrow options or force a trade-off; the factions' persistence is predicted, not tested. Agency remains observational; no on-page choice forecloses a live path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from the stillpoint metaphor and the diamond-as-data conceit: truth as the calm center around which lies orbit. The final image—apple trees anchored in paradox—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution by acknowledging that mythologies will persist. Minor slip: "The truth, she had learned, was never a destination" edges toward thematic statement, though it remains tied to prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance contracts smoothly during the keeper's dialogue and expands for the weeks of reconstruction. Diction is controlled and specific ("radiation mapping," "stillpoint of calm"). The orchard keeper's voice carries distinct idiom ("Same thing, if you understand what's been hidden here"). Minor register drift: "metastasized" and "co-opted into a dozen competing mythologies" push toward elevated abstraction at odds with the narrator's investigative voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening sentence anchors voice and stakes. Information density is high in the setup. Template-cadence slip: "Each theory arrived with its own convenient martyrs and villains, each designed to make people feel they understood" repeats "each" stem. Paraphrase loop: "The truth isn't a punishment. It's just the thing everyone agreed to forget" restates in adjacent beats without added pressure. The final paragraph's "the truth was never a destination—it was simply the stillpoint" recycles the metaphor without tightening it. Minor clarity gain from cutting scaffolding phrases ("she had learned," "Mira understood then").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The stillpoint-as-geological-anchor and diamond-as-crystalline-data offer a fresh synthesis of myth-debunking and hard-SF world logic. The orchard paradox is vivid and specific. The framing—conspiracy debunker in a radioactive zone—risks template plotting (lone investigator vs. factions) but transforms it through the flawed-diamond instrument and the compression of curse-narrative into data. The final image's resonance feels earned. Risk: the piece avoids dramatizing the investigative struggle, preferring summary, which softens the ingenuity's impact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira appears in every beat and her professional method structures the investigation. She makes two on-page choices: establishing her safehouse (mentioned) and staying through the dust storm (closure). The transmission of findings is told, not shown. Her role as debunker frames expectation early and her final stance (patience as method) reconfigures the opening fragment-collection metaphor. However, the middle weeks of reconstruction are summarized; she does not make a tactical choice under pressure that alters her approach. Present in closure but causal work is modest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The diamond appears in two beats: the keeper's revelation (physical handling, visual detail of inclusions) and Mira's realization that inclusions encode exposure data. Its transformation from cursed relic to scientific instrument drives the investigative turn and reweights the stillpoint premise. It does not appear in or shape the final image; the apple trees take that role. Early signal, causal involvement in the central turn, but closure linkage is absent. Swappable with another data-storage object (e.g., coded artifact) with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The stillpoint is named in paragraph one, explained as a geological phenomenon (tectonic stability, mineral composition) in the investigative middle, and echoed metaphorically in the final paragraph ("the stillpoint around which all the lies began to orbit"). It shapes Mira's understanding and the thematic closure but does not constrain an on-page tactical choice. Present across setup, development, and payoff; drives the conceptual repricing. However, its mechanics remain told rather than tested by character action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Sharply observant" is labeled in the opening line ("her decade of training kicking in before her conscious mind could process") and demonstrated when she evaluates the orchard keeper and infers the factions' narrative strategy. It does not visibly constrain a choice or impose cost; Mira's observations lead to understanding, not tradeoffs. The trait enables her investigative method but is not tested under pressure with a visible price. Present early, functional, but replaceable with "experienced investigator" with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Intuit" describes Mira's method: she intuits "the patterns beneath such narratives" and understands why factions deployed storytellers first. This realization drives her approach but the intuitive leaps occur off-page during the summarized weeks of letter reconstruction. The final paragraph restates her patient, pattern-seeking stance. The action is thematic and present in closure, but not dramatized in a specific beat where intuition alters tactics with cost. Swappable with "deduce" or "infer" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Shredded letters are introduced in paragraph five and their reassembly is described with tactile specificity ("archaeological rhythm of reconstruction, matching paper fibers and ink trajectories"). The method produces the investigative payoff (controlled-release story, diamond-as-data). However, the weeks of work are summarized in one paragraph; no on-page beat shows Mira making a tactical choice within the reassembly process. Present in setup and development; delivers closure intel but does not shape an on-page choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is introduced in the opening paragraph and recurs throughout: skeletal pretreatment village vs. living canopy, dust storms pausing daily assault, radiation mapping on the keeper's skin, apple trees swaying in the final image. The orchard's paradox (thriving amid contamination) embodies the stillpoint premise and charges the closure image. The setting pressures the investigation's stakes (why survival here?) and the final decision to stay. Present across all three gates with strong closure linkage and irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the liquidation" anchors the timeframe in paragraph one; "two days after" and "by the time she established her safehouse" provide sequence. The orchard keeper arrives "on her third day" and reconstruction occurs "over the following weeks." Time is tracked but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the summarized weeks dilute urgency. The final dust storm marks closure timing but does not impose a deadline. Present in setup; minimal pressure in development; closure participation is atmospheric only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mira's desire to excavate truth is stated early ("she collected fragments") and dramatized through her letter reconstruction and transmission of findings. The contrast between "comfortable lies" and "uncomfortable truths" recurs and the final paragraph restates her patient, fragment-reassembly stance. However, the motivation is not tested by friction or cost on the page; Mira encounters no on-page obstacle or temptation that forces her to choose truth over safety or expediency. Present across beats; thematic payoff strong; but no visible tradeoff that forecloses a path.</comment>
