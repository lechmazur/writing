<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's proprioceptive enhancement provides concrete embodiment throughout ("every joint slightly displaced from where memory insisted it should be"), and the shame of compliance during interrogation registers viscerally in her stomach. Her micro-choices—walking forward despite the beacon's call, refusing to remove the strap—demonstrate contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The decision to remain at the clearing's edge facing an unknown cost forecloses the path of comfortable numbness with visible psychological stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the first paragraph (Mira awakening post-interrogation in an ultraviolet forest). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (pewter strap humming, ultraviolet gathering like water) and the mathematics-of-mercy motif reweights from survival calculation to acceptance of devastation. Closure achieves Charged Poise—Mira stops at the clearing's edge understanding she must trade "the arithmetic of her wounds for something stranger," crystallizing her stance with undeniable conceptual cost even though the final transaction remains unexecuted on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest supplies colors "she had no names for," charging every sensory detail with otherworldliness while the body itself functions as micro-setting through proprioceptive awareness constraining movement. The pewter mask strap's hum felt "in her teeth and the base of her skull" pressures the protagonist's trajectory. The clearing where ultraviolet light "gathered like water in a basin" and "existed outside of ordinary geometry" directly charges the final image, making environment indispensable to the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to continue fleeing or confront the unknown price—is signaled when Mira realizes the unlocked doors might be "just another form of experiment." Pressure accumulates through the strap's increasing hum and the clearing's pull. The tightening occurs at the threshold where "whatever waited for her there would demand a price she had not yet calculated," forcing a trade-off between comfortable numbness and "something stranger and perhaps more true." Agency is expressed through endurance (not removing the strap) and stance crystallization at the clearing's edge with conceptual cost legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "mathematics of mercy" motif emerges from concrete interrogation experience, evolves from quantification tool to recognition that answers live "in the questions themselves," and reweights at closure into acceptance that the price remains incalculable. The pewter strap transforms from forgotten relic to beacon to anchor for "her own devastation," constraining the final choice. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: mercy cannot be calculated but must be walked through, trading arithmetic for truth without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with Mira's perceptual signature showing proprioceptive filtering ("every joint slightly displaced") and synesthetic processing (ultraviolet colors, frequencies felt in teeth). Diction stays character-consistent—"the mathematics of mercy," "special was just another word for damaged in a language that preferred euphemisms"—reflecting her analytical bent warped by trauma. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at "she realized with a start that this was how the remembering worked now" and opening for the closing stakes. No head-hopping; elision of the interrogation's content serves closure by keeping focus on bodily memory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong figurative density throughout ("anesthesia dissolved like sugar in rain," "time had become a rubber band") maintains consistent voice and advances atmosphere without obscuring causality. Minor template-cadence slip: three consecutive "she [past verb]" constructions in paragraph four create brief rhythmic monotony. Information density is high—most lines layer body state, world detail, and thematic weight—and the final sentence's syntax ("would demand a price she had not yet calculated, would ask her to trade") mirrors the accumulating obligation effectively. One paraphrase loop: paragraph three restates the proprioception-as-curse idea across two sentences without added pressure, triggering −0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of body-horror medical SF with mystical threshold imagery and trauma-as-epistemology creates a distinct atmospheric blend. "Mathematics of mercy" as organizing obsession transforms the survivor-walks-away premise into philosophical inquiry with genuine stakes. The ultraviolet forest and proprioceptive enhancement work symbiotically rather than as checklist additions. Risk-taking in the abstract philosophical register during peak pressure moments (final paragraph's "arithmetic of her wounds") could alienate some readers but commits fully to its conceptual stance without retreating to safer genre beats.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's survivor status frames the opening, her interrogation compliance drives the shame that fuels her mathematics obsession (middle development), and her choice to walk toward the clearing rather than flee or remove the beacon directly shapes the closure stance. Present across all three gates with causal pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The pewter mask strap appears in the opening as "relic they had forgotten to remove," returns transformed as humming beacon in paragraph five, and remains worn at the threshold—"She did not remove it"—charging the final choice with the weight of remaining "rooted to her own devastation." Three distinct beats, closure linkage strong, irreplaceable because its beacon function drives the final dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Ultraviolet appears as setting color but "penance" as concept never materializes on the page. The forest pressures movement and the final clearing offers a threshold, but no enacted or contemplated penance shapes tactics. The mathematics-of-mercy obsession functions where penance should; the prompt concept is largely replaced by a thematically adjacent substitute.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Proprioceptive enhancement provides opening embodiment ("every joint slightly displaced") and enables trauma-encoded navigation ("her bare feet found the moss path automatically, her body remembering"). Functions in two beats with modest cost (discomfort, involuntary response) but does not constrain a major choice or charge the closure image—Mira's threshold decision would operate identically without it.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Bracing against the tree grounds the opening physically and signals bodily struggle, but the action itself could swap with "steadied herself" or "leaned" without structural loss. Present early but does not drive turns or closure; merely functional transit staging.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled in paragraph four ("this was how the remembering worked now... through the body's responses") and demonstrated through automatic moss-path navigation and heart-racing at light wavelengths. Shapes middle development by encoding the escape route and thematically charges the closure choice to remain anchored in devastation. Present in two beats with clear mechanics that matter to the journey.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest supplies un-nameable colors that disorient and pressure, the moss path encodes bodily memory enabling navigation, and the clearing's geometry-defying basin of light creates the final threshold where price must be faced. Present throughout, shapes tactics (following body memory), and is indispensable to the closure image where "ultraviolet light gathered like water" charges the confrontation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Post-anesthesia timeframe anchors the opening and establishes causality for disorientation and weakened state. Retrospective "three weeks by her count" provides interrogation duration context. However, the forest walk operates in soft elapsed time with no clock pressure tightening decisions—Mira could pause or continue without urgency. Present and functional but does not escalate stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mathematics-of-mercy obsession is introduced in paragraph three as coping mechanism born from interrogation trauma, evolves through realization that "mercy... did not live in answers but in the questions themselves," and directly frames the closure choice to "trade the arithmetic of her wounds for something stranger." Desire shapes tactics (choosing to walk forward) and charges the final stance with visible conceptual cost. Strong across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Displaced-rooted tone is embodied immediately through "phantom weight of restraints" and "proprioceptively enhanced sense... now a curse," sustaining simultaneous groundedness in body and estrangement from self throughout. The tone modulates appropriately—analytic during the mathematics reflection, visceral during body-memory moments—and charges the final image where she chooses to remain "rooted to her own devastation rather than fleeing." Coherent, pressure-responsive, and indispensable to thematic resonance.</comment>
