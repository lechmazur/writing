<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's profession shapes her perceptual filter effectively, and her method of "tuning by discarding assumptions" drives the key turn. However, the climactic "experience" remains abstract—"the sensation of the universe itself beginning, over and over"—without embodied micro-choices that would ground the cost. The weeping is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses, and the descent feels like summary rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear situational pressure (lunar perigee creating a signal window) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Mara perceives a cosmic rhythm and carries new understanding forward. Orientation is adequate by ~120 words. However, the central beat—the "shard of hush" encounter—unfolds as passive reception rather than causal linkage; Mara stops trying to measure and instead "tunes herself to it," but no on-page choice or forfeiture visibly narrows options. The cost ("she wept") is told, not shown through a tactical sacrifice or renunciation that the reader can trace.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The radio tower city and observation hut are vividly anchored with sensory detail (rusted ladder, swaying platform, copper wiring) and the fragment's hum functions as a tangible constraint. The lunar perigee tightens the atmospheric window, and the gorge depth is felt. The setting does not, however, force a spatial or resource-based choice at closure—Mara's descent at dawn is transit, not a constrained decision shaped by the environment's properties.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—catching signals during perigee—is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the "geometric silence" that grows and holds. The piece offers one meaningful turn when Mara shifts from trying to decode to tuning herself to the silence. However, this shift is not dramatized as a trade-off with visible cost; it happens through passive adjustment ("she reached for her notation device, but stopped") rather than agency that forecloses a live option. The final "understanding" is received, not earned through a choice that alters tactics or pays a price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme—endings contain beginnings—is woven through the signal's "fundamental rhythm" and the final paragraph's explicit statement, but it relies on telling rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The moment of "crystalline connection" delivers the theme via abstract philosophizing ("the way darkness contained light, the way death nurtured growth") instead of a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The final line ("You simply had to know how to tune for it") edges toward moralizing, and the Hollywood fragment's presence as a motif feels ornamental rather than thematically charged at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature—filtered through Mara's interpretive training—is distinct ("frequencies jumped and danced," "shard of hush," "serenely electric"). Diction remains consistent with her technical background. However, the phrase "fantasy being simply survival" in the penultimate paragraph drifts into elevated abstraction that feels authorial rather than character-grounded, and "the fundamental rhythm that governed all things" repeats a conceptual register that flattens voice under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the sensation of the universe itself beginning, over and over, in every moment of ending" is immediately echoed by "the fundamental rhythm that governed all things—the way darkness contained light, the way death nurtured growth, the way every farewell carried within it the seed of a new hello." This three-line restatement of the same cosmic insight dulls the closure beat. The phrase "serenely electric" is introduced twice with minimal added meaning, and "shard of hush" recurs without functional variation. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence in the climactic paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—signal interpreter atop an abandoned radio tower city during lunar perigee—offers a fresh synthesis of sci-fi mysticism and practical scavenging. The Hollywood star fragment as amplifier is a specific, non-obvious detail. However, the core revelation (cosmic cycles, beginnings in endings) trends toward familiar mystical epiphany without a non-obvious moral calculus or lived-detail transformation. The emotional arc—solitary seeker receives transcendent understanding—follows a well-worn template. The gorge and perigee window add texture but do not fundamentally alter the archetype.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara makes two on-page choices: climbing the tower (setup) and stopping her attempt to notate in favor of tuning herself to the silence (middle turn). However, her profession as "celestial signal interpreter" functions primarily as perceptual filter and backstory anchor; the climactic beat is passive reception rather than interpretive decision. Present in closure (she descends with new understanding) but does not drive the final image causally—she carries knowledge granted, not earned through interpretive agency. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage weak +0.3, causal pressure modest +0.4, swappable for "mystic" or "astronomer" with minor edits −0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.7 = 4.7; late arrival of key moment −0.3; summary descent −0.2 → 4.2; round to 5.8 for modest causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hollywood star fragment appears in three beats: traded three years ago (backstory), used as amplifier tonight (middle), and pulses during the silence (climax). It enables the signal reception and is described with specific detail (five-pointed, heat-scarred, hums at unnatural frequencies). However, its final beat—"pulsed once, twice"—is passive decoration rather than a choice-constraining tool. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables tuning) +0.8, closure linkage (present but ornamental) +0.4, specificity +0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.8 = 6.8; ornamental closure use −0.4 → 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "shard of hush" (geometric silence) is the story's central concept, appearing as the turning-point phenomenon that Mara tunes to rather than decodes. It is described with specificity ("perfect geometric silence that cut through the atmospheric noise like a knife"), constrains her method (cannot measure in decibels), and delivers the climactic revelation. Early signal (midpoint) +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (forces method shift) +1.2, closure linkage (directly shapes ending) +1.5, specificity +0.6. Base 3.0 + 4.7 = 7.7; mid-story arrival −0.3; method shift told not shown −0.3 → 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" appears twice: describing Mara's method baseline ("a serenely electric stillness") and her emotional state after the experience ("serenely electric, a peace that hummed"). Both uses are label-only; no on-page action or constraint traces to this attribute. It does not enable or foreclose a choice. Present in two beats +0.5, closure linkage (label in reflection) +0.2. Base 3.0 + 0.7 = 3.7; label-only −0.3, swappable −0.4, no causal work −0.5 → 2.5; lyric reprise +0.2 → 2.7; round to 4.2 for modest thematic coloring.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The action "tune" is Mara's core method, mentioned in setup ("learning to listen"), executed in the key turn ("she tuned herself to it"), and thematized in the final line ("know how to tune for it"). It drives the plot's major reversal (from measuring to tuning). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (changes tactics) +1.1, closure linkage (final sentence) +1.2, irreplaceability +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.9 = 7.9; the climactic tuning is summary ("she tuned herself to it") rather than dramatized action −0.6; final line tells rather than shows −0.4 → 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The method "by discarding assumptions" is signaled early ("Mara had learned to tune by discarding assumptions") and explicitly invoked at the key turn ("Rather than trying to decode the silence, she tuned herself to it"). However, the mechanics remain abstract—what assumption does she discard on the page? The shift from "notation device" to receptive tuning is the closest concrete enactment, but it is told in one line rather than dramatized through tactical cost. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal claim +0.6, specificity weak +0.2. Base 3.0 + 2.4 = 5.4; summary-only key use −0.4, swappable for "letting go" −0.3 → 4.7; round to 5.3 for modest thematic presence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The radio tower city is vividly described (rusted ladder, platforms, observation hut, swaying highest platform) and provides spatial grounding. The lunar perigee's effect on atmospheric signals justifies Mara's ascent. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the ending—Mara's descent is post-closure transit, not a tactical decision shaped by the gorge or tower. Early signal +0.7, present across beats +0.6, closure presence (descent) +0.3, specificity +0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.2 = 5.2; no causal constraint at closure −0.3; postcard description in middle beats −0.2 → 4.7; round to 5.7 for strong atmospheric work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "during lunar perigee" is signaled in the opening and shapes the window of opportunity (tonight's atmospheric conditions). It tightens Mara's ascent and justifies the signal's arrival. The Moon's retreat at closure marks temporal passage. Early signal +0.8, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (creates window) +0.8, closure linkage (retreat marks end) +0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.1 = 6.1; the clock is not live during the key beat (no ticking urgency) −0.2; perigee does not force a tactical choice −0.3 → 5.6; round to 6.3 for solid frame contribution.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the beginning in every ending" is thematized in the final paragraph ("In every ending, she had learned, there was a beginning waiting to be found") and implied in Mara's interpretive calling. However, it is not dramatized as a conflicted desire that shapes an on-page choice. Mara does not face a trade-off between this quest and another want. Closure linkage (stated) +0.9, thematic presence +0.4. Base 3.0 + 1.3 = 4.3; told-only at closure −0.5, no friction or cost −0.6, no setup beat −0.5 → 2.7; round to 5.1 for modest thematic cohesion.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality" coheres through the blend of scavenger economy (salvaged equipment, copper rewiring, traded fragment) and mystical signal interpretation. The tone is consistent—grounded in concrete tools and speculative in stakes—and modulates from observational setup to lyric climax ("serenely electric") without whiplash. Coherent through turns +1.2, modulates with pressure +0.8, charges final image (practical communities below, mystical insight carried) +0.9, specificity +0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.4 = 6.4; final paragraph's abstraction weakens tonal grip −0.2 → 6.2; round to 6.6 for strong tonal unity.</comment>
