<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's engineering curiosity and problem-solving orientation are consistent, but her interior life remains thin—she moves through discovery to proposal without meaningful internal conflict or embodied emotion. The sextant piece triggers calculations and civic vision, yet no contradictory impulse complicates her drive; she's functionally creative as labeled but never struggles with doubt, fatigue, or competing desires. The council approval arrives off-page, removing the chance to dramatize her stake under interpersonal pressure. Competence without genuine friction flattens what could be a richer arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a causal lens early (discover → calculate → propose → approve) and delivers an on-page decision to redirect water flows, but closure cost remains abstract: we're told the project begins, yet no visible trade-off, renunciation, or interpersonal friction charges the final image. The sextant becomes a desk ornament rather than a constraint that alters her next move. Orientation is clean, escalation is present in the form of expanding civic vision, but the ending summarizes hope ("the only appropriate response") instead of dramatizing a choice that forecloses a live alternative with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The spaceport's ribcage polymer walls, cracked tiles, and mineral-sealed tunnels are vivid and selective, filtered through Mara's engineering lens. The sextant piece and ruptured drainage pipe constrain her middle exploration, and the trickling stream at closure uses setting tactilely. However, spatial choreography in the tunnels remains vague—three junction chambers are mapped but never individuated—and the carnival's residual popcorn-and-sawdust sensory layer, though atmospheric, doesn't pressure her choices. The final hall image is static description rather than environment that alters her stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can she restore the terminal for civic use—is signaled early and pursued through mapping, calculation, and proposal. One meaningful tightening occurs when she identifies the aquifer angle and presents to the council, but no on-page reversal tests her commitment: the supervisors approve without friction, the carnival's departure is backdrop rather than complication, and no resource or interpersonal cost narrows her options. The final paragraph declares "stoic wonder" as the appropriate response, summarizing rather than dramatizing a trade-off. Agency is present but escalation lacks a visible price that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of resurrection and refusal to let go emerges organically from the spaceport's history and Mara's engineering mission, but the council speech ("spoke not of engineering specifications but of possibility") tells the thematic pivot rather than showing it through a fraught choice or image. The sextant recurs with symbolic weight yet never constrains a decision; it sits polished on her desk, an ornament rather than a lived question. The closing line—"stoic wonder as the only appropriate response to the universe's stubborn persistence toward renewal"—is overt philosophizing that replaces scene pressure with abstraction, lowering resonance at the critical moment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable, and Mara's engineering idiom (calculations, aquifer angles, filtration systems) colors perception consistently. Psychic distance modulates appropriately between close interiority ("Her mind began cycling through equations") and wider civic vision. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction—"maze of intentions," "psychological architecture," "stoic wonder as the only appropriate response"—that exceeds her on-page voice in peak beats, especially at closure. No dialogue is present to test character distinction. Perceptual signature is functional but not deeply idiosyncratic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and syntax is generally clean, but several passages loop or inflate without adding pressure: "hope, she realized, could not be measured in linear time" restates the prior paragraph's optimism; "stubborn persistence toward renewal" in the final line stacks abstract nominalizations where a concrete image would sharpen closure. The phrase "functionally creative, always had been" is summary-label backstory that could anchor in a present micro-choice. Template openings recur ("She descended," "She was," "She traced," "By noon, she had"). Figurative language—"hollow ribcage," "ghost of music," "dark ribbons"—is vivid in early beats but the closure paragraph abandons image for philosophical summary, dulling propulsion at the key moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of carnival ground and former spaceport offers a fresh premise, and the sextant piece as historical survivor is specific. However, the emotional arc—lone engineer discovers relic, envisions civic renewal, gains approval—follows a familiar template without a non-obvious complication or moral calculus. The council approval arrives cleanly off-page, removing friction that could distinguish this from similar restoration narratives. The ending's "stoic wonder" and "stubborn persistence toward renewal" reach for profundity through abstraction rather than a charged particular, and the piece does not take structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes beyond the median.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara's curiosity drives her to beg for the assignment and explore the tunnels; her engineering calculations lead to the aquifer solution and council proposal. She appears in setup, middle mapping, and closure presentation. However, key turns—the decision to present and the approval—occur with minimal on-page friction or cost; her observations dominate over high-stakes choices. She is functionally present across beats but rarely forced into a trade-off that the curious-engineer trait uniquely enables or constrains. Swappable with "determined intern" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sextant piece appears early (discovery in tunnels), is handled physically (brushed clean, felt heavy), returns at closure (polished on her desk), and its explorer heritage seeds the resurrection theme. It does not, however, constrain a middle choice or alter tactics; she calculates the aquifer solution independently. Its closure presence is ornamental—a desk object rather than an image that reweights her next decision with cost. Two-beat presence (discovery, desk) with thematic echo but no causal pressure caps it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Maze of intentions" is named explicitly in one paragraph ("profit, progress, abandonment, forgetting") but functions as thematic label rather than on-page constraint. The tunnels are literal corridors Mara navigates, yet the concept does not shape her tactics—she maps junctions and calculates flows without wrestling competing intentions or priority conflicts. The council decision is summarized, not dramatized as a clash of visions. Present and articulated, but ornamental to the causal engine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Functionally creative, always had been" is a label stated once and illustrated by her aquifer solution, which demonstrates problem-solving. However, the trait does not constrain or cost her—no on-page moment where creativity clashes with procedure, safety, or budget. She calculates, proposes, succeeds without friction that the attribute uniquely enables or limits. Label-only mention with one supporting action but no visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Resurrect" frames her goal from the outset (resurrect infrastructure, "perhaps she could resurrect more than infrastructure") and drives the aquifer plan and council pitch. The word recurs with purpose and her final act—starting the water flow—is resurrection in concrete form. However, the resurrection succeeds without complication or cost on the page; no choice or tactic hinges on whether to restore versus abandon. It defines the goal but does not redefine options under pressure, keeping it essential yet not indispensable to a turning point.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Redirected water flows are signaled early (her research focus on "redirected water flows through abandoned civic spaces"), shape her middle calculation (aquifer angle, mineral flush timeline), and materialize at closure ("first diverted stream began trickling"). The method is not merely cosmetic—it determines her tactical approach and the seventeen-day timeline. However, it does not create friction or force a mid-scene adjustment; the flow works as planned. Present in setup, middle mechanics, and closure action, with causal role but no on-page cost tied to the method itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The spaceport's transparent polymer walls, maintenance stairwell, ruptured drainage pipe, and junction chambers anchor every beat; Mara's descent and mapping depend on its layout, the sextant is discovered in sediment, and the main hall hosts the closure image of sediment swirling away. The terminal's status as abandoned civic space is inseparable from her stake. It supplies the problem (mineral blockages), resources (old filtration system), and the final stage for renewal. Environment constrains exploration and charges the ending image; removing this exact setting breaks the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The carnival's recent departure is mentioned in the opening and creates atmospheric residue (crushed grass, popcorn smell), but it does not tighten decisions or create a clock. Mara's mapping, calculations, and proposal unfold at her own pace; no deadline or urgency stems from the post-carnival moment. The timeframe is present as context but ornamental to pressure—easily replaceable with "after the festival" or "last week" without altering her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Her desire "to puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated late (final third: "some equations…were not meant to solve mysteries but to pose them") and illustrated by her aquifer calculations and civic vision. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized in conflicted choices—she pursues restoration without friction between hope and fear, personal cost, or competing wants. The phrase appears at closure but as thematic summary rather than a decision that forecloses an alternative. Present and thematically coherent but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Stoic wonder is named explicitly in the final line and reflected in Mara's calm problem-solving amid the spaceport's grandeur and ruin. The tone is consistent—measured curiosity, no melodrama—and modulates slightly when she imagines hopeful travelers. However, the final paragraph declares the tone ("stoic wonder as the only appropriate response") rather than embodying it through image or restrained gesture, and the tone does not charge the closure beat with pressure. Coherent and legible but told at the key moment, capping it in mid-band.</comment>
