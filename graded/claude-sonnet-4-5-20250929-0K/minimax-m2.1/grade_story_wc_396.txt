<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is richly textured—"understanding required seeing clearly what others could not bear to look upon directly"—and her willingness to stand apart from easy answers feels earned. However, the transformation at closure lacks a concrete cost; she walks out "with purpose" but no visible forfeiture or micro-choice that dramatizes what she's given up or risked. The shadows and her peacekeeper nature are told more than embodied in pressure-driven action, and her hierarchy of values remains abstract rather than tested through incompatible goods.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story anchors early (lighthouse keeper, orchard, ice) and builds a Resonant Reconfiguration—she chooses to use the fragment to see more clearly rather than repair it. The closure reads as Charged Poise, crystallizing her stance, but the felt cost is implicit rather than visceral; the "weighted breath before reply" frames intention but doesn't land a decisive forfeiture on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layered images reweight meaning), held consistently, though the final move feels more described than lived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the orchard in impossible soil, ice floes that "shifted and groaned like sleeping giants," and the vintage store materializing where bones once lay all anchor Mira's world. The fragment charges the final image, and the ice softening for safe passage ties environment directly to closure consequence. Spatial choreography inside the store is clear—upturned crate, mirrors, fragment—though the lighthouse-to-store transition elides distance and time without signaling the gap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to repair or reconstitute—is signaled and resolved, but escalation is gentle; the fragment's faces "form and dissolve" without narrowing Mira's options or imposing visible trade-offs. The final turn (using fragments to see clearly) emerges from calm intuition rather than pressure-driven agency. No reversal tests commitment; the ice softening feels like validation rather than a price paid for her choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—peace as understanding, fragments as lens rather than wholeness—emerges organically from the crystal, mirrors, and Mira's stance. "Some things could not be made whole again" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The weighted breath before reply recurs purposefully, charging the final move. However, "courageous anomaly" and "map empathy onto action" hover near prompt-label territory, slightly diluting the specificity at peak moments.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and distinct: "the salt that dried into their skin from years of sea wind," "the weighted breath before reply when everything was still possible." Psychic distance remains stable; diction fits Mira's reflective cast. Minor slippage: "she understood instinctively" tells certainty the prose could show, and "courageous anomaly of her nature" reads slightly external. No dialogue present; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but controlled: "veins through marble," "sleeping giants," "current carry her toward what she needed to see." However, the final third carries minor loops—"understood" recurs three times in close succession, "walking" twice in adjacent beats—and "the weighted breath before reply" is reused without reweighting. Information density is high, propulsion steady, though the closure sentence stacks clauses ("the fragment warm… the orchard bending… softening the ice") in a way that slightly diffuses impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse-orchard-ice synthesis and the vintage store materializing where bones lay offer fresh angles; the broken crystal as a lens rather than a repair project transforms a stock motif. Mira's stance—"peace was not the absence of conflict but the presence of understanding"—feels earned through specific images (mirrors, layered reflections, faces in fragments) rather than assertion. Risk-taking in the layered, elliptical structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though the broader peacekeeper-in-impossible-landscape frame echoes familiar lyric-fantasy templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and makes the key choice at closure (use fragments to see, not repair). Setup by first paragraph, middle development via the mirror encounter, payoff in the final walk. However, her peacekeeper role mostly provides thematic color; the "shadows" are told rather than tested, and her decision doesn't visibly narrow options or impose a trade-off tied specifically to peacekeeping. The shadow-laced attribute remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The fragment appears in three beats: pressed into her palm, held on the crate while faces form, held before the mirror as compass. It constrains her final action (use it to see clearly) and charges the closure image. Setup mid-story (~40% mark), strong development and payoff. Swappability is low—its brokenness is thematically load-bearing—but the cost tied to it (what she foregoes by not repairing) is implicit rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Courageous anomaly" is named once in exposition and again implied in the final choice, but it does not constrain or enable a tactical move on the page. The concept echoes thematically (standing apart, harder peace) but remains abstract. Setup present, weak development, minimal payoff. Easily swappable with "unconventional peacekeeper" or similar phrasing without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" is shown in the current-like movement through images and the unhurried final choice, but no visible cost or trade-off is tied to it. Setup by paragraph two, middle use in the crate scene, implicit at closure. The trait enables smooth passage but doesn't foreclose an option or create friction. Functional presence, minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" is the stated goal and the closure turn hinges on it—she chooses to reconstitute understanding rather than the crystal itself. Setup in the store, reframed at closure. Strong thematic linkage. However, the action itself is more metaphorical than physical; she doesn't literally reconstitute anything on the page, lowering irreplaceability. Development is conceptual rather than beat-driven.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The mirrors appear in two beats: Mira catches her layered reflection, then holds the fragment before the largest mirror as compass. The method shapes the middle encounter and primes the final choice. Setup ~50% mark (late but paid off), moderate development, payoff in the compass image. Mechanics matter—the mirrors show "more than reflections"—but the glimpses themselves don't constrain a choice; Mira's insight could plausibly arise elsewhere.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice is introduced in the opening line, provides apples for trade, frames Mira's understanding of safety/hunger, and the ice softening at closure validates her choice. Setup strong, middle pressure (orchard as context for store visit), closure linkage direct. The setting's impossible soil and the ice's physical pressure are causally tied to stakes and outcome. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"The weighted breath before reply" is named twice—as concept and as the moment of Mira's choice—but does not function as a live clock. The timeframe reweights the closure thematically but doesn't tighten tactics or create urgency. Setup mid-story, weak development, lyric reprise at end. Swappable with "moment of decision" without breaking causality.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira's desire to "map empathy onto action" is stated and enacted at closure—she walks out with purpose to strengthen understanding. Setup paragraph two, middle friction in the fragment scene (faces of those helped and failed), payoff in the final walk. The motivation drives the ending but lacks on-page conflict; no competing want tests her commitment. Told more than dramatized under pressure.</comment>
