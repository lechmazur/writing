<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("read absence the way others read scripture"), and her shift from provincial surveyor to "archeologist of abandoned dreams" is signaled early and earned through the pavilion discovery. The embodied cold water and careful handling of the inkwell ground her physicality. Minor slip: the final epiphany about "hushed blaze" edges toward label-speak, though it remains anchored in prior sensory work. The choice to place notes and claim the inkwell forecloses her old path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clean within 120 words (Maren, shore mapping, dusk, pavilion). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through object discovery, note-placing ritual, and the final image of carrying the story "like a letter never sent." Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final paragraph crystallizes her new role with undeniable pressure and conceptual cost (leaving the provincial job implied). One meaningful deepening: the inkwell inscription shifts her from observer to custodian, reweighting her entire practice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The pavilion is vividly particular: octagonal, stone pillars, kelp-draped railings, raised drawbridge bleeding rust into evening light. The rising water functions as a live constraint, forcing Maren to work quickly and climb to the highest bench. The cold seeping through her clothes and the smell of wet limestone anchor sensory selection to present urgency. The crumbled foundation directly enables the inkwell discovery, and the structure charges the final image—Maren carries its story as the pavilion "settles deeper into its long forgetting."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Maren wants to transcend provincial survey work and become the "archeologist of abandoned dreams." The pavilion discovery provides one meaningful tightening—finding the inkwell and its inscription forces her to commit to this new identity by placing her own notes and carrying the artifact away. The rising water creates physical pressure and a ticking clock. Agency is clear: her choice to document and claim the site forecloses her old role, and the cost is visible in her wading out alone with "permission" earned. No antagonist required; the accumulative lens supports a single decisive deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the pavilion, inkwell inscription, and note-placing ritual dramatize "interlaced absence" and unfinished projects without stating a thesis. The final image—"like a letter never sent"—reweights the entire premise of surveying loss versus curating it, offering a resonant answer to Maren's implicit question about her life's work. Subtext operates in the widow's-veil kelp, the drawbridge "raised in perpetuity," and the phrase "hushed blaze," though the latter edges toward thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph. The piece resists moralizing and embraces ambiguity about whether Maren's new path is noble or obsessive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices "absence the way others read scripture" and thinks in metaphors of archeology and correspondence. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during the inkwell discovery, pulling back slightly for the final reflection. Diction remains consistent and elevated without jarring register shifts, though "hushed blaze" in the penultimate paragraph feels slightly imposed. Rhythm varies: short urgent sentences during the wade-in, longer cadences in reflection. No dialogue, so those bullets are not applicable. No head-hopping or unmotivated filter verbs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean and rhythmically controlled: "The waterline crept higher each decade" and "kelp draped the railings like widow's veils" demonstrate concision and specificity. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor template cadence in the final paragraph: three sentences begin with "The" or "She" in close succession, creating slight monotony. The metaphor "hushed blaze" is introduced late and borders on abstract, though the prior work (cold water, wet limestone, "bruised sky" ink) earns it. No loops or scaffolding; grammar and punctuation are clean. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise—surveyor becomes custodian of drowned history—offers a fresh angle on archival obsession, and the specific detail (traveling inkwell, note-placing ritual, submerged octagonal pavilion) avoids generic treatment. The "interlaced absence" concept and the phrase "archeologist of abandoned dreams" feel slightly workshop-coined rather than earned through lived particulars. The turn is anticipated rather than surprising, but the emotional specificity (cold water, rusted chains, "letter never sent") lifts it above template. Transformation test: the core emotional arc could survive a setting swap, but the pavilion's physical constraint and the inkwell's inscription are integral enough to resist easy substitution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maren's role as shore surveyor frames her dissatisfaction early and her choice to transcend it drives the ending. Her decision to wade in, claim the inkwell, and place notes alters her identity with visible cost. Present in setup, middle discovery, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inkwell appears in three beats: discovery with inscription, close examination ("bruised sky" ink), and tucked in her coat at closure. Its inscription ("For whoever finds what we could not finish") directly motivates her note-placing and reweights her mission. The object is causally active and irreplaceable—no other artifact would carry the same unfinished-project resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Interlaced absence" is named once in the penultimate paragraph and echoed in imagery (kelp-draped railings, raised drawbridge, submerged pavilion). It shapes stakes by defining Maren's desired role, but the concept functions more as thematic overlay than on-page tactical constraint. Setup and closure present, but middle development is implicit rather than dramatized through a specific choice forced by absence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Stoically sensitive" is not explicitly labeled but implied through Maren's methodical handling of cold water, careful note-placement, and restrained wonder at the inkwell. The trait enables her to work in discomfort and to read emotional residue in objects, but no single on-page moment foregrounds a cost or tradeoff tied specifically to this duality. Present across beats but not causally decisive.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears in "wrest meaning from the spaces people had left behind" and governs the action of retrieving the inkwell from the hollow. The act redefines Maren's mission and charges the ending, but the verb itself could swap for "retrieve" or "claim" without breaking structure. The concept of wresting—forceful claiming—does elevate the moment beyond passive discovery. Present in middle and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The note-placing method is introduced in the middle ("into each crack and crevice she placed her notes") with explicit philosophy ("conversation across time") and directly shapes the ending beat by formalizing her new role. The mechanics matter—leaving records within the structure itself—and could not easily be swapped. Setup in early reflection, enacted in middle, and its promise ("someone would find them") charges closure. All three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion supplies every key resource and constraint: the crumbled foundation reveals the inkwell, the rising water creates urgency and isolates Maren, the benches provide refuge, and the raised drawbridge literalizes her cut-off state. The setting is irreplaceable—no other location would provide this exact combination of access, danger, and symbolic charge. Present in setup, middle discovery, and closure participation with high causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the drawbridge rises" is established early ("Once the tide turned, she would be cut off for hours") and the rising water is tracked throughout ("The water was rising now," "When the water reached her ankles"). It creates urgency and shapes her final exit, though the clock does not force a specific tactical choice or visible cost. Setup, middle presence, and closure mention satisfy two-of-three gates; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's desire to become "the archeologist of abandoned dreams" is dramatized early ("This was the moment she had been building toward"), tested by the inkwell discovery, and crystallized at closure when she claims "permission" and carries the story away. The motivation conflicts with her colleagues' view ("sentiment") and costs her the safety of provincial records work. All three gates; felt friction and visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" is named late in the penultimate paragraph but is enacted throughout: the quiet intensity of Maren's work, the "particular pull that always preceded discovery," the conviction in her note-placing ritual, and the charged final image of carrying the inkwell "like a letter never sent." Tone modulates from anticipation (dusk arrival) to focus (discovery) to resolve (exit) without breaking coherence. Late explicit mention lowers score slightly, but the mood charges the ending.</comment>
