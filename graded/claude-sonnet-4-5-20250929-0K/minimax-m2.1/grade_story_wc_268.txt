<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Threnody is present throughout but makes no dramatized choices under pressure; her "endless vigil" is told rather than tested. The piece summarizes her purpose and methods across centuries without a single on-page micro-decision that forecloses a path or reveals hierarchy of values. The final "she returned to her endless work" is static description, not a choice with visible cost. Motivation exists only as exposition; no internal contradiction or embodied emotion appears in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: "who" and "where" arrive early, but "when" remains vague ("across the pause of shifting constellations" is atmospheric, not an anchor); no −0.3 applied since the lyric frame is taught. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural is inferred (density build toward a final image). Closure problem: the ending offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing—Threnody simply "returned to her endless work" with no visible cost, no tightening of options, no reweighting of the dominant stake. The "young scholar being born" is future-tense setup, not an on-page closure effect. No felt or conceptual cost is legible in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The library is richly described with vivid, POV-filtered detail ("marble softening into organic curves," "moss that traced the paths of readers long turned to bone and name"). However, setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—it remains postcard backdrop. The "endless corridors and forgotten chambers" are mentioned as "mechanism" but never used tactically on the page. Fails the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (unmask the pretender), but no on-page pressure materializes. Threnody faces no opposition, no reversal, no tightening choice that narrows her options. The "trap from paper and ink" is described in summary; we never see her encounter resistance, adapt tactics, or pay a cost. The piece tells us she has prepared across eleven generations without dramatizing a single escalation beat. No agency is exercised on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of patient truth versus stolen legacy emerges from the premise, not from dramatized events. The "rune of drift" and the library-as-justice motifs are asserted rather than tested. No epiphany is earned on the page; the final "smile, a small expression of satisfaction" is a static label, not a resonant reconfiguration. The piece avoids moralizing but also avoids dramatizing its central question, so resonance remains abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lyric voice is sustained and distinct ("knowledge slumbered in decaying volumes," "dust motes drifted like memories"). POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, register drifts into elevated, decorative diction that never modulates with pressure because no pressure exists on the page. Perceptual signature is consistent but not tested under stress. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished and carries vivid images ("sun-bleached murals were old acquaintances rather than ruins"). However, heavy overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the opening paragraph stacks figurative language without pattern-teaching or payoff ("knowledge slumbered," "dust motes drifted like memories," "readers long turned to bone and name"). Template cadence in the third paragraph: repeated "she" sentence openers and parallel structures. Paraphrase loop: "pretender to the throne" / "fraud...slipped into power through deception" restate the same content. Deductions: density overload −0.5, template cadence −0.4, paraphrase −0.2; total −1.1. Additionally, the opening two paragraphs are scaffold that delay plot entry without creating immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Premise (patient immortal librarian plants clues across generations) is familiar from fantasy templates. The iron gall ink mechanic and biological lineage test add specificity, but the core arc—immortal waits for prophesied scholar—is unaltered from stock patterns. No bold structural or perspectival risk; no transformation through specific lived detail or moral calculus. The final image (she returns to work, scholar is being born elsewhere) is a gentle echo of the opening, not a fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Threnody is present throughout but makes no on-page decisions that alter tactics or narrow options. Setup present; no middle development choice; final image mentions her but does not hinge on a choice. Observation without decision trends low. Gate: setup + payoff cameo. Caps at ~6.0 for two gates, but swappability and summary-only use lower to mid-3s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Iron gall ink pellets are described in detail in the second paragraph and mentioned again in the fourth ("when their fingers traced the iron gall ink"). Two beats, but both are summary-only; the pellets are never handled or used on the page. Setup present; middle development absent (told, not shown); payoff is future-tense. Caps at ~4.6 for missing middle development. Swappability (any magical detection device) lowers further.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The "rune of drift" is mentioned once in the third paragraph as a symbol Threnody inscribes. It does not shape stakes or tactics on the page; it is decorative marginalia in her method. No setup in opening third; no middle or closure participation. Ornamental mention only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Regally unpretentious" is a label applied in the opening paragraph to describe Threnody's bearing; it does not constrain or enable any on-page action. No visible tradeoff, no cost. Setup present as descriptor; no development or payoff. Label-only trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"Sunder" appears once in the fourth paragraph as "a linguistic dismantling of a stolen identity." It is described as Threnody's method but is never enacted on the page. No major turn traces to this action; easily swappable with "expose" or "reveal." Summary-only, no dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cryptic messages in library books are introduced in the third paragraph, detailed in the fourth, and shape the entire method. Setup present; middle development is told (the trap is built off-page); payoff is future-tense (the scholar "will" find the passages). Two gates met (setup + closure seed), eligible to ~6.0. However, the method is never dramatized—we do not see Threnody inscribe a single passage under pressure. Lyric reprise (library mechanism) reweights the stake modestly, reaching mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is established in the opening paragraph, supplies the spatial logic (shelves, genealogies, corridors) across all beats, and frames the closure ("returned to her endless work among the sleeping books"). Setup, development (the library houses the trap), and payoff all present. Three gates met; eligible for ≥6.1. Causal pressure: the library's "endless corridors and forgotten chambers" serve as the mechanism of justice (+0.5). However, the library does not constrain a tactical choice on the page; it remains atmospheric setting. Reaches low-6s for strong involvement without on-page pressure test.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Across the pause of shifting constellations" appears in the opening and closing paragraphs as atmospheric marker. Time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page; the story summarizes eleven generations without tracking a clock. Setup present; no middle development or closure pressure. Vague, untracked time trends low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The motivation to unmask the pretender is introduced in the second paragraph and sustained throughout. Setup present; no on-page friction between want and cost (Threnody's vigil is told as patient rather than tested); payoff is future-tense. Two gates (setup + thematic presence), eligible to ~6.0. However, desire is told-only, not dramatized in choices. Summary-only use and swappability (any justice-seeking motive) lower to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Graceful collapse" is seeded in the opening ("state of graceful collapse," "marble softening into organic curves") and reprised in the fourth paragraph ("pretender's reign would begin its graceful collapse") and final beat. Tone is coherent and modulates subtly from description to thematic claim to closure echo. Setup, development (applied to the pretender's fate), and payoff all present. Three gates met; lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, specificity +0.4. Reaches mid-6s for consistent tonal charge without on-page pressure to elevate further.</comment>
