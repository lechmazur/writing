<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mercury-glass seer possesses a concrete physical form and her interior contradictions appear (fear versus gift, isolation versus connection), but her emotional progression feels abstract and label-driven. The pivotal moment—"I want to remember what home felt like before I learned to fear my own sight"—arrives as articulated insight rather than embodied struggle. Her decision to leave at the end reads as declared rather than earned through on-page choice under pressure. The keeper functions more as oracle than character, offering wisdom without his own stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure when the seer decides to leave, carrying the stone. The closure reconfigures her relationship to her gift with conceptual cost (ending isolation, accepting vulnerability). However, orientation is delayed—"after remembering became painful" and "the cavernous bookstore" establish when and where only vaguely, and "mercury-glass seer" as identity arrives without spatial or temporal anchor by ~120 words. The "seven nights... eighth night" structure provides a tightening, but the accumulative pressure relies heavily on reflection rather than scene-based constraint. Cost is implied (leaving sanctuary, carrying the stone into an uncertain world) but not sharply dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore offers vivid details ("wound through the mountain's core like a digestive tract," "infinite shelves," "electric lamplight") and the stone tablet's feather-texture recurs across multiple beats. The mountain setting anchors the isolation stake. However, spatial choreography remains vague—where exactly is the seer seated, how does the keeper watch "from the shadows," and what does "rising from the floor" imply about her position? The bookstore constrains through isolation but doesn't visibly shape her tactical choices within the space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding home and reclaiming buried talent—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the seven-night consideration and the eighth-night question, creating one meaningful deepening when the seer speaks aloud. However, escalation occurs largely in reflection; the keeper's challenge is met off-page across "seven nights." No on-page reversal tests her commitment with visible cost during the attempt. The decision to leave carries implied cost (vulnerability, unknown reception) but the final image declares rather than dramatizes the price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: home as language rather than place, gifts as gardens requiring tending, pain as proof of value. The stone's glow and the grandmother's kitchen memory offer concrete anchors. However, the closing paragraph states theme overtly—"The shape of home... is not a place you find. It is a language you learn to speak"—which undercuts the emergent quality. The reflections/reality substitution recurs but functions more as motif-mention than constraint. The ending honors complexity (pain paired with gratitude) without moralizing, though the keeper's final lines edge toward summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a lyric register ("mercury-glass," "infinite shelves," "feathered ridges") that suits the protagonist. Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrative voice carries a distinct texture. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction during emotional peaks ("permissions, a vocabulary of healing," "sacred language") that feels writerly rather than character-rooted. The keeper's dialogue is purpose-driven and distinct. Elision of the seven nights is purposeful compression that serves accumulative pressure, though some interiority becomes summary ("she finally understood") rather than dramatized realization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "digestive tract of knowledge," "seed beneath snow," "doorway" for reflections, "water finding its level." In the climax paragraph, metaphors stack without clear propulsion: "The buried talent rose like water... sharp and sudden, but it came paired with something... gratitude for having been given such gifts." Template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "her grandmother speaking... her childhood home dissolving... her talent... buried beneath years." Paraphrase loops occur: "not a curse to be feared but a garden to be cultivated" restates the seed metaphor from two sentences prior. Information density is modest; many lines elaborate a single idea. The read-aloud test reveals syntactic monotony in the middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The mercury-glass seer and mountain bookstore offer a fresh synthesis, and the feather-textured stone is a specific, non-generic object. However, the emotional arc—isolation, feared gift, tentative reclamation, departure—follows a familiar template for magical protagonists. The "buried talent" premise closely matches archetypal hero-refuses-call structures without substantive transformation. The keeper as wise guide and the stone as unlocking artifact are executed competently but conventionally. The lost-language conceit and substituted-reality attribute are introduced but remain ornamental rather than driving unique tactical or thematic friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mercury-glass seer is present throughout. She chooses to ask the question on the eighth night and decides to leave at the end, but much of her arc unfolds in reflection and summary across "seven nights." The question "I want to remember..." is a key turn, but it is articulated insight rather than embodied decision under pressure. Her departure is declared in the final section without on-page resistance or cost-laden choice. Setup and closure participation are clear; middle development is reflective rather than scene-driven.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The lost language stone appears early (second paragraph), is handled and traced across multiple beats (seventh night, eighth night, climax), and the feather texture recurs. It enables the climax when she speaks her question and the stone translates/glows. She pockets it at the end, reweighting it from static artifact to carried companion. However, it does not constrain an earlier choice or create visible friction; it waits passively until she is ready. The cost tied to the stone is conceptual (accepting her gift) rather than a direct price of using the object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Buried talents are named early and shape the dominant stake. The seer's fear of her prophetic gift drives her isolation, and reclaiming the talent is the arc's goal. However, on-page dramatization is thin: the talent is described as "buried," "dormant," and finally "rising" without showing how it constrained earlier choices or what specific cost its return imposes now. It functions more as thematic claim than as a concrete pressure that alters tactics or creates tradeoffs in scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Substitutes reality nightly is mentioned in the opening and closing paragraphs ("reflections substituted reality," "her reflections still substituted reality each night") but never dramatized in action. No on-page scene shows this substitution occurring, constraining perception, or costing her agency. It is framed as a nightly occurrence yet does not shape any beat. It reads as atmospheric label rather than functional trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Seed appears in the keeper's dialogue ("You must plant something of yourself... A seed") and returns when she realizes "the talent she had buried was... a seed beneath snow" and at the end she "water[s] it with honesty." It links the request to the reclamation metaphorically. However, it is figurative language rather than a distinct action. No literal seed is planted or handled. The metaphor is coherent and returns at closure, but it does not redefine options or impose mechanical constraint. Setup and closure reprise are strong; middle beat is summary.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Via the texture of a feather: The stone's surface is described as "feather against her glass fingertips" and "feathered ridges" recur when she traces it on the eighth night. The tactile method is signaled and consistent. However, it does not shape an attempt or impose a cost—she touches it multiple times without consequence until the final question. The mechanics are decorative rather than functional. Setup and closure mention are present; middle involvement is repetition without development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain is vividly described and establishes her isolation. It appears throughout and anchors the setting. However, it does not constrain her choices within the story—she wanders freely, sits before the stone, and leaves without obstacle. The mountain/bookstore functions as sanctuary and symbol but does not pressure tactics or supply resources that alter outcome. Spatial details (corridors, shelves) are not used for choreography. Setup, development, and closure presence are clear; causal pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>After remembering becomes painful is the inciting timeframe and establishes why she retreated to the bookstore. It recurs at closure: "when remembering was no longer painful." However, it is a completed threshold rather than a live clock. The "seven nights... eighth night" sequence provides structure, but no urgency or deadline tightens her decision—she could wait longer without consequence. The timeframe sets context but does not constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>To understand the shape of home is stated early ("she had come here to understand the shape of home") and the question she speaks aloud—"I want to remember what home felt like"—directly expresses it. The keeper's closing line reprises it. However, the desire is articulated more than dramatized through conflicted choices. No on-page moment shows her torn between home-seeking and another want, or shows her paying a cost to pursue it mid-story. Setup and closure linkage are strong; friction and trade-off are weak.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Hidden thunder appears in the keeper's voice ("carrying the hidden thunder of impending change") and at the end ("the quiet certainty of thunder that has finally found its release"). The tone is lyric and elevated throughout, with moments of intensity at the climax (stone glowing, visions blooming). However, the tone remains relatively static—melancholy reflection dominates without modulation for urgency or conflict. The thunder metaphor recurs but the tonal charge does not escalate with pressure or sharply shift at closure. Setup and closure participation are clear; modulation under pressure is minimal.</comment>
