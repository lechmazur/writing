<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The conjurer's interior is established through metaphor-heavy reflection on ambiguous loss, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her final choice to leave the glass eyes feels more like acceptance of a poetic idea than a decision with visible cost that forecloses a live path. The motivation remains abstract—"mathematics of emotion"—without embodied stakes that alter tactics under pressure. Interiority leans toward philosophical summary rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates motifs (glass eyes, mosaic, dovetailing) toward a final image of acceptance, meeting the RR (Earned Stasis) threshold. However, cost remains oblique: what live option does leaving the eyes foreclose? The protagonist walks away "feeling for the first time in three seasons" a shift, but the before/after distinction in stakes or capability is asserted more than dramatized. Orientation is clear early. One tightening occurs when she presses the eyes to her own and sees differently, but the escalation is more conceptual than pressure-driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is vividly rendered with sensory particulars (phosphorescent glow, dripping stalactites, chipped mosaic). The mosaic stepping stones constrain her ritual method and charge the closure image when she places the eyes at the exact dovetail point. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting does more than backdrop—it supplies the pattern-finding framework central to her practice—but the stalactites' dripping functions mostly as atmospheric recurrence rather than altering a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding/resolving ambiguous loss—is signaled early but remains abstract. No clear options narrow on the page: she arrives intending to "solve" her loss and leaves having "dovetailed with it," yet what she renounces or gains in capability is unclear. The glass-eyes moment offers a perceptual shift but not a trade-off with legible cost. One deepening occurs (blur-to-question via the eyes), but pressure does not tighten through protagonist agency so much as through lyric meditation. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a cadence shift or density increase that reweights the stake with cost; here the final paragraph asserts the shift rather than demonstrating it through a visible forfeiture or choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—grief's geometry, the limits of understanding, pattern-finding as coping—emerges organically from the mosaic imagery and the conjurer's method. The final image of leaving the eyes as an offering while retaining "buried, stubborn, gently inventive hope" resonates without overt moralizing. Subtext operates through the dovetailing metaphor and the glass eyes' origin story. However, the closing lines veer toward explicating the theme ("understanding might not be the point at all") rather than letting the image carry it, and the phrase "mathematics of emotion" risks abstraction. Still, the particulars (chipped tiles, taxidermist's glass eyes) ground the meditation enough to avoid pure thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV third-limited is stable and controlled. Diction is elevated and internally consistent, though at peak moments (pressing the eyes, the final walk) the register risks uniformity—long, clause-heavy sentences without the compression or fragmentation stress might cause. The perceptual signature is present: she notices patterns, fractures, dovetailing. However, the voice does not modulate meaningfully with emotional intensity; the rhythm remains lyric-meditative throughout. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Psychic distance is consistent but does not shift to heighten the closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often elegant (stalactites as downward forest, loss as "a stone that had learned to breathe"), but the final third stacks metaphors and abstract phrases without clear propulsion: "dovetailed with it," "fit into the mosaic of her being," "grief might…find its pattern too," "something like peace." These restate the same acceptance idea across adjacent lines, creating a paraphrase loop. The closing sentence runs 80+ words with nested clauses that dilute momentum at the closure beat. Sentence openings vary, but information density drops in the final paragraph. No severe artifacts, but the overwriting and loop in the closure passage pull the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of ambiguous loss, pattern-finding via mosaic, and taxidermist's glass eyes is specific and non-generic. The premise—using objects to understand unmappable emotion—offers a fresh angle. However, the emotional arc (acceptance of mystery) is familiar, and the closure image (leaving an offering, walking away with new understanding) does not transform expectation in hindsight. The world details (cavern orchard, phosphorescent walls) are particular but not used to generate a non-obvious turn. Risk-taking is moderate: lyric structure and reflective mode are executed competently but safely. Transformation test: the plot could transplant to a different setting with minor edits and retain the same emotional arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The secretive conjurer is present throughout and her decision to leave the glass eyes at the mosaic center constitutes the closure action. She is introduced immediately, her secrecy implied by solitary practice and the private orchard. Her choice to leave the eyes is signaled as an offering and acceptance, altering her stance from solving to sitting-with. However, the decision feels more like thematic punctuation than a turn that narrows live options with visible cost. She will return for the eyes in the morning, softening the renunciation. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure action—two gates solid, third (middle choice) weaker. The trait "secretive" is not leveraged on the page to constrain or enable a specific action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The glass eye pair is introduced early (first paragraph), handled in a distinct beat when she presses them to her eyes (middle), and left at the mosaic in the closure action. The eyes' backstory (belonged to a man studying animal death) seeds their thematic charge. Their use transforms her perception briefly. However, their function is more symbolic than mechanically specific—what she sees (stalactites as forest, fruit as question) does not alter her tactics or reveal actionable knowledge. The reprise at closure reweights them as an offering, but the cost tied to leaving them is undercut by her plan to retrieve them in the morning. Three beats, but causal pressure and irreplaceability are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ambiguous loss is named explicitly in the second paragraph and frames the dominant stake throughout. It shapes her motivation (to understand it) and her method (pattern-finding). The concept drives her to the orchard and governs her final acceptance that "some equations required not solving but sitting with." The closure turn—from solving to dovetailing—directly addresses the ambiguous loss. However, the loss itself remains abstract (what exactly did she lose?) and its effect on her magic or capabilities is vague. The concept is thematically central and shapes the ending stance, but on-page tactics do not visibly change in response to it. Strong thematic integration, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Gently inventive" appears twice: once as description of her method ("the way water finds its path through stone, gently inventive in its persistence") and once in the final paragraph ("the buried, stubborn, gently inventive hope"). The trait is asserted rather than demonstrated through a specific on-page action with cost. Her method (using glass eyes, reading mosaic patterns) could be called inventive, but no single choice turns on the gentle or inventive quality in a way that forecloses an alternate approach. The attribute colors tone and aligns with her character, but does not constrain or enable a beat with visible trade-off. Present in setup and closure echo, but label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Dovetail" is the story's central verb and metaphor. She observes the mosaic tiles dovetailing, places the eyes where two patterns dovetail perfectly, and concludes she has "dovetailed with" her loss rather than solved it. The action is signaled early (chipped patterns that dovetail), enacted at closure (placing the eyes), and thematically reprised in her realization. However, the physical act of dovetailing (fitting two pieces together) does not mechanically drive a turn—she could have placed the eyes anywhere as an offering. The metaphorical dovetailing redefines her stance, meeting the lyric-resonance threshold for mid-6s, but the action itself is more symbolic than causally irreplaceable. Strong early-final reprise, moderate causal force.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The chipped mosaic stepping stone is introduced in the first sentence and described in detail in the third paragraph ("the chips and fractures in each tile creating a larger picture that only revealed itself from this particular angle"). She kneels at the center where the stones dovetail and places the eyes at that exact point in the closure. The mosaic is her method's physical anchor and the site of the closure action. However, the mechanics of how the mosaic reveals pattern or enables understanding are asserted, not demonstrated—she looks at it, but we do not see what she learns or how it changes her options. Present in setup, middle description, and closure site, but the "via" (how it works) remains vague. Mid-band: essential as location and symbol, but its method is under-dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is anchored immediately and detailed throughout: phosphorescent walls, dripping stalactites, gnarled roots, fruiting trees, mosaic stepping stones. The setting is not generic—it is a subterranean orchard nourished by mineral drip, a micro-setting with specific resources (the mosaic, the stillness, the dark earth). The stalactites provide "patient nourishment" and recur as "indifferent and constant" at closure, underscoring her acceptance of process over solution. The mosaic stones constrain her ritual positioning. The setting charges the final image and supplies the framework for her method. Strong specificity, clear pressure on choice (where to kneel, what to offer), and closure participation. The cavern's silence and lack of moonlight reinforce the tone of inward turning.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the moonlight had drained" and "after the orchard grows silent beneath the moon" is signaled in the opening and reinforced midway ("the moon had set entirely now"). The time of night (post-moonset darkness) contributes to atmosphere and the conjurer's solitude. However, time does not tighten decisions—no clock pressures her, and the sequence is a single undifferentiated visit rather than a time-constrained window. She knows she will return in the morning, which undercuts urgency. The timeframe is present and coherent but does not alter tactics or escalate stakes. Functional, but replaceable with another quiet hour.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the mathematics of emotion" is stated explicitly in the fifth paragraph and frames her use of the glass eyes and mosaic as instruments. It drives her to the orchard and governs her method (pattern-finding, mapping variables). The closure turn—accepting that "understanding might not be the point at all"—directly addresses and reweights this motivation. However, the desire is told more than dramatized: we do not see her struggle with competing wants or the cost of pursuing this understanding. No friction between the motivation and another goal; no visible sacrifice made in its service. The motivation is central to theme and closure participation, but lacks on-page conflict or embodied cost. Mid-6s for thematic centrality without dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Buried optimism is signaled in the fifth paragraph ("buried optimism that surprised even herself") and echoed in the final paragraph ("buried, stubborn, gently inventive hope"). The tone coheres: despite loss, the conjurer persists in seeking pattern and retains hope that grief has geometry. The optimism is not overt—she accepts mystery rather than solving it—but remains present as a undertone. The tone modulates subtly from determined (pressing the eyes) to accepting (leaving them, walking away), charging the final image with quiet resolve. However, the tonal shift is asserted in summary ("feeling for the first time in three seasons") rather than embodied through rhythm or diction change. The optimism shapes the ending's emotional color but does not force a tactical choice. Strong thematic coherence, moderate dramatic charge.</comment>
