<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are coherent—tracing her father through chemistry, inheriting his work—but internal contradiction is minimal; she moves from grief to resolve without visible struggle between competing impulses. The "dappled resolve" phrase at closure attempts to signal ambiguity, but on-page micro-choices never dramatize a hard trade-off or foreclosed path with felt cost. Interiority leans abstract ("love could be encoded in the smallest physical decisions") rather than embodied perception under stress. The final choice to continue his work feels inevitable rather than earned through a visible wrestle between preservation and control.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara arrives, samples adhesive, realizes her father's message, commits to his work. Orientation anchors (amphitheater, volcano, surveyor's chain) appear early. However, the closure—rising with "dappled resolve" to continue engineering—lacks a decisive on-page cost or visible foreclosure; she simply inherits the mission without dramatized renunciation or trade-off. The final image reweights prior material thematically but does not crystallize a before/after with undeniable pressure or felt price. Causality is present but the RR/CR effect at closure is asserted more than charged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The amphitheater's volcanic setting is vivid and purposeful: geothermal heartbeat, trembling stones, thermal currents shifting. The surveyor's chain returns in the penultimate paragraph as a concrete anchor for her future work, constraining her next steps. Sensory detail is selective and integrated (breath cycles, heat exhale, stone shudder), filtered through an engineer's lens. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The environment charges the final image—dormancy negotiating with pressure—but does not constrain a pivotal choice on the page; it supports rather than forces the decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding her father's disappearance and continuing his work—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when she decodes the adhesive and realizes he vanished to protect her, narrowing her understanding. However, the final commitment to "continue" lacks on-page agency with visible cost; no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The volcano's trembling offers external pressure but does not force a choice between competing goods or require renunciation. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening is more thematic reconfiguration than escalation that alters tactics or options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of harmonizing conflicting values—preservation vs. control, individual vs. collective—is woven through floodgate engineering and the amphitheater's design. "Encrypted compassion" emerges from the adhesive analysis and shapes her understanding of absence as love. The final image of measured harmony through the surveyor's chain offers resonance without overt moralizing. However, the thematic question is more illustrated than tested; Elara does not grapple with a dilemma that forces her to harmonize incompatible goods on the page. The ending asserts continuity ("harmony found its enduring form") rather than reweighting the premise through a non-literal, charged image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Single-POV control is clean; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and technical ("geothermal heartbeat," "molecular traces," "thermal convection") but consistent with an engineer's perspective. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("slyly heartfelt in their mundane specificity," "dappled resolve") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present—she reads decay patterns, chemical signatures—but the rhythmic control flattens under emotional pressure rather than tightening. The final paragraph's syntax ("measured out link by measured link") is purposeful but the voice does not modulate with urgency; it maintains a steady, reflective cadence throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: "monument to some long-dead engineer's ambition to build harmony between human settlement and geological volatility" and "slyly heartfelt in their mundane specificity" load figurative language without teaching a pattern. Mixed metaphors: "dappled resolve" suggests light through clouds, not emotional texture. Template cadence runs in paragraph four ("He had mixed… encoding… ensuring…"). The final paragraph recycles "harmony" and "channels" without added pressure, creating a paraphrase loop. Applying the Overwriting and Patterned-artifact penalties: density (−0.5), coherence drift (−0.4), template cadence (−0.5), paraphrase loop (−0.3), totaling approximately −1.7 in Q7, with artifacts touching the closure beat. This disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—decoding a father's message through adhesive chemistry—offers a fresh angle. The amphitheater-in-volcano setting is specific and grounded. However, the emotional arc (grief → understanding → resolve to continue) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "encrypted compassion" concept is illustrated rather than tested in a way that feels inevitable in hindsight. The final image of inherited work and harmony does not subvert or deepen the initial framing; it confirms it. Applying the Derivative Premise Guardrail for the template emotional journey without transformation: −0.8 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout, observes the amphitheater, samples adhesive, and decides to continue her father's work. However, her "ingenious" trait is told (portable spectroscope, calculating decay) rather than demonstrated through a pivotal on-page choice that only her specific skill enables. The final commitment to design new floodgates is a plan, not a dramatized turn. Two gates met (setup, closure presence); middle development (adhesive analysis) is passive observation. Swappable with "determined engineer" with minor edits. Baseline 3.0 + early signal +0.4 + closure presence (plan, not action) +0.3 + beat involvement (observation) +0.4 − swappability −0.5 − told-only ingenuity −0.4 = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The surveyor's chain appears in paragraph one ("coiled in her palm—her father's most prized possession") and returns in paragraph five ("The antique surveyor's chain would measure new channels"). Two touches, both static description; never used on the page to measure, constrain a choice, or alter tactics. The reprise in the final image ("measured out link by measured link") reweights its symbolic charge but does not demonstrate irreplaceability—any inherited tool could serve. Baseline 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + two beats +0.9 + closure linkage (symbolic, not causal) +0.5 + lyric reprise +0.6 − ornamental use −0.7 − swappability −0.5 − static description −0.5 = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Encrypted compassion" is named in paragraph four ("He had mixed his own signature into the adhesive, encoding compassion") and echoed in the final paragraph ("encrypted in adhesive chemistry, preserved through absence, decoded through love"). It shapes her understanding but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page; the stakes (continue his work) exist independently of the encryption concept. Two gates met (middle development as theme, closure echo); setup absent. Baseline 3.0 + middle theme presence +0.3 + closure echo +0.4 + beat involvement (theme claim) +0.4 − late first appearance (second third) −0.3 − ornamental (no choice constraint) −0.7 − label-only −0.3 = 4.6, capped at 4.6 for missing setup.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Slyly heartfelt" appears once in paragraph four ("each one chosen with deliberate tenderness, slyly heartfelt in their mundane specificity") as a label for the adhesive compounds' selection. It does not constrain an action, enable a tactic, or incur a cost; it is pure description of her interpretation. One gate met (middle, as theme claim); setup and closure absent. Baseline 3.0 + middle theme claim +0.2 − late (second third) −0.3 − label-only −0.3 − ornamental −0.6 − missing setup and closure gates would cap lower, but single-beat presence at 3.1 reflects minimal integration, capped at 3.4 for missing middle development as action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Tremble" appears twice: paragraph five ("felt the building tremble around her as thermal currents shifted") and paragraph six ("stones settling into their eternal negotiation"). The action provides atmospheric pressure and cues urgency but does not redefine options; Elara's choice to rise and continue is not causally dependent on the trembling—she could decide the same in a stable structure. Two gates met (middle external pressure, closure atmosphere); setup as environmental constant. Baseline 3.0 + early/setup (geothermal constant) +0.4 + two beats +0.9 + causal complication (not resolution) +0.6 + closure atmosphere +0.5 − swappable (any geological reminder) −0.6 − does not alter her decision −0.4 = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Analyzing adhesive is signaled in paragraph two ("she would analyze the leftover adhesive") and executed in paragraph four ("she analyzed the adhesive's chemical signature through her portable spectroscope"). The method produces the revelation (father's encoded message) but the mechanics are summary ("patterns emerged that no standard document could contain"); we do not see her interpret compounds, compare references, or rule out alternatives. Two gates met (setup, middle use); closure references decoding but not the method itself. Baseline 3.0 + early signal +0.6 + two beats +0.9 + causal (enables revelation) +0.8 − summary-only mechanics −0.6 − closure absence (theme echo, not method) −0.4 − swappable (any chemical test) −0.5 = 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The amphitheater-in-volcano setting is established in paragraph one and sustained throughout with vivid detail (thermal currents, stone breathing, trembling). It provides atmospheric pressure and thematic resonance (harmony between human settlement and geological volatility mirrors her father's floodgate philosophy). However, it does not supply a resource or constraint that alters Elara's tactics or decision; she could perform the same analysis and reach the same resolve in any remote, thematically apt location. Three gates met. Baseline 3.0 + early signal +0.7 + three beats (sustained presence) +1.4 + closure atmosphere (not causal) +0.6 + specificity (unique combo) +0.5 − postcard pressure (vivid but not tactical) −0.8 − swappable thematic frame −0.5 = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"As the building breathes" appears in the title framing and paragraphs three ("the building breathing in cycles"), five ("stones shuddered more noticeably now"), and six ("as the amphitheater exhaled"). The breathing rhythm tracks geological time (centuries, magma convection) rather than a live decision clock that tightens Elara's window. Time pressure is vague; we do not know if she has minutes or hours, and the breathing does not force her to act faster or choose differently. Two gates met (setup, sustained presence); closure reprise is atmospheric, not tactical. Baseline 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + three beats +1.4 + thematic coherence +0.4 − vague clock (no tightening) −0.9 − does not alter tactics −0.6 = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Harmonize conflicting values" is named in paragraph three ("harmonizing… preservation against control, freedom against safety") and echoed in the final paragraph ("the conflicting values her father had harmonized would flow through her hands"). It frames her understanding of floodgate work and her inheritance, but Elara never faces an on-page choice between competing goods—she does not weigh preservation vs. control or freedom vs. safety in her own decision to continue. Two gates met (middle theme, closure echo); setup as backstory. Baseline 3.0 + early theme seed +0.5 + two beats (theme claims) +0.9 + closure linkage (thematic, not choice friction) +0.5 + thematic coherence +0.4 − told-only (no dramatized friction) −0.8 − no on-page trade-off −0.6 = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears once in paragraph six ("Dappled resolve filled her—not complete certainty, but fragmented light through clouds of grief"). The tone aims for ambiguity but the prose maintains a steady, elevated register throughout; no modulation under pressure. The metaphor (light through clouds) is introduced only at closure without prior tonal anchoring of "dappled" texture. One gate met (closure only); setup and middle development absent. Baseline 3.0 + closure charge attempt +0.7 + specificity (light/clouds image) +0.4 + thematic fit (ambiguity) +0.3 − late first appearance (final third) −0.8 − static mood prior (no modulation) −0.6 − label-only (not enacted in rhythm) −0.4 − missing setup/middle caps at 3.4, but closure presence and image lift to 5.1 under lyric-resonance allowance, capped at 2.8 for missing closure *participation* as tonal shift vs. mere assertion.</comment>
