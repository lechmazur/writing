<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and particular (nerve regeneration tingling, silent choir background), and the final realization about safety as "quiet accomplice" grows from the bolt discovery. However, the emotional arc relies heavily on abstract philosophical reflection rather than embodied contradiction in action. The peak insight—"unpardonable silence was not what he had failed to say but what he had chosen to believe"—reads as arrived-at wisdom rather than a choice forced by immediate pressure, limiting the felt cost of his stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (Accumulative texture building to a Conceptual Repricing at closure) and lands a clear before/after: Marcus moves from paralysis to recognition that safety itself was complicit. Orientation anchors (bellhop, fortress, winter, nerve regeneration) arrive within the first 120 words. The bolt discovery and bronze trail provide a meaningful tightening that narrows his interpretive frame, and the final image reweights "unpardonable silence" with conceptual cost—though the cost remains more intellectual than visceral, preventing higher scores.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, snow, spiral staircase, and nerve-regeneration physicality create a coherent micro-setting. The bolt's weight "against his thigh" and the bronze dust trail constrain Marcus's choices: he pockets the bolt and follows the trail rather than reporting it, a micro-decision that charges the ending. The sensory hierarchy (tingling nerves amplify the bolt's "clink") filters detail through POV priorities. The fortress "settling into its winter sleep" provides atmospheric closure without forcing symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety versus movement—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus finds the bolt and must choose whether to report or follow. The discovery narrows options (remain/flee, see/look away) and his choice to pocket the bolt and continue upward constitutes agency with on-page cost: he forecloses the path of protocol and re-engages with risk. However, the escalation is more contemplative than pressured; no external antagonist or urgent consequence sharpens the trade-off, keeping the felt price moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the bolt, bronze trail, and nerve regeneration rather than assertion. The final image—snow as "small white notes in the world's most patient symphony"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The insight that "safety was not the opposite of danger but its quiet accomplice" reweights prior material (brother's silence, his own choice of the bellhop role). Minor slip: "seraphically mundane" and "frostbitten hope" feel slightly over-articulated as thematic labels, edging toward the clarity line without crossing it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable; Marcus's perceptual signature (nerve-sensitized hearing, choir-trained silence) is consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains plausibility for a bellhop mid-shift: "the seraphically mundane nature of the discovery," "evidence that someone else had passed this way," and "unpardonable silence was not what he had failed to say but what he had chosen to believe" read as authorial rather than character-bound thought. The prose modulates well under emotional pressure, but the lexical reach prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively; sensory detail is vivid ("green with oxidation yet somehow bright"). However, multiple sentences loop or restate without added pressure: "he did not know if he believed that, but he believed in the bolt's weight" restates the prior clause's idea. Template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph: "had remained when he could have fled, had seen when he could have looked away" is purposeful parallelism, but earlier scaffold—"not a vision. Not a miracle. Just evidence"—feels rhythmically mechanical. Figurative density in the final paragraph (snow as notes, fortress settling, heart thawing) clusters without clear pattern-teaching, per the overwriting check (−0.4 to −0.6 range).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of nerve regeneration with emotional thawing, silent choir background, and the bolt as movement-trace is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms a familiar "redemption through small choice" template by grounding it in physiological and spatial particulars (spiral stair, bronze dust, regeneration tingling). However, the emotional arc—guilt, paralysis, tentative re-engagement—follows a well-trodden path, and the final insight about safety's complicity, while earned, does not surprise in hindsight. Risk-taking remains modest; the piece executes competently within its chosen register rather than challenging it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus (silent-choir bellhop) is present throughout and his observation of the bolt leads to the choice to pocket it and continue upward rather than report it—a decision that alters his stance at closure. Setup is immediate, middle development occurs when he "remained on the step" and traced the discoloration (a micro-choice under pressure), and payoff shapes the ending realization. However, the choices are largely internal and contemplative; no second on-page character forces a harder trade-off, limiting causal intensity. The element constrains one key turn (remain vs. report) and participates in closure, reaching the 5–6.9 band, but swappability (any guilt-ridden service worker could function similarly) and modest beat count prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The piano bench bolt appears early (setup), is handled in two distinct beats (picking it up, pocketing it), and its "weight against his thigh" persists to the ending, charging the final image of movement over stillness. The bolt's physical properties (green oxidation, small weight) matter: Marcus's regeneration-sensitized nerves amplify the "clink," and the bolt becomes evidence of someone else's passage. However, the bolt does not directly enable or block a tactic; it functions primarily as symbolic catalyst rather than mechanical necessity. Closure linkage is present but not causal—removing the bolt would weaken resonance but not break plot logic, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Unpardonable silence" is introduced early (setup) as the sound Marcus did not make when his brother needed warning, revisited in the middle ("particular climate of a heart that had frozen"), and reweighted at closure: "the unpardonable silence was not what he had failed to say but what he had chosen to believe." This Conceptual Repricing shifts the stake from past guilt to present interpretive stance, and the concept constrains his choice to remain silent as a bellhop. However, the concept operates more as thematic container than on-page pressure; no moment forces Marcus to speak or stay silent under immediate consequence, limiting felt cost. The element satisfies all three gates and reweights meaning at closure, reaching mid-5s, but lacks the causal bite for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Seraphically mundane" appears once in the middle third as a descriptor of the bolt discovery: "the most angelic thing he could encounter was a tiny metal bolt and a faint trail of color." The phrase characterizes tone and thematic register but does not constrain or enable an action with visible cost. It functions as atmospheric label rather than attribute that shapes tactics. Late arrival (past the 40% mark by word count) and ornamental use cap the score at 4.6; label-only mention without on-page pressure or cost further lowers it within that ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Remain" is signaled early ("he had remained when he could have fled"), shapes the middle choice (Marcus "remained on the step" instead of reporting the bolt), and anchors the closure realization that remaining is itself a form of movement. The action is irreplaceable: substituting "stay" or "linger" would preserve function, but "remain" carries specific connotations of endurance and witness that charge the thematic payoff. The element drives two beats (the stair decision and the final understanding) and appears in the ending's penultimate sentence, satisfying setup, development, and closure participation. Causal pressure is moderate—remaining is a stance choice rather than a high-cost forfeiture—preventing entry to the 8.5+ band, but the element is essential across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"The slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase" (bronze dust trail) is introduced early alongside the bolt, shapes Marcus's middle choice to follow rather than report, and persists implicitly to closure as evidence of movement. The method's mechanics matter: the dust comes from brass/copper carried repeatedly, teaching Marcus that "someone else had passed this way...had chosen movement over safety's stillness." Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is indirect but present (the trail primes the final movement-over-safety realization). However, the method is not irreplaceable—any small trace (footprints, scent, sound) could function similarly—and it does not block or enable a tactic under pressure, capping causal intensity and preventing scores above 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress under snow is established immediately and pressures Marcus through isolation, cold, and the spatial constraint of the spiral staircase (a confined vertical path that forces the remain/ascend choice). The snow's "high-contrast relief" makes the bolt visible, and the fortress "settling into its winter sleep" charges the final image. Setup, development (the stair as locus of choice), and closure participation are all present. However, the fortress functions more as atmospheric container than active obstacle; substituting another remote, cold location would preserve most narrative function. The micro-setting (staircase) does constrain the bolt discovery and ascent choice, lifting the score into the 6.0–6.9 band, but broader swappability prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"During nerve regeneration" is signaled early (tingling, "months" of recovery ahead) and colors Marcus's perception throughout (the bolt's clink "felt like a shout" to sensitized nerves). The timeframe shapes his choice of a voiceless job and the metaphor of "rebuilding...cell by cell" mirrors his emotional arc. Setup and thematic development are strong, but the regeneration does not tighten a decision or impose a live clock that alters tactics under pressure. The element enriches atmosphere and metaphor without constraining a beat's outcome; swapping it for another recovery process (physical therapy, grief timeline) would preserve arc and closure. Lyric resonance (early seed, final payoff in "frostbitten hope" callback) reaches the 5.5–6.3 allowance, but lack of middle causal pressure caps the score near 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To understand the cost of safety" is introduced early ("he had chosen this position precisely because it demanded nothing") and drives the bolt-discovery choice: Marcus remains to trace the bronze trail rather than retreating to protocol's safety. The motivation is reweighted at closure: "safety was not the opposite of danger but its quiet accomplice." Setup, development (the stair decision), and closure participation are all present. However, the desire is more contemplative than conflicted in action; no on-page friction forces Marcus to choose between safety and danger with immediate consequence. The element shapes one key turn and charges the ending, satisfying the 5.0–6.9 band, but the lack of a high-pressure trade-off and moderate irreplaceability (any guilt-driven insight motive could function) prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Frostbitten hope" is introduced late (final third: "the doctors had called it during his recovery") but retrospectively anchors earlier imagery (frozen fortress, nerve regeneration, "heart that had frozen and was only now beginning to thaw"). The tone modulates coherently: cold stillness in the opening, tentative warmth at closure ("tissue that survived the cold could grow stronger"). The final image—snow as patient symphony—charges the tone with quiet optimism. However, late first appearance and primarily atmospheric function (the tone describes rather than constrains) limit causal pressure. The lyric reprise (cold/thaw/hope arc) reweights the dominant stake, reaching the 5.5–6.3 lyric allowance and slightly above due to strong closure linkage, but the element does not drive a beat's tactical choice, capping the score in the mid-6s.</comment>
