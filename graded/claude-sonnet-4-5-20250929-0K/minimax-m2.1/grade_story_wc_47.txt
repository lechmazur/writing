<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-specific, with embodied emotion in the moss-garden visits and the amber pendant handling. However, the mother remains abstract—her "confession" is summarized rather than dramatized, and the narrator's response ("not the cold kind, but the kind that holds space") edges into therapy-speak. The final stance ("simply stay") reads as renunciation, but the cost is asserted rather than shown through a foreclosed path or visible trade-off. Internal contradiction is present (betrayal/pride) but not pressured into a scene-level micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates reflective density through the moss-garden visits, the amber pendant, and the drip-pattern motif, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "simply stay"). Orientation is clear by ~100 words (data center, post-confession). Cost is felt but oblique—the narrator's isolation and the mother's trembling hands carry emotional weight, but no concrete option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The closure image reweights prior material without a decisive turn, which fits the lens but limits urgency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned data center is vividly rendered (moss on server racks, collapsed ceiling, thawing icicles) and charges the final image through the water/moss metaphor. The amber pendant is handled twice (received, worn) but does not constrain a choice. Micro-setting works: the moss and water function as recurring texture that supports the closure stance. No orientation debt. The setting shapes atmosphere but does not pressure a tactical decision, capping higher scores.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: learning to heal after the mother's public confession. The piece deepens rather than escalates—three visits to the data center and the morning phone call add reflective density but no reversal or tightening that narrows options. The narrator's decision to "simply stay" is a stance crystallization (fits the accumulative lens) but the cost is atmospheric rather than a visible forfeiture. No antagonist or complicating pressure beyond internal processing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (patient reclamation, quiet healing) emerges organically from the moss, drip patterns, and amber pendant without direct statement. The final image ("let the rest become what it will") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of healing. Subtext operates cleanly in the phone call and the phrase "protected vulnerability." One weakness: "graft new meaning onto old wounds" is prompt-language that edges into thematic echo, though it's cushioned by the surrounding metaphor work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and rhythmically controlled ("honeyed hush," "drip of thawing icicles"). POV is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Distance is consistent, though some lines ("protected vulnerability—this is what I offer her now") read as slightly elevated for the moment. Perceptual signature is strong (moss, water, light). The phone-call dialogue is brief but purposeful. Compression is taught and pays off at closure. Minor diction drift in reflective beats does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence openings, vivid sensory detail ("drip of thawing icicles"), and high information density. Two issues lower the score: paraphrase loops ("simply stay. Simply witness. Simply proffer") and template cadence in the final paragraph ("Simply X. Simply Y. Simply Z"). Stock metaphor ("stone in her chest") appears once. No loops that obscure causality, but the repetition in the closure beat dulls propulsion slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of public confession aftermath, abandoned data center, and nature reclamation is specific and non-obvious. The moss-as-healing metaphor is fresh in execution. However, the core premise (processing a family secret through solitary reflection in a symbolic space) is familiar, and the story does not transform it through risky choices or moral calculus. Emotional truth is present, but the stance ("simply stay") is safe rather than bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The mother (watchful dreamer) is mentioned but does not appear on the page in a choice-making capacity. The narrator describes her but the character herself does not create a key turn. The phone call is summarized, not dramatized. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The amber pendant appears in two beats (given, worn) and returns at the end ("amber warm against my heart"). It is handled and its origin (grandmother's) is noted, creating a multi-generational through-line. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Honeyed hush" frames the opening and closing, establishing tone and setting. It shapes the atmosphere and the narrator's perceptual filter (quiet, patient, non-urgent). Present in the opening line and closing third, it charges the final image. Does not constrain a choice, but the concept is indispensable to the piece's textural accumulation and closure effect.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Quietly proactive" is mentioned twice (opening, middle) as a descriptor but does not visibly constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The narrator's stance is reflective rather than proactive in the tactical sense. Label-only use without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Proffer" appears twice: "proffered nothing in return but silence" and "proffer your presence." Both are passive gestures rather than major turns. The final instance is thematically resonant but does not redefine options. Swappable with "offer" or "give" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The drip pattern of thawing icicles appears mid-story and is tied to the narrator's reflection on how "water remakes the world." It charges the theme and recurs in the final paragraph ("The ice continues to melt. The water continues its patient work"). Present in two beats and shapes the thematic closure, but does not alter a tactical choice. Lyric reprise with clear cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned data center is signaled early ("three days after the video broke"), revisited across three visits, and directly shapes the closure image (narrator sitting in the moss garden). It provides the recurring sensory texture (moss, water, collapsed ceiling) that anchors the healing metaphor. Setting is indispensable to the piece's logic and closure effect. Does not pressure a tactical choice, but its role is structural.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Seventeen days since the confession went viral" anchors the timeframe. The phone call "this morning" and "three days after the video broke" create a sequence. Time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—the narrator's visits are habitual, not urgent. Present and tracked but passive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To graft new meaning onto old wounds" is stated explicitly in the middle and enacted through the moss metaphor and the narrator's reflective process. It drives the piece's dominant stake and is resolved in the final stance ("let the rest become what it will"). Present across beats and essential to closure, though stated rather than fully dramatized through conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is named once mid-story and enacted throughout: the narrator's silence with the mother, the phone call, and the final stance. Tone is coherent and modulates with the reflective beats. The phrase charges the closure image and fits the narrator's perceptual filter. Indispensable to the piece's emotional logic and thematic resonance.</comment>
