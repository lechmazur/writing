<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The archivist's interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical statements rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "preemptively nostalgic" trait is asserted through exposition ("This was not weakness but method") but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost. Her actions—moving among monuments, examining shadows, writing—trace a meditative observation loop without genuine internal conflict or a decision that forecloses a path. The final shift ("her own identity shifting, becoming less a thing she carried") reads as conceptual summary rather than earned change rooted in prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the archivist walks the forecourt, observes monuments, and reflects on collective memory in a single continuous meditation. No causal reversal or tightening narrows options; the storm intensifies and quiets without altering her stance or knowledge. The ending offers a Conceptual Repricing—"not their names, but their love; not their achievements, but their presence"—that reweights the premise, but the cost remains implied rather than concretely legible on the page, and no prior constraint shaped her tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt, fog-made-solid, and stormlit observatory are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (droplets tracing channels, lightning pulsing across crystal). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The environment subtly charges the archivist's reflection ("being above the clouds...clarified the nature of her work"), and the storm's rhythm modulates the scene's cadence. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it functions as atmospheric crucible rather than tactical pressure, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—witnessing and recording collective memory—is signaled early but remains abstract and unchallenged. The archivist moves through her ritual without encountering opposition, time pressure, or a dilemma that forces a tradeoff. The storm intensifies and quiets, but this external shift does not tighten her options or compel a decision with visible cost. One monument "spoke of grief remembered accurately," but this observation does not escalate into a reversal or deepening that narrows tactics. Agency is limited to continued observation and writing; no renunciation or endurance forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—identity as continuous creation from collective memory—emerges organically from the archivist's observations and the monument imagery. The final lines ("not their names, but their love; not their achievements, but their presence") offer a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moralizing. However, the thematic material is carried almost entirely through reflection and assertion ("the self was not a fixed object...but a continuous act of creation") rather than dramatized particulars that test the premise under pressure. The piece resists banality but does not charge the theme with an on-page cost tied to character choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct elevated register ("threshold time after fog becomes solid," "preemptively nostalgic") consistent with the archivist's contemplative role. Perceptual signature is present in the focus on shadows, resonance, and memory-as-architecture. However, the narrative voice converges with the character's philosophical interiority to the point of indistinguishability; peak moments default to abstract meditation rather than embodied perception under stress. The diction occasionally drifts into thesis-like phrasing ("collective memory was precisely this, a solid ground") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no mechanical template runs. Information density is high in descriptive passages ("crystal whispering forecourt," "fog becomes solid"). However, the piece suffers from conceptual paraphrase loops: "collective memory of a people," "collective memory was precisely this," "collective witness" cycle through adjacent paragraphs without adding pressure. Several lines restate the same thesis in different metaphors (fog/solid ground, monument/memory, sculptor/creation) without propulsion. The final paragraph contains a minor filter-verb stack ("felt her own identity shifting, becoming less a thing she carried") that dulls immediacy at closure. Apply −0.6 for loops and −0.3 for closure-beat filter density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—an archivist reading collective memory through monument shadows above the clouds—offers surface novelty, but the execution follows a familiar contemplative-observer template without transformation. The archivist's epiphany ("the self was not a fixed object") and the closing wisdom ("not their names, but their love") feel derivative of genre conventions for lyric meditation on memory and identity. No bold structural risk or non-obvious synthesis; the piece could function unchanged with a historian, curator, or monk in place of the "summer-quill archivist." The storm and fog-made-solid are evocative but ornamental; they do not impose a unique constraint that alters the arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The summer-quill archivist is present throughout and performs her observational role, but her choices do not create key turns. She moves among monuments, examines shadows, and records—actions that advance understanding but do not narrow options or impose cost. The closing decision to write is uncontested ritual rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Setup and development are present; payoff is present but passive. Functional but replaceable; another observer role would serve the same arc with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt after rain is established in the opening beat (droplets tracing channels, voices captured in stone) and reprised in the penultimate paragraph ("The crystals continued their soft whispering"). Setup and payoff are clear; however, middle development is thin—the forecourt supplies atmosphere but does not constrain a choice or shift meaning between mentions. The reprise adds texture but does not reweight the dominant stake with visible cost. Lyric resonance is present but the object remains more setting than active participant.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Collective memory is the thematic center and is repeatedly invoked ("collective memory of a people," "collective memory was precisely this," "collective witness"). It shapes the archivist's motivation and worldview. However, it functions as abstract concept rather than on-page pressure that changes options or tactics. The archivist never faces a choice where competing claims on memory force a tradeoff. Setup and thematic payoff are present; middle development that constrains action is absent. Label-only mentions and synonym churn (−0.3) lower the score within the functional band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Preemptively nostalgic" is introduced early with exposition ("This was not weakness but method") and repeated in reflective passages ("feeling loss for experiences she had not yet recorded"). The trait colors the archivist's lens but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. It remains a descriptive label rather than a force that shapes a decision or tightens a dilemma. Setup is present; development and payoff that impose tradeoffs are missing. Ornamental use and label-only treatment (−0.6 cumulative) cap the score below 4.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Conjecture is named as "her primary tool" and dramatized once when she examines a monument whose shadow "spoke of grief remembered accurately." This observation distinguishes one monument from others and signals her interpretive method. However, the act of conjecturing does not drive a turn or reshape tactics; it remains descriptive analysis without consequence. Setup and one middle beat are present; closure linkage is weak—the final act of writing follows from her role, not from a conjecture that redefined options. Functional but mid-replaceable; another interpretive method would serve with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Examining shadow lengths at monuments is established early ("examining shadow lengths at monuments as the lightning provided its intermittent illumination") and specified as revealing which monuments "remembered their dead with accuracy." The method is used in one middle beat when she stops before a monument "whose shadow fell at an unfamiliar angle." Setup and development are present; however, the shadow-reading does not drive the closure or impose a choice with cost. The archivist writes "what the shadows had told her," but this is recounted rather than dramatized. Functional but swappable; another observational technique would serve with edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds is established in the opening paragraph ("elevated plaza," "above the clouds") and developed across multiple beats: the storm intensifies, lightning illuminates the forecourt, and the storm quiets. The setting supplies vivid atmosphere and spatial grounding. It subtly charges the archivist's reflection ("being above the clouds...clarified the nature of her work") and modulates the scene's rhythm. However, it does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Setup, development, and thematic payoff are present; causal pressure on action is absent. Strong atmospheric integration earns the mid-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"After fog becomes solid" is introduced in the opening paragraph ("that strange threshold time after fog becomes solid") and reprised in the penultimate paragraph. The timeframe signals a liminal moment but does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline. The archivist's actions unfold at a meditative pace without urgency; the storm's rise and fall do not alter her timeline. Setup and closure echo are present; middle development that pressures tactics is missing. The timeframe supplies tone but does not function as a live constraint. Lyric consistency without causal work places it in the low-4 band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation to sculpt identity from experience is stated explicitly ("the self was not a fixed object...but a continuous act of creation") and thematically central. It explains the archivist's role and frames her observations. However, it is never dramatized in friction or choice; no competing desire or obstacle tests her commitment. She moves through her ritual without encountering a moment where this motivation forces a tradeoff or forecloses a path. Setup and thematic payoff are clear; middle conflict that dramatizes the desire under pressure is absent. Told motivation without on-page friction caps the score at mid-4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Deepening hush is signaled early ("the forecourt existed in that strange threshold time") and developed across the arc: the storm intensifies, then "began to quiet, its rage spent, and the hush deepened around her like a held breath." The tone is coherent and modulates with the storm's rhythm, charging the final image where the archivist writes as "the crystals continued their soft whispering." Setup, development, and payoff are all present. The tone does not merely describe but actively shapes the scene's emotional cadence and supports the reflective closure. Strong tonal integration without causal constraint on choice places it solidly in the mid-6 band.</comment>
