<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to comfort through silence is established and her micro-choices (extending route, uncorking vial, humming) are clear, but her interior remains somewhat external and competent without genuine struggle or contradiction. The boy functions as an object of care rather than a source of dynamic pressure; his nightmare state shifts too smoothly under Maren's intervention without resistance. The "fluidly logical" trait is label-only; we never see it constrain a choice or force a trade-off. Emotional progression is linear and the final move (humming at exact frequency) reads as skill demonstration rather than a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (operator, vessel, boy) arrive early. The piece accumulates images (storm glass, prism light, silence) toward a resonant final state, but the closure lacks felt cost—the boy's breathing steadies, the glass clears, and Maren smiles with satisfaction rather than forfeiting anything or facing a trade-off. The transformation happens *to* the boy via Maren's expertise, not through a protagonist choice that narrows options. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing (silence learns to comfort) but the conceptual cost is not legible; success arrives without price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prism terrace, storm glass vial, and acoustic properties create a vivid micro-setting. The glass constrains Maren's timing (she watches its color shift and adjusts trajectory), and the prism light is woven into the comfort beat. Sensory detail (scented vapor, light spectrums, train whistle echo) is filtered through Maren's professional attention. Spatial choreography is clear and the vial functions as both tool and symbolic anchor, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of constraining choice and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: soothe the boy's nightmare. Maren extends the route and deploys her skillset, but there is no reversal, trade-off, or meaningful tightening—each step succeeds as executed. The storm glass signals distress and then clears in direct response to her actions without resistance. No cost is visible; the boy will not remember, but this is framed as gift rather than loss. Pressure remains static rather than escalating under the Accumulative lens; density increases but does not force a harder choice or alter Maren's options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme (silence as comfort, teaching as transmission) emerges from Maren's action and the grandmother's teaching, not from overt statement. The final image—"silence had finally learned to comfort"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, the thematic question is never tested under pressure; Maren's work succeeds without friction, and the boy's unconscious state prevents genuine relational complexity. The ending reweights "silence" but lacks the ambiguity or counter-reading that would elevate it beyond a tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited on Maren. Diction is elevated and consistent ("silence is a room waiting for furniture," "hush vault upward") with a distinct perceptual signature (she listens to missing sounds, notes exact frequencies). Psychic distance is controlled and interior access remains character-bound. The prose reflects Maren's calm expertise without register drift. Some phrases approach over-ornamentation ("transformation made visible through motion") but remain voice-motivated and legible, and no head-hopping or elision issues appear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings are not template-driven. Information density is adequate but several lines paraphrase without advancing pressure: "the knowledge passed down through generations of operators who understood that silence could be instructed, that the absence of sound could be taught to embrace" loops conceptually. The phrase "fluidly logical" appears twice as scaffold without dramatization. Figurative language is dense in the opening and closing thirds (storm glass as "representation of silence," hush as cathedral) but does not muddle clarity. Minor loop penalty (−0.2) and one register-elevated phrase that slightly stalls momentum in the grandmother's exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of transit operator, storm glass, and acoustic emotional work offers a fresh micro-concept. The grandmother's teaching and the method of "furnishing silence" provide specific, non-generic angles. However, the core arc (caretaker soothes child through expertise without cost) is familiar and not transformed by bold risk; Maren's success is complete and the boy's passivity keeps the premise in safe territory. The prism terrace and sound refraction are vivid but remain setting rather than driving a turn. Emotional specificity is present but the resolution's tidiness limits ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren (gondola/vessel operator) is present throughout, makes three on-page choices (extend route, uncork vial, hum), and her professional lens filters all description. She appears early, shapes the middle beat, and her final smile closes the piece. However, her choices are sequential skill applications without trade-offs or visible cost; she could be swapped for any calm expert. The operator role is essential to the frame but her decisions do not create reversals or force sacrifice, capping the score in the mid-5s despite strong presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Storm glass vial appears in beat 1 (introduction with backstory), beat 2 (color shift from amber to violet signals boy's distress), and beat 3 (uncorking releases vapor, glass clarifies to blue as he calms). It is handled twice (hung at hip, uncorked) and its changing state directly tracks the boy's emotional weather, shaping Maren's timing and closure satisfaction. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (its specific properties—color, scent, electrostatic sensitivity—matter) all present. Cost connection is weak (no price paid for its use), preventing entry to 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"In transit" frames the entire premise (drifting platform between districts, passenger in passage) and shapes Maren's role and the boy's vulnerability. It constrains her tactic (extend route to gain time) and the ending ("drifted on, carrying its cargo of transformation"). Present early, developed in the middle extension, and in the final image. The concept is core to setting and stakes but does not force a harder choice or create friction; it enables rather than pressures. Specificity is strong; swapping to static setting would break the logic, earning mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Fluidly logical" appears twice: opening exposition ("her mind worked fluidly logical") and mid-story decision ("a fluidly logical decision"). Both are label-only; the text never dramatizes what fluid logic looks or feels like in action, nor does it constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. The trait could be removed without altering any beat. Functional mention without causal pressure caps the score at ornamental/low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Catalyze" appears in the phrase "mechanism for catalyzing silence into comfort" and frames Maren's work (uncorking vial, humming to transform lingering sound). The action is signaled early, executed in the middle beat, and the result (storm glass clears, boy calms) closes the piece. It defines her method and is irreplaceable to the premise. However, the catalysis succeeds without complication or cost, and the action could be described as "soothe" or "transform" with minor edits. Strong presence and closure linkage but modest causal pressure and swappability keep it in upper-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Monitoring noise levels" is mentioned once in exposition ("method of monitoring noise levels throughout the vessel") and dramatized when Maren "listened not to what sounds existed but to what sounds were missing" and notes "the exact frequency of his distress." It shapes her attention and informs her humming tactic. Setup and middle development present, but it does not appear in the ending and its mechanics remain abstract. Functional across two beats but absent from closure and somewhat replaceable with "listening" or "sensing," placing it in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace is the setting throughout: introduces acoustic properties, enables Maren's work, refracts light across the boy's face (a gift that aids her timing), and "drifted on" in the final image. It constrains the in-transit frame and supplies the "prism light" resource. Early signal, middle involvement (light spectrum beat), closure presence. Irreplaceable (ordinary vessel would lack the acoustic and optical properties). Cost is absent (no navigation hazard, no sacrifice tied to extending the route), preventing 8.5+ entry, but strong integration across all three gates and specificity earn upper-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"The quiet that follows a train whistle's echo" appears in exposition, frames the optimal moment for Maren's work, and recurs in the penultimate paragraph and final sentence. It provides atmospheric texture and a temporal anchor. However, it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; Maren extends the route "by several minutes" with no urgency or trade-off. Present in setup and closure but passive in the middle. The timeframe is lyric rather than causal, and swappable with "dusk" or "late afternoon calm." Reprise at closure earns mid-4s under the lyric-resonance allowance, but lack of pressure caps it there.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To teach silence how to comfort" is Maren's explicit motivation, introduced via grandmother's teaching and enacted through vial, humming, and silence architecture. It is present in setup (exposition), middle (catalyzing action), and closure (final sentence: "silence had finally learned to comfort"). Dramatized through micro-choices (extend route, hum at exact frequency) but never conflicted—Maren faces no friction, doubt, or cost in the teaching. All three gates met and irreplaceable to premise, but want-versus-obstacle tension is absent. Lyric reprise with clear causal role earns low-6s; lack of friction prevents higher band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Vaulting hush" appears once in the text ("feeling the hush vault upward around her like a cathedral ceiling") and the tone of quiet, expansive calm is coherent throughout. Diction (silence as room, hush as comfort, quiet that holds warmth) and rhythm (long, unhurried sentences) sustain the tone across turns. The final image ("silence had finally learned to comfort") charges the vaulting-hush metaphor with resolution. Tone modulates slightly (storm glass violet → blue, boy's distress → calm) in step with pressure. Present implicitly in setup, dramatized in middle, charged at closure. Strong coherence and closure linkage, but single explicit mention and static mood (no sharp tonal shift under pressure) cap it in upper-6s.</comment>
