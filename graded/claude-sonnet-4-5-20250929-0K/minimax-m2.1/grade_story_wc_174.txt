<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior life is vivid and his contradiction between colonial mapping instinct and ethical restraint reads credibly. The epiphany about "stories we refuse to complete" feels earned by the reverse-telling experiment. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophizing ("half-lit epiphanies," "territorial conquest") rather than embodied contradiction in scene. Mira exists only as summarized accusation; her absence weakens the relational crucible that would sharpen Elias's cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (Elias, radar dome, post-argument night). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: reverse-telling deepens understanding through cadence shift and the final planted stick offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis—he leaves the stick, refusing completion). Cost is conceptual and felt: he abandons his colonial completion instinct. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the closure effect is legible under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The radar dome's curved acoustics and axis-marked platform constrain the ritual's staging and charge the final image when the stick remains planted. Sensory detail is filtered through Elias's calligraphic precision ("white fiberglass skin weathered to the color of old bone"). The "meteor hush" atmosphere modulates from anticipation to recognition, supporting tonal coherence. Micro-setting (the circular impression, the hatch, the platform) guides choice and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ethical storytelling—signals early and tightens through the reverse-telling experiment, which narrows Elias's options by revealing his complicity. The argument with Mira off-stage weakens immediacy; her challenge arrives as summary rather than scene pressure. One meaningful deepening (the reversal experiment changes his understanding) suffices under the Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual: he relinquishes narrative conquest, leaving threads dangling. Agency is clear in his choice to plant the stick and walk away.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—ethical storytelling as refusal to complete—emerges from the reverse-telling action and the planted stick image without overt moralizing. The radar dome as "fallen celestial eye" and the story stick as "horizontal monument" resonate without shouting. The meteor's arrival mirrors internal combustion. The final image (stick planted, Elias departing) offers a non-literal answer to the thematic question. Minor slip: "ethical care" in the final sentence edges toward abstraction rather than letting the image do all the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and textured ("uncommonly serene patience," "half-lit epiphanies"), with a perceptual signature filtering the dome through Elias's craft. Distance remains stable in third-limited. However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak reflection ("territorial conquest," "colonial mapping") that feels authorial rather than character-bound for a calligrapher mid-crisis. The long participial-clause sentences create a hypotactic rhythm that occasionally stalls momentum. No dialogue present to evaluate, and Mira's off-stage voice is paraphrased rather than quoted.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. However, several beats loop conceptually: "half-lit epiphanies" appears twice with near-synonym phrasing; the ethical-storytelling thesis is restated in the penultimate and final paragraphs. Figurative density ("fallen celestial eye," "combustion," "horizontal monument") accumulates without full integration into action. The final paragraph's abstract summary ("the stories we refused to complete") recaps rather than trusting the image of the planted stick. Template cadence in the long participial openers appears across multiple paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The reverse-telling frame and the radar dome as ritual space offer fresh angles on the ethics-of-narrative premise. The specificity of the story stick and the architectural acoustics ground the concept. However, the core ethical question—what stories to tell—echoes familiar meta-narrative debates without a decisively non-obvious answer. The transformation feels more thematic than structural; removing the calligrapher trait and dome setting would leave the arc largely intact. The meteor arrival is atmospheric but not causally necessary.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias appears throughout and his choice to reverse-tell and then plant the stick drives the ending. However, the "urbane calligrapher" trait functions mostly as background color; his craft precision flavors perception but does not enable or constrain the key choice. Swapping in "urbane philosopher" would require minimal edits. Present in setup, development, and closure, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story stick is handled in two distinct beats (carried to the dome, planted at the end) and returns with reweighted meaning: from tool of telling to monument of refusal. It anchors the closure image and its vibration during the meteor streak offers a charged moment. The stick's physical properties (oak, fire-darkened, carved symbols) matter. It shapes the final action but does not constrain earlier choices, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Half-lit epiphanies" recurs as label in the opening and closing but functions primarily as thematic decoration rather than on-page stake. The reverse-telling experiment demonstrates the concept, yet the epiphanies remain abstract; they do not narrow options or create visible tradeoffs. The concept is told more often than it alters tactics. Introduced early but development and closure participation are weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene" appears in the opening and closing as description of Elias's patience. It colors his approach but does not enable or constrain a key choice with cost. The trait could be replaced with "deliberate" or "methodical" without structural change. Label-only; no visible tradeoff tied to this specific attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The act of reverse-telling structures the central sequence and produces the ethical insight that shapes the ending. It is specific and non-swappable. However, the reversal itself is recounted rather than fully dramatized; we are told "the words came slowly" and "he felt the half-lit epiphanies flickering brighter" without scene-level detail. Present in setup, development, and closure, with moderate causal pressure. The specificity and thematic link earn mid-upper band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>0.0</grade><comment>"Subversive puppet shows in seedy bars" does not appear or influence the story. Absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The radar dome's curved acoustics, central platform, axis impression, and service hatch guide Elias's ritual staging and constrain the spatial choreography. The setting's history (vigilant search now deemed unnecessary) mirrors Elias's abandonment of narrative surveillance. The dome holds his words and charges the final image when the stick remains planted at the axis. Present in setup, development, and closure with strong causal and symbolic integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "hush left behind by a heated argument" frames the opening and the "two hours prior" anchor establishes recency. The timeframe creates emotional urgency and Elias's decision to return to Mira "tomorrow" marks a boundary. However, no live clock pressures the ritual itself; the meteor's arrival is atmospheric rather than a deadline. Setup and closure participation present; middle development is light. One clear turn tied to time (argument aftermath shapes his readiness), so mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elias's desire "to explore ethical storytelling" is dramatized through the reverse-telling experiment and friction with Mira's accusation. The motivation shapes his choice to plant the stick and leave threads dangling. However, the exploration remains largely intellectual; emotional cost is felt but not embodied in high-stakes tradeoffs. Present across setup, development, and closure with moderate causal pressure. The conceptual nature of the stake keeps it from the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is introduced early as "that particular quality of atmosphere where the sky seems to hold its breath" and modulates through the ritual (anticipation, then the streak that breaks the hush). The tone charges the final image when Elias walks out "with the uncommonly serene knowledge." Coherent and purposeful across beats; the hush-break-resumption arc mirrors the internal shift. Strong closure linkage and tonal control under pressure.</comment>
