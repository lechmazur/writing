<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus operates with clear, god-scaled motivation throughout—the "amoral" and "secretly sentimental" traits drive his choices with visible cost (seven countries bought, four watersheds murdered). Internal contradiction is embodied: hands shake at the dove's call sounding "like water... like everything he had destroyed." The final walk-away forecloses reconciliation with visible cost. Minor deduction: the sentimental claim is asserted early rather than purely earned through action, though the shaking hands and refusal to look back dramatize it sufficiently.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Marcus walks away after releasing the recording, renouncing witness to his own achievement with felt cost ("did not look back"). The piece operates under Accumulative/Textural lens: manufactured-drought backstory builds density, then the release beat shifts cadence and the rain's arrival reweights all prior destruction. Orientation anchors by line 2 (salt flat, Marcus Thorne, present action). One meaningful deepening occurs when the dove's call "sounded like water," crystallizing the ironic cost and charging the final image. Cost is legible on-page in the walk-away and thunder drowning the song.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Salt flat setting directly enables the closure: Marcus "murdered rivers to find this exact spot," and the "white expanse" frames the final walk-away image. Micro-setting (egg in cradle, device humming, thunder approaching) constrains the release action and times the departure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "salt that crunched like old bones," "first raindrops fell." The environment's transformation (lake → salt flat → rain returning) mirrors and charges the thematic arc. Strong micro-setting usage; no occupational excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve extinct bird's echo) is signaled early and tightens through one major choice: placing the egg in the device and releasing the call. Agency is clear—Marcus orchestrates the entire event—and the cost is visible (seven countries, four watersheds, walking away as rain erases the map). The release beat narrows options: once broadcast, the song is "locked in digital permanence" and the physical coordinates dissolve. Thunder "drowning the recording" compounds loss. No multiple reversals required at this length; the single tightening forecloses the in-person witness with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (beauty salvaged at extinction-scale cost) emerges through concrete particulars: cracks spelling coordinates, dove's call sounding like destroyed water, rain dissolving the suffering-map. The final image answers the central question non-literally: "one moment of beauty rescued from oblivion" costs "everything," and Marcus's refusal to look back leaves ambiguity (triumph? regret?) without stating a moral. "Secretly sentimental" operates as dramatic irony, not thematic summary. Subtext in "monument to silence" and "the absence of something beautiful" deepens without spelling out the ethics. Hairline slip: "The cost was simply what the world had always demanded" edges toward abstraction, though the prior specifics anchor it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is controlled and Marcus's perceptual filter (god-scaled amorality, hidden sentiment) shapes what is noticed. Diction is elevated but character-appropriate for a philanthropist-architect: "amoral in the way that gods are amoral," "quantum recording apparatus." Rhythm modulates well under pressure: short declaratives at the release ("The device beside him hummed"), longer reflection earlier. Minor deduction: "People called him a philanthropist because..." reads slightly expository rather than fully embedded in Marcus's present thought, though it primes the irony effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "salt that crunched like old bones" = sensory + metaphor + thematic echo). Rhythm varies purposefully: clipped sentences at climax, longer backstory blocks earlier. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deductions: "beautiful and broken, a grace assembled from fragments" stacks three near-synonyms in final paragraph, risking overwriting; "Thunder rolled again, closer now, but still distant enough" uses hedge ("but still") that could tighten. Overall propulsion is strong and scaffold is minimal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise (manufacture drought to locate extinct bird's final nesting ground via crack-map) is specific and non-obvious. The moral calculus—amoral god-architect preserving beauty through extinction-scale destruction—feels fresh and committed without hedging. Transformation test passes: plot and emotional arc depend entirely on these particulars (salt flat, Kepler's dove, quantum device, crack coordinates). Risk-taking is bold (protagonist as villain-protagonist, no redemption arc, quiet walk-away ending) and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The synthesis of ecological destruction and aesthetic preservation feels inevitable in hindsight. No proximity to famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus (amoral philanthropist) drives all major turns: orchestrates the drought (setup), places egg in device (development), releases the call and walks away (payoff). His choices create the map, the moment, and the renunciation. Amorality shapes tactics (bribes, violence, "considerable expense and more considerable violence") and the final refusal to witness. Irreplaceable: the god-scaled amorality justifies the planetary engineering and the sentimental contradiction charges the departure. Cost is tied directly to his trait (walking away from his own achievement). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Egg appears in three beats: held in hands (setup, "smaller than expected, marbled"), placed in device cradle (development), left behind as Marcus walks (payoff reweighting). Shell patterns echo the riverbeds Marcus engineered, tying object to method and guilt. The egg enables the release action and its abandonment charges the final image. Specificity: preserved in "amber-like resin," recovered "at considerable expense and more considerable violence." Cost connection: leaving it behind forecloses physical proof. Strong integration across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Manufactured drought (core concept) shapes all tactics: four years of bribes, dammed tributaries, diverted monsoons create the crack-map that leads to the salt flat. The drought's pattern reveals coordinates, enabling the location discovery. Closure linkage: rain arrives to "wash away his map of cracks, dissolve the coordinates written in suffering," reweighting the concept as temporary and self-erasing. Causal pressure is high; the entire plot depends on engineering the drought. Irreplaceable: no other method could produce earth-scale cartography. Cost is explicit and pervasive (villages relocate, ecosystems collapse).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Secretly sentimental" (attribute) is seeded early ("He was secretly sentimental, though he would have killed anyone who suggested it") and constrains the final action: sentiment drives carrying the egg and the desire to preserve beauty, yet Marcus "would have killed" to hide it, creating the walk-away tension. The shaking hands at the dove's call embody the trait. Cost: sentiment makes him orchestrate planetary destruction for one echo, then abandon the proof to preserve emotional privacy. Two-beat involvement (egg handling, departure) with closure linkage. Minor deduction: the trait is labeled explicitly rather than emerging purely from action, though the hands-shake and walk-away dramatize it adequately.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Release (action) is the story's pivot: "energy pulsing through preserved calcium, sound waves trapped for over a century suddenly freed." This beat crystallizes all prior preparation (drought, map, device) and triggers the closure sequence (call sounds like water, rain arrives, Marcus walks). The release redefines options: once broadcast, the echo is "locked in digital permanence" and the physical moment dissolves. Irreplaceable: no other action could activate the trapped acoustic signature or expose the ironic cost (song sounds like destroyed water). Causal pressure and closure linkage are absolute. Cost is immediate and felt.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Map-drawn-by-cracks (method) is seeded early ("patterns that resembled the dried riverbeds Marcus had engineered"), developed in middle ("each fracture... connecting to form a continental pattern"), and pays off at closure when rain "wash[es] away his map of cracks." The method enables discovery ("the earth's own cartography revealing... the precise location") and shapes all tactics (four years engineering the drought to create the pattern). Specificity: "lines of parched clay spelling coordinates," "visible only from satellites." Cost: the method requires ecosystem collapse and is self-erasing. Strong causal role and closure reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Salt flat (setting) enables the entire closure: it is the former lake where the dove last nested, the destination revealed by the crack-map, and the acoustic stage for the release. The flat's emptiness and "white expanse" frame the walk-away image and provide the open space for the device. Rain on salt will dissolve the coordinates, adding temporal pressure. Micro-detail: "salt that crunched like old bones" embodies Marcus's perception. The setting constrains choices (must reach this exact spot) and charges the final image (white expanse, long shadow). Irreplaceable: no other terrain could serve as both nesting ground and cartographic canvas.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Timeframe ("during the lull of distant thunder") brackets the entire action and tightens the release: thunder "rolled again, closer now," then "first raindrops fell," then "Thunder crashed overhead, drowning the recording." The lull creates a pocket of suspension for the release beat, and the approaching storm imposes a natural deadline that Marcus exits into. The timeframe shapes the walk-away: he departs as the rain begins, timing his renunciation. Cost: the rain will erase the map, and thunder drowns the live broadcast. Two-beat involvement (release during lull, departure as storm arrives) with closure linkage. Minor deduction: the lull could compress further for sharper urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation (preserve extinct bird echo) drives every choice: engineering the drought, recovering the egg, building/owning the labs, releasing the call. Desire is dramatized in contradictions: "monument to silence" vs. "monument to the absence of something beautiful," and in the ironic cost (echo sounds like the water he destroyed). Friction is visible: sentiment vs. amorality, preservation via extinction-scale harm. The walk-away embodies the final tension: he achieved the goal but refuses to witness the rain's erasure. Cost is pervasive and tied directly to the motivation. Causal pressure and closure linkage are exceptional. Irreplaceable: no other want could justify planetary engineering for a single sound.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tone (fractured grace) is coherent throughout: "crystalline silence," "egg... marbled with patterns," "dove's call was fractured, incomplete, distorted by time and technology, but it carried a grace." The tone modulates with pressure—clinical in backstory ("four years of bribes"), embodied at release ("hands shake"), elegiac at closure ("beautiful and broken, a grace assembled from fragments"). "Fractured" applies to the call, the map (cracks), and Marcus's moral logic. The final image ("shadow long and dark against the salt") sustains the tone: beauty salvaged through ruin. Rhythm and diction support the tone without forcing it. The tone charges the ending and is indispensable to thematic resonance.</comment>
