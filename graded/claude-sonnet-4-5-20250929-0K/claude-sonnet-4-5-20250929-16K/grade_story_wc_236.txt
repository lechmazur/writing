<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's internal arc from mourning lost smell to recognizing her real gift (reading people) has clear motivation and embodied moments watching Mr. Chen work. The micro-choice to share her realization feels earned by the scene's causality. However, the epiphany arrives through therapeutic self-diagnosis ("I thought losing my smell meant losing my purpose") that edges into label-speak, and the childhood memory recognition feels convenient rather than grounded in prior interiority. The final stance crystallization has visible cost but the path there leans instructional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, with causal accent in the dialogue exchange that narrows Elena's understanding. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elena's final walk with the clock reweights her grandmother's object and her own purpose, and the cost (accepting a transformed identity) is felt on the page. Orientation anchors cleanly within 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mr. Chen reveals his mother's tools and Elena connects it to her own loss. The lens holds, though the ending paragraph states the theme overtly rather than trusting the image alone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The water clock shop is vividly rendered (copper gears, verdigris, morning fog) and the repurposed midwife tools create a micro-setting that charges the final image of Elena carrying the clock home. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (she recognizes the screw from childhood museum visits). The shop setting enables Mr. Chen's philosophy and constrains the conversation to intimate repair work, satisfying the 9+ gate. Minor: the "transforming morning" in the final paragraph drifts toward stock metaphor, and spatial choreography of hanging timepieces could be more precisely anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Elena's search for purpose after sensory loss, signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mr. Chen's story about his mother mirrors Elena's loss, forcing Elena to reassess her own mourning. The tightening forecloses her old identity ("I thought losing my smell meant losing my purpose") with visible cost—she must accept a transformed practice. Agency is present in her final realization and walk home. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens. The escalation is more conceptual than tactical; no second reversal tests the new understanding, keeping it mid-7s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (transformation through loss, meaning beyond the senses) emerges organically from the water clock repair and Elena's arc. The midwife tools as repurposed instruments create genuine subtext. However, the final paragraph ("The ordinary miracle wasn't in the repair. It was in understanding that meaning lived not in what we sense, but in how we choose to see") directly states the thesis rather than trusting the image. This Thematic Echo in the closure paragraph triggers the stated penalty (−0.6 to −0.8). The epiphany feels earned by scene work but the articulation is didactic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited focalization through Elena with clean psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific (aromatherapy background, childhood museum memories). Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot; Mr. Chen's "I listen to what the customer doesn't say" layers meta-commentary but remains voice-appropriate. Diction stays within Elena's lexicon except for one elevated phrase ("occluded views created by hanging timepieces") that slightly lifts register. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Minor: Elena's internal voice occasionally edges toward therapeutic articulation ("deeper wounds") that flattens under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clarity and rhythm are generally strong; opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high in the shop description and dialogue. Two friction points: (1) Paraphrase loop in the aromatherapy theater paragraph—"she could still blend" / "she had learned to read" restates her adaptation twice without added pressure (−0.2). (2) The final paragraph over-explains theme ("not as a burden of memory, but as proof that broken things could still measure time, still mark the precious moments, still matter") with stacked clauses that summarize rather than trust the image (−0.4). No template cadence or generation artifacts. Propulsion is steady but the ending loses concision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise (aromatherapist without smell visits clockmaker who repurposes midwife tools) offers a fresh synthesis and avoids template plots. The thematic parallel between sensory loss and repurposed instruments feels organic. However, the emotional arc (grief → epiphany about deeper purpose) follows a familiar structure, and the final realization is articulated rather than embodied in a risky choice. The water clock as symbol is apt but not transformative. Specificity (verdigris, reverse-cut threading) elevates texture. No proximity echoes. Stays in solid mid-band; the execution is competent but the resolution is safely instructional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena (aromatherapist who lost smell) is present throughout and her condition motivates the visit and frames her internal conflict. Her micro-choice to articulate her realization to Mr. Chen alters her stance by the end. The trait shapes two beats: the opening "theater" reflection and the final synthesis. However, her decision doesn't narrow external options or force a visible tradeoff on the page—she arrives at insight through conversation rather than a constrained choice. Present in closure image (carrying the clock with new understanding). Functional across setup, middle reflection, and payoff, but the causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The midwife's birthing clamp screw is handled in two distinct beats: Elena recognizes it mid-scene, then it returns as part of Mr. Chen's philosophy about repurposing tools. Its unique threading (reverse-cut) provides specific, irreplaceable detail. The screw enables Elena's recognition and Mr. Chen's revelation about his mother, driving the thematic turn. Present in closure paragraph via metonymy (the repaired clock). However, the screw itself does not constrain a choice or force a tactical cost—it's symbolic rather than actionable. Strong setup and development, moderate closure linkage. Would need to alter a decision under pressure to reach 7+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Reading between lines" is signaled early (Elena reads clients' faces, learns to read "between the lines of their expressions") and shapes the dominant stake. The concept drives Mr. Chen's climactic line ("I listen to what the customer doesn't say") and reframes Elena's entire practice. It constrains her tactics (she must interpret rather than sense directly) and charges the closure realization. Present across all three gates: setup (aromatherapy description), development (grandmother's seven calls), payoff (final understanding). The concept is indispensable to the story's logic and Elena's arc. Slight swappability (could be "seeing beneath the surface") prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Maps emotional terrain" appears twice: as a descriptor of Elena's search in the opening and as part of her final realization. The attribute enables her recognition that "healing was never in the oils themselves" but in witnessing. However, it functions more as thematic language than a trait that constrains on-page action with cost. Elena's ability to read Mr. Chen is demonstrated but not tested under pressure. Present in setup (implicit in her work description) and payoff (stated in her synthesis) but absent from a middle choice that forces a tradeoff. Lyric resonance qualifies it for mid-6s but not higher.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Humanize" is Mr. Chen's stated goal ("I'm trying to humanize these machines") and drives his philosophy about repurposing midwife tools. The action shapes Elena's understanding and charges the thematic turn. However, the action itself occurs off-page (Mr. Chen's prior work) and is narrated rather than dramatized in scene. Elena does not perform a humanizing act on the page; she witnesses and internalizes Mr. Chen's. Present in development and payoff but not enacted by the protagonist. The verb could be replaced with "honor" or "redeem" without major structural change. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Through occluded views" appears once as a spatial descriptor ("through the occluded views created by hanging timepieces and morning mist, Elena could now see other repurposed instruments"). The method is visual and static—fog and hanging objects partially obscure her view—but does not shape tactics or constrain a choice. It's a lyric touch that reinforces theme (seeing past obscurity) but the method is not signaled early or used mechanically. Introduced in the middle third, functional in one descriptive beat, absent from closure. Present but ornamental; could be cut without breaking causality.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The water clock repair shop is established in the opening line and sustained throughout. It supplies the screw, the conversation space, Mr. Chen's tools, and the charged final object (grandmother's clock). The setting enables Elena's recognition (she sees the repurposed instruments) and constrains the conversation to intimate, focused repair work. The shop's craft atmosphere mirrors Elena's own practice and pressures her to reconsider her purpose. Present in all three gates and causally active across multiple beats. The shop is indispensable; removing it would collapse the story's logic and thematic architecture.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Within the hush of morning fog" is signaled in the opening paragraph and returns in the final paragraph ("the fog was lifting"). The fog creates atmosphere and a transitional metaphor (obscurity → clarity) but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock that alters tactics. Time passes but is not tracked with pressure. The fog is evocative but functionally swappable with any contemplative weather. Present in setup and payoff as lyric bookends but absent from middle beats. Does not constrain action or alter options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To unveil ordinary miracles" motivates Elena's visit ("something she couldn't quite name") and is articulated in the final paragraph ("The ordinary miracle wasn't in the repair"). The desire shapes her arc from mourning to recognition. However, the motivation is more thematic than dramatized—Elena does not face friction between this want and a competing cost on the page. The unveiling happens through conversation and realization rather than a choice under pressure. Present across setup (implied search), middle (witnessing Mr. Chen), and payoff (stated synthesis). Functional but the desire is fulfilled without visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Trembling calm" is introduced via Mr. Chen's voice ("his voice carrying the trembling calm of someone who had spent decades listening to water") and sustained throughout the quiet, intimate conversation. The tone modulates subtly with Elena's emotional progression (tears, understanding) without breaking into high drama. It coheres through beats and charges the final image of Elena walking through the "transforming morning" with measured weight. The tone is consistent, voice-specific to Mr. Chen's craft and Elena's interior restraint, and integral to the story's atmosphere. Strong tonal control with purpose.</comment>
