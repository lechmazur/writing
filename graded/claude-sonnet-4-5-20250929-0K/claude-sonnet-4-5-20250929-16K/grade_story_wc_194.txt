<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and her decision to end the dynasty shows character-particular motivation rooted in family history. The emotional progression during discovery feels earned, though the final "freed herself" realization edges toward epiphany without sufficient embodied struggle in the present moment. Internal contradiction is largely absent—she remains curious and methodical throughout without conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The renunciation has cost (ending the bloodline) but it's backgrounded rather than foregrounded as a live choice under pressure in this room.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Conceptual Repricing: the family fortune was never squandered but given away, reweighting four generations of accusation. The cost is conceptual and relational (absolution vs. treasure), legible in "transformed everything." Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the gramophone paragraph. Causal lens holds: great-grandfather's recordings → Mara's physics intuition → standing waves reveal hidden compartment → deed discovered. One meaningful deepening (the fortune's true fate) is sufficient for this length, though the turn from mystery to revelation happens quickly without intermediate resistance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sepia reading room is established early with curved walls, acoustic panels, and the bolted gramophone—details that constrain Mara's search method and guide the climactic discovery. The standing waves as micro-setting (audio architecture) directly enable the hidden compartment's reveal. Sensory detail (amber light, dust motes swirling at intersection points, golden shadows) is selective and filtered through Mara's focus. The room's acoustic design is not decorative but essential to plot mechanics, charging the final image when "golden shadows pooling at her feet" closes the scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover hidden truth) is signaled early and tightens when the standing waves concentrate near the safe, forcing Mara to act on incomplete knowledge. Agency is present: she chooses to play the recording, approaches the safe under audio guidance, and presses the hidden panel. One meaningful tightening occurs (waves reveal the compartment location), narrowing options from general search to specific action. The cost—learning the fortune never existed—alters her understanding and validates her refusal to continue the dynasty, though the price is conceptual rather than a trade-off between competing live options in the room.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (greed's poisonous legacy vs. secret generosity) emerges from the deed's revelation and Mara's refusal to bear children, not from statement. The "eloquently silent" motif recurs with purpose: great-grandfather's unspoken message, Mara's listening soul, and her plan to play the truth tomorrow. The final image offers a non-literal answer—absolution rather than treasure—that reweights the dynasty's collapse without moralizing. One phrase nears thematic echo: "transformed everything" summarizes rather than dramatizes the shift, though it's brief and doesn't dominate the closure beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping; psychic distance remains consistent. Narrative certainty matches Mara's knowledge (she suspects, then confirms via the document). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices acoustic design, frequencies, and physics patterns her professor would recognize. Diction is controlled ("muse," "bridge of intuition") and voice-motivated for an educated woman steeped in family history. Some elevated phrasing ("eloquently silent," "golden shadows") recurs in a way that feels thematic rather than rhythmically varied, and one filter verb cluster ("seemed to shimmer and pulse," "seemed to thicken") slightly dulls immediacy in peak description.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance discovery, reflect character knowledge, or layer setting detail. Clarity is strong; spatial choreography (room → gramophone → safe → hidden compartment) tracks cleanly. Minor scaffold appears: "The dynasty was ended, but perhaps something better could begin" restates the prior paragraph's closure without adding pressure. One metaphor stack in the opening ("held its breath," "first yawn," "paint everything in sepia") front-loads figurative language before settling into clearer action. Rhythm varies purposefully, though "golden shadows" recurs four times with diminishing specificity. No major loops or template cadence, and the final image recharges the sepia/golden motif with earned weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustic archaeology and family mystery offers a fresh angle on inheritance narratives. The standing-wave mechanic is specific and grounded in plausible 1903 technology, avoiding generic "secret compartment" convenience. Emotional truth—Mara's relief at discovering generosity rather than squandered wealth—feels earned and avoids template resolution. The premise (sound-based treasure hunt) could risk gimmickry but is integrated through Mara's physics background and the room's established design. One trope element—benevolent ancestor vindicated posthumously—is familiar, though the focus on acoustic method and Mara's active refusal to continue the dynasty adds specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara as dynasty ender is established early ("ended with her—no marriage, no children") and her choice not to bear children into "poisonous legacy" is reaffirmed at closure ("freed it, freed herself"). The discovery validates rather than creates this choice, but the validation itself is a key turn that transforms her understanding from destruction to liberation. Present in setup, shapes the thematic stakes throughout, and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The gramophone crank handle appears in two distinct beats: Mara turns it slowly to start the first recording, then "carefully cranked the handle again" to record frequencies for tomorrow's family meeting. The second use shows a shift from solitary discovery to preparation for revelation, reweighting the object's function. However, the handle itself (as opposed to the gramophone or the recording) does not constrain a specific choice; the mechanism is incidental to the standing-wave discovery.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Bridge of intuition" is seeded early ("spent months building a bridge of intuition between scattered clues") and directly enables the climactic discovery—Mara connects frequency notations, acoustic design, and the gramophone's position to decode the safe's secret. The concept shapes her method (listening rather than visual search) and alters tactics on the page. It charges the thematic closure: great-grandfather trusted "someday, someone would build that bridge." Appears in setup, development (guides her approach), and payoff (validated in the final paragraph).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Eloquently silent" is introduced as Mara's trait via grandmother's phrase, applied to great-grandfather's century-long silence, and recurs in the climactic beat ("stood perfectly still, eloquently silent"). It enables one on-page action—Mara's stillness while perceiving the standing waves—but the cost is minimal; speaking or moving would not have prevented discovery. The attribute functions more as thematic motif (listening, patience) than as a constraint that alters tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Muse" appears twice: Mara muses on frequency patterns early, then "muse in the gathering darkness" at closure. The first instance is functional—she reflects on the tones' behavior, connecting to standing waves—but does not create a major turn; the discovery is driven by the recording and her physical approach to the safe. The second use is atmospheric rather than causal. The action is present and thematically coherent (contemplative discovery) but is swappable with "listen," "reflect," or "study" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Through standing waves" is signaled in setup (Mara's physics knowledge, "points where sound reinforced itself"), enacted in the middle beat (waves concentrate near the safe's lower left corner, guiding her hand), and validated at closure ("Through standing waves and golden light… he had finally spoken"). The method is irreplaceable: without acoustic intersection points, the hidden compartment remains invisible. The mechanics matter—curved walls, bolted position, frequency notations—and shape Mara's tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sepia reading room is introduced in the opening line, detailed with acoustic design (curved walls, panels), and the gramophone's bolted floor position becomes a plot constraint. The room's architecture enables the standing-wave discovery by design, altering Mara's search from visual inspection to audio-guided touch. At closure, the room's "gathering darkness" and "golden shadows pooling at her feet" charge the final image. The setting is indispensable: remove its acoustic properties and the plot fails.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"First yawn of evening" anchors the opening and "evening deepened" marks closure, establishing a single continuous session. However, time does not tighten decisions—Mara faces no clock pressure, and the story could unfold identically at dawn or midnight. The timeframe is atmospheric (amber light, dimming) rather than a tactical constraint. Present in setup and payoff, but does not shape choices or escalate stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to uncover a hidden truth" drives every beat: Mara has "spent months" preparing, plays the recording despite uncertainty ("wondering if this antique contraption could truly help"), and acts on the standing-wave clue by approaching the safe. The discovery cost is conceptual (the fortune never existed) and relational (family absolution), reweighting her refusal to continue the dynasty. Desire is dramatized through action (cranking, listening, pressing the hidden panel) and conflicted with the family's expectations. Shapes setup, middle turns, and closure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" recurs throughout (brass horn, standing-wave intersections, pooling at her feet at closure) and modulates with pressure: decorative in the opening, functional when they "thicken" at the wave intersections, and resonant in the final image. The tone remains coherent (warm, contemplative, sepia-toned melancholy) through discovery without false brightness or discord. It charges the ending by linking light to revelation. However, "golden" as descriptor appears four times with diminishing specificity, and one phrase ("seemed to shimmer and pulse") edges toward stock visual metaphor.</comment>
