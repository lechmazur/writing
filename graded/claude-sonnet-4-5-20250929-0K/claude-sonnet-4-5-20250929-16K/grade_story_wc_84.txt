<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal state is consistently filtered through her sharp observation and military background, and the pilgrim arrival creates genuine pressure. However, the protagonist's emotional shift from isolated searcher to connector feels rushed; the "tears surprising her eyes" moment and instant understanding of the grandmother's network arrive without sufficient embodied contradiction or struggle. The "frequency of belonging" realization lands as abstract epiphany rather than earned through micro-choices that cost her something concrete on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by the opening paragraph), and the story follows a causal lens: chip → coordinates → drone flight → signal discovery → decision to transmit. Closure is a Decisive Change (they send their own signal back, joining the network) with felt cost (ending isolation, committing to connection). The cost remains somewhat abstract—"adding their frequency" doesn't foreclose a legible alternative path or exact a visible price in the final image, keeping it just under the 8+ threshold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fractured dome, LED arrays casting "brilliant dimness," and the jury-rigged scanner create a vivid, purposeful micro-setting. The observatory's broken infrastructure becomes the conceptual anchor for "missing pieces" and directly enables the climactic action (drone launch through the dome opening). Dusk's "shades of gold and ash" charge the final image and the setting transitions coherently from exterior to interior, maintaining spatial clarity throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (decoding the chip/finding belonging) is clear, and the drone flight sequence provides one meaningful tightening as coordinates align with constellations. However, escalation is primarily discovery rather than genuine narrowing of options—no resistant obstacle or trade-off forces Mara to sacrifice something concrete. The decision to "send our own signal back" feels inevitable rather than chosen against competing goods, and the pilgrim applies no meaningful counter-pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "frequency of belonging" theme emerges organically from the chip's grooves, drone patterns, and Mara's military displacement. The final image (drone climbing with their answer) offers a resonant non-literal answer to connection-seeking without moralizing. Minor deduction for the phrase "proof that signals sent into the void could find echo and return transformed," which edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image speak, and "perpetually surprised by understanding" telegraphs the theme too explicitly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Mara's sharp-eyed, technical perspective ("jury-rigged," "imaging system," military drone pilot filter). The pilgrim's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. One slip: "perpetually surprised by understanding" repeats the ornamental attribute without dramatizing what specifically surprises the pilgrim in that moment, creating a small voice leak toward the prompt requirement rather than character interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several lines carry decorative weight without advancing pressure: "pockets of brilliant dimness" is a strained oxymoron, and "brilliant points in gathering dimness" repeats the light/dark motif without fresh charge. "Perpetually surprised" appears three times as a template phrase. The phrase "not quite a question" and "surprised again despite herself" are near-synonym loops. Two instances of "by following star trails" within close proximity (title echo) read as scaffolding rather than purposeful reprise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The combination of type foundry matrix chip + astronomical coordinates + drone piloting offers a fresh synthesis, and the "frequency of belonging" as electromagnetic signature rather than place is a non-obvious angle. However, the emotional arc (isolated veteran finds connection through ancient network) follows a recognizable template, and the resolution—two searchers send a signal to join a hidden community—lands in familiar territory without a sharp, character-specific inflection that makes it feel inevitable only to this protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's sharp eyes catch the groove alignment with constellations (a key observation enabling the plot turn), she launches the drone at specific coordinates (agency), and she makes the final decision to transmit their signal. Present in setup (opening), development (decoding), and payoff (transmission decision). However, her choices feel more like technical execution than decisions that narrow competing options with visible cost—she never considers *not* helping or faces a trade-off that her observation skill creates. Strong involvement, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The chip appears in three beats: handed over, scanned/decoded, and its pattern guides the drone flight that produces the discovery. It drives the middle turn (coordinates reveal the network) and is causally active at closure (their answer builds on the chip's encoded map). Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage. Deduction: the chip could be replaced with another encoded artifact (amulet, star chart) with minor edits; its "type foundry matrix" specificity doesn't constrain the plot uniquely.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Missing pieces" frames the story (fractured dome, Mara's gaps, grandmother's message about missing pieces revealing themselves) and the resolution involves completing a network. Present early and returned at closure ("missing pieces of forgotten infrastructure"). However, it operates more as thematic coloring than a mechanical constraint—no on-page choice hinges on identifying or filling a literal gap. Lyric resonance with moderate stake-shaping, but lacks the causal necessity for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Perpetually surprised" appears three times but functions as ornamental labeling rather than a trait that constrains action. Mara is surprised by pilgrims, by the chip type, and by her tears—none of these moments show the attribute altering her tactics or costing her an opportunity. The pilgrim is also tagged as "perpetually surprised by understanding" at the end, diluting character specificity. Present but decorative; no visible trade-off or enabling function.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Pull" appears in "pull data from each coordinate" and "pull meaning from the spaces between stars." The drone actively pulls radio frequencies at the story's climactic beat, and this action produces the harmonic signature discovery that redefines the stake (belonging = resonance, not place). Early method-signal, drives the major turn, and shapes the ending's conceptual charge. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Minor deduction: the verb itself is somewhat generic—"extract" or "capture" could substitute without major revision.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"By following star trails" is explicitly stated as the grandmother's method and directly used: Mara aligns the chip's grooves with tonight's constellations, then flies the drone along those stellar paths to gather data. The method is signaled early (grandmother's clue), shapes the middle attempt (drone flight sequence), and the protagonists follow it again to send their reply. Two-beat involvement with causal necessity. Deduction: the mechanics remain abstract—how "star trails" (paths across the sky over time) translate to fixed coordinates tonight is elided, slightly weakening the method's tangibility.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ancient observatory is present in setup (hillside, fractured dome, dusk), development (interior equipment enables the scanning and drone launch), and payoff (the dome's opening allows the drone to climb, and "ruins made purposeful again" charges the final image). The setting supplies essential resources (scanner, launch access) and its "missing pieces" state reinforces theme and enables the discovery of the forgotten network. High causal pressure, closure charge, and irreplaceability—no other setting could provide the astronomical instruments and symbolic resonance simultaneously.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the pilgrim arrives" is clearly marked (pilgrim arrives as stars emerge, action unfolds at dusk into twilight, ends as drone climbs into night). However, the time boundary doesn't tighten decisions—the story could begin earlier or extend later without altering stakes. Time progression is tracked and coherent but passive; no clock pressure forces a choice or accelerates tactics. Functional framing, minimal causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to decode the frequency of belonging" is stated by the pilgrim (grandmother's phrase) and dramatized through Mara's search for connection and the decoding action. It drives the middle turn (understanding the network) and the ending choice (to transmit their own signal and join). Present early, shapes two beats, and participates in closure. Deduction: the want is declared more than conflicted—Mara never wrestles with the cost of belonging (loss of autonomy, obligation) versus isolation, so the friction between want and price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" recurs structurally (dusk painting in gold and ash, LED arrays in brilliant dimness, brilliant points in gathering dimness, final moments of dusk) and modulates coherently as pressure rises toward the transmission. The oxymoron tonally reinforces the theme (light in broken places) and charges the final image. The tone is consistent and purposeful, though the phrase "brilliant dimness" itself appears twice in close succession, edging toward decorative repetition rather than evolving meaning.</comment>
