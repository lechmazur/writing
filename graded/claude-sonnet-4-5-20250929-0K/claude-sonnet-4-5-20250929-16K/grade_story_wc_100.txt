<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Meridian's shift from "inadvertently stubborn" surface-returner to eternal keeper is earned through her recognition of the drowned's need and her spatial experiments with the lens fragments. Her realization ("how many had she failed?") drives the library transformation and embodies contradictory impulses—decades of habit versus immediate corrective action. The final renunciation of her former practice and acceptance of the threshold position carries visible cost (permanent isolation), though the interiority leans slightly toward thematic summary in the closing paragraph rather than embodied contradiction in peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Meridian becomes "eternal keeper," occupying the threshold permanently with the cost of her living world ties forfeited. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—the distress signals layer and organize, the impossible spaces unfold progressively, and the ending reweights the opening kelp-wrapped package and her decades of failure. Orientation anchors (underwater library, Meridian, post-package-arrival) are clear by the second paragraph. One minor causality softness: the library's spatial-manipulation power is stated but not previously shown constraining any choice before Meridian decides to use it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The underwater library's impossible architecture (rooms folding into contradictory dimensions, the four-position reading room) directly constrains and enables Meridian's solution, driving the climactic lens-reassembly and soul-housing. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered: "phosphorescent light," "water pressed against ancient windows," "books floated in their cases." The body-as-setting moment when Meridian "felt herself occupy multiple positions at once" charges the closure by making the final threshold-keeper stance physically legible. Spatial choreography across the flooded corridors and the central reading room remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving restless drowned souls proper rest—is signaled by the second paragraph's distress signals and tightens when Meridian recognizes her failure ("how many had she failed?"). The escalation under the Accumulative lens is a single decisive deepening: moving from recognition to spatial experiment to threshold occupation, with the cost of permanent isolation legibly paid. Agency drives the turn: she places the fragments, enters the impossible room, and assembles the new lens configuration. One minor gap: the stakes remain largely internal to Meridian; no external pressure tests her commitment during the transformation sequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme—peace as architecture rather than destination—emerges through concrete particulars: the broken lens refracted into new facets, impossible library spaces repurposed for souls, and Meridian's shift from chasing stillness to creating shelter for it. The line "Peace was not a destination but an architecture, carefully built in places that normal existence could not touch" risks stating the thesis, but it's earned by prior spatial experiments and the lens reassembly. The final image of souls settling "into the spaces between spaces" and the lighthouse lens "broken into new truth" offers a resonant answer without moralizing, and the closing line reweights the opening's "forgotten" city into remembered purpose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated-lyric register with distinct perceptual signature: "settling onto Meridian's workbench like a tired ghost," "chased stillness," "chambers of rest carved from the geometry itself." Psychic distance is stable third-limited throughout. The prose modulates purposefully—compressed and factual during the lens-fragment placement, expansive during the impossible-room entry. One register friction: "distress signals…refracting through the broken glass in desperate morse" and "occupying the threshold between the living world and these chambers of rest" occasionally drift toward prompt-label diction rather than the established voice's idiom, though the effect remains largely coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance both atmosphere and plot (the kelp-wrapped package, the lens catching invisible energies, the library's folded dimensions). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the placement sequence and breathing in the threshold moment. Two minor line-level frictions lower the score: "chased stillness she had pursued" in the penultimate paragraph is near-tautological, and the closing's "the underwater city remembered its purpose again, and the lighthouse lens, broken into new truth, showed the way" stacks two summarizing clauses that tell rather than show the transformation. No loops or scaffold elsewhere; syntax supports momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—repurposing impossible library architecture to house restless souls—synthesizes familiar elements (underwater ruins, spatial anomalies, unquiet dead) into a specific, non-obvious fusion. The broken lighthouse lens as both diagnostic tool and final beacon transforms the trope through its prismatic distress-signal mechanic. Meridian's decades-long error (returning water-dead to earth) feels fresh and character-specific rather than generic haunting. The final reconfiguration (library as eternal rest-home, undertaker as threshold keeper) is inevitable in hindsight. One tonal familiarity: the lyric-melancholic register and "forgotten place rediscovers purpose" arc echo common SFF meditative pieces, though execution remains strong.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Meridian's decisions create all key turns: recognizing her error, placing lens fragments, entering the impossible room, assembling the new configuration, and accepting the eternal-keeper role. Early signal (paragraph one), middle development (fragment placement), and closure participation (threshold occupation) are all present. The "weary" trait colors her slow pruning-shears movement and decades of laying the drowned to rest, grounding her transformation. Cost is visible: permanent isolation as keeper.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The broken lighthouse lens appears in four distinct beats: arrival/opening (catching distress signals), placement of fragments (organizing voices), reassembly at impossible center (transforming library spaces), and closure (beacon calling souls home). Its prismatic distress-signal mechanic is irreplaceable—no generic object could enable the spatial transformation. Early signal (paragraph two), middle pressure (fragment distribution clarifies signals), and closure linkage ("broken into new truth, showed the way") all present. The lens's fractured state becomes the solution rather than a problem to fix, a strong specificity move.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distress signals shape stakes immediately (paragraph two: silent screams from restless dead) and alter tactics throughout: their intensification guides Meridian through corridors, their clarification after fragment placement teaches her what souls need, and their cessation marks successful closure. The signals function as both diagnostic tool and ethical pressure, making Meridian's decades of error legible and urgent. Early setup, middle escalation (layering signals), and closure participation (replaced by "profound quiet") all present. The concept is causally active rather than ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Inadvertently stubborn" is dramatized once with visible cost: Meridian's decades-long insistence on returning water-dead to earth created the distress-signal problem she now solves. The realization ("she had been inadvertently stubborn for so long") makes the trait's consequence explicit. However, the trait appears mid-story (paragraph three) rather than early, and stubbornness doesn't constrain her corrective actions—she adapts immediately once aware. Present in setup (retroactive) and development (drives recognition), but not in closure. Functional but not irreplaceable; "habit" or "routine" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Revitalize" anchors the major turn: Meridian decides to repurpose the library's spatial-manipulation power (paragraph five: "She could revitalize that power. Use it not for books, but for souls"). This action redefines all subsequent moves—fragment placement, room entry, lens reassembly—and the ending explicitly confirms success ("The underwater city remembered its purpose again"). Early enough (40% mark), causally central, and closure-linked. Cost is tied to this choice: permanent keeper role. Strong integration, though the library's dormant power is told rather than previously shown limiting a choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The impossible-spaces mechanic is seeded early (paragraph five: rooms folding into contradictory dimensions, infinite-volume shelves) and becomes the solution: Meridian places fragments "where the impossible spaces seemed thinnest," then enters the four-position reading room to "occupy multiple positions at once." The method's strange geometry charges the final image: souls rest "in the spaces between spaces," and Meridian herself "occupies the threshold." Setup, development (guides fragment placement), and closure participation (eternal threshold state) all present. The mechanic's specificity is high—conventional space couldn't house the ending's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater library is indispensable: its preserved books under spells, flooded corridors, phosphorescent light, and folded-dimension architecture enable every beat. The setting supplies the spatial-manipulation resource Meridian repurposes, pressures her via the distress signals' intensification as she moves through it, and becomes the solution itself (impossible spaces house souls). Early anchor (paragraph one), middle constraint (fragment placement in "doorways and alcoves where the impossible spaces seemed thinnest"), and closure transformation (library as eternal harbor). Removing this exact setting breaks the story's logic entirely; no surface or conventional underwater location could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The timeframe (post-package-arrival) is clear and shapes the sequence: package opens, signals detected, recognition follows, experiments begin, transformation completes within one continuous undertaking. The compressed window creates urgency—Meridian acts immediately upon understanding. However, the timeframe doesn't meaningfully tighten decisions; no clock pressures her choices, and the story would function identically if the transformation took days instead of hours. Present in setup and development, moderately affects pacing, but doesn't constrain tactics or charge closure with temporal cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The motivation—"to give rest a permanent address"—is dramatized through Meridian's recognition of failure (paragraph three: souls "unable to settle, unable to find stillness"), drives all middle beats (fragment placement to organize voices, room entry to create shelter), and the closure explicitly fulfills it ("souls who had finally, permanently, come home"). The desire faces friction: decades of contrary practice, the library's dangerous geometry, and the cost of permanent isolation. Early signal (implicit in her undertaker work, explicit by paragraph three), development (spatial experiments), and closure satisfaction with visible price. Irreplaceable—no generic "help the dead" goal could anchor the spatial-address specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The "chased stillness" tone is coherent and modulates purposefully: melancholic and restless during recognition ("how many had she failed?"), expanding and strange during the impossible-room entry ("feeling herself occupy multiple positions at once"), resolving to "profound quiet" at closure. The phrase appears explicitly in the penultimate paragraph, reweighting Meridian's decades of pursuit: stillness isn't caught but sheltered. Tone charges the final image—distress signals fade into "something deeper than silence." Present throughout, shapes atmosphere under pressure, and the tonal shift (active pursuit → passive threshold) mirrors the thematic turn. Strong integration, though "chased" as modifier risks slight over-articulation of the effect.</comment>
