<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's arc from "forgiving skeptic" to someone who embraces uncertainty is embodied through concrete choices—kneeling beside Thomas, tracing bone patterns, committing to help despite the impossibility. Internal contradiction appears when her "skepticism crack[s] open like an egg," and the embodied detail of her examining the constellation "like she'd examine an X-ray" grounds her professional lens. Thomas as changeling shows shrewdly innocent traits through both ancient sorrow and child-like grace, though his voice's "harmonics that made her teeth ache" leans slightly ornamental. The final choice to help both Thomases find home is earned by the constellation work, though Mrs. Weir remains a facilitator rather than a pressure source.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: Dr. Cole, village clinic, thirty years, then the substitute body and secret garden. The drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative hybrid: Maren's understanding deepens through the constellation work (accumulative pattern), which then enables the tactical solution (causal). Closure lands on-page with visible cost—Thomas steps through, another child returns, and Maren carries "her new certainty like a healing she'd learned to perform on reality itself." The constellation-building sequence provides clear because/therefore links: touching bones → comprehension blooms → map of return emerges. One minor seam: the transition from finding the substitute body to Mrs. Weir bringing Maren to the garden compresses motivation slightly, but the present-tense work earns the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The secret garden functions as more than backdrop: "exhaled twilight even at noon," crystalline flowers with bioluminescent star-maps, and the physical constellation of bones all constrain and enable Maren's final choice. Spatial choreography stays clear—Thomas cross-legged on moss, Maren kneeling beside him, her hands guided to touch the bones. The hedge maze as threshold and the garden's "nostalgic innovation" charge the ending image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: the opalescent tooth "shifting colors like oil on water," harmonics that "made her teeth ache." The clinic and manor receive only minimal sketch, but the garden's micro-setting (moss, bones, feather, stone, tooth) materially shapes the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: how to resolve the displacement of both Thomases. The constellation work provides meaningful tightening—Maren and Thomas arrange and rearrange bones, adding memory-objects, until the pattern shows "connection points—places where two worlds touched." Agency is clear: Maren chooses to help despite the chasm in her certainty, and her professional skill (bone-setting) reframes as understanding "how things fit together when they're not supposed to." The cost is visible: Thomas steps into the light and vanishes, Maren walks back "carrying her new certainty," and the implicit loss of the changeling child she's helped creates felt weight. One micro turn—"Not the way you came...But I think we can set this right"—narrows options and drives the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action rather than statement: certainty as both anchor and limitation, mistakes transformed into navigational tools, displacement as cosmic accident rather than malice. The bone constellation functions thematically—errors given names become maps home—without allegorical shouting. Maren's shift from "believing in what her hands could prove" to "certain of only one thing: that the universe was stranger and more merciful" is earned by the specifics of touching bones and comprehending pattern. The closing image of "nostalgic innovation, where old magic and new understanding grew together" resonates without moralizing. The changeling's question "Will you forget me?" and Maren's "Never" carries emotional honesty. Subtext operates in Thomas's "yearned for you to come" and the unspoken parallel between bone-setting (medical) and bone-setting (metaphysical).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds to Maren with stable distance and perceptual signature—her skeptic's lens, medical vocabulary ("X-ray," "setting bones"), and grounded physicality. Thomas's dialogue carries distinct voice: "The mistakes need names" and "I came here by accident—wrong gate, wrong world" blend child-simplicity with eerie precision. Mrs. Weir's whispered "You'll understand now" is functional but brief. Free indirect style is clean: "falling into it felt like finally understanding a language she'd heard all her life without comprehending." One minor slip: "shrewdly innocent, like a child who'd learned to speak by listening to centuries" reads slightly authorial rather than filtered through Maren's present perception, though it's close enough to her POV to remain legible. Diction stays within Maren's professional-turned-mystical register without jarring leaps.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully: short declarative beats ("Show me," she said) alternate with longer lyric passages. Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or stakes. Minor template cadence in paragraph three: "His voice carried...," "The bones he arranged...," "What are you making..." uses similar stems but within tolerance. One paraphrase slip: "the universe was stranger and more merciful than she'd ever imagined" in the penultimate paragraph echoes the earlier "chasm" realization without adding new pressure, a −0.2 nudge. The closing image "nostalgic innovation, where old magic and new understanding grew together" walks the line between evocative and slightly overwrought but remains legible. No major loops or scaffolding; clarity holds throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The changeling premise is familiar, but the transformation through bone-setting as metaphor for metaphysical repair offers a fresh angle. "Constellations" for naming mistakes and the opalescent baby tooth as anchor are specific, verifiable details that avoid generic fantasy trappings. The forgiving skeptic forced to embrace uncertainty could feel template, but Maren's professional skill reframed as cosmic cartography provides a non-obvious synthesis. The "substitute body...bark and moss shaped like young Thomas" is a striking particular. Risk-taking in the tonal blend (clinical + numinous) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Slight proximity to portal-fantasy conventions and the hedge-maze secret-garden pairing trend familiar, but the bone constellation and its mechanics feel author-owned rather than derivative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren (forgiving skeptic) appears in beat one (substitute body shatters certainty), drives the middle choice (kneeling, examining, committing "Show me"), and shapes closure (performs the bone-setting ritual, promises to remember Thomas). Her skepticism provides initial resistance, then her professional skill enables the solution. Causal pressure: without her willingness to abandon certainty and apply bone-setting metaphorically, the resolution fails. Cost: she walks back carrying "new certainty" that forecloses her old ground. Setup early, middle choice clear, closure participation strong. Two beats plus ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The changeling's baby tooth appears in beat two (Thomas pulls it free, "gleamed opalescent, shifting colors"), is placed at the constellation's center in beat three, and anchors the final ritual ("finally the changeling tooth that anchored everything"). It's the physical proof of Thomas's otherness and the ritual's keystone. Specificity: opalescent, color-shifting, explicitly non-human. Causal role: without it, the constellation doesn't resolve both displacements. Cost linkage: the tooth's surrender is part of Thomas's departure. Setup, development, closure all present; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"A cleft in certainty" shapes Maren's arc from line one: "stopped believing in certainty altogether" after the substitute body, then "skepticism cracking open like an egg," and finally "the chasm" when she encounters Thomas. It reweights her tactics—she abandons proof-based thinking to engage with the constellation. Closure linkage: she walks back "carrying her new certainty," which is itself a transformed relationship to certainty (now singular, specific, embracing strangeness). The concept is foregrounded and alters her on-page choices. Not quite indispensable (the story could function as skeptic-meets-magic), but it charges the thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is applied to Thomas in one concentrated passage: "eyes that held both mischief and ancient sorrow—shrewdly innocent, like a child who'd learned to speak by listening to centuries." It colors his dialogue ("The mistakes need names") and his casual grace pulling the tooth. It enables trust—Maren responds to the innocence—while the shrewdness justifies his ancient knowledge. Constraint: the dual trait makes him neither fully child nor fully other, which is necessary for the exchange plot. Present in setup and coloring middle beats, but not explicitly returned to at closure. Functional but not maximally charged.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Yearn" appears once, mid-story: "That's why I yearned for you to come." It signals Thomas's agency in summoning Maren and distinguishes his call from accident. However, it's delivered as exposition rather than enacted—we don't see the yearning process. It sets up Maren's arrival but doesn't drive a major turn; the story would function nearly unchanged if Mrs. Weir had simply invited her. Setup present, middle role minimal, no closure participation. Functional but replaceable with "asked" or "called."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Bone setting is signaled in paragraph one (Maren's thirty-year career), reframed metaphorically in beat three ("Bone setting isn't just making straight what was broken. It's understanding how things fit together when they're not supposed to"), and enacted in the climax ("worked through the afternoon, arranging and rearranging the bones"). The method's mechanics matter: Maren's professional skill becomes the means of resolution. Cost: her certainty-based practice is transformed into mystical cartography. Setup, development, closure all present. Could score higher if the physical bone-setting were more procedurally detailed, but the metaphorical transformation is strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The secret garden behind the hedge maze provides the physical space for the ritual and supplies the constellation materials (moss, bones, flowers with star-maps). It "exhaled twilight even at noon," creating temporal dislocation that supports the crossing. The maze itself is a threshold Maren had "never noticed in all her years," implying hidden access. The garden's impossibility (crystalline flowers, bioluminescent patterns) validates the mystical work. Micro-setting: the moss Thomas sits on, the space where they arrange bones. Closure: the garden "bloomed its nostalgic innovation" in the final image. Setup, middle constraint (only here can the ritual work), and closure presence. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the substitute body is found" anchors the story's opening and provides the inciting mystery that shatters Maren's certainty. However, time within the garden sequence is vague—"afternoon" work becomes "evening light"—without tightening pressure. No ticking clock or deadline; the passage of time is atmospheric rather than tactical. Setup clear, but the timeframe doesn't constrain choices in the middle or shape closure beyond establishing the "after" state. Functional but not maximally pressurized.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To turn mistakes into constellations" is Thomas's stated goal ("The mistakes need names") and becomes the shared project with Maren. It drives the middle action (arranging bones, adding memory-objects) and shapes closure (the constellation glows, enables Thomas's return). The motivation is dramatized through on-page work rather than merely told. Cost: mistakes (wrong child, wrong world, substitute body) must be named and mapped before they can be resolved. Friction: Maren must abandon her certainty-based approach to engage. Setup, development (entire ritual sequence), and closure participation. Could score higher if Thomas's internal conflict about wanting to go home were more textured.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Nostalgic innovation operates throughout: crystalline flowers alongside "roses her grandmother might have planted," Thomas's ancient sorrow in a child's body, Maren's medical skill reframed as mystical practice, the closing image "where old magic and new understanding grew together." Tone modulates from clinical skepticism (paragraph one) to awed acceptance (garden discovery) to collaborative ritual (middle) to quiet resonance (ending). The tone charges the final image and coheres with the thematic stakes. It avoids static pastoral or pure fantasy by blending clinical precision with numinous imagery. Could score higher if the tonal tension between old and new were more explicitly pressurized in a middle choice.</comment>
