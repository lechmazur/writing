<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The loom spinner's interior life is established through concrete action (bleeding fingers, seven-day weaving) and embodied emotion (wistful hands, unshed tears). Her final sacrifice—giving "the essential warmth that had kept her breathing"—lands with weight. However, the motivation remains largely told rather than tested through contradictory impulses in scene; the choice to sacrifice herself unfolds without visible internal resistance or competing desires that would deepen characterization under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered images (puzzle edges, amber bead, raveling silence) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—the mother's death becomes the message's completion, an Earned Stasis with visible cost ("hands finally stilled," bead dimmed). Closure lands on the page with felt sacrifice. Orientation anchors appear late (orchard/bamboo/loom established only after the opening abstract passage), but the disorientation proves functional at closure when the spatial setting becomes the mother's final resting place, so the penalty is waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The forgotten orchard and bamboo forest frame the action, and the loom itself acts as micro-setting that constrains the weaving process. The puzzle pieces and amber bead are handled tactilely across beats. However, the spatial relationship between orchard and bamboo remains vague (are the apple trees within or adjacent to the forest?), and the environment functions more as backdrop than active constraint—nothing about the setting alters the spinner's tactical choices during the seven-day weave.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving daughter's village from sickness) is clear early. The seven-day weaving provides escalation through physical cost (bleeding fingers) and the amber bead's final dimming marks the price paid. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens through the "raveling silence" growing worse around her work. However, the protagonist's agency reads passive—she follows a discovered solution (the puzzle box) rather than making a difficult choice between competing goods; the weaving unfolds without tactical friction or meaningful risk of failure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice emerges concretely through the bead's exhausted light, the spinner's stilled hands, and the daughter's unexplained knowledge. The piece resists moralizing; the final image ("love, measured in thread and time") risks abstraction but is earned by prior particulars. The raveling silence as metaphor for time's unraveling deepens across beats. The ending offers resonant reconfiguration without stating a thesis, though "what mattered had survived" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance and lyrical cadence. Diction stays elevated but coherent ("wistful hands," "raveling silence," "latent sacrifice"). However, perceptual signature is thin—the spinner's noticing lacks character-specific bias, reading more as authorial lyricism than a weaver's particular way of seeing. The phrase "stoically sparkling" appears twice as description rather than enacted trait, and the final shift to the daughter's waking moment briefly slips focalization without clear section break.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structure and vivid images (amber "glowing with trapped sunlight," silence "knitting itself closed"). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "raveling silence" / "unraveling" recurs without added pressure; "stoically sparkling" is used identically twice; the final three paragraphs restate the message's success and the mother's completion in overlapping language. The phrase "through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" (title element) functions as throat-clearing rather than concrete image. Filter-verb stacks ("could hear," "would reach," "would wonder") appear in several beats without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The combination of loom-weaving, jigsaw puzzle edges as magical conduit, and amber bead sacrifice offers specific detail that avoids pure template. The image of threading cardboard teeth into warp is tactile and fresh. However, the core frame—aging artisan sends mystical warning to distant child through craft-magic—follows familiar folklore structure without sharp transformation. The "forgotten orchard" and "raveling silence" risk vague everywhere-setting. The puzzle box discovery beneath the tree arrives conveniently as solution rather than complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Wistful loom spinner is present throughout and makes the central choice to weave the message-pattern with her life force. She handles the puzzle edges and positions the amber bead (two beats), and her death completes the closure. However, "wistful" as attribute appears only in "wistful hands" (one mention) without constraining later choices; the character's decisions unfold without visible friction or competing impulses that the trait enables or costs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tree sap amber bead appears early (inheritance from mother), is positioned at the pattern's heart (middle beat), and dims at closure to mark the sacrifice's cost. It anchors three distinct beats and charges the final image. The bead's "stoically sparkling" light becomes the vehicle for transferred knowledge. Strong integration, though the bead could be replaced by another heirloom object (gemstone, coin) with minor edits to the light-transfer mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Raveling silence is mentioned repeatedly and thematically frames the world's unraveling, but it does not constrain the spinner's choices or alter her tactics on the page. The silence "began unraveling three seasons past" (backstory) and "grew worse" during the weaving, yet the spinner's seven-day process proceeds without the silence forcing adjustments. It functions as atmosphere and metaphor rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Stoically sparkling appears twice as description: once for the spinner's tears, once for the amber bead. Neither instance shows the attribute constraining or enabling a choice with cost. The phrase is ornamental—vivid but label-only. Removing it would not alter any beat's logic or outcome.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Recommence appears when the spinner returns to "the pattern she had abandoned in despair," marking a decisive turn from passivity to action. This beats triggers the seven-day weaving and integrates with the puzzle edges. However, the action is somewhat swappable ("resume," "begin again") and the text does not clarify what changed between abandonment and recommencement—the puzzle discovery enables the method, but the decision to restart reads as summary rather than dramatized shift.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Jigsaw puzzle edges are discovered in the wooden box (setup), threaded into the warp to anchor the message-weave (middle development), and referenced at closure ("last puzzle pieces lay scattered"). The method shapes the weaving's mechanics across two beats. However, the box is "found half-buried," a convenience arrival, and the text does not explain why edges (versus centers or other puzzle parts) enable the impossible sending—magic logic remains asserted rather than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest is established and returns in the final image. The oldest apple tree supplies the puzzle box discovery. However, the setting does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome—the spinner could perform this weaving in any isolated space. The bamboo "whispering" and orchard "glowing softly" at closure function as lyric backdrop rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry appears as thematic phrase framing the challenge of sending a message across distance and time. The seven-day weaving provides a temporal container. However, "time's unraveling" remains abstract—no ticking clock or deadline tightens the spinner's tactics, and the phrase recurs without functional escalation. The daughter will wake "miles away" after the work completes, but temporal pressure is asserted rather than felt.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>To carry a message across impossible distance is the explicit central motivation, signaled early and pursued through the weaving. The spinner's knowledge of remedies must reach her daughter's village before spring. This desire drives the plot and is tested through the seven-day ordeal and ultimate sacrifice. The friction between wanting to save the village and the cost (her own life) is present, though the choice unfolds without on-page hesitation or competing impulse.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Latent sacrifice is coherent throughout: the piece withholds overt violence, building toward the quiet giving-away of "the essential warmth" and the bead's dimming. Tone modulates from melancholy memory (daughter's laughter, rummage sale) to physical endurance (bleeding fingers) to final stillness. However, "latent" implies hidden cost that the ending makes explicit—the progression is smooth rather than revealing a previously concealed price, so the tone reads consistent rather than charged by surprise.</comment>
