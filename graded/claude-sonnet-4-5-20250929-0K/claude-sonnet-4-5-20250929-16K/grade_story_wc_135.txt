<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maris's motivation to restore the archive is clear and sustained, though her internal conflict remains muted—she never wavers or doubts the work itself. Her reactively visionary trait constrains tactics (waiting for spray conditions), but the emotional stakes of exile are told rather than dramatized through on-page friction. The final choice to take the boat out herself shows agency, yet the cost feels minor; no established path is visibly foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maris demonstrates the method, others follow, and the harbor's relationship to the sea shifts from fear to navigation. The cost is felt (she risks herself on uncertain routes) and the accumulative lens holds—fragments of vision coalesce into practical maps. Orientation is clean by paragraph two. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the valve represents three kinds of knowledge, reweighting her approach mid-story.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor after rain is vividly anchored with sensory specificity: limestone cliffs weeping, salt-taste air, spray at dawn and high tide. The environment constrains Maris's observation windows (she must wait for spray conditions) and the herald's valve, mounted in the tower at closure, charges the final image. Micro-setting (tower instruments, spray patterns) shapes her method and validates the 9+ gate for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring navigational knowledge to re-empower the fishermen—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maris connects the valve's three ports to knowledge types, deepening her method. The final escalation (taking the boat out herself) narrows options under accumulative pressure. However, the cost remains abstract; no prior tactic is explicitly abandoned or traded away, and the fishermen's skepticism dissolves too cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the sea as palimpsest, knowledge as adaptive practice, and the herald's valve as instrument of transformation rather than preservation. The final image—valve singing in the wind—offers a non-literal answer to how broken systems regain purpose. "The spaces between their notes" resonates without stating a moral. The only slip is minor overstatement ("living practice that could adapt"), but it doesn't flatten the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and lyric, with a distinct perceptual signature: "navigated absences, the cartography of what was no longer there." Distance remains stable in close third; no head-hopping. The single line of dialogue ("The sea hasn't abandoned you...") feels slightly elevated but plausibly in-character for a woman of authority delivering reconstructed wisdom. Register occasionally drifts toward the abstract ("the authority of her visions"), though it does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied and information-dense, with minimal scaffold. "Reactively visionary" and the staggered-interval method are compressed efficiently. However, figurative density in the opening ("air tasted of salt and forgiveness," "foam that dissolves on rocks," "cartography of what was no longer there") clusters without pattern-teaching, risking overwriting. One paraphrase loop: "the old routes" echoed across paragraphs without advancing pressure. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ocean-spray archivist and reactively visionary constraint offer fresh angles on the "restore lost knowledge" template. The herald's valve as tri-port metaphor is specific and memorable. However, the core arc—exiled expert returns, deciphers mystery, demonstrates solution, community follows—follows a familiar beat. Transformation is present but modest; removing "spray visions" and substituting another divinatory method would leave the emotional stakes largely intact.</comment>
