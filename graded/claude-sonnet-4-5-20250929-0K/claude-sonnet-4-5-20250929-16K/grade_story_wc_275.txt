<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's shift from rejection to teaching is earned through her father's gesture with the weapon, creating a credible arc. Interiority is character-specific ("engraved quiet," the way she reads violence in shadows) and embodied through her work with the roses. The father's internal conflict is less developed but his final choice—kneeling to learn—feels motivated by the weight of accumulated observation. Minor weakness: the roses "leaning away" risks anthropomorphic convenience, though it serves the perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis plus micro-turn: the father's choice to learn gentleness forecloses his former path with visible cost (he kneels, the killer becoming student). The piece holds an Accumulative/Textural lens through imagery and pattern (canvas scraps, repeated "engraved quiet," the dome's atmosphere) that culminates in the final image of roses learning alongside them. Orientation is clean by ~80 words. One escalation beat (the hand moving to the knife, then sheathing it) tightens the dominant stake (can violence transform into care?). Cost is legible in the father's posture and role reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The glass dome functions as micro-setting, constraining atmosphere and pressuring the father's restlessness ("disturbing the roses"). Spatial choreography is clear: entrance, rows of roses, kneeling positions. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—amber light, dust, leather creak, sand texture—filtered through Mara's perceptual bias. The dome's "tranquil blaze" charges the final image. The post-tower wasteland anchors timeframe and stakes without over-explaining. The ballast canvas as handled object (pressed into soil, handed to the father) bridges setting and action effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teaching resilience/continuity vs. inherited violence) is signaled early and sustained. The father's hand on his weapon creates immediate pressure; his move to the knife is the key reversal, and his choice to sheathe and ask to learn narrows options with visible cost (identity shift from killer to student). The piece operates under Accumulative pressure, deepening rather than multiplying turns, which fits the length. The cost is felt but not maximally visceral; the final image charges meaning more than it enacts sacrifice, keeping this shy of 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (weaving continuity through chaos, embedding values in living systems) emerges organically from the roses, canvas scraps, and the father's shift without stated moralizing. The final image—"roses leaned toward them both, learning"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in the father's gesture with the knife, the plants' response, and Mara's method ("sounded absurd when spoken aloud" acknowledges but doesn't undercut). The piece resists tidy binaries: the father's violence is neither redeemed nor condemned, only met with an invitation to transform. Minor slip: "Someone has to remember" skirts didacticism but stays anchored in Mara's action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Mara's perceptual signature (reading violence in shadows, tasting dust storms). Dialogue is sparse, natural, goal-driven, and advances plot; the father's "Show me" and Mara's instruction carry subtext and shift the dynamic. Diction is controlled and consistent with voice ("engraved quiet," "tranquil blaze"). Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated ("she could feel," "she heard"). Minor convergence: "the gesture was small, but...it felt enormous" leans slightly explanatory rather than trusting the image alone. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with the father's arrival and final choice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Clarity is strong overall. Two deductions: "That particular quality of fierce peace she'd created here" is over-explained where "tranquil blaze" already carried the effect (−0.3 for minor scaffold). "Harvested" as metaphor for killing is apt but "what you want to grow instead of what you've harvested" risks slight on-the-nose thematic phrasing in a high-stakes beat (−0.2). No loops or template cadence; figurative language is generally controlled. Sentence openings vary well.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting, generational violence, and botanical care as moral practice feels specific and non-obvious. The method (inculcating plants with values via salvaged materials and intention) is fresh and commits fully to its premise. Emotional truth anchors the transformation: the father's kneeling is earned, not sentimental. The "tower fell" world-building is economical and avoids cliché wasteland tropes. Minor limitation: the bounty-hunter-to-gardener arc is a recognizable redemption template, though the execution through roses and canvas scraps offers enough particularity to lift it solidly above derivative work.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (pacifist daughter) is present from the opening, drives the refusal ("I don't"), and her choice to teach her father creates the closure turn. Her pacifism is enacted through rose cultivation and the instruction to "think about what you want to grow." The final image depends on her agency. Strong causal involvement, early setup, and closure linkage. Cost is visible in her tears and the risk of inviting violence into her sanctuary.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ballast canvas scraps appear in three beats: Mara pressing fabric into soil (early), handing a scrap to her father (middle instruction), and his pressing it down (closure beat). The object's backstory (merchants' routes, cargo manifests) charges its symbolic weight and ties to the "weaving continuity" stake. Specificity is high; the material's origin and texture matter. Strong setup, development, and payoff; irreplaceable within the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Engraved quiet" is introduced early ("that engraved quiet she'd cultivated") and shapes Mara's stance throughout; it recurs in "this pocket of engraved quiet" near the end, reweighting the father's learning as a form of stillness carved from violence. The concept constrains tactics (her refusal to engage with his weapon logic) and charges the final image (quiet as presence, not absence). Lyric reprise functions well. Not indispensable—story could function with "cultivated peace"—but deeply integrated.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Senselessly perceptive" is labeled early and demonstrated twice: Mara reading violence in shadow angles and tasting tomorrow's dust storm. The trait enables her refusal ("The plants know") and underwrites her teaching method. Cost is implicit (her isolation, the father's incomprehension). Functional but not indispensable; the story's causality does not hinge on this exact phrasing. Mid-band for one clear payoff and thematic resonance without structural necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sheathing of the knife is the story's pivot: the father's hand moves to the blade (threat/test), pauses with "weight measured in memory," then deliberately sheathes it, and immediately asks to learn. This reversal is the closure's hinge. Present at the climax, causally irreplaceable, and charged with symbolic cost (renouncing violence). Removing this exact action collapses the arc. Strong setup (holster creak earlier) and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Inculcating plants with values" is introduced early ("I'm teaching them resilience"), elaborated mid-story ("whispering principles into seeds"), and enacted at closure when Mara instructs her father to "think about what you want to grow." The method is specific, absurd-sounding yet treated seriously, and shapes the final image (roses learning). It drives two beats and the ending. Strong integration; the story's logic depends on this exact practice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass dome is present in the opening image, constrains the father's restlessness ("disturbing the roses"), and appears in the final beat ("The dome glowed"). The enclosure creates the "carefully balanced atmosphere" that pressures the father's violence and enables Mara's controlled environment. It's both literal setting and symbolic boundary. Essential to the stakes (sanctuary vs. wasteland) and closure image. Strong setup, pressure role, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the tower fell" anchors the story's premise early, contextualizes the wasteland and Mara's scattering commentary, and provides the debris that supplies the ballast canvas. The timeframe is not a live clock but a condition that defines the stakes (chaos requiring continuity). Present in setup and thematic closure but does not tighten tactical decisions beat-to-beat. Functional background more than driver; lyric reprise in the final paragraph's "debris from the fallen tower" adds resonance but not urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to weave continuity through chaos" is articulated mid-story and dramatized in her actions: pressing canvas into soil, instructing her father, and the closing image of "weaving green continuity from chaos and canvas scraps." The motivation creates friction (her solitude, the father's incomprehension, the absurdity she acknowledges) and shapes the closure. Cost is visible in her isolation and the risk of teaching violence-doers. Strong thematic and causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is introduced mid-story ("the dome's tranquil blaze") and modulates the father's gesture from threat to transformation. The oxymoron tone—fierce peace, quiet intensity—coheres through the piece and charges the final image ("The dome glowed"). Tone reflects the stakes (gentleness under threat) and supports the closure without being static. Not structurally indispensable but purposeful and consistent. Strong atmospheric integration.</comment>
