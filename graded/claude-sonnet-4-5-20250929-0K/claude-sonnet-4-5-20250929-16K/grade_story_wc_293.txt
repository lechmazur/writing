<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maria's motivation is clear and her observational trait is consistent, but her internal conflict remains largely abstract—she processes the mystery through professional metaphor rather than embodied struggle. The decision to "bear witness" feels like a natural extension of her existing practice rather than a choice with visible cost. Her emotional progression from observant professionalism to "luminous disbelief" is told more than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The hitchhiker remains a cipher, preventing relationship pressure from forming.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Maria's final fiddle note and commitment to "bear witness" crystallizes her stance with the felt cost of assuming responsibility for the disappeared. Causality holds: glass flake → discovery → investigation → resolve to act. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the names are "pixelated amnesty." The piece teaches its lyric-laden pattern early and maintains it, though the conceptual cost remains somewhat oblique—we see her choose to sing their names but not what she must sacrifice to do so.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mountain pullout, scaffolding, and fluttering wrap constrain Maria's discovery—she must scramble down, wait for wind, and recognize that photos won't capture the secret. The micro-setting (her fiddle case, the thermal updrafts, the green mesh) charges the final image when she places the glass flake beside her rosin. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "pine needles sliding under her boots," "thermal updrafts," "reflective silver." The spatial choreography of her descent and the wrap's behavior under wind are coherent and essential to the revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—witnessing and recounting the disappeared—is signaled early and Maria's agency (descending, photographing, choosing to add a verse) drives the progression. However, the escalation is more textural than pressured: she encounters no resistance, no cost to her scramble, no trade-off in her choice. The "secret" reveals itself cooperatively once she's in position. The final commitment to bear witness feels significant thematically but lacks a visible sacrifice or foreclosed path—what does she give up or risk by adding this verse tonight?</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: bridge-songs as metaphor for impossible crossings, the glass flake as proof of time's porosity, names on wind as witness. "Pixelated amnesty" and "sculpting possibility from the ashes of 'never'" operate through the action of discovery and Maria's professional practice rather than abstract statement. The final image—a single suspended note answered by harmonics—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether the disappeared truly crossed over. Minor slip: "that particular feeling when reality reveals itself" edges toward meta-commentary in the penultimate section.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable throughout; Maria's perceptual signature (musician's ear, bridge-focused metaphors, "dynamically observant") is consistent and specific. Diction stays within her idiom: "bow slack," "thermal updrafts," "bridge tone." The hitchhiker's direct speech ("Some secrets are only visible when the wind catches the wrap just right") feels slightly elevated for casual conversation but serves the mystery effectively. Psychic distance is controlled; free indirect style is clean. Voice modulates purposefully from professional observation to wonder without breaking texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor pattern artifacts: "about the woman... / About the names... / About amnesty..." in the penultimate section reads as anaphora but edges toward list structure. "Suffused with luminous disbelief" and "dynamically observant" feel slightly elevated for the POV under stress. The phrase "pixelated amnesty... forgiveness broken into fragments" performs a explain-the-metaphor move mid-discovery that slows momentum. No loops or major scaffolding; clarity and concision are strong overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of collodion photography, bridge-songs, and liminal disappearance feels fresh and purposeful. The "secret mapped by scaffold wrap flutters" is a genuinely novel revelation mechanism tied to Maria's observation skills. However, the emotional arc—skeptic encounters mystery, chooses to believe and act—follows a familiar template. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids hedging, but the final choice (adding a verse, bearing witness) offers comfort rather than a harder moral calculus. Transformation is present but the stakes remain primarily conceptual.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maria's choice to descend, investigate, and commit to bearing witness drives the key turns. Her observation enables discovery, her decision to photograph (though it fails) shows agency, and her final act of placing the glass flake in her case and resolving to add a verse creates the closure. Present in setup, development, and payoff; drives two beats (descent/discovery, final resolve) with causal pressure. Not indispensable—another witness-type character could perform similar functions—but well-integrated.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass flake appears in beat one (discovery on seat), returns in beat two (she peers through it to see the old photo), and reappears in the final image (placed in fiddle case). Its specific property—embedding a collodion image—provides the proof and motivation Maria needs. It constrains her interpretation (this has happened before) and charges the closure by becoming a talisman she'll carry forward. Strong setup, clear development, meaningful payoff; near-essential but theoretically another proof-object could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Pixelated amnesty" is named and explained mid-story ("forgiveness broken into fragments, scattered across time and space") and shapes Maria's understanding of what the names represent. However, it functions primarily as thematic labeling rather than altering her tactics or creating cost. The concept of amnesty/forgiveness doesn't constrain her choices—she would likely bear witness to "disappeared people" regardless of whether it's framed as amnesty. Functional but replaceable with "scattered memory" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Maria's dynamic observation is demonstrated in the opening (reading tourists' faces) and enables the key discovery (noticing the scaffold wrap, seeing the marks when wind pulls taut). The trait is shown through action rather than label-only. However, it doesn't create visible cost or trade-off—her observation is purely beneficial. Present in setup and development, participates in closure by extension (her skill enabled what she'll now sing about), but lacks the friction or price that would elevate it further.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Recount" drives the core action: Maria recounts the names aloud mid-discovery ("her voice falling into the rhythmic cadence she used when singing bridge-songs") and resolves to recount their crossing through song at the ending. This action defines both the discovery beat and the closure commitment; the story's final third explicitly frames her role as one who will "recount their crossing in the old way." Removing "recount" would require fundamental rewrite of her profession and final choice. Strong causal and closure integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The scaffold-wrap-flutter mechanism is introduced early (hitchhiker's clue), discovered mid-story (Maria sees marks only when wind pulls mesh taut), and its properties constrain her actions (she must wait for the right angle, photos don't work). The method shapes tactics (timing her observation, accepting she can't capture it digitally) and charges the theme (ephemeral witness, wind-carried names). Present in all three gates, drives two beats, provides unique constraint. Nearly essential—the story's core mystery depends on this exact mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The mountain pullout frames the opening and provides the spatial anchor for descent. The specific geography (fifty feet down, thermal updrafts, pine needles) affects Maria's actions and enables the discovery. However, the pullout itself is somewhat generic—any elevated mountain stop with a hidden structure below could function similarly. The setting participates in setup and development but doesn't uniquely charge the closure; Maria could resolve to sing at "Canyon Bridge" from any location. Solid functional integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the hitchhiker vanishes" is signaled clearly in the opening ("Fifteen minutes ago, the hitchhiker had been there") and structures the investigation as reactive/responsive. However, time doesn't create pressure—there's no urgency, no deadline, no cost to Maria taking her time. The "tonight" at the ending provides a near-future anchor but doesn't tighten decisions. Functional for orientation but doesn't shape tactics or escalate stakes. Present in setup and implied at closure, but replaceable with any post-event frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maria's motivation to "sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'" is articulated mid-story and frames her professional identity (bridge-songs about impossible crossings). It drives her final choice to bear witness and add a verse. However, the motivation is more explained than dramatized through conflicting costs—she wants to believe and act, and the story allows her to do so without friction. Present in development and payoff, shapes the ending, but lacks the on-page struggle between competing wants that would elevate it to essential.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Luminous disbelief" is named once ("suffused with luminous disbelief") and the tone of wonder-amid-mystery is sustained throughout via diction ("harmonics," "suspended," "fluttering") and imagery (glass catching light, names rippling). The tone modulates appropriately from professional assessment to mystical acceptance and charges the final image (the note and harmonic reply). However, the single explicit naming feels like a thematic check-in rather than organic voice. Coherent across turns, participates in closure, but not indispensable—a similar reverent-mystery tone could achieve the same effect.</comment>
