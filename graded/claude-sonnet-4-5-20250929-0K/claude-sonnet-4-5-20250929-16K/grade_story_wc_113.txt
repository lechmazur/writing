<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Celeste's interiority is concrete and the journey from musician to inheritor of silent language is legible. However, the "lately inspired" trait functions as a label rather than shaping on-page choices under pressure. The final decision to "disrupt everything" feels declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the character moves smoothly toward embrace without visible internal friction. The embodied moment of plunging hands into water works well, but peak beats lean on therapy-adjacent phrasing ("inspired by dreams," "lately dormant creativity") that dilutes specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through discovery beats, and closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the journal discovery reweights Celeste's creative stance. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (flooded orchestra pit, violin case, three days post-flood). The cost, however, remains conceptual—"would disrupt everything"—without an on-page action or forfeiture that forecloses a path; the ending crystallizes intent but the price is deferred. One meaningful tightening occurs (program → map → discovery), sufficient for this length, though the mechanics feel guided rather than earned through protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is vividly rendered with water at knee-height, flickering lanterns, and submerged stage. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: pit → podium → music stand → floorboard gap. The environment pressures one key choice (plunging into murky water) and charges the final image (water lapping, lanterns settling). Sensory selection is strong early but becomes generic in the final paragraph ("water lapping gently," "steady flames"). The micro-setting (the pit itself, the gap between floorboards) successfully functions as setting that constrains discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering Magdalena's code—is signaled early and pursued cleanly. One meaningful tightening occurs (discovering the circle marks her exact location), narrowing options and driving the plunge decision. However, the escalation relies on coincidence (the program floats to her, the circle marks where she stands) rather than protagonist tactics under pressure. The cost of embracing silent music is declared but not tested; no live option is foreclosed on the page. The "wordless conversation" completes without friction or trade-off, leaving stakes abstract at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of in-between spaces—musician neither soloist nor audience, music residing in silence—emerges organically from Celeste's pit position and Magdalena's notation. The final image (water meeting air, silence meeting sound) reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the thematic statement "music's true nature: that it lived not in the striking of strings…but in the charged emptiness between them" borders on thesis articulation. The epiphany feels asserted rather than earned through struggle; Celeste accepts the journal without internal resistance, leaving complexity underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries character-specific perception ("in-between space where she'd spent fifteen years playing second violin") and registers Celeste's professional idiom. The perceptual signature—focus on musical notation, rests, liminal moments—is distinct and purposeful. Slight drift occurs in the closure paragraph where elevated diction ("charged emptiness," "something new would begin") feels slightly detached from prior texture. No head-hopping, clean mechanics, and filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with strong momentum through discovery beats. Information density is high: each object (program, lantern, journal) advances both plot and atmosphere. However, template cadence appears in the closure: three successive "she would" constructions followed by parallel abstract phrases ("disrupt everything," "learn Magdalena's silent language"). The phrase "lately inspired by dreams of half-remembered melodies" in paragraph one is scaffolding that paraphrases the stated concept. Minor paraphrase loop: "wordless conversation" appears twice in final two paragraphs without reweighting. No filter-verb stacks or major clarity issues; deductions remain non-closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The flooded opera house and ghostly musical code offer a fresh synthesis. The water-damage-as-cipher mechanism is specific and purposeful. However, the emotional arc—musician discovers mentor's hidden work and embraces it—follows a recognizable template without transformation. The "ghost left code for someone who understands in-between spaces" premise reads as wish-fulfillment; Celeste's acceptance is frictionless. The final image reweights prior material but feels inevitable from paragraph two, reducing dramatic surprise. Derivative premise adjustment applied for template closeness without sufficient lived-detail transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Celeste (orchestra pit musician) shapes the discovery sequence through observation and one key physical choice (plunging hands into water). Present in all three gates: setup (violinist in pit), development (traces patterns on program), payoff (retrieves journal). However, most beats are observational; only the water-plunge constitutes a decision that alters tactics. The trait "second violin" colors perception but does not create friction or constrain options. Mid-band for functional presence across beats with limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The antique opera program appears in three distinct beats: retrieval from water, lantern examination revealing patterns, and its use as a map. Early signal (paragraph two), development (decoding images), and payoff (map directs the search). The object's water-damaged state is irreplaceable; no generic map would provide the same causal chain. It constrains choice by marking the exact location and charges the middle sequence. Specific cost: Celeste must interpret ambiguous symbols, narrowing her search. Strong integration across beats and ending participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"In between spaces" is established early (pit position, second violin, rehearsal-to-performance) and shapes Celeste's perceptual filter. The concept drives the middle beat (notes "residing where silence should live") and closure linkage (water/air, silence/sound meeting). However, it functions more as thematic lens than tactical constraint; Celeste's choices are not narrowed by her liminal status, she simply recognizes it. Present in setup, development, and payoff, but causal pressure is oblique. Mid-to-high band for shaping interpretation without altering on-page options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Lately inspired" appears once as motivation in paragraph one ("lately inspired by dreams"). The trait explains her return to the condemned building but does not constrain or enable on-page action with visible cost. It functions as backstory label rather than present pressure. Missing development and payoff gates; no middle choice is shaped by dormant creativity being rekindled. Ornamental use that could be omitted without altering the discovery sequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Disrupt" appears at closure ("would disrupt everything she thought she knew about music") as declared intent. The action is thematically apt but arrives only in the final paragraph as summary of future consequence, not dramatized choice. Missing setup and development gates; no earlier beat shows Celeste disrupting conventional notation or practice. Lyric reprise (concept introduced and paid off at ending) provides thematic resonance, but the action itself is not enacted on the page. Mid-band for thematic coherence with deferred execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Water damage creating images is signaled early (paragraph three: "water damage had created images…ghostly shapes bleeding through"), developed in the middle (patterns resembling musical notation, center-page map formed by concentrated ink), and directly enables the payoff (map reveals location). The mechanics matter: moisture meeting aged ink produces the code. Specific and irreplaceable; conventional ink-on-paper would not provide the cipher. Causal pressure across two beats and closure linkage. Strong integration with visible necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Flooded opera house lit by flickering lanterns is established in paragraph one, pressures the search (wading knee-deep, murky water obscuring the floor), supplies the discovery resource (gap between floorboards found by touch in dark water), and charges the final image (water lapping, lanterns settling into steady flames). Early signal, development (lantern flames bend, creating urgency), and payoff (environment stabilizes as "something new would begin"). Spatial constraint (submerged pit) and atmospheric tool (lanterns) both shape tactics. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Amid the hush of unstruck chords" appears as tone/atmosphere in paragraphs four and eight ("amid the hush of unstruck chords" twice). The phrase does not function as a ticking clock or timeline constraint; it describes a quality of silence rather than temporal pressure. No setup showing Celeste working within a time window, no development where elapsed time narrows options. Present thematically but does not tighten decisions. Replaceable with similar musical-silence phrasing without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation to unravel the ghost's code is signaled early (paragraph one: drawn back by half-remembered melodies; paragraph four: recognizing Magdalena left something behind) and pursued through two beats (decoding program images, following the map). Dramatized via physical search rather than told-only. However, the desire faces no friction or competing cost; Celeste moves smoothly from discovery to embrace without internal conflict. Shapes one key turn (plunge into water) and contributes to ending, but lacks the friction between wants and costs that would elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Wordless conversation" is established in paragraph four ("a wordless conversation starting in the air") and reprised at closure ("The wordless conversation was complete"). Tone modulates from eerie discovery (lanterns bending, presence felt) to settled resolution (lanterns steady, house breathing). Coherent through turns and charges the final image by bookending the exchange. However, the tone remains somewhat static—reverent and hushed throughout—without sharper modulation under pressure. Lyric reprise reweights meaning, lifting the score to mid-band despite limited tonal range.</comment>
