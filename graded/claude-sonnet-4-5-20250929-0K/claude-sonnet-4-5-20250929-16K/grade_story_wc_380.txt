<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, but her interior life relies heavily on summary rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The grandmother's dementia is told efficiently but remains abstract until the pressed-wildflowers moment. Her shift from observation to exhumation is earned, yet the final recovery feels smooth—no micro-choice reveals competing impulses or the cost of success. The work is strong but lacks the contradictory layering required for the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the whale → pockets → crystal chamber → coffee grounds → recovery sequence builds density and reaches a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly by the second paragraph. The final image—"Each one proved that nothing was ever truly gone"—reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost (the work is "slow, silent, and gleaming"), though the felt price remains oblique. One meaningful deepening (from touching pockets to stabilizing and reading them) is present, satisfying the lens requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber, dock lanterns, and coffee grounds are vivid and selective, with sensory hierarchy filtered through Maren's patient, methodical POV. The chamber constrains her method (mineral saturation stabilizes pockets) and charges the final image ("searching for stars reflected in dark water"). Spatial choreography is clean across locations. The whale itself functions as both setting and concept anchor, grounding the fantastical premise in tactile, barnacled specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering her grandmother's lost memories—is signaled early and tightens through the sequence: first touch → deletion → chamber stabilization → pattern-reading → successful recovery. The pressed-wildflowers match is a meaningful deepening that narrows her method and enables the climax. Agency is clear (Maren's patient observation and requisitioning), and the final recovery forecloses the path of accepting loss. The cost is conceptual ("slow, silent" work) rather than visceral, which holds the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—preservation, the physics of grief, memory as redistributed rather than deleted—emerges organically from the whale, pockets, and crystal-growing metaphor without stated moralizing. The pressed wildflowers seed the thematic question early and return with reweighted meaning at closure. The final image ("searching for stars reflected in dark water") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the closing paragraph edges toward summary ("Each one proved...") and explains theme rather than trusting the image alone, preventing entry to the 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited is stable and apt; perceptual signature is consistent (Maren's "practiced silence," methodical patience). Diction is controlled and slightly elevated ("gleaming silence," "exhume," "topographical charts") but remains character-plausible for someone who lights lanterns and works in a marine lab. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The phrase "gleaming silence" recurs purposefully to unify tone. Distance modulates appropriately with emotional beats (the grandmother's vanishing decades, the recovery flood). Elision of the scientists' work is efficient and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with strong specificity ("barnacled body," "salt crystal growing chamber," "coffee grounds forming a perfect match"). However, the phrase "gleaming silence" appears four times, and "deleted," "evaporate," "disappeared" cluster in the dementia passage without sufficient variance. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the recovery work ("Each recovered memory crystallized and held"), flattening momentum at closure. Information density is high elsewhere, but the closing beat needed one concrete image instead of abstract confirmation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core synthesis—whales as memory vessels, gravity pockets as repositories, coffee grounds as maps—is fresh and commits fully to its fantastical logic. The salt-crystal chamber and pressed wildflowers ground the concept in tactile specificity. However, the "deleted memories redistributed" premise echoes common grief-fantasy templates (lost things waiting to be found), and the resolution is tidy: Maren succeeds without a failed attempt or trade-off that would deepen the premise's moral calculus. The piece transforms familiar material but does not push into bold, non-obvious territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren (dock-side lantern lighter) is present throughout and drives key turns: touching the first pocket, understanding the whale's role, requisitioning the chamber, and recovering the wildflower memory. Her occupation frames her patient, ritual-driven approach and seeds the "lighting the way home" closure image. However, the lantern-lighting itself is mentioned but not shown constraining a choice or shaping a middle beat; it functions more as character texture than causal lever. Two gates clear (setup, payoff); middle development is implied but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressed wildflowers appear in three beats: the grandmother's teaching (backstory anchor), Maren bringing them to the chamber and noticing the pattern match (enables the recovery method), and the successful memory retrieval (closure). The flowers' spiral pattern becomes the gravitational signature, making them causally indispensable. They carry visible cost (the loss of that shared afternoon motivated the entire search) and charge the final recovery. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff; one step below indispensable because the story could pivot to another keepsake with moderate structural edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pockets of gravity shape every major beat: the inciting touch and memory deletion, the whale as vessel, the challenge of stabilization, the method of reading via distortion, and the final recovery. The concept defines the story's physics, stakes, and tactics. Removing it collapses the entire narrative. The pockets' "fluctuating gravity" enables the coffee-ground map method and the metaphor of memories "drifting" in gravity wells. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability are all maximal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Fluctuates mysteriously" describes the pockets' behavior and enables the coffee-ground mapping method (the grounds respond to invisible gravitational architecture). It appears in the opening beat and returns when Maren lets "fluctuating gravity pull at her consciousness" during recovery. However, the fluctuation itself does not visibly constrain a choice or impose a cost; it functions as atmospheric detail and method-enabler rather than a pressure point. Two gates (setup, payoff) with modest causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Exhume" appears as the verb for Maren's goal ("to exhume what lay buried") and names the recovery action at closure. The word choice frames memory work as archaeological and careful, aligning with her methodical character. It drives the chamber setup and the final successful retrieval. However, the actual exhumation is summarized rather than dramatized beat-by-beat, and "recover" could substitute with minor tonal loss. Strong presence across setup, middle framing, and closure; one step below indispensable due to swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Coffee grounds appear in one morning epiphany ("patterns form in my coffee grounds"), are brought to the chamber, go "wild" creating maps, and become the topographical key to matching memories. The method is signaled at ~50% and enables the climactic recovery. However, its mechanics are asserted rather than tested; we do not see Maren fail with another substance or iterate on the method. Two gates clear (introduction, payoff); middle development is thin. The method is specific and necessary but arrives late and resolves quickly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The salt crystal growing chamber provides the "unique atmosphere" (mineral saturation) that stabilizes the pockets, enabling all subsequent work. It appears in setup (requisitioned), middle (becomes Maren's workspace), and closure (where recovery occurs and the final image is set). The chamber's "impossible geometries" and "gleaming silence" charge the setting and tie to theme. Removing it forces a different stabilization mechanism and collapses the spatial anchor for the ending. Strong integration; one step below indispensable because another controlled environment could substitute with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The whale beaches "on a Tuesday" and the timeframe proceeds through "seventeen years" of lantern-lighting, the scientists' arrival, "last spring" (grandmother's death), "weeks of patient observation," and "each night" recovery work. Time structures the accumulation but does not tighten decisions; there is no countdown or urgency. The "after the whale beaches" frame is setup-only and does not return with pressure at closure. One gate (setup) with atmospheric presence but no tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren's motivation—to find where her grandmother's deleted memories went—is dramatized through the dementia passage, the pressed-wildflowers anchor, and the climactic recovery. The desire drives her nightly returns, chamber work, and pattern-reading. Cost is present (grief, patient labor, the "slow, silent" nature of the work) and the final recovery validates the search. However, there is no on-page friction between wanting recovery and fearing what it might cost or reveal; the path is patient but uncontested. Three gates with strong causal pressure; one element of dramatic friction missing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Gleaming silence" recurs four times, anchoring tone from the whale's surroundings through the chamber work to the final image. The phrase unifies the story's meditative, patient register and modulates appropriately (awe at the pockets, focus during mapping, reverence at recovery). It charges the closure line ("searching for stars reflected in dark water"). However, repetition without variation flattens rather than deepens; the phrase is used identically each time. Strong coherence and closure linkage; moderate escalation of meaning.</comment>
