<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's interiority is present but operates at a single register throughout—contemplative, poetic—without meaningful internal contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. The climactic choice to chart territory feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle; we witness her understanding but not the cost of renouncing escape. Micro-choices exist (walking past creatures, holding the sundial) but don't reveal a hierarchy of conflicting values with visible stakes. The reincarnation backstory anchors present stance adequately but the transformation from "brittle awakenings" to independence reads as declarative summary rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Situational lens—Kael navigating the library's constraints toward stance crystallization. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening paragraph. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: Kael places the sundial and begins charting territory, reframing isolation as chosen coexistence. However, the cost remains largely implied rather than viscerally legible on the page; the "finally learning to breathe" reads more like thematic echo than felt consequence. The tightening is present (avoiding cartography → confronting it) but the stakes of that confrontation dissolve quickly into metaphorical resolution without a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift that narrows later options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Tidal Library setting is vivid and purposeful: atomically reflective floors, cloud tides that rearrange shelves, extinct species as co-inhabitants. The brass sundial and stone circle hum constrain navigation choices concretely. Sensory detail (photon reflections, compressed cloud-matter, golden clouds at dawn) is selective and anchored to Kael's survival needs. The cartography wing appearance and the sundial's shadow-pointing create spatial choreography that drives the final beat, lifting this above postcard description into functional pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and remains coherent. The tightening occurs when Kael confronts the cartography wing she'd been avoiding, a reversal of her evasion pattern. However, the escalation lacks concrete cost or trade-off; she stands firm during the tide and places the sundial, but no live option is visibly foreclosed and no tactical price paid. The resolution (choosing to remain and chart territory) feels more like philosophical acceptance than a decision that alters her capabilities or relationships with visible consequence scaled to the scene's pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—coexistence, second chances, choosing sanctuary over escape—emerges through imagery (extinct species, drowning/breathing, tides) rather than statement. The brass sundial and map motifs recur with shifted meaning at closure. Yet the final paragraph edges toward overt moralizing ("independence wasn't about escaping...It was about choosing") that states the theme rather than letting the image do the work. The piece resists simplistic binaries and builds resonance from particulars (quagga rescue, thylacine howl), but the closing articulation undercuts the earned ambiguity with a too-neat thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is clean with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is poetic and consistent (photon reflections, brittle metaphors, museum-visit memories). Diction remains elevated throughout, which fits the otherworldly setting but doesn't modulate under rising pressure—the voice at crisis (first tide, nearly dissolving) sounds identical to the voice at contemplative opening. Psychic distance is stable. The prose carries a distinct textural rhythm (short declaratives, metaphoric fragments) that reads purposeful, though "brittle awakenings" as a repeated anchor becomes slightly mechanical by the third use.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several template-cadence runs appear: "Each day brought...that her old skills...that the books shifted...that time moved" and parallel "The hum was navigation, warning, and welcome." The phrase "brittle awakenings" recurs three times without evolving meaning until the final deployment. Figurative language is dense (fractures sharp enough to draw blood, bones breaking to reset, clouds like applause) but occasionally stacks without breathing room in high-concept beats, pushing toward overwriting. Clarity remains intact and no loops obscure causality, keeping this in the serviceable mid-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The Tidal Library as extinction archive and reincarnation waystation offers a fresh synthesis. Extinct species coexisting with the displaced, cloud tides rearranging knowledge, and atomically reflective navigation create specific world logic. However, the emotional arc (isolation → independence via acceptance) follows a familiar template, and the brass sundial as truth-pointer plus ancient stone circle hum read as conventional fantasy quest markers transposed into the setting. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids hedging, earning points for conceptual integrity, but doesn't transform the self-acceptance structure enough to feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael is a "contemporary of extinct species" via reincarnation. She observes thylacines, dodoes, great auks, and a quagga rescue; the quagga pulls her to safety during her first tide. This rescue creates one middle beat (survival) but Kael's choices at closure (placing the sundial, charting territory) do not trace to species interaction. Present throughout but the extinct creatures function more as atmospheric witnesses than drivers of her final decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The brass sundial appears in week two, is held and consulted multiple times (shadows reveal stable sections, used "by the hum" for navigation, carried to cartography wing), and is placed at the map's center in the final beat as a symbolic anchor for charting territory. Three distinct beats with evolving use (finding it, using it to navigate, placing it as a claim). Meets setup, development, and payoff gates. Drives the cartography-wing turn and participates in closure, though its properties (shadow-pointing to truth/stability) could be replaced by a similar device without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Brittle awakenings" frames the reincarnation shock, daily realizations of skill obsolescence, and the cartography confrontation. It recurs explicitly three times and implicitly structures the arc (fracture memories, bone-breaking resets, finally standing firm). Shapes tone and one middle choice (facing maps) but remains more thematic than tactical—it doesn't constrain options so much as label the emotional texture. Present in closure rhetoric but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "atomically reflective" floors capture and magnify light, and Kael learns to read them as maps (photon reflections carry information about structure and safe paths). This enables navigation and is mentioned in the closure beat ("stood firm on the atomically reflective floor"). However, no on-page action shows a visible cost or tactical trade-off tied specifically to the atomic property versus ordinary mirrors; it's described and used but not irreplaceable. Functional descriptor without demonstrated necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Coexist" is the story's emotional and thematic center: extinct species coexist in the library, Kael learns to coexist with her transformed self and past, and the climax is "choosing to coexist, choosing to build something new." The action defines the final stance and is woven through multiple beats (quagga interaction, species observations, final choice to remain). However, the coexistence itself is more acceptance than a contested action with on-page friction; swapping it for "adapt" or "integrate" would require only minor edits. Central but not mechanically irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The stone circle's hum is introduced early (ancient megaliths embedded in foundation), signals tide shifts, warns of danger, and teaches Kael to read reflective surfaces for navigation. It appears in at least three beats (dawn hum, learning navigation "by the hum," hum intensifies before final tide) and enables her survival tactics. The hum approves her map insight and marks the rising tide at closure. Signaled, developed, and present at ending, with causal role in her learning curve, though the mechanics remain somewhat abstract (hum → navigation knowledge) rather than a strict gating constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Tidal Library drives nearly every choice: cloud tides force climbing or vapor-swimming (Kael nearly dissolves, quagga rescues her), atomically reflective floors enable navigation, shelves shift and relocate knowledge, extinct species populate reading platforms, and the cartography wing holds the confrontation map. Kael's final decision to chart territory and remain is spatially anchored (standing on reflective floor, placing sundial at map center). The library's properties constrain survival tactics and supply the closure image. Essential across beats and ending; removing the specific setting would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the reincarnation memory awakened three months ago" anchors the present and explains Kael's knowledge state (she remembers drowning, knows she's transformed). The "three months" frames her learning curve (found sundial in week two, daily brittle awakenings). However, time within the on-page scene is vague—"today" begins the cartography visit, "the next tide was rising" adds slight urgency, but no live clock tightens decisions. The timeframe enables setup but doesn't pressure the final choice with a countdown or deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Kael's motivation—translating isolation into independence—is stated explicitly and dramatized through her trajectory: avoiding cartography (protecting isolation) → confronting it (seeking independence) → choosing to remain and chart territory (redefining independence as coexistence). The desire is tested in the cartography beat and resolved at closure. Friction exists between isolation's safety and independence's demand to face the map, though the cost of that confrontation dissolves quickly. The motivation drives structure and final stance but the internal conflict stays largely reflective rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
