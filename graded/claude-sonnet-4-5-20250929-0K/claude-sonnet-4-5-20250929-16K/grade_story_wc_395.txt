<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking digital traces of her brother through the archive. However, her internal life remains largely declarative rather than embodied under pressure. The final decision to write the extraction protocol feels inevitable given her role, but the moment lacks contradictory impulses or visible tradeoffs that would complicate the choice. The brother's backstory anchors present action effectively without exceeding length allowances.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (corporate memory keeper, EternaNet archive, present investigation). The piece follows a causal lens: Mira notices patterns → tracks deletion logs → discovers the preserved consciousness backups → decides to extract them. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes the astronauts are trapped in purgatory rather than deleted. Closure lands on-page with her decision to write the extraction protocol, though the felt cost remains implied rather than viscerally dramatized—we see determination but not the immediate price of defying her employer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The archive setting provides atmospheric detail (server clusters, deletion logs, cache sizes) but functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint. The patch is handled twice (wall, fingers) and charges the final image, qualifying as micro-setting. The digital environment doesn't materially narrow Mira's options—she accesses backdoors without friction. Spatial choreography remains abstract; we never feel the physicality of her workspace under investigative pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: find and recover the trapped consciousness backups. Pressure tightens once when Mira discovers the astronauts are contained rather than erased. Her decision to extract them is protagonist-driven but arrives without visible on-page friction—no supervisor confrontation, no system lockout, no immediate cost that alters her tactics. The lie to her supervisor is mentioned but not tested. One meaningful deepening (realization of purgatory state) but the final act lacks the trade-off or obstacle that would charge it further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: digital preservation versus corporate erasure, the ethics of trapped consciousness. The patch and recurring numbers create thematic resonance without over-signaling. However, the final paragraph edges toward statement—"deserved to be remembered" and "She would bring them home" feel closer to thesis than earned image. The story invites reflection on digital souls and institutional memory but the ending offers a promise rather than a non-literal reconfiguration of the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a consistent perceptual signature—Mira filters the archive through her archivist lens. Distance control is clean with no head-hopping. Voice carries purposeful compression in phrases like "the echo of forgotten songs" and "brightly attentive," teaching a lyric mode that supports the digital-archaeology atmosphere. Minor register drift occurs in "suffused with the sensed absence"—slightly elevated diction that edges beyond Mira's established voice under pressure but doesn't break clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean with varied syntax and good information density. "Brightly attentive" and "moving brightly across her keyboard" feel ornamental—the adverb doesn't add pressure or POV color. Minor template cadence in the investigation sequence: "She found breadcrumbs. A comment thread... A tagged photo... Then the numbers..." The pacing works but the parallel structure is mechanical. The final paragraph repeats "numbers pulsed" and "timestamp, coordinate, promise" in a way that edges toward summary. No major loops or artifacts that obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes digital archaeology, missing persons investigation, and consciousness backup in a specific way. However, the core "corporate conspiracy hiding experimental neural backups" setup is widely used in SF templates. The recurring numbers as coordinates is a fresh angle, and the "space they occupied" null-state concept adds specificity. The transformation is present but incremental—changing names and setting to another archive/conspiracy scenario would leave the emotional arc largely intact. The piece executes competently within genre conventions without bold structural or perspectival risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's role as memory keeper is signaled early and drives all key beats: noticing deletions, tracking patterns, accessing backdoors, deciding to extract. Her professional access enables the investigation and her final choice (writing the extraction protocol) flows directly from her keeper identity. The character constraint is clear—she must preserve rather than investigate, creating tension with her supervisor lie. Present across setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure and closure linkage, though the ending decision feels职业-predictable rather than irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The patch appears in three beats: pinned to cubicle wall (opening), Marcus Chen's photo (inciting discovery), and Mira handling it before the final search ("pulled from her wall, ran her fingers over"). It returns with reweighted meaning—from memorial to map—and the brother backstory ties it causally to Mira's motivation. The patch shapes her investigation target (Artemis-7 crew) and charges the final image ("guided by her brother's patch"). Strong integration across all three gates with specific causal and emotional weight, though one more tactical use in the middle investigation would elevate it further.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The missing persons cold case is the story's central engine: vanished astronaut profiles drive Mira's investigation, the deletion pattern creates the mystery, and discovering they're trapped (not deleted) is the key reversal. The concept shapes every tactic—tracking deletion logs, following breadcrumbs, searching for absence rather than presence. It appears in setup (Marcus Chen vanishing), development (pattern discovery), and payoff (finding the preserved null-state). The case structure narrows options and the resolution (extraction protocol) directly answers the central question. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive" appears twice as an adverbial modifier but doesn't constrain or enable specific choices with cost. The trait is asserted ("she'd become brightly attentive") and repeated at the ending ("fingers moving brightly") without dramatizing how this particular mode of attention differs from standard vigilance or creates a tradeoff. It functions as atmospheric color rather than a trait that alters tactics under pressure. Present in setup and payoff but ornamental—swappable with "keenly observant" or similar without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's lie to her supervisor ("optimizing archival compression ratios") is signaled clearly and enables her continued investigation, creating a tactical turn. However, it's mentioned once without return—no consequence, no escalation when she accesses forbidden logs, no risk dramatized at closure. The lie matters causally (she continues unimpeded) but doesn't shape the ending or carry visible cost. Present in development with causal function but not integrated into the closure beat, making it feel more like a convenience unlock than a defining action with price.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The recurring numbers (2-3-4-7) appear across multiple beats: timestamps, post IDs, file sizes, likes, cache sizes, server addresses, user ID fragments. The pattern drives Mira's investigation method—she follows the numbers deeper into the archive. The revelation that 2347 is a file extension for memory-transfer technology provides the causal key. Numbers pulse on her screen at closure as "timestamp, coordinate, promise," charging the final image. Signaled early, shapes tactics throughout, and participates in closure with specificity. Essential to the mystery structure and irreplaceable as the story's core investigative method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The social network archive is established early and provides the terrain for all action: deletion logs, server clusters, backdoors, cache data. The setting supplies resources (forgotten engineer paths, corrupted files) that enable Mira's search and the "server cluster that officially didn't exist" is the discovery location. The archive's structure shapes her tactics—searching absence rather than presence, moving through "neglected corners." Present across all three gates with causal pressure, though the digital environment remains somewhat abstract and doesn't physically constrain choices the way a locked door or failing system would.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" appears once as atmospheric description of the archive's neglected corners (abandoned playlists, unlistened podcasts). It provides texture and metaphoric weight but doesn't function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. The thirty-seven days of searching is the only temporal marker that tracks duration, and it's mentioned in summary without pressure. The "echo" phrase returns implicitly at closure ("all those forgotten songs finally finding their voice") but as thematic resonance rather than a time constraint altering tactics. Present but ornamental; easily replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to find where deleted files go" is articulated clearly in her interior monologue and shapes every choice: tracking vanished users, following deletion trails, searching for the "essence of a person's digital existence." The desire creates friction with her job description (preserve, not investigate) and her supervisor's expectations. The brother backstory dramatizes the personal cost driving this need. The motivation is tested across beats—each discovery deepens rather than satisfies it—and the final extraction protocol decision flows directly from this want. Essential, irreplaceable, and dramatized with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tone of "sensed absence" is established early ("users who didn't just go dormant, but vanished entirely") and sustained through "the echo of forgotten songs," "following the ghost-paths of deleted files," and "the space they occupied—a preserved null-state." The tone modulates appropriately, becoming more urgent as Mira discovers the astronauts are trapped rather than erased. It charges the final image: "these forgotten astronauts, trapped in the spaces between data, deserved to be remembered." Coherent across turns with purposeful intensification, though the ending edges toward assertion that slightly dilutes the atmospheric restraint maintained earlier.</comment>
