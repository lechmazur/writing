<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal contradiction between preservation-as-penance and preservation-as-celebration drives the arc. The "gently thorough" trait constrains her method but doesn't visibly cost her at the closure beat. Interiority is particular ("cathedral of the overlooked"), though the phrase "something between grief and exultation" at the opening reads slightly stock. The covenant transformation is earned by the locket's arrival and her embodied response at the jetty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph two. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira's decision to continue archiving transforms from penance to affirmation, foreclosing the mausoleum path with visible cost (she must now face her daughter's memory rather than hide). The walnut-ink ritual deepens the pattern, and the final image—carrying laughter home—reweights prior material. One meaningful tightening through the locket's reframing is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight constrains the choice: this specific location where ashes were scattered forces Mira to confront memory. The walnut ink (hulls, nails, time) functions as micro-setting that charges the final act. Sensory detail (salt, sweetness, roses) is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's professional lens. The tool—fountain pen and fresh ink—actively enables the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to continue preservation as penance or transform it. The locket's arrival is the reversal that narrows options; Mira's choice to write the card and wear the locket at the jetty tightens pressure under the accumulative lens. The cost—she must now face memory rather than avoid it—is legible in "steep herself in memory rather than hiding from it." One meaningful deepening is sufficient here, though the shift feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the walnut-ink particulars: permanence through oxidation mirrors the covenant shift. The closing card text ("because they're how we recognize we've been alive") answers the central question without stating a moral. "Haunted and euphoric, both permanent and fleeting" risks slight abstraction but is anchored in the roses and the locket. The archive-as-mausoleum vs. sanctuary tension generates complexity without resolving into a tidy binary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds stable; perceptual signature (walnut ink darkening vs. modern inks' "brittle ghosts") is character-specific. Diction is controlled, though "covenant with preservation regenerated but transformed" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward elevated register. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the jetty. No dialogue to evaluate. The phrase "something between grief and exultation" at the opening is slightly generic, but voice recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; the walnut-ink recipe and the jetty's history both advance character and theme. However, minor loops appear: "small moments" recurs four times across the piece without accumulating new pressure each time, and "gently thorough" appears twice in identical phrasing. The phrase "contextualized changed" (paragraph five) reads like a typo for "context changed." Sentence openings vary well, and rhythm supports the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The walnut-ink archivist premise is specific and non-obvious. "Proximate causes" (hulls, nails, time) grounds the transformation concretely. The jetty blooming "with an intensity that seemed impossible" risks slight abstraction, and the covenant frame reads slightly derivative of grief-work templates. The locket-as-catalyst and the oxidizing-ink ritual feel earned rather than imposed, lifting the piece above median risk-aversion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's choice to descend to the jetty, write the card, and wear the locket creates the closure turn. Present in setup (carries locket), middle (opens it at jetty), and ending (places it around her neck). Drives at least two beats and shapes the final stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The locket appears in opening (arrives), middle (opened at jetty, photograph viewed), and ending (placed around neck). Its reappearance at closure reweights "Maya's laughter" from loss to carried presence. The photograph inside enables the emotional shift from grief to euphoria. Removing it would break the causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The covenant is setup (original vow to preserve), developed (felt as mausoleum), and paid off (regenerated but transformed). It shapes the dominant stake and the final stance. However, it remains somewhat abstract; the on-page mechanics are less specific than the walnut-ink or locket beats. Causal role is present but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Gently thorough" is mentioned twice identically, framing Mira's archival method in setup and reflecting on it in the middle. It does not visibly constrain a choice or impose cost at closure. The trait is consistent but replaceable with "meticulous" or "careful" without structural loss. Functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Steep" appears late (paragraph five) as the interpretive verb for Mira's shift: "steep herself in memory rather than hiding from it." It links to the walnut-ink preparation (steeping hulls) and charges the thematic turn. However, first appearance in the final third and summary-only use (not dramatized as distinct action) cap it. The metaphorical link to ink-making is strong but arrives too late to shape middle tactics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Proximate causes" is named explicitly in paragraph five and demonstrated through the walnut-ink recipe (hulls, water, nails, time). It shapes Mira's understanding and the thematic logic. However, it is more explanatory than tactical; it does not constrain a beat-level choice. Present in middle reflection and ending insight, but not setup. Two of three gates; purposeful but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight anchors setup (destination), middle (site of ritual), and ending (where she climbs back). This location—where ashes were scattered—constrains the choice to confront memory here. The roses and tide pools supply sensory resources. Removing this exact setting would break the covenant logic. Essential across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"When context changes" is signaled at the locket's arrival ("Then the locket arrived, and context changed") and fulfilled in the jetty scene when Mira reweights memory. The timeframe tightens decisions: twilight's fading light creates urgency for the writing act. Present in setup, developed through the descent, and paid off in the final realization. Strong causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve small moments is setup (thirty years of archival work), developed (felt as mere weight), and transformed at closure (archive continues but no longer as penance). The friction between preserving others' joys and avoiding her own grief drives the internal conflict. The card Mira writes at the jetty dramatizes the shift. Drives multiple beats and shapes the ending stance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Haunted euphoria" modulates across the arc: opening "trembling with something between grief and exultation," middle "unbearably heavy and impossibly light," ending "carrying her daughter's laughter home." The tone coheres through pressure and charges the final image. Both qualities act simultaneously rather than alternating. The duality is embodied in the roses blooming impossibly at twilight.</comment>
