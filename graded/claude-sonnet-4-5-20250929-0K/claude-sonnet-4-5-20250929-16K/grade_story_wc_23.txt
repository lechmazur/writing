<question>1</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Mara's interiority is present and consistent—salvaging, mapping, guiding—but her micro-choices remain generic and service-oriented rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final window moment ("pressed her forehead against the cold window") gestures toward internal conflict between her own loss and the work, yet the renunciation or stance shift is more asserted than dramatized through a concrete trade-off with visible cost. Emotional embodiment leans toward poetic abstraction ("geography of loss") rather than visceral specificity under pressure. Her daughter remains a tidy motivational token rather than a lived complication forcing harder choices on the page.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: repetition of midnight calls, the bronze censer foot, moon phases, and star imagery accumulate toward the final waiting posture. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately in the opening paragraphs. Closure unit is Charged Poise—Mara waits, maps ready, the work continues—but the cost is more conceptual atmosphere than a legible on-page forfeiture or tightening that narrows options. The piece builds texture and tone but does not deliver a decisive pressure point or meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake with felt consequence at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The starlit signal station is vivid and purposeful: broken hydraulics, cliff perch, maps on walls, the bronze censer foot as tactile anchor. Moon phase detail (waning crescent, new moon signal strength) constrains the navigation system with specificity. The station's disabled hydraulics appear twice, grounding the setting as a broken-but-functional space that charges the ending when "she'd learned to hear solace in malfunction." Spatial choreography is clear, though the valley-below and submerged temple remain postcard elements rather than live constraints on choice.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake is Mara's project of guiding the lost home, with her daughter as motivating shadow. The midnight phone call beats are coherent and patterned, but pressure does not escalate—each call feels iterative rather than narrowing options. The woman's progress ("touch the stone," "another mile north") is resolved off-page without complication or reversal on Mara's side. No on-page tightening or trade-off alters Mara's tactics; the ending restates the work rather than testing it with visible cost. One meaningful deepening is absent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of return, loss, and "navigation through deep memory" emerges organically from the bronze censer foot, reverse migration imagery, and the station's repurposed function. The piece resists overt moralizing and allows ambiguity—Mara's daughter is still lost, the work continues. The ending image ("the stars pulsed their ancient light, and Mara waited") offers a resonant non-literal answer that reweights the premise without stating a moral. The "patchwork" motif recurs purposefully and charges the closure without becoming a checklist symbol.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent and poetic: "fingernail scraping the sky," "geography of catastrophe," "coordinates of the heart." Perceptual signature is clear—Mara notices stars, maps, bronze patina—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the geography of loss," "deep-rooted memory") that risks abstraction rather than character-particular idiom. The phone-call dialogue is minimal, functional, and goal-driven. Focalization remains stable; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance is controlled, though peak stress moments could benefit from tighter syntactic compression to match urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and free of scaffold or loops. Figurative language is purposeful: "starlit signal station perched on its cliff like a broken lighthouse," "moon hung thin as a fingernail scraping the sky." Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or theme. Minor template cadence in the phone-call sequence ("Good," Mara said / "Touch it," Mara said) is brief and voice-consistent. No paraphrase loops, no register drift into corporate diction, no grammar errors. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and resonance effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of reverse migration, patchwork navigation via deep memory, and a broken signal station repurposed for human guidance is specific and non-obvious. The bronze censer foot as zero meridian and the moon-phase signal fluctuation add fresh detail grounded in the world's logic. Emotional specificity (Mara guiding others as practice for finding her daughter) avoids generic templates. The piece commits fully to its lyric, accumulative mode without retreat into causal convenience. Risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though the ending does not surprise—it confirms the established pattern rather than reweighting it unexpectedly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Mara appears throughout, guiding the caller and reflecting on her project. Her role as "patchwork navigator" is label-clear and frames the story, but her on-page decisions are service moves (instructing the caller) rather than key turns that alter her own tactics or cost. She does not face a complication that forces a meaningful choice; the ending restates her waiting posture. Present in setup, middle, and ending; functional causal role in one beat (the phone call); swappable with "guide" or "operator" without major structural loss. No closure linkage where her choice reweights the final image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The bronze censer foot is introduced early ("patina bronze censer foot, salvaged from the temple") and handled twice: first as anchor/zero meridian, later as weight in her hand ("pressed her forehead against the cold window" follows immediately after "she picked up the bronze censer foot, feeling its weight"). Its properties (three-pronged, compass rose carved, green-black patina) are specific and irreplaceable. It serves as the navigation system's anchor point and returns with reweighted meaning at the ending ("Now it held coordinates of the heart"). Present in setup, middle description, and ending image; causal pressure as a tactile/symbolic anchor; closure linkage moderate. Could score higher if its handling constrained a live choice rather than serving as thematic recurrence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Reverse migration" is named and explained ("people scattered by disaster…trying to return to places that no longer existed"). It shapes the phone-call stakes (the caller navigating backward toward lost foundations) and Mara's project framing. The concept is present in setup, middle phone call, and ending tally ("Forty-seven people had found their way back"). It does not constrain an on-page choice or create a visible trade-off; it remains thematic architecture rather than a tactical pressure. Swappable with "return journey" or "homecoming" without major structural loss. Functional causal role in one beat; no closure-scene cost tied specifically to the reversal mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Moon phases are introduced early ("waning crescent…signals would be weak") and return ("In five days, the new moon would bring the strongest signals"). The trait constrains Mara's expectations and the caller's success rate, shaping the navigation system's mechanics. It does not force a visible on-page trade-off or enable/disable a key action at closure. Present in setup and middle reflection; functional in one beat (signal strength); no closure participation. Swappable with "weather" or "equipment reliability" without major loss. Label-only mentions without dramatized cost at a peak beat cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>"Build" appears explicitly ("build their way back through the rubble," "help someone build their way back") and governs Mara's guiding method. The phone-call sequence enacts building via instruction ("Place your hand on something old," "Touch it," "Look for the foundation stones"). Present in setup metaphor, middle phone call, and ending summary. The action does not create a major turn or reversal; the caller's success is recounted, not dramatized as a complication. Swappable with "guide," "navigate," or "retrace" without major structural loss. Functional in one beat; no closure-scene cost where building redefines options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>"Cryptic phone calls at midnight" is signaled early ("The phone rang at midnight exactly") and drives the central beat (the woman's navigation instructions). The midnight timing and cryptic exchange shape the scene's texture and stakes. Present in setup, middle enactment, and ending promise ("At the next midnight, the phone would ring again"). The method is specific and irreplaceable—its mechanics (touch, describe, follow) structure Mara's tactics. Causal pressure in two beats (current call, anticipated next call); closure linkage moderate (the waiting posture hinges on the method). Could score higher if the method's constraints created visible cost or forced a trade-off at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The starlit signal station is introduced immediately ("starlit signal station perched on its cliff") and its broken hydraulics frame Mara's situation. The station's disabled rotation, maps on walls, and cliff isolation provide tactile anchors and constrain Mara's improvisation ("unable to rotate its beacon…she'd become a patchwork navigator"). Present in setup, middle reflection on hydraulics, and ending ("the station's broken hydraulics groaned again"). The setting charges the final image (Mara at the window, waiting) and supplies the "broken lighthouse" metaphor that threads through the piece. Causal pressure in two beats; closure linkage strong. Micro-setting (body/tool) is not foregrounded, but the station itself constrains tactics and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>"After the hydraulics fail" is anchored ("The hydraulics had failed three weeks ago") and frames the station's current state. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page; it serves as backstory context rather than a live clock. Present in setup only; no middle or closure participation. No on-page moment where the elapsed three weeks forces a trade-off or constrains a choice. Swappable with "after the equipment broke" or "during the crisis" without structural loss. Label-only mention without dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>"Navigate the geography of loss" is present as Mara's motivation ("navigating the geography of loss herself, trying to find her way back to a daughter who'd disappeared"). The desire is stated, not dramatized in on-page friction. Mara's guiding work serves as proxy/practice for her own search, but no scene beat forces her to choose between her daughter and another caller, or to pay a visible cost tied to this desire. Present in setup and ending reflection; functional in framing stakes but not in forcing a turn. Could score higher if the daughter's absence constrained a live choice rather than serving as thematic backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>"Raw solace" is enacted rather than named: the broken hydraulics groan "like comfort," Mara has "learned to hear solace in malfunction," the ending waits without resolution but without despair. Tone is coherent through the phone call's quiet intensity and the final starlit patience. The piece modulates from the opening's cool factuality ("hydraulics had failed") to the ending's charged poise without jarring shifts. Tone charges the final image (stars pulse, Mara waits, "raw and real, this was the work of return"). Distinct from stock melancholy or triumph; the oxymoron ("raw solace") is earned through the patchwork navigation and the bronze censer foot's dual weight. High integration with closure effect.</comment>
