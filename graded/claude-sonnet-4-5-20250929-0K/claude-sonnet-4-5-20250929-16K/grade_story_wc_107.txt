<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is specific and embodied through her glass-working choices, and her self-narration habit emerges organically from isolation. Internal contradiction appears in her simultaneous flight from judgment and need to perform for an invisible audience. However, the final choice to "keep drawing" feels more like continuation than transformation—there's no visible cost or foreclosed path at closure, weakening the earned-change requirement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly within the first paragraph. The accumulative lens is stable—ice melting, glass cooling, reflection building—but closure delivers only atmospheric resonance without a decisive change or felt cost. The final image of Mira "kept drawing" restates her established pattern rather than reweighting it; no option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned control room is vividly realized through rusted panels, static monitors, and humming units, anchoring Mira's isolation. Sensory details—frost-rimed windows, meltwater, groaning pipes—are filtered through her artist's POV and evolve with the thaw. The annealer's eighteen-hour cooling cycle and the spring landscape meaningfully constrain her rhythm and mirror the thematic work, charging the final image of transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—crafting safe zones for inquiry—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Pressure accumulates texturally through the thaw metaphor and glass-working details, but no on-page choice narrows options or carries visible cost. The ending gesture of sketching tomorrow's piece is continuation rather than a turn that forecloses a path, leaving escalation under-realized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the thawing-heart metaphor woven through ice, glass, and emotional architecture. The contrast between glacial memory and human forgetting is specific and avoids platitudes. However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit statement—"Change looked like loss until you recognized it as transformation"—where image alone would resonate more powerfully. The premise holds complexity without false balance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and Mira's perceptual signature—artist observing through metaphor, self-narrating for company—is distinct and consistent. Her dramatic narration ("And now," "And thus concludes") provides texture and voice. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between immediate sensation and reflection. However, some diction ("thoughtfully spirited," "weighty lightness") feels slightly elevated beyond her established register under the present-tense intimacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong sensory specificity and varied rhythm. The opening lines anchor voice effectively. However, several phrases loop conceptually: "safe zones for inquiry" / "places where questions could exist," and "frozen moments" / "frozen motion" within two paragraphs. The metaphoric density in the final third ("winter's architecture collapsing, spring's beginning") occasionally tips toward decorative rather than propulsive, though it doesn't obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The glassblower-in-abandoned-station frame offers freshness, and the thawing-heart metaphor is developed with specificity. However, the contemplative-artist-finding-meaning-in-isolation premise is familiar, and the story transforms it only moderately through the control-room setting. The self-narration habit provides a distinct inflection, but the emotional arc—solitary work leading to acceptance of transformation—follows a well-worn template without a sharp counter-turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her choices drive glass-working beats. She lifts the blowpipe, pinches the aperture, places the sphere in the annealer—on-page actions that demonstrate craft. However, these are execution moves rather than stake-altering decisions. The final choice to "keep drawing" reaffirms rather than transforms her trajectory; no option is foreclosed. Introduced early, involved in multiple beats, but lacks causal pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The bookmark appears in two distinct beats: jutting from the journal mid-story and returned to "a new page" at the end. Both uses are concrete handling rather than static description. However, its function is largely symbolic—marking passages about memory and forgetting—without constraining a choice or altering tactics. The final repositioning charges the ending image slightly but remains ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The thawing heart is the story's organizing metaphor, shaping Mira's sculpture concept ("thawing heart rendered in glass") and the seasonal frame (ice surrendering to warmth). It recurs across beats and is present in the final image ("winter's architecture collapsing, spring's beginning"). However, it functions thematically rather than causally—Mira's on-page choices aren't constrained by it. The lyric reprise reweights the opening stake but without felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully spirited" appears once as a descriptor for the ice's violence ("the violence was slow-motion, thoughtfully spirited in its destruction"). It colors the narrator's perception but doesn't constrain or enable any on-page action. The trait remains label-only without dramatized tradeoffs. Present in the middle third but swappable with other atmospheric modifiers; no Setup or Payoff participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Abandon" structures the entire premise: the control room is abandoned, researchers fled, Mira abandoned the city. It appears in the opening line and recurs through the journal's final entry ("abandoned their posts") and the landscape "abandoning its winter face." The action shapes Mira's isolation stake and charges the final image of transformation. However, the concept is present throughout rather than turning at a key beat; its role is foundational but static.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dramatically narrating mundane tasks is introduced early ("And now," she announced) and mechanically demonstrated in two distinct beats: the glassblower-contemplates-furnace narration and "And thus concludes today's episode." Mira explicitly frames it as a coping mechanism for isolation. The method affects her voice and emotional texture but doesn't alter tactics or create friction. Present in setup, middle, and implied at closure, but its mechanics remain illustrative rather than pressure-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned control room anchors every scene: rusted panels house her studio, monitors display static, refrigeration units no longer refrigerate. The setting provides concrete resources (the annealer, the director's desk with journal) and pressures her isolation. Spatial details—window, eaves, walls—shape her observation beats. The groaning pipes in the final paragraph directly charge the transformation image. Setup, development across multiple beats, and payoff all present with causal texture.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Ice melting brackets the story (frost-rimed window opening, meltwater carving channels closing) and imposes the eighteen-hour annealer cooling cycle as a temporal anchor. Spring's arrival is causally tied to her thematic work on transformation. However, the timeframe functions atmospherically rather than as a live clock tightening decisions—no deadline pressures a choice. Setup and payoff present; middle development is textural rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Crafting safe zones for inquiry is stated as Mira's motivation ("her real motivation") and demonstrated through her sculpture concept (apertures for viewing suspended forms). It recurs in her reflection on questions without answers. However, the desire is told more than dramatized—no on-page beat shows her sacrificing an alternate want or paying a cost to pursue this goal. Setup and thematic presence are strong; friction and felt cost are absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Weighty lightness is explicitly named ("The weighty lightness in her chest—half melancholy, half hope") and tonally sustained through the juxtaposition of "quiet violence," slow-motion destruction, and hopeful sketching. The oxymoron charges the final image of spring's beginning. However, the direct labeling in the middle third undercuts the tonal work—showing the paradox through image would integrate more tightly. Present in setup, modulates with pressure, and lands at closure, but the on-the-nose articulation weakens it.</comment>
