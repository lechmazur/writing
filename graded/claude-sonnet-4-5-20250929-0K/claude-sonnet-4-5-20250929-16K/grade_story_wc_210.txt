<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's interiority leans abstract—"working memory," "concentrated potential"—rather than embodied contradictions. Her refusal of the wish is told via summary ("She knew better than to grasp at false comfort"), not a dramatized micro-choice with visible cost. The final smile and settled confidence lack internal friction; we don't see her wrestle with doubt or pay an immediate emotional price on the page, only witness a thesis statement clothed as character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (history floods in, bottle cracks, potential disperses). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the bottle's shattering reweights "revival" to "foundation of transformation." However, cost is asserted conceptually—"rejected the easy path," "work had only just begun"—not felt in a concrete forfeiture or altered relationship. The before/after legibility is present but the price remains oblique, keeping closure from full resonance under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cove's sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: tide pools, tattered lanterns, the pier that "groaned with rot." The workshop's "abandoned instruments and dusty phials" ground the alchemist's isolation. The bottle's warmth and the lighthouse projecting "intricate patterns of possibility" charge the final image. Micro-setting (the bottle, the square, the lanterns) constrains and enables the closure action, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming the town via the bottle—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when she "pressed the bottle to her forehead" and channels working memory. The bottle's shattering narrows options from passive study to active reimagining. However, the escalation is compressed into one beat; the "three days" of study is summarized without dramatized trial or error. Cost is conceptual (foreclosing restoration in favor of transformation) but lacks visceral immediacy or visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "not a restoration, a reimagining," the djinn's gift to the one who stayed, lanterns as "a library scattered across the wind." The ending offers a resonant image—knowledge dispersed, waiting for builders—without moralizing. However, the phrase "She had conceived the foundation of a civilization that would reject the comfortable past" tilts toward thematic declaration rather than purely letting the image speak. The motif of the paper lanterns recurs and reweights effectively at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—"raw material," "crucible," "transmute"—reflecting the alchemist's craft. The prose carries a distinct elevated register, purposeful and voice-motivated. However, diction peaks into abstraction during peak pressure: "concentrated potential, distilled possibility" and "working memory" lack concrete anchoring when the bottle shatters, softening immediacy at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift appropriately. Some lines do double duty: "The town watched silently around her—empty shops with their faded awnings, houses with doors that swung on broken hinges." However, paraphrase loops appear: "not to resurrect what was, but to transmute it into what could be" restates the title's premise. "Not a restoration. A reimagining" repeats the same concept adjacently. Template cadence in the middle third ("She understood now... She carried the bottle... She pressed the bottle") stacks similar stems. Filter-verb reliance ("She understood," "She knew") dulls immediacy in high-pressure beats. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence, plus −0.3 for filter stacks touching peak beats; total −0.9 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise—alchemist as last resident uses a mysterious bottle to seed future civilization—offers a fresh angle on ghost-town revival. The bottle's sealed perfection and the "working memory" mechanism feel specific. However, the emotional arc and thematic resolution (staying vs. wishing away, transformation over restoration) follow a recognizable template: the wise loner who refuses comfort and plants seeds for others. The synthesis is competent but not surprising; removing the alchemist's name and the cove's details would leave a familiar moral calculus largely intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's choice to refuse her turn frames the story (setup). She studies the bottle for three days (middle development, though summarized). She presses the bottle to her forehead and pours in her working memory, triggering the shattering (closure participation). Her decision drives the key turn and the final reconfiguration. However, the middle beats are summarized rather than dramatized, and the climactic action—"pressed the bottle to her forehead"—appears suddenly without prior failed attempts or visible tradeoffs. Eligible for mid-6s: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8; total ~6.5 baseline. Summary-only middle use −0.3; late mechanics −0.2. Final: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amber bottle appears nested in tide pools (setup, paragraph 3). She studies it for three days in her workshop (middle beat). She presses it to her forehead and it shatters, releasing the town's knowledge (closure beat). The bottle's sealed perfection and the substance inside drive the central mystery and enable the final transformation. Its properties—flawless, no opening, something moving inside—are specific and irreplaceable. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +1.0, specificity +0.5; total ~7.4 baseline. No major frictions.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ghost town revival shapes the dominant stake from the opening: "Everyone else had gone," "the dying town," "A ghost town waiting for a resurrection." The middle section uses the town's "history" and "genius" as raw material. The ending redefines revival as "reimagining" rather than restoration, directly reweighting the concept. The concept pressures her choice throughout and is transformed at closure. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.4, causal pressure +1.2; total ~7.0 baseline. Minor swappability (could be "abandoned" rather than "ghost") −0.2; elevated diction not fully POV-specific +0.1 offset. Final: 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Rejects false comfort" is stated in paragraph 2: "she knew better than to grasp at false comfort, at easy escape." It explains her refusal of the wish (setup). The trait is invoked again when the bottle is described as "a gift for the one who rejected the easy path" (middle). The final paragraph echoes rejection of "the comfortable past" (closure). However, the rejection is told rather than dramatized with visible tradeoff; we don't see her tempted or wrestle with the cost on the page. Early signal +0.5, closure echo +0.4, label-only treatment −0.6, summary-only −0.4. Final: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Conceive" appears explicitly in the climax: "she began to conceive what others could not imagine," and the ending: "She had conceived the foundation of a civilization." The action is the method by which she processes the town's history and seeds the future. It drives the key turn from study to transformation. Early signal (paragraph 5) +0.4, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8; total ~6.0 baseline. However, the mechanics are abstract ("working memory," "crucible") rather than embodied or specific, reducing irreplaceability. Swappability (could be "envision" or "design") −0.3. Final: 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Working memory" is named in paragraph 5: "Through working memory, she began to conceive." She "poured her working memory into it" at the climax (paragraph 8). The method is signaled and used at the key turn. However, the mechanics are left abstract—no prior dramatization of what "working memory" means or how it differs from ordinary thought. It resolves the bottle's mystery without prior grounding, reading as a late-breaking rule. Setup present +0.3, closure linkage +0.8, causal pressure +0.5; total ~5.8 baseline. Late mechanics (first clear use at climax) −0.4. Final: 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paper-Lantern Cove is named in the opening line and anchors the setting throughout. The tide pools provide the bottle (setup). The town square with hanging lanterns is the site of the climax. The lanterns "bloom with color" and become "a library scattered across the wind" at closure, directly charging the final image. The cove's emptiness pressures her isolation. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.3, causal pressure +0.8; total ~7.2 baseline. Minor swappability (could be another empty town) −0.3. Final: 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the last wish is granted" frames the opening and establishes the timeframe. The djinn's departure and the townspeople's absence are consequences of this moment. The "three days" of study provide temporal progression. However, time does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the alchemist studies at leisure without a live clock pressuring her choices. Setup present +0.5, brief middle reference +0.2; total ~4.8 baseline. No closure participation; no pressure from time constraint. Cap at 4.6 for missing closure participation, but brief middle use lifts slightly to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To reimagine an entire civilization" is stated in the final section: "She had conceived the foundation of a civilization that would reject the comfortable past." The motivation explains her refusal to wish herself away and her multi-day study. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized with internal friction; we don't see her wrestle with the ambition's cost or doubt its feasibility. Setup (implied refusal) +0.4, closure linkage +0.8, causal pressure +0.6; total ~6.0 baseline. Label-only treatment −0.3, summary-only middle −0.3, closure echo restores +0.4. Final: 6.1.</comment>
