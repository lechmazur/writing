<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Celeste's synesthetic perception and stage-ghost motivation are established, but her interior life operates more as a vehicle for thematic display than as contradictory impulses under pressure. The young man exists only as an object of her perception—his "despair tasted like ash"—never gaining agency or on-page presence to create relational friction. The final choice to "wait" for him tomorrow carries minimal felt cost because no live option was foreclosed; she was already bound to the building and seeking applause. Embodied emotion is present in her memory of "electric joy" and "blue-cold regret," but the peak beat (her song) remains largely abstract rather than rooted in a micro-choice that alters present stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early (stage ghost, antique shop, after closing) and establishes a clear accumulative lens: echoes produced by song will reverberate into the young man's tomorrow. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the tarot coin settles on the Star, blossoms bloom across decades, and Celeste smiles in anticipation—but the cost remains conceptual and future-facing rather than legible on the page. The young man's discovery of his grandfather's sketchbook is narrated as a vision of tomorrow, not a causal consequence visible now, which softens the closure's immediacy. One meaningful deepening occurs (her performance crystallizes the fractured timeline), but the final image charges hope without a visible forfeiture or trade-off that alters her present condition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mystic orchard is vividly rendered with sensory specificity: silver fruit, perpetually twilit sky, blossoms and rot occupying the same branches. The fractured timeline is not mere backdrop—it responds to her song, swaying and opening/closing in rhythm, and the tarot coin heats in her palm as images spin. The garden's temporal currents constrain her method (she must navigate them synesthetically) and charge the final image (three decades of blossoms blooming simultaneously). Spatial choreography is clean; the progression from shop aisles to hidden door to orchard is legible, and the setting's strange temporality directly enables the plot's core action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—luring possibility from despair by performing echoes that will reach the young man tomorrow—is signaled early and pursued without deviation. Pressure accumulates through her song (each note splits, shows futures, intertwines timelines), and the tarot coin's shift from Fool/Star to Star alone marks a tightening. However, the young man's despair and future discovery are narrated as Celeste's synesthetic visions rather than on-page confrontation, so escalation reads as textural intensification without a live trade-off. The resolution is earned by her performance, but no option is foreclosed with visible cost; she remains bound to the building, still seeking applause, and the consequence is deferred to "tomorrow."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the ghost's encore-seeking bound to performance as life-saving gift: her death and his rebirth, her eternal seeking and his newfound purpose, all braided through the orchard's fractured time. The final image—apple blossoms from three decades blooming simultaneously—resonates without stating a moral, and the piece resists tidy resolution by leaving the young man's response off-page. Nostalgia rises "like perfume...bittersweet, powerful, transforming," charging the ending with emotional specificity. The tarot coin's Fool-to-Star arc subtly underscores hope and beginning without becoming allegory. However, the thematic question—can a performance transcend death to change a life?—is posed more than tested, since the young man's transformation remains a vision rather than a dramatized choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Celeste; her synesthetic lens is consistent and voice-particular ("deep purple tasted of longing, silver hummed with hope"). Perceptual signature is strong: she reads time's taste, sees futures spiraling, and perceives the young man's despair as ash and a flat note. Diction stays controlled—"encore-seeking stage ghost," "copper-sharp surprise," "mint-green possibility"—without register drift. However, the narrative confidently narrates the young man's future actions ("saw him find a forgotten sketchbook...saw his hands trembling") as if they are present fact rather than Celeste's hopeful vision, which blurs the line between what she perceives and what will occur. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction tests do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is selective: "amber-warm triumph, blue-cold regret, green-bright resilience." Information density is high in the orchard sequence, where image and action advance simultaneously. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Tonight, she'd sensed someone...A young man...had stood outside...His despair had tasted..." restates the same observation across three sentences without added pressure. Template cadence emerges in the vision sequence: "She saw him find...saw his hands...She tasted his recognition," stacking "saw/tasted" constructions. The final paragraph—"Perhaps this time, someone would recognize...Perhaps this time, the encore she sought"—cycles "perhaps this time" without causal progression. These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats but do not obscure the ending image. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase and template runs, preventing 9+ eligibility globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of stage ghost, synesthesia, fractured-timeline orchard, and tarot coin feels purposeful rather than checklist assembly, and the emotional stakes (performance as connection versus eternal isolation) ground the speculative frame. The young man discovering his grandfather's sketchbook is a fresh, specific inflection that grows from the orchard's temporal braiding. However, the ghost-seeks-meaning-through-influence premise is familiar, and the story does not transform it with a non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail that would make Celeste's choice feel risky or costly in the present. The ending defers consequence to tomorrow, which softens the bold commitment to premise. No close echoes of famous scenes; the tarot coin and synesthetic perception add texture without quirk for its own sake.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Celeste is present throughout, framing the stake (lure possibility from despair) and executing the plan (sing to produce echoes). Her ghost-nature confines her to the building and her desire for applause drives the performance. However, her choices do not create key turns—she decides to act, then acts without complication or mid-course adjustment. The young man's future discovery is narrated as her vision, not a consequence of a choice she makes under pressure. She is the vehicle for the plot but does not face a dilemma or trade-off that alters her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tarot coin appears in beat one (she holds it, its images shift Fool/Star, colours explode) and returns at closure (it cools, images settle on Star). It triggers her synesthetic perception ("colours exploded across her vision") and heats during the song, charging the performance. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic she could not otherwise pursue; it functions more as a mood object and thematic marker than as a causal lever. The reprise at closure reweights meaning (hope crystallized) but the coin itself does not alter her options.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fractured timeline is not mere backdrop—it is the orchard's defining mechanic. Celeste navigates it by reading "the taste of time itself," and her song causes timeline threads to "intertwine more tightly," braiding past and future. The core conflict (sending echoes into tomorrow to prevent despair) depends on this temporal fracture, and the final image (blossoms from three decades blooming simultaneously) is legible only because the timeline is broken. The concept shapes stakes (she must perform into tomorrow) and tactics (she uses synesthesia to read temporal currents).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Synesthesia is established early ("Sound had texture; emotion had flavour") and applied multiple times: despair tastes like ash and sounds like a flat note, purple tastes of longing, recognition is copper-sharp surprise. It enables her to navigate the orchard's temporal currents and to perceive the young man's emotional state. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost—she uses it fluently without struggle or trade-off. The trait enriches texture but remains a perceptual filter rather than a source of friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Intertwine" is the story's central verb: timeline threads intertwine, her performance and his discovery intertwine, her death and his rebirth intertwine. The orchard's blossoms "intertwine like clasped fingers," and the climax narrates "timeline threads began to intertwine more tightly." The action is signaled early and paid off at closure, but it is enacted by the orchard's magic responding to her song rather than by a choice Celeste makes under resistance. Swapping "intertwine" for "braid" or "merge" would not alter the plot's structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Producing echoes is the story's method, signaled when Celeste begins to sing and "Each note split and multiplied, creating harmonies with past and future versions of itself." The mechanics are clear: echoes reveal moments not yet happened, paths not taken, and will reach the young man tomorrow. The method shapes two beats—her song in the orchard and the young man's future response—and the final line hinges on whether "someone would recognize the echoes." The means is not merely decorative; it defines how the ghost can act across time.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mystic orchard is introduced early (paragraph three), detailed with specific properties (silver fruit, perpetually twilit sky, fractured timeline made visible), and becomes the arena for the climax. It responds to Celeste's song (trees sway, blossoms open/close in rhythm), supplies the mechanic for temporal braiding, and produces the final image (blossoms from three decades blooming simultaneously). Without this exact setting, the fractured timeline would remain abstract and the echoes could not bridge past/future. The orchard's spatial and temporal properties constrain and enable the plot's resolution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe is established in the opening line ("The antique shop closed at six, but Celeste remained") and recurs in the final transition ("Tomorrow, after the business closes again, she would wait"). However, the time window does not tighten decisions or impose urgency—Celeste has decades of haunting behind her and unlimited nights ahead. The orchard exists in "perpetually twilit" time, further loosening the clock. The timeframe anchors the scene but does not pressure tactics or escalate stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation is stated clearly ("to lure possibility from the brink of despair") and dramatized through Celeste's perception of the young man's grey futures and her decision to act. Her desire for applause intertwines with the rescue impulse: "Perhaps this time, the encore she sought wasn't applause, but the simple knowledge that her performance had changed a life." The friction between wanting recognition and offering a gift is present but not tested by a choice under pressure—she pursues both without sacrifice. The motivation drives the plot but does not create internal conflict that alters her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Nostalgia is introduced subtly through Celeste's memories of "the fear before the footlights, the electric joy of connection, the devastating fire" and rises explicitly at closure: "nostalgia rose like perfume through the orchard—bittersweet, powerful, transforming." The tone modulates from her present loneliness ("death had only sharpened her hunger for applause") to the charged hope of the ending ("Celeste smiled"). The final image—three decades of blossoms blooming simultaneously—is steeped in temporal nostalgia, reweighting the dominant stake. The tone is coherent and purposeful, charging the closure without remaining static.</comment>
