<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation ("to understand the texture of time passing") is declared but never embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The climactic discovery is handed to him via projection rather than earned through his agency; he remains a passive receiver. Interiority relies on poetic abstraction ("heartbeat underneath everything") rather than character-particular contradiction. The final stance feels asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are established early (emerald silo, Marcus, prairie setting). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marcus gains Chen's framework and commits to teaching it, but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no on-page forfeiture or visible tradeoff. The projection device delivers the turn via convenient exposition rather than protagonist agency. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (poetic measurements, sensory framework), but the ending summarizes future intent rather than reweighting prior material through a charged final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The emerald silo is vividly described with purposeful detail (green-tinted glass filtering light into "wavelengths that helped the brain process duration differently"). Spatial choreography is clear: ladder, curved chamber, concrete floor, time capsule position. The silo's function as meditation chamber constrains Marcus's learning process, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, the body and tool details remain generic; no recurring object charges the final image beyond the urn fragment, which functions more as plot key than setting element.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding time without numbers—is signaled early but remains abstract. The single turn (urn fragment clicks, projection appears) is coincidental rather than driven by protagonist agency; Marcus inserts the piece without struggle or tradeoff. No escalation narrows options or forces a choice with visible cost. The resolution (Marcus will teach Chen's methods) is future-oriented summary rather than an on-page decision that forecloses a path. Accumulative lens doesn't rescue this: no deepening or cadence shift reweights the stake at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (time as sensation vs. quantification) emerges clearly from the world's premise and Chen's framework. The final image attempts resonance ("the profound weight of being alive in time's endless current") but tips into abstract philosophizing rather than arising from earned particulars. The urn fragment as key is purposeful but the thematic answer is stated by Chen's projection rather than discovered through Marcus's experience. No plausible counter-reading; the piece resolves into a tidy thesis without ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance remains consistent and the perceptual signature carries poetic coloring appropriate to the premise. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("arbitrary symbols," "experiential framework") that feels more authorial than character-particular for a "borrowed-time timekeeper." The projection's dialogue is expository and thesis-laden. Focalization is clean but lacks contradictory internal texture under pressure; Marcus's voice remains smooth and untroubled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Opening and closing lines are imagistic and purposeful. Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "numbers still meant something" / "numbers dissolved into abstraction" / "numbers have finally failed" restates the same premise across beats. Stock phrases recur: "weight of responsibility," "texture of time," "heartbeat underneath everything." Template cadence in mid-section: "Marcus [verb], [gerund]" pattern runs across three consecutive sentences. Figurative language is dense but mixed: "Heavy as three summer storms" and "smooth as the moment before sleep" are poetic but lack concrete anchors. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise (post-numerical measurement society) offers a fresh speculative angle. However, execution leans on familiar tropes: mysterious projection, dead mentor's message, chosen protagonist receives framework to save community. The poetic measurements ("heavy as three summer storms") gesture at originality but remain ornamental rather than constraining choice. Transformation test fails: swap names/setting and the emotional arc (lost person receives guidance, commits to teaching) remains generic. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece follows a conventional discovery-and-commitment template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Marcus is present throughout and his role as borrowed-time timekeeper frames the setup and closure. However, his choices do not create key turns; the projection activates when he inserts the urn fragment (coincidence), and his final commitment to teach is future-intent rather than an on-page decision with cost. Setup present, closure participation weak (summary of future action), no middle choice that narrows options. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; modest lift for setup and thematic tie.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The urn fragment appears in three beats: garage sale description, insertion into capsule (mechanical turn), and final carry-down with "warm" sensation. It functions as plot key (rare earth minerals unlock projection) with specificity. However, its meaning does not evolve; it remains a tool rather than reweighting thematically. Setup early, middle use (insertion), closure presence (carried with warmth). Two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure (enables projection) +0.5, closure linkage modest +0.4, but swappability (any mineral key would work) −0.5. Lands mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The damaged time capsule is central: its cracked state enables discovery, its interior mechanism accepts the urn key, and its projection provides the framework that shapes Marcus's closing commitment. Setup early (second paragraph), middle turn (activation), closure driver (Chen's system becomes Marcus's new toolkit). Three-beat involvement +1.4, causal pressure (without it, no turn or resolution) +1.2, closure linkage strong +1.4, specificity (titanium shell, interior mechanism, projection) +0.5. Swappability low; the capsule's design as post-numerical survival tool is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" describes the capsule's contents but does not constrain or enable Marcus's actions with visible cost. It functions as thematic label rather than tactical pressure. Mentioned twice (setup and reflection) but remains ornamental. Setup present, no middle constraint, no closure cost. Cap at 4.6 for missing development; further reduce for label-only use −0.4. The trait could be removed without altering plot or Marcus's choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Rediscover" appears twice: Marcus rediscovers the capsule (past event, summary) and will help his community rediscover time (future intent, closure summary). Neither instance is dramatized as a major turn on the page. The projection's reveal is the key turn, but that traces to insertion, not active rediscovery. Setup weak (prior event), middle absent, closure present but as summary. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle; modest lift for closure mention +0.6, lyric reprise +0.3, but swappability high (replace with "learn" or "understand" with minor edits) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Embedding messages in garage sale descriptions is signaled early ("the seller's description embedded with strange phrases") and explains how Marcus found the urn fragment. Chen's projection confirms the method was intentional. It shapes Marcus's initial action (purchasing the urn) and primes the closure (Chen anticipated survivors would use poetic description). Setup early +0.6, one beat involvement (garage sale discovery) +0.4, causal pressure (method enables the key find) +0.8, closure linkage (Chen explains the design) +1.0, specificity (poetic transaction language unique to premise) +0.5. Missing middle constraint −0.3. Lands high-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The emerald silo is introduced in the opening line and returns throughout: rusted ladder (physical navigation), curved chamber (spatial container), green glass panels filtering light into wavelengths that aid duration processing (functional constraint), and meditation chamber function (shapes Marcus's learning). Setup immediate +0.8, three-beat involvement (climb, discovery, learning) +1.4, causal pressure (environment enables study of borrowed time) +1.0, closure linkage (silo's function grounds the framework Marcus will teach) +1.2, specificity (green-tinted glass as cognitive tool) +0.7. Irreplaceable; the silo's design is integral to the premise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after numbers change meaning" is established early and sustained: three years post-Change, digits as meaningless shapes, poetic measurements replace quantification. It constrains all action (timekeeping without numbers is the central problem) and drives Marcus's motivation. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions at closure; no live clock pressures the ending. Setup early +0.7, two-beat involvement (problem setup, Chen's system as solution) +0.9, causal pressure (inability to measure time creates the stake) +1.1, closure linkage (resolution depends on post-numerical framework) +1.0. Missing tactical urgency −0.5; no countdown or deadline narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation "to understand the texture of time passing" is declared early and restated at closure. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. No on-page moment shows Marcus wrestling between wants and costs; he climbs, discovers, learns, and commits without friction. Setup present +0.5, closure participation (he will teach, fulfilling the desire) +0.6, but middle development absent (no choice where this desire conflicts with another priority). Cap at 4.6 for missing middle; modest lift for thematic tie +0.5, but told-only nature and lack of embodied cost −0.5 keeps it mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Tone of "anticipated mysteries" is established through Marcus's climb ("wrapped carefully," "jagged edge pressing"), the capsule's damaged state, and Chen's recorded message. The tone modulates from solitary discovery to revelation to quiet commitment. However, the tone remains static through the projection scene—no pressure shift or surprise that charges the final image. Setup early +0.6, present across beats +0.8, closure participation (mysteries revealed, new purpose found) +0.8, but single mood without intensification −0.4. The ending summarizes rather than charging the image with tonal reconfiguration.</comment>
