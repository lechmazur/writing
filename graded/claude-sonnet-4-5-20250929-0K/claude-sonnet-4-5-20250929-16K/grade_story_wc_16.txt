<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction—needing isolation to prove the method versus betraying collaborative promises—drives the scene authentically. Her "carefully reckless heart" emerges through concrete choices: the deliberate handling of the ink well, the decision to share volumes that represent months of solitude. Kael's war between "hurt against hope, anger against fascination" is embodied in his shifting finger taps and the moment he pulls his notebook forward. The reconciliation feels earned by the prior causality of her necessary silence, though the ending's "infinite possibility" phrase edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lens: Causal with accumulative accent. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the "together" promise reframes their diverging paths as interconnected rather than severed, with felt cost in the acknowledgment that tomorrow they separate. The ink well's transformation from "frozen tear" to "prism" charges the final image with reweighted meaning. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first two paragraphs. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael's initial unreadable expression dissolves into "old excitement," narrowing Maren's options from defensive explanation to collaborative restoration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archive's "sealed containers holding the final whispers of dead tongues" constrains the emotional stakes—they work among voices that died in silence. The glass ink well functions as micro-setting, passed between them and reweighted at closure. Spatial choreography remains clear (table, satchel, notebook positions). The single lamp's amber light filters perception consistently, though the archive itself could pressure a choice more directly—it remains evocative backdrop rather than active constraint on their reconciliation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trust restoration) is signaled early and tightens when Kael demands "Tell me via interconnected promises" rather than accepting surface apology. Maren's choice to share the method forecloses her option to protect the discovery alone—a visible tradeoff. The "last hour before their paths would diverge permanently" imposes time pressure. Escalation coheres under the causal lens: her explanation of harmonic patterns dissolves his resentment into fascination, agency rests with Maren's decision to reveal rather than withhold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete method: extinct languages leaving "harmonic patterns" in survivors mirrors how broken trust leaves traces that can be restored through careful work. "Symphonies of truth that died with them, made audible again through what they left behind" operates as image rather than thesis. The ink well's transformation from frozen tear to prism offers a resonant non-literal answer to whether silence can be repaired. Minor slip: "infinite possibility" in the final paragraph edges toward abstract declaration where the prism image already carried the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV holds cleanly; Maren's perceptual signature prioritizes linguistic patterns and emotional cost. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tightest during the ink well handling, more expansive during collaborative notation. Dialogue carries subtext: Kael's "The Verdanti texts" as "not quite a question" and his "Show me" contain forgiveness before he articulates it. Free indirect style remains controlled ("Of course he understood. He always had, which made her disappearance crueler"). The phrase "carefully reckless heart" in the final paragraph risks filter-verb stack, but the established voice absorbs it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density: "buying herself precious seconds" does three jobs (characterization, pacing, stakes). Rhythm varies effectively—short declarative "Together" after the longer collaborative paragraph. Minor loop: "interconnected promises" appears three times across the piece without enough functional variation between uses. The "war in his eyes—hurt against hope, anger against fascination" construction is clean and propulsive. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Figurative language (frozen tear, prism, symphonies) remains coherent and motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—languages leave harmonic patterns in survivors—offers a fresh synthesis of linguistics and restoration. "Carefully reckless" as deliberate contradiction transforms a potential hedge into character logic. The method of layering "promise-structures" to reveal extinct beliefs through contradictions shows conceptual specificity. Risk: the reconciliation between collaborators is familiar territory, elevated here by the arcane linguistics frame and the ticking clock of tomorrow's divergence. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat into generic relationship repair.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's choices as arcane linguist create all key turns: the decision to work alone, the choice to reveal the method, the collaborative notation that restores their synchrony. Her linguistic expertise shapes how she explains harmonic patterns and frames trust through "promise-structures." The method is inseparable from her identity as linguist; removing this role would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glass ink well appears in three distinct beats: opening (Maren turns it), middle (she dips pen for notation), and ending (transforms from frozen tear to prism). It carries the "promise" of their doctoral collaboration and its reweighting charges the final image. However, the middle use (pen dipping) is functional rather than transformative—it enables action but doesn't constrain choice. The opening and closing reprise with clear thematic shift elevates it into lyric-resonance range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" shapes the method: Maren discovered that extinct languages "sing" through harmonic patterns, which alters her tactics (she works alone first to prove it). The concept appears in the climactic explanation and is restated at closure. However, the discovery itself happens off-page; we see only the revelation and collaboration phases. It constrains her prior silence and enables the ending reconciliation, placing it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Carefully reckless" is demonstrated through the visible tradeoff: Maren's solitary pursuit enabled the discovery but broke collaboration promises. The phrase appears explicitly once and is shown earlier through "deliberate care" paired with six months of ghosting. At closure, her "carefully reckless heart" frames the commitment to continue together despite diverging paths. The trait enables the reunion with visible cost (months of hurt), landing it in the purposeful-reprise range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" appears explicitly once when Maren explains needing to "unsnarl the method first," justifying her silence. The action is past-tense and summarized rather than dramatized, but it gates the present reconciliation—without unsnarling, she couldn't credibly share the method now. It shapes the central turn (Kael's acceptance) by making her isolation necessary rather than capricious. However, the mechanics of unsnarling remain abstract; we don't see the specific tangles or their resolution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Via interconnected promises" is signaled when Kael demands she reveal the method this way, then demonstrated through their collaborative notation where "promise-structures" of extinct languages are layered to create harmonics. The method's mechanics (taking three languages, layering commitments, revealing contradictions) shape the climactic explanation beat. It appears at closure as the means by which they'll maintain connection across distance. The method is integral to both plot resolution and thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The extinct language archive provides thematic resonance ("final whispers of dead tongues, preserved but never spoken") that mirrors their broken communication. It anchors location early and frames their work. However, the archive supplies atmosphere more than constraint—the reconciliation could occur in any private scholarly space with minor edits. The "row upon row of sealed containers" doesn't alter tactics or provide resources that affect outcome, keeping it in functional-but-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Before paths diverge" is signaled early ("This was their before, fragile and fleeting") and tightens decisions throughout: "the last hour" before Kael's Institute appointment and Maren's departure south creates urgency. The timeframe forces the reconciliation now-or-never stakes and pressures Maren's choice to reveal the method rather than protect it. It shapes the ending's "Together" promise by acknowledging physical separation is imminent, making their commitment more costly and specific.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Restoration of trust drives every beat: Maren's careful handling of the ink well, her apology, Kael's demand for proof, her vulnerability in sharing the volumes, his choice to "trust that your silence was necessary." The motivation is dramatized through competing impulses (her fear of seeming mad versus need for reconciliation) and friction between her six-month silence and his hurt. The final "Together" promise directly resolves the motivation with visible cost—they reconcile knowing tomorrow brings separation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" modulates coherently: Maren's initial caution (buying seconds, deliberate care), the breaking of "careful exuberance" when Kael engages, the cautious joy rising as they work, and the final "carefully reckless heart" that commits despite risk. The tone charges the collaborative notation beat where "old synchrony" returns "like muscle memory." It remains distinct and controlled through pressure, reflecting both the fragility of reunion and the genuine intellectual excitement of the method.</comment>
