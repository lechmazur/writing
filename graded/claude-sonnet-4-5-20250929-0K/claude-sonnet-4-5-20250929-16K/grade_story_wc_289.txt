<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mei Lin's interior life is specific and embodied—her cataloging system by "particular ache," her hands moving "with the certainty of someone who had finally recognized the shape of her own seeking." The final renunciation (teaching Jun to write his own letters) arises from her realization about release versus preservation and carries visible cost: abandoning her keeper role. Minor slip: Jun's emotional state after reading the letter again feels asserted rather than fully dramatized, and the transition from observer to participant could carry more friction.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly: Mei Lin's decision to tie all forty-three letters to the spiral and shift from preserving secrets to releasing them constitutes a Decisive Change with felt cost (her identity as keeper dissolves). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—storm → installation → village recognition → teaching moment—each beat reweighting the stake of connection versus isolation. Orientation is swift (temple, post-storm, Mei Lin with letters). One mild tension: the visitors' reconciliations feel slightly convenient, but they serve thematic accumulation without breaking causality.</comment>

<comment>The lotus temple and lily pond anchor space early and recur purposefully (golden pond light at closure). The thrush nest installation is vivid and specific, its "near-invisible threads" and magnified scale grounding the central metaphor in tactile detail. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (wet stone path, courtyard, lowest tier of spiral, temple eaves). The installation constrains Mei Lin's choice—its presence and Jun's framing catalyze her release—pushing this toward the 9-band gate, but the temple itself remains more atmospheric than a live pressure on tactics.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (Mei Lin's impulse to preserve versus release) is signaled early and tightens when she encounters the installation. The act of tying all forty-three letters forecloses her keeper role with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through the storm revelation, Jun's confession, and the village reunion. One friction: the visitors' recognitions feel like a montage that diffuses rather than sharpens individual agency; Mei Lin's own turn carries the weight, but secondary escalation is more atmospheric than contested.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—connection through release, the spiral as organic architecture of longing—emerges from image and action without thesis statement. The final line ("each one carrying its own small truth into the clearing air") resonates without moralizing, and the installation's layered meanings (nest, art, shared archive) deepen across beats. The "thread that connects all things" is enacted rather than explained. Slight vulnerability: "rejoining" and "spiraling connections" receive minor thematic echo in narration, but the particulars (widow's letter, war correspondence, grandfather's proposal) anchor the universal.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mei Lin; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during her realization, pulling back for village vignettes). Diction is elevated but consistent: "prismatic reflections," "persistent, inevitably whimsical determination." Jun's brief dialogue carries subtext ("I think I need to write the next one myself") and contrasts with Mei Lin's more formal interior cadence. One artifact: "each one" repetition in the final paragraph edges toward template cadence, and the phrase "small truth" in the last line feels slightly generic within the otherwise textured voice.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies well, and information density is high (the opening efficiently anchors character, profession, and secret archive). Clarity is strong throughout. However, "each one" appears five times in close proximity across the final third, creating a mild template-cadence effect that dulls propulsion. The closing image ("fracturing into a thousand crystalline notes") is vivid but borders on overwriting given the already heavy use of "prismatic" earlier. No loops or scaffold otherwise, and the storm-to-spiral sequence advances cleanly.</comment>

<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—ghostwriter encounters public art installation of found letters—synthesizes familiar elements (confession, art, reconciliation) into a coherent whole. The thrush nest magnified a hundredfold is a specific, memorable image, and the storm as catalyst feels organic. However, the core emotional arc (hoarder learns to release) follows a recognizable template, and the villagers' reunions, while particularized, trend toward expected beats. The piece executes its concept cleanly but does not surprise or transform the material beyond competent execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mei Lin's profession as ghostwriter is signaled in the opening and directly motivates her archive and her final choice to release the letters. Her expertise shapes the central conflict (preservation versus circulation) and her decision to teach Jun closes her arc. Present in setup, development (the choice to tie letters), and payoff (teaching moment). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the specificity of her eleven-year practice and cataloging system makes the role irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The thrush nest spiral appears after the storm, is examined closely by Mei Lin, becomes the physical site where she ties all forty-three letters, and recurs when the actual thrush lands on it at closure ("as if recognizing its own architecture translated into human longing"). Present in all three gates, drives two major beats (discovery and letter-tying), and the thrush's return charges the final image. The spiral's whimsical inevitability and its function as archive-made-visible are indispensable to both structure and theme.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>"Keeper of secrets" is stated in the opening and drives the central tension: Mei Lin's habitual preservation versus the installation's invitation to release. Her realization ("they were never mine to keep") directly confronts this identity, and the shift from keeper to teacher enacts the concept's dissolution. Present in setup (eleven years, stored copies), middle choice (releasing letters), and ending (teaching Jun). Strong thematic and causal role, though the label itself is somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>"Inevitably whimsical" is applied twice—once to the nest's pattern ("only nature and obsession could produce") and once to the human heart's "persistent, inevitably whimsical determination." The term frames the installation's organic logic and echoes in Mei Lin's final understanding, but it does not constrain a specific on-page choice with visible cost. Present in setup and thematic payoff; functions more as tonal descriptor than active plot lever. Mid-band: purposeful reprise, but the trait itself does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>"Rejoin" is the action's spine: letters rejoin in the spiral, villagers rejoin through recognition, Mei Lin rejoins the communal act by releasing her archive. Jun's line "they wanted to rejoin something" names the motive, and the village reconciliations dramatize it. Present in all three gates and drives the central turn (Mei Lin's choice to tie letters). The concept of rejoining is indispensable; swapping it for "reconnect" or "unite" would require structural rewrite. High causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The public art installation (thrush nest spiral) is the means through which secrets are revealed and villagers reconcile. It appears early (storm conjures it), its mechanics matter (near-invisible threads, tiered structure, Mei Lin ties letters to the lowest tier), and it shapes the ending (thrush lands on it, closure image). Present in all three gates, constrains Mei Lin's method of release, and organizes the village's engagement. Strong integration, though the installation itself is passive infrastructure rather than active obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The lotus temple and lily pond anchor every beat: Mei Lin walks the wet stone path, the installation rises in the courtyard, the pond reflects prismatic light, and the temple bells close the piece. Setting is present throughout and recurs with reweighted meaning (golden pond at closure). The temple's sacred context lends weight to Mei Lin's renunciation and the visitors' reconciliations. Solid integration across all gates, though the setting enables rather than pressures choices; it does not actively constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>"After the cloud bursts" establishes the temporal frame in the opening and the storm's role in summoning the installation. The timeframe recurs implicitly (morning light, noon, afternoon light) to mark progression. However, time does not tighten decisions—Mei Lin's choice unfolds without urgency or deadline. Present in setup and tracked lightly through the day's arc, but it does not pressure tactics or escalate stakes. Mid-band: coherent chronology, but no live clock that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Mei Lin's desire "to find the thread that connects all things" is stated directly and dramatized through her cataloging system and her final realization that release, not preservation, enacts connection. The motivation is present in setup (her archive organized by ache), middle (recognition of the spiral's purpose), and payoff (teaching Jun, trusting letters to find their way home). Solid causal and thematic role; the phrasing is somewhat abstract but anchored in her specific actions and choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>"Prismatic quiet" governs the piece's register: post-storm calm, reflective rather than urgent, with recurring light imagery (prismatic reflections, crystalline notes, golden pond). Tone is coherent through all turns—Mei Lin's interior contemplation, Jun's confession, the villagers' weeping reconciliation—and modulates subtly (opening solemnity, midday communal energy, closing bell resonance). The final image ("fracturing into a thousand crystalline notes") charges the prismatic motif with closure weight. Strong tonal control; the descriptor itself appears only once but the effect pervades.</comment>
