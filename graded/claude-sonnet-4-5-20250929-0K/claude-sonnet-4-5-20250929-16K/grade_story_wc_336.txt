<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Esme's motives are clear and her pruner's craft anchors her perceptual filter, but internal contradiction is absent—she proceeds with patient competence from start to finish without genuine struggle or self-doubt. The work of "capturing essence" unfolds through contemplative observation rather than embodied conflict; when her hands cramp and knees ache, these physical costs arrive as afterthoughts rather than complications that force tactical adjustments. The final choice (planting the seed in thin-reality soil) feels like the natural continuation of her established method rather than a decision that forecloses another path with visible cost. Micro-choices exist (kneeling, closing eyes, standing) but serve choreography more than revealing a hierarchy of competing values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and maintains single POV across one continuous scene. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the seed now carries preserved essence, and Esme's smile signals ongoing work across realms—a crystallization of her role as cross-world gardener. However, the cost remains conceptual and gestural; the aching knees and cramped hands are mentioned but do not visibly foreclose an option or alter her stance. The accumulative lens (patient weaving of essences through mist-revealed gardens) holds without contradiction, but the final image reweights wonder's preservation more thematically than tactically. One meaningful deepening occurs (the multi-hour weaving), sufficient for this length, though the stakes never truly narrow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The parapet, waterfall mist, and "radiant hush" function as more than postcard—the thin-reality geography directly enables Esme's essence-gathering, and the mist's shimmer gates access to other gardens. Micro-setting (wet stone, spray) grounds her kneeling posture and tracks time (dawn mist burns off, sun rises). The shears carry generational weight but remain held rather than used, a missed opportunity for tool-as-constraint. Sensory hierarchy reflects her pruner's attention (light through leaves, wind through branches), and the spatial choreography of threshold/parapet/glimpsed-gardens remains coherent. The waterfall's constancy anchors the work's duration and the final image, charging closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the heirloom tree's wonder across worlds—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the hours-long weaving rather than a causal tightening; the work's difficulty is asserted (cramped hands, aching knees) but no reversal or complication forces Esme to adapt her method or sacrifice an option. She seeks essences, finds them in other gardens, and braids them successfully; the accumulative lens supports this patient gathering, but escalation remains flat. The ending offers continuation ("other seeds to save") rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Agency is present (she performs the essence-capture) but the cost is durational rather than a trade-off with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the gardener's refusal to let wonder vanish—preservation as active defiance, not museum stasis. The "radiant hush" and "threshold place" motifs charge the atmosphere without overt statement, and the final image (shears, smile, ongoing work) resonates as vocation rather than resolution. The piece resists moralizing; Esme's method (weaving essences through thin places) is particular to her craft and avoids generic save-the-world rhetoric. However, the thematic answer—wonder can be preserved by those patient enough to see between worlds—arrives cleanly without the friction of competing goods or a cost that reweights prior certainty. The closing "work, as always, continued" nods toward iterative commitment but stops short of a non-literal conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with a perceptual signature filtered through Esme's pruner's lens: "particular quality of sound," "essence of things," "learning to see." Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Register occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("insatiably creative," "succor," "verdant parapet") that reads slightly beyond a working gardener's idiom under stress, though the narrative frame allows contemplative remove. Sentence rhythm modulates with the work's phases (patient observation, hours-long concentration, standing with joints protesting), and the final paragraph's tone shift (from strain to satisfied continuity) supports closure. No dialogue present. Free indirect thought is clean, and the voice remains character-particular without template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clear and largely propulsive, with vivid sensory anchors (mist, wet stone, spray) and purposeful diction. However, mild overwriting appears in stacked modifiers and slightly precious phrasing: "verdant parapet," "radiant hush," "insatiably creative," "luminous coral-gold that seemed to hold dawn itself." The essence-capture sequence ("consciousness stretched thin, weaving between") leans abstract where concrete sensory struggle would sharpen pressure. A brief paraphrase loop: "the work took hours" followed by "sun rose higher" restates duration without added detail. Sentence openings vary, paragraph rhythm breathes appropriately, and no major scaffold or template cadence disrupts flow. Figurative density is moderate and does not obscure causality, though one mixed vehicle ("grafting invisible branches onto a living root") blurs physical logic momentarily.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—gardener as essence-weaver across thin-reality thresholds—offers a fresh synthesis of horticulture and portal fantasy, avoiding stock chosen-one framing. The patient,craft-driven approach (decades of observation, learning to "see essence") transforms the typical save-the-magic trope through occupational specificity. However, the emotional and plot arc would largely survive if Esme were a different kind of artist (painter capturing light, musician preserving melodies) in a different liminal space; the pruner identity enriches texture but does not drive the structure's inevitability. The ending's iterative vocation ("other seeds to save") feels more like a mission statement than a risky, non-obvious closure image. Authenticity of vision is strong; no derivative echoes; the middle-ground safety (Esme succeeds without sacrifice or moral friction) keeps the piece from bold risk territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Esme's pruner expertise shapes her perceptual method (learning essence through patient observation, understanding roots/branches ignore human boundaries) and her choice to perform the essence-weaving. She drives the central action (kneeling, capturing, weaving, planting decision) across multiple beats. Setup is immediate (title, opening line). However, her wisdom functions more as assured competence than a trait that creates friction or constrains tactics—she proceeds without error, doubt, or a choice between conflicting pruner principles. The ending (picking up shears, smiling, continuing work) reflects her role but does not hinge on a pruner-specific decision with visible cost. Present in closure participation but as vocation-confirmation rather than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The heirloom seed anchors the mission from paragraph two, is handled physically (placed on wet stone, tucked away after), and accumulates meaning as Esme braids essences around it. It appears in three beats: introduction with backstory of the lost tree, the essence-weaving ritual, and the planting decision. The seed's transformation (now carrying "preserved essence" beyond genetics) is asserted rather than shown through changed appearance or behavior, but the narrative treats it as causally active—Esme's work would be meaningless without it. Closure linkage is strong (she tucks it away, will plant it in thin-reality soil). Swappability is low; another object (e.g., a cutting, a painting) would require reframing the genetic-plus-essence logic. Cost is conceptual (hours of labor) rather than a trade-off tied to the seed itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds is both method and premise: Esme's consciousness "stretched thin, weaving between the world of stone and water...and those other gardens." The concept shapes her tactic (finding essence-components in multiple realms, braiding them around the seed) and gates the story's central action. Setup occurs early (parapet as threshold, mist revealing other gardens). However, the mechanics remain abstract—what prevents others from doing this? what are the rules or costs of crossing?—and no on-page complication tests the weaving's limits. The act succeeds as described without reversal, so the concept enables rather than constrains. Closure depends on it (planting in multi-world soil), but the ending's charge comes from Esme's ongoing vocation more than a specific between-worlds friction. One causal role (essence-gathering) pushes it above ornamental but swappability is moderate (a different liminal access method would work).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Insatiably creative in her methods" is introduced as a label in paragraph two but never dramatized through on-page invention, improvisation under pressure, or a visible cost of creative excess. Esme's approach (patient observation, essence-capture through contemplation) reads as disciplined craft rather than insatiable drive. No moment shows her choosing a risky creative gambit over a safer alternative, nor does her creativity constrain or complicate tactics. The attribute could be removed without structural loss; her actions demonstrate patience and skill, not insatiability. Label-only mention in the first third; no middle or closure participation. Swappable with "methodical" or "devoted" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Succor (offering aid to something dying) is the story's explicit mission: "offered succor to something dying, had refused to let wonder fade." The action frames Esme's goal and her choice to perform the essence-weaving, appearing in setup (refusing the tree's vanishing), development (the preservation work), and closure (the planted seed as ongoing succor, "other essences to preserve"). However, "succor" itself is broad and passive—nearly any preservation or rescue act qualifies—so swappability is high. The narrative would function identically if framed as "rescue," "save," or "sustain." The term carries thematic weight (compassion for dying wonder) but does not create a unique tactical constraint or pivot. Two gates (setup, closure theme) allow mid-band; lack of middle pressure and high replaceability keep it from higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Capturing essence" is both named method and on-page action: Esme "began the work of capturing essence," then gathers color and wonder-quality from other gardens, weaving them around the seed. The concept is signaled early (paragraph five) and enacted in the central beat (paragraphs nine–eleven). However, the mechanics remain abstract—no physical tool, no described resistance, no cost beyond time and physical strain. The method succeeds as intended without complication, so it enables rather than tests. Closure depends on it (the seed now "carried...preserved essence"), but the final image emphasizes Esme's ongoing work rather than the capture-method's unique properties. Setup and closure participation allow low 5-band; lack of middle friction (no failed attempt, no choice between capture techniques) and high abstraction limit higher scoring. Swappable with "distilling," "imprinting," or similar essence-transfer verbs.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The verdant parapet beside the waterfall is introduced in the opening line and functions as the story's sole location and gateway. Its "threshold" geography (where reality thins, mist reveals other gardens) enables Esme's essence-gathering by providing visual/spatial access to alternate realms. The wet stone affects her physically (aching knees), and the waterfall's "radiant hush" sustains atmospheric coherence and appears in the closing image. Setup, development (she kneels on it, uses it as working platform), and closure participation (waterfall continues, other gardens still visible) are all present. However, the parapet itself is largely static backdrop; no feature of the setting forces a tactical choice or constrains her method—she could perform the same work on any thin-reality threshold. The waterfall's constancy supports tone but does not complicate action. Moderate irreplaceability (the mist-shimmer is load-bearing) and strong closure linkage push it into the 7-band despite limited pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Upon the hush of budding hope" (early spring) is mentioned as present context but never tightens decisions or creates urgency. The dawn-to-mid-morning arc provides loose temporal scaffolding (mist clings, sun rises, hours pass), but no clock pressures Esme's work—she could take longer or stop without stated consequence. The spring timing thematically aligns with renewal/hope but does not constrain tactics or alter outcome. Setup is present (paragraph four), but middle and closure participation are absent; the ending's "work, as always, continued" implies iterative cycles, not season-driven stakes. Vague and untracked as a forcing mechanism. Swappable with any season or time of day. Functional presence for atmosphere but replaceable for structure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Preserving "the color of wonder" is Esme's stated desire (paragraph two: "refused to accept that its wonder should vanish entirely") and drives her multi-hour essence-weaving. The motivation appears in setup (lost tree's wonder), development (gathering "luminous coral-gold" and "catch of breath" quality), and closure (seed now carries "wonder it had inspired"). However, the desire is never conflicted—no moment shows Esme tempted to abandon the work, no trade-off between preserving wonder and another value. The motivation functions as mission statement rather than friction-generator. Told and enacted but not tested. Cost is durational (hours, physical strain) rather than a sacrifice tied specifically to wonder-preservation. Two beats (gathering, planting decision) and closure linkage allow mid-6-band; lack of want-versus-cost tension and high abstraction prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Radiant hush—"that particular quality of sound that wasn't quite silence but invited contemplation"—is introduced early, recurs as atmospheric anchor ("the waterfall's radiant hush remained constant"), and charges the final paragraph implicitly (the waterfall's "eternal song" continuing). Tone is coherent and contemplative throughout, modulating only slightly (patient observation, hours-long strain, satisfied closure). The hush functions thematically (liminal quiet enabling threshold work) and supports setting specificity. However, tone does not shift under pressure or create friction; the mood remains consistent rather than evolving with stakes. Setup and closure participation are strong, and the phrase's specificity (not generic "quiet") adds irreplaceability. Lack of tonal pivot or pressure-driven modulation keeps it from higher bands, but purposeful consistency and charged reprise in the final image justify low-7 scoring.</comment>
