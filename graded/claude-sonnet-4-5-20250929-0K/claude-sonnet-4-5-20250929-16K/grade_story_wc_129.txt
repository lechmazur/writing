<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sculptor's interiority remains primarily declarative—longing is stated rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. Her motivations are clear (seeking belonging), but internal conflict is thin; the search scenes demonstrate outward sympathy without genuine struggle or cost until the late realization. The discovery that the tag was always there gestures at self-deception but arrives as told insight rather than dramatized tension. Embodied emotion is sparse; crystalline tears and luminescent ache remain descriptive rather than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who/where/when established early). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the sculptor realizes the search itself was the point and grafts herself into community), but the cost remains conceptual and implied rather than visible on the page—no forfeited path or enacted price. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (weaving motifs of connection, weaving reeds, the search ritual), and the final image does reweight prior material. However, the revelation that "the tag had been there for weeks, perhaps months" lands as told retrospective rather than a dramatized turn that alters present stakes, weakening closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered with consistent sensory specificity (glass-like trees, iridescent soil, bioluminescent memory). The setting constrains the sculptor's search (teaching her "secret paths") and the arbor serves as the spatial anchor for community gatherings and the sculpture's placement, directly shaping the final image. Micro-setting via the reeds she carries and the crystalline fibers merges her past with present, charging closure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—belonging through grafting into community—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sculptor makes her public offer, raising social risk. The search itself generates communal pressure but lacks an on-page reversal or cost that narrows her options; the child's discovery feels coincidental rather than earned by protagonist agency. The final sculpture and realization fulfill the stake, but the path there is smooth rather than tested, and the price (her vulnerability, time, carried materials) remains abstract rather than viscerally felt in a pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme (belonging as shared searching, kinship as process not blood) emerges organically from the sculpture's ring of figures and the ritual search. The final image—woven reeds merging her past with their present—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates well in the community's repeated "finding" of the tag. One thematic echo appears ("webs of kinship spun not from blood but from shared wonder"), which borders on explicit statement but remains rooted in scene observation rather than sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization on the sculptor throughout. Perceptual signature is present (she notices reeds, weaving, textures) but somewhat generic in emotional beats. Dialogue appears only briefly; the elder's and young woman's lines carry distinct positions but lack strong subtext or rhythm variation. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("luminescent ache," "calcified into silence") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered, though the voice remains consistent. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high, with most lines advancing character or atmosphere. However, several phrasesLoop conceptually: "luminescent ache" appears twice, "webs of kinship" recurs without evolving pressure, and the "beyond the murmur" frame repeats at beginning and end as bracket rather than charged callback. Overwriting is present in stacked metaphors ("glass-like trees refracting light into prismatic shadows," "frozen smoke," "bioluminescent memory") that cluster without clear necessity. Clarity remains intact; no major scaffold or filter stacks. One paraphrase loop: "the search was the point" and "the searching itself" convey identical content in adjacent paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—artist seeks belonging in strange community via shared ritual—draws on familiar "outsider finds home" templates without strong transformation. The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor provide vivid surface detail but function primarily as backdrop rather than altering stakes. The turn (the tag was always there; the search is the bond) feels predictable in hindsight and echoes common "journey not destination" wisdom. Emotional specificity in the sculptor's loneliness and the mother's loss adds some texture, but the core arc remains median. No bold structural or perspectival risks elevate the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The marsh-reed sculptor appears throughout and makes two key choices: offering to dedicate a sculpture (middle beat) and creating the woven ring (closure beat). Both choices advance plot, but the second is execution of the first rather than a new turn. Her internal realization at the end reweights her understanding but does not alter her action—she completes the promised sculpture as planned. Present in setup, middle, and payoff; drives two beats; but swappable with any artisan seeking belonging.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glimmering obsidian arbor appears in at least four beats: initial gathering site, the sculptor's announcement location, the child's discovery beneath its lowest branch, and the sculpture's placement "at the arbor's base." It anchors the community spatially and charges the final image by housing both the search object and the created work. However, its properties (black branches, spiraling, "neither fully natural nor crafted") remain static description; the arbor does not constrain choices or evolve in meaning beyond serving as scenic anchor. Present in setup, middle, and closure; essential for spatial coherence but replaceable with any community landmark.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Webs of kinship is stated explicitly ("webs of kinship spun not from blood but from shared wonder") and echoed in the final sculpture ("a ring of figures, each touching the next"). It frames the thematic question but does not constrain on-page choices—the sculptor's decision to offer a sculpture and her learning of names and stories would function identically under a different thematic label. The concept appears in setup (framing her desire) and payoff (the sculpture embodies it), but missing distinct middle development where it narrows options. Present as theme but not as causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" is illustrated in one beat: "The sculptor listened, boldly sympathetic, approaching strangers without hesitation to hear their theories." This trait enables her participation in the search but does not face a cost or constraint—no moment where boldness backfires or sympathy conflicts with another need. Label-only mention without visible tradeoff. Signaled in setup, absent from middle development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Dedicate" appears twice: the sculptor's public offer to dedicate her sculpture to whoever finds the tag (middle beat), and the fulfillment when she "kept her promise" and "dedicated her art to them" (closure beat). The dedication structures the search's social stakes and motivates the final sculpture, which becomes the vehicle for her grafting into community. The action redefines her relationship to the group but is somewhat replaceable—any collaborative or gift-based gesture could serve similarly. Present in setup (announcement), middle (promise), and payoff (realization of belonging through dedication).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The shared search for the street artist's tag is the story's central method, driving multiple beats: community discussions of sightings, paired search excursions teaching secret paths, and the child's discovery. The search shapes attempts (sculptor learns names, stories, paths) and enables community bonding. However, the mechanics of searching remain vague—what specifically they examine, how they coordinate—and the tag's location ("beneath the obsidian arbor's lowest branch") is revealed rather than discovered through dramatized searching. The sculptor's participation is shown but the method itself does not constrain her choices; she could bond through any shared activity. Signaled early, sustained through middle, and present at discovery; but missing specificity that would make it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard provides vivid atmosphere (glass-like trees, iridescent soil, translucent bark, fallen glass fruit) and supplies two materials: reeds the sculptor carried and "crystalline fibers from the orchard itself" that she weaves into the final sculpture. The orchard's "secret paths" teach the sculptor geography and enable bonding. The crater's edge location and bioluminescent glow set tone. However, the setting does not pressure choices—the search and sculpture could occur in any communal space with local materials. Present in setup, middle (materials gathering), and payoff (merged materials in sculpture); essential for sensory texture but replaceable for causal function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" appears as poetic frame at opening and closing but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. No clock or deadline pressures the sculptor's integration; "seven evening" and "long nights" mark duration but do not constrain tactics. The phrase evokes post-catastrophe setting but remains atmospheric rather than causal. Present in setup and echoed at closure, but missing middle development and any mechanism that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to graft oneself onto community is clearly stated ("she wanted to graft herself onto this community, to become a strand in their intricate tapestry") and drives the sculptor's offer, search participation, and sculpture creation. The desire faces mild friction—her outsider status and "loneliness that had driven her away from solitude"—but no on-page moment where belonging conflicts with another need or costs her something tangible. The realization at the end fulfills the want without visible sacrifice. Present in setup (stated desire), middle (pursuit through offer and searching), and payoff (achieved belonging); but missing dramatic friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" appears twice explicitly and is sustained through imagery of "crystalline tears," "quiet celebration...luminescent, aching with significance," and "bittersweet beauty of connection." The tone modulates subtly from isolation (opening) to communal longing (search discussions) to fulfillment tinged with fragility (ending: "fragile and fierce"). Coherent through turns and charges the final image by framing belonging as beauty-with-cost rather than simple resolution. However, the ache remains somewhat static—a consistent mood rather than a tone that escalates with pressure.</comment>
