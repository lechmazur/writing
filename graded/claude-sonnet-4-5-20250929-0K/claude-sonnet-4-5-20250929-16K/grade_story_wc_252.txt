<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's internal landscape is embodied through her careful movement and the weight she carries, with concrete particulars like "kelp sliding against her calves." The key choice—releasing the scrimshaw—emerges from her prior restraint, though the epiphany moment ("I was never meant to be a weapon") edges toward explicit self-diagnosis. The dampeners provide interesting constraint, but the final transformation relies heavily on declarative realization rather than accumulated contradictory action. The grief and "tender rage" are felt, yet the closure leans on Marina telling herself what she's learned rather than the reader discovering it through irreconcilable behavior.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, context by the second paragraph). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Marina's nightly ritual, the island's emergence, the scrimshaw discovery, and the whale's call layer toward a reweighting of her identity. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she renounces the fighter identity and accepts the dancer—with felt cost in the line "I was never meant to be a weapon." The cost is more emotional than tactical; the story would benefit from a harder external consequence tied to the release, but the reconfiguration is legible and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is vivid and purposeful: "barnacled rock," "anemones bloomed like fists," kelp as tactile presence. The disappearing island functions as both setting and constraint, tightening the window for action. The scrimshaw wedged between rocks and the whale circling below charge the final image. Sensory selection reflects Marina's practiced familiarity without tourist cataloging, and the tidal rhythm mirrors her internal release. The ending—touching each living thing softly—uses micro-setting (tidal pools) to embody the shift, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint on choice and closure charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>One dominant stake is clear: Marina's need to release the grip of her brother's death and the fighter identity. The scrimshaw discovery and whale's call provide one meaningful deepening that narrows her to a binary—hold or release. The Treaty and dampeners create background pressure, though they function more as setup than active complication. Agency is present in the choice to speak aloud and release the bone, foreclosing the protector role with visible cost (the sinking island, the departure of the whale). Escalation is moderate; the piece would score higher if the cost of releasing had immediate tactical consequence rather than solely interior reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the dancer nickname, the dampeners that sever violence but not "the harder emotion beneath," the scrimshaw as relic of the crew that abandoned her brother. The release of the bone and the line "I was never meant to be a weapon" risk summary, yet the final image—touching each living thing softly—answers the thematic question without moralizing. "Combative tenderness" as the story's conceptual frame is integrated rather than imposed. The whale's call and Marina's walking home through tidal pools create resonance, though one beat ("the furious love she still felt, the tender rage") flirts with abstract phrasing that the surrounding embodiment rescues.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited with tight focalization; Marina's perceptual signature is consistent (grace, careful attention, the dancer moniker internalized). Diction stays within her lexicon—practical, lyrical in image rather than elevated abstraction. The line "I was never meant to be a weapon" reads as spoken thought, character-plausible rather than authorial. Psychic distance compresses slightly at the epiphany but remains anchored to her body and the immediate stimuli (whale song, scrimshaw in hand). No head-hopping, clean filter use, and the prose rhythm modulates with her internal state. The final paragraph's syntactic simplicity ("touching each living thing softly as she passed") reflects earned stillness rather than template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and images are specific: "anemones bloomed like fists waiting to open," "kelp sliding against her calves." Information density is high with minimal scaffolding. One paraphrase loop appears: the "guarded heart" and "heart locked behind iron gates" restate the same metaphor across two beats without added pressure, triggering a −0.2 deduction. The line "the furious love she still felt, the tender rage of having no one left to fight for or against" stacks near-synonyms ("furious love," "tender rage") in a way that blurs rather than sharpens, costing another −0.3 for figurative muddle. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are strong, with no template cadence or major loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The neural dampener premise offers a fresh angle on the "warrior learns gentleness" arc, and the sublittoral setting is specific rather than generic coastal backdrop. The scrimshaw as pirate relic and the whale as witness/guide avoid stock symbolism through their concrete interaction with Marina's choice. However, the emotional trajectory—fierce protector releases grief and accepts her gentler nature—follows a familiar template, and the Treaty/dampener premise, while intriguing, remains largely backdrop rather than complicating the core turn. The ending's quiet resonance and the "combative tenderness" frame elevate execution, but the arc itself does not surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's grace and dock-worker identity frame the story from the opening line. Her decision to wade to the island, grip the scrimshaw, and release it with spoken acknowledgment drives all three major beats (approach, discovery, release). The trait appears in the final paragraph when she touches each living thing, reweighted from prowling to freedom. Removing her would collapse the entire causal chain and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The scrimshaw appears at the midpoint discovery, is gripped and warmed in Marina's hand (embodied interaction), and is released over the water in the climactic choice. Its carved scenes (ship, figures, whale) directly cue her brother's death and the crew's betrayal, making it irreplaceable. The whale follows it down, linking object to method. Closure hinges on the physical act of letting it go; swapping for another keepsake would require wholesale rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The island appears only at lowest tide and surfaces early in the narrative, creating the time constraint that pressures Marina's ritual. It provides the stage for the scrimshaw discovery and sinks by full dark, foreclosing return. The disappearing mechanic is not ornamental—it defines when and where the climactic choice can occur. The final sentence ("the island was already sinking, would be gone by full dark") underscores the cost of her choice and the unrepeatable nature of the moment.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "unlocks guarded hearts" attribute is stated in the scrimshaw paragraph ("she felt her guarded heart begin to unlock") and echoed in the final section ("her heart unlocked and surprisingly spacious"). It enables the emotional shift but remains largely metaphorical rather than constraining a tactical choice. The unlocking is described rather than dramatized through contradictory action. Present in setup and closure, functional to the arc, but the mechanism stays abstract.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Detachment is seeded in the whale paragraph ("holding onto her brother...was keeping her from the only freedom left") and executed in the release of the scrimshaw. The spoken line "I was never meant to be a weapon" and the physical act of letting the bone slip beneath the surface together constitute the story's decisive change. Marina's realization that she must "detach...from the story she'd told herself" drives the thematic and causal resolution. The action is irreplaceable; no other choice would land this closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The whale's call is signaled midway ("A sound rose from the water, low and resonant"), shapes Marina's realization ("she understood suddenly"), and provides the auditory/physical pressure that prompts her to walk to the island's edge. The whale circles, calls again, and follows the scrimshaw down, completing the method's arc. Removing the whale would require a different catalyst for her insight and a different witness to the release. Present in two beats and integral to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe opens the story with sensory specificity (barnacled rock, anemone pools) and establishes Marina's embodied relationship to the littoral zone. The cold shallows, kelp against her calves, and tidal pools bracket the action. The island's emergence from "grey-green water" and the rock beneath her feet transmitting the whale's song give the setting tactile agency. The final paragraph—walking home through tidal pools, touching each living thing—uses micro-setting to embody the transformation. The setting constrains when the island is accessible and charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The Treaty and neural dampeners are established early and provide context for Marina's locked emotional state and inability to pursue revenge. However, the timeframe functions as static backstory rather than live pressure. The dampeners prevent certain pathways but do not tighten decisions within the present scene; Marina's choice to release the scrimshaw is not urgently shaped by post-violence temporality. The element is present and logically consistent but largely replaceable—her grief and need for release could exist without this speculative frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Marina's desire to find freedom is externalized in her nightly shore ritual, the wading to the island, and the choice to release the scrimshaw. The motivation is dramatized: she grips the bone, feels the unlocking, and chooses to speak her realization aloud before letting go. Internal conflict between "the fierce protector" identity and "the courage to be gentle" is present, though the insight arrives somewhat declaratively. The final paragraph's soft touching enacts the motivation's fulfillment. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure; drives the arc with moderate cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tone of combative tenderness is signaled in the opening (graceful dock worker with weapon-hands past) and named explicitly late ("combative tenderness of her true nature"). The oxymoron is embodied in "the furious love she still felt, the tender rage," and in the final image of touching each living thing softly. However, the tone reads more thematic than modulating under pressure; the piece trends lyrical-declarative rather than showing tenderness and combat in friction within a single beat. Present and coherent, purposeful in framing, but not dynamically charged across turns.</comment>
