<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The guard exists in superposition and seeks to cultivate possibility—clear motivation rooted in her altered state. Interiority is present ("her motivation had become singular") but remains abstract; we see few micro-choices under competing pressures. The final smile and song feel asserted rather than earned through on-page contradiction or cost. Embodied emotion is thin; much is told through concept rather than lived tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The piece accumulates pressure through the guard's singing, the chess clock warming, a wave function collapsing, and the clock ticking forward—one meaningful deepening that reweights the stake. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes her ongoing cultivation with undeniable pressure, though the cost remains conceptual and somewhat diffuse rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glowing dune, phosphorescent flowers, and cargo container supply vivid anchors. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (ash-dark sky, luminescent sand, equations that shift when observed). The dune blooms brighter as evidence of her work, charging the final image. The recurring environment constrains her method and supports closure, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly signaled: cultivate sparks where growth can return. One meaningful tightening occurs when the chess clock ticks and a wave function collapses, narrowing possibility into one branch. Agency is present but operates at a conceptual level—singing, pressing the clock—without visible friction or a trade-off that costs her something immediate and legible. The resolution feels open and ongoing rather than earned through a decisive fork.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action: hope fractured into possibility, quantum superposition as metaphor for resilience. The chess clock as threshold, flowers in multiple states, and "flames that didn't consume but illuminated" all build coherent resonance without overt moralizing. The final image—sparks cultivated in unlit corners—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of renewal. No thematic echo or label-speak mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "occasionally everywhere," "the equations sang back." Diction is elevated and lyric but consistent; no unmotivated register shifts. Psychic distance is controlled, and the guard's way of noticing (wave functions, probability fields) is character-specific. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue present to evaluate; the voice sustains pressure without slipping into filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high—most lines do double work (world-building + character state). Minor scaffold appears: "What mattered was the resonance" feels slightly explanatory, and "her motivation had become singular" tells rather than embodies. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language (amber specimen, quantum foam, probability fields) remains coherent and legible throughout, including at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The quantum-superposition premise is fresh and the guard's dual existence is integrated into character and world logic. Phosphorescent flora drawing nutrients from probability fields offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The piece commits fully to its speculative frame without retreat. However, the "post-apocalyptic cultivator" and "reality-bending archive" are familiar SFF templates; transformation through lived detail and moral calculus is moderate rather than exceptional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Present early; her choices (singing, pressing the clock) drive the wave-function collapse and the final ticking. Two distinct beats (opening scan, climactic button-press). Causal pressure is moderate—her actions enable the bloom but feel more ritualistic than contested. Closure linkage is strong (she smiles, sings, exists). Swappability is low; her superposition state matters. Cost is conceptual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Introduced early as frozen at midnight. Handled twice: described in paragraph two, then pressed and ticking in paragraphs nine and eleven. Returns with reweighted meaning—threshold, not ending. Shapes one key turn (the wave-function collapse) and charges the final image. Specificity is high (twin faces, midnight, threshold metaphor). Could score higher if the cost of pressing it were more legible.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Signaled in paragraph three; shapes her goal and the story's central mechanic. The archive contains all possible worlds; she queries it to find growth-viable branches. Appears in at least three beats (introduction, her singing to it, the collapse). Drives escalation and closure—without it, her cultivation has no source. Irreplaceable. Cost connection is implicit (accessing it changed her into superposition).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph four; constrains her existence (collapsed into singular presence only when observed). Enables one on-page moment: "standing occasionally everywhere and specifically here." The attribute is vivid but mostly descriptive; it does not visibly alter a tactical choice or impose a felt trade-off. Present in closure (she exists "in all the places") but more thematic echo than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Central action. She sings the fractured lullaby in paragraphs five, six, and twelve, making wave functions ripple and separate. The singing enables the archive query and the final bloom. Two distinct beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present. Irreplaceable—removing "charm" (singing to coax response) would break the story's logic. Could score higher if the cost or friction of charming were dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Signaled early (paragraph three); the archive is a collection of wave functions. The method matters—she accesses divergent paths, collapses one branch. Appears in paragraphs seven, nine, and ten. Shapes at least two attempts (the singing, the button press). Closure participation is strong (knowledge bleeds through quantum foam). Specificity is high; the mechanics are consistent and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Present from the opening line; the guard walks it, the flowers open on it, it blooms brighter as proof of success. Micro-setting that alters tactics: she sings "to the glowing dune, charming the reluctant earth." Appears in opening, middle (brightening), and closing image. Drives closure—the dune's bloom is the visible payoff. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Signaled in the opening: "since the last forest burned three years ago." Establishes the world state and the guard's dreamless condition. Does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; time is static context rather than active pressure. Present in backstory only; no mid-story or closure use. Functional but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stated explicitly in paragraph five: "to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners." Drives her choice to sing, to press the clock, to seek growth-viable branches. Appears in at least three beats and shapes closure (she will "cultivate them… until they grew into flames"). The desire is clear but not dramatized through friction or competing want. Cost is implied (months of wandering) but not viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and purposeful: lyric, elliptical, tinged with melancholy and quiet hope. The "fractured lullaby" metaphor appears in paragraphs five and twelve, modulating with pressure (breaking apart, reassembling). Charges the final image ("sang without resting… began, stubbornly, to bloom"). Rhythm and diction sustain the tone without static sameness. Strong closure linkage and thematic integration.</comment>
