<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The guardian's transformation is embodied through concrete detail (dirt under fingernails, fox-like movement on all fours), and her shift from feral to upright at the end carries visible cost. Internal contradiction appears in her struggle between civilized librarian and wild creature, though the initial forgetting of her name and dimension-shift lacks specific causal grounding. The final choice to stand and resume work feels somewhat predetermined rather than forced by competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract label-speak ("dimensional homesickness," "interiorizing exteriors") without full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she accepts her boundary-state role with visible physical cost (bones creaking) and the homesickness shifts rather than vanishes. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early through the mist/boundary imagery and pays it off when the library reveals itself. Orientation anchors (library guardian, frozen garden, dimensional displacement) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. One tightening occurs when touching the pendant resolves the garden into the transformed library, narrowing her options to tending this impossible collection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen roses, thornbush, stone columns, and mist constrain movement and choice throughout (she waits, moves on all fours through specific obstacles). The pendant's position "three yards away" and the light-shadow boundaries on its surface provide concrete spatial anchors. The final transformation where shelves of frost-books appear charges the closure image by revealing the garden was always her library. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her altered perception (ice in hair, cold chain burning her sternum).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding and inhabiting her displaced role) is signaled early and tightens when she touches the pendant, forcing a choice about her identity. The piece accumulates pressure through her sustained waiting and physical degradation (forgetting, moving on all fours), then deepens understanding when the mist resolves into frost-books. Agency appears as endurance that forecloses return to ordinary existence—she accepts boundary-guardian status with visible cost (bones creaking, homesickness persisting). One meaningful tightening occurs; the resolution is earned by her practiced acceptance of uncertainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (boundary existence, befriending uncertainty) emerges through concrete particulars: frozen roses that neither bloom nor die, light negotiating with darkness, the guardian's hybrid feral-civilized state. The pendant functions as more than symbol—it's a tool that reveals rather than resolves. The final image of frost-books with flickering titles offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a moral: knowledge at boundaries refuses single-realm containment. "Interiorizing exteriors" borders on thesis statement but is grounded in her physical transformation (taking garden strangeness into herself until distinction dissolves).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV maintains stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. The narrative voice carries distinct texture through compression and lyric patterning ("wrong-dimensional garden," "foggy lucidity"). Perceptual signature is character-specific—she notices boundaries, light territories, system breakdowns. Some filter verbs ("understood," "thought of as") appear but fit the reflective register. The prose modulates appropriately from feral fragments to more structured thought as she regains uprightness, though occasional elevated diction ("staked claims," "tending these impossible collections") slightly exceeds her degraded state in mid-passage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (most lines advance situation and interiority). The piece avoids major loops, though "she had been/couldn't remember/couldn't recall" in paragraph two shows mild synonym cycling. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("boundaries where illumination met shadow" ties to premise). One metaphor strain: "veil of sleep" as travel mechanism is asserted but never embodied with sensory grounding. Propulsion maintains through accumulative patterning rather than causality, fitting the chosen lens. Minor template cadence appears in "she had stopped" repetitions (paragraph five).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The library-guardian premise and dimensional-displacement frame are familiar fantasy tropes, but the piece transforms them through specific detail: Dewey Decimal loss, fox-like movement, frost-books with flickering call numbers. The "interiorizing exteriors" formulation risks abstraction but is grounded in physical transformation. The cultist pendant arrives as unexplained convenience—it resolves without helping create the problem, though it unlocks rather than solves. The final synthesis (library exists in boundary-space, she guards it while feral) feels earned in hindsight by the sustained waiting and attention to boundaries, offering a non-obvious angle on "lost librarian" material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Present from title/opening and shapes two key beats: her sustained waiting (demonstrating patience learned from dimensional wrongness) and her final choice to stand upright and resume work. The feral state constrains her movement (all fours, fox-like) and alters her priorities (stops tracking time, practicing uncertainty-acceptance). Her decision to place the pendant and stand forecloses return to human-only existence with visible cost (bones creaking, homesickness persisting). The trait could be more irreplaceable—"displaced librarian" would function similarly with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Appears early (paragraph two) and returns at two beats: watching it for extended time, then touching it to trigger revelation. The pendant's properties (swaying without wind, light-shadow boundaries) tie to the core concept. Touching it narrows her options by revealing the library and burning cold against her sternum—physical cost on the page. At the end it "grew warm," approving her choice, reweighting its meaning from memorial to endorsement. Specificity is moderate; another boundary-object could substitute with edits to the cultist backstory.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Signaled early (paragraph two: "boundaries where illumination met shadow") and shapes her understanding throughout. The concept enables her final realization that the garden exists "in the space between waking and sleeping, between her dimension and another." It constrains her existence to boundary space and justifies the library holding "books from multiple dimensions." However, "boundaries of light" functions more as thematic frame than tactical stake—she doesn't actively navigate light/dark borders to achieve goals. The concept charges the closure image (flickering titles) but doesn't force specific trade-offs in her choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present from paragraph one ("terrible ache of dimensional homesickness lodging permanently in her chest") and returns at closure ("didn't leave, but it shifted"). The trait constrains her early state (contributes to feral degradation) and provides cost at the end—she must carry it rather than resolve it. However, it functions more as emotional label than enacted pressure; we don't see her attempt return or weigh dimensional options against each other. The homesickness is told and summarized rather than dramatized through competing pulls with visible behavioral trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Waiting anchors the entire narrative structure: she waits "for hours—or days" in paragraph two, has "been watching it" continuously, and at closure accepts she "would wait here, tending these impossible collections." The action defines her learned patience ("no longer fought the wrongness") and differentiates her from the cultist who "tried to cross deliberately." Her waiting is not passive—it's practiced acceptance that enables her to stand and work when the pendant reveals the library. Swapping "wait" for "guard" or "tend" would require restructuring her arc from active patience to static duty.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Named explicitly in paragraph four ("interiorizing exteriors: taking the frozen garden's strangeness into herself") and restated at closure ("had interiorized the exterior until she herself became a boundary"). The method explains her transformation from fighting wrongness to accepting it. However, the mechanics remain abstract—we see results (she moves like a fox, stops tracking time) but not the actual practice of "interiorizing." It functions as thematic label more than enacted technique. The phrase could be removed and her transformation shown through the same physical details with only the framing concept lost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Present from opening and pressures every choice: frozen roses she crouches among, thornbush holding the pendant three yards away, mist that thickens and resolves, stone columns the mist curls through. The spatial layout constrains her movement (she moves on all fours between obstacles) and the cold is embodied (frost on lips, ice in hair, cold chain). At closure the garden transforms into towering frost-shelves—the setting itself is revealed as the library, making it indispensable. The micro-setting (frozen flowers, specific distances) shapes her waiting tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Present as frame ("through the veil of sleep, she had traveled here originally") and returns in the final state ("awake within the veil of sleep"). The timeframe explains her displacement but doesn't create urgency or constrain tactics—she explicitly "no longer scratched tallies" and time "obeyed no familiar laws." The lack of temporal pressure fits the accumulative design, but the element functions more as conceptual boundary than active timer. Removing "veil of sleep" and stating "dimensional displacement" would preserve the story with minimal adjustment to her waiting or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Explicitly named in paragraph four as "her only coherent motivation" and drives her shift from fighting wrongness to practicing acceptance. The desire manifests in specific choices: stopping tallies, ceasing Dewey Decimal recall, practicing "interiorizing exteriors." At closure she has "made friends with the uncertainty," enabling her to stand and work with sustained homesickness. However, the motivation is more stance than dramatized want—we don't see her wrestle between certainty-seeking and acceptance in a single choice moment. The friction is sequential (was fighting, now accepts) rather than simultaneous contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Established early ("foggy lucidity of her existence") and sustained throughout with concrete correlates: mist through columns, thoughts "trapped mid-formation" in ice, memory loss blurred with time confusion ("third winter, or perhaps the thirtieth"). The tone modulates—clarifies when she touches the pendant ("mist suddenly resolved into shapes") then "settled into a comfortable fog through which she could see just clearly enough." This tonal shift from obscuring to functional fog charges the closure by making partial vision her working condition. The tone is essential to the boundary-state premise and irreplaceable without fundamentally altering the story's texture.</comment>
