<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Nadia's interiority is concrete and filtered through her cartomancer's worldview ("willingly perplexed by her craft"). The guilt-driven motivation is clear, but the final choice to "rush downward…hurrying home to trace new hands together" feels under-earned; the transformation from ritual understanding to actionable change lacks a visible on-page micro-choice that forecloses the guilt path with cost. The weeping alone in the kitchen three nights ago provides embodied emotion, but the peak closure moment remains abstract wisdom rather than a dramatized renunciation or decision that costs something immediate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through layered images (glade, cards, cracked saucer, tablecloth) toward a final reweighting. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Nadia gains "aching wisdom," leaves one card as vow, and descends with intent to "trace new hands together"—options are reweighted, though the cost reads more conceptual (lost time transformed into wisdom) than viscerally felt on the page. One meaningful deepening is present when the gap between traced hands "began to shimmer" and she sees lost time pooling, altering her understanding and future stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The midnight glade is vividly rendered with selective, purpose-driven detail: "silver-barked trees whose branches disappeared into distances that defied geometry," stars that "pressed close enough to warm her skin." The flat stone table and the cracked saucer at center function as micro-setting elements that charge the ritual moment. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the climb, ritual, and descent. The glade's "choking beauty" pressures Nadia's breath and charges the final release ("letting her breathe freely for the first time"), satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining perception and charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to find where lost time accumulates) is signaled early and drives the ascent and ritual. One meaningful deepening occurs when the gap between traced hands shimmers and Nadia sees lost time pooling—this reweights her understanding. However, the escalation relies more on revelation than on protagonist agency under pressure; the glade delivers the answer rather than Nadia wrestling a choice that narrows options with visible cost. The leave-one-card vow is a gesture, but its price (what she forfeits by leaving it) remains implicit rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (the accumulation and irreversibility of lost time, maternal guilt, work-life tension) emerges from concrete particulars: the cracked saucer, the traced hands with their gap, the card left as vow. The final image—descending to "trace new hands together"—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in the gap between hands and the "aching wisdom" that can't recover hours. The piece resists tidy resolution (lost time is gone) while opening future possibility, achieving thematic resonance. No overt thematic echo in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited; psychic distance is controlled and purposeful. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Nadia's cartomancer lens colors the glade ("time's true shape," "onyx ink…her deepest cartomancy"), and her professional idiom ("willingly perplexed," "certainty was the enemy of true knowing") remains consistent. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated and legible throughout. Narrative certainty matches what Nadia can know; the vision of lost time pooling arises from the ritual she performs. No dialogue on the page; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control supports the accumulative pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and purposeful with strong imagery: "veils of starlight," "clouds dense as marble," "lightning-bolt fracture." Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is steady. Minor overwriting appears in the opening ("onyx-ink cartomancer climbed through veils of starlight") and in stacked metaphors ("choking—so exquisite it squeezed her chest, made breathing an act of deliberation"), but these remain voice-motivated and legible. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. The final image ("rushed downward through the thinning darkness, hurrying home") uses near-synonyms ("rushed," "hurrying") in close proximity, a small momentum drag, but the closure beat itself is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—magical realism ritual to confront maternal guilt—synthesizes familiar elements (fantasy ascent, family custom, symbolic objects) through specific detail: the hand-tracing tradition, the cracked saucer from the dolls' tea set, the cartomancer profession. The "cloudbound repentance" frame and the vision of lost time pooling in negative spaces offer a non-obvious angle. However, the maternal-guilt-and-work-life-balance conflict is a widely used template, and while the piece clothes it in fantastical particulars, the emotional arc (ascent for wisdom, return with resolve to do better) follows a recognizable path. The glade's function as a place where answers are given rather than fought for reduces ingenuity at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Nadia's choice to ascend (setup), perform the ritual (middle), and descend with resolve (closure) frames the arc. Her decision to leave one card as vow is on-page and alters her stance, though the card-leaving is more symbolic gesture than a choice that narrows live options with immediate cost. Present in all three gates; causal role is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cracked saucer appears in beat one (Nadia carries it), beat two (placed at cloth's center, "blazed with cool light"), and is kept at the end, charged as a talisman of the ritual's cost. Its fracture mirrors the gap in the traced hands, and its pink-painted roses carry domestic intimacy. Specificity and recurrence with evolving meaning justify the score; it shapes the ritual's center and the closure's emotional weight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Cloudbound repentance" is named once mid-story ("Her cloudbound repentance had brought her here, guilt lifting her above the world to see clearly") and frames the ascent's motivation. The concept pressures Nadia's emotional state and drives the journey, but its mechanics—how repentance manifests as literal ascent—remain thematic rather than tactically constraining. Present in setup (implied by guilt-driven climb) and closure (she descends absolved), but not developed in middle beats as a force that alters her choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Willingly perplexed" is introduced early ("Nadia had always been willingly perplexed by her craft, embracing confusion as the doorway to deeper sight") and characterizes her approach to cartomancy. However, it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost; it remains a label for her worldview rather than a trait that forces a tradeoff in a peak beat. Functional but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Unfastening the leather cord and letting the cards fall occurs at the ritual's center, forming "time's true shape" spiral. This action triggers the next story element (placing the tablecloth over the cards), but the unfastening itself is easily swappable with another ritual gesture. It is present and functional in the middle beat, contributing to the ritual sequence, but not irreplaceable or charged at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The family custom is introduced early (backstory in paragraph five), enacted on-page when Nadia places the pre-traced tablecloth over the cards, and the gap between traced hands becomes the story's central image at closure—where lost time pools and where future hands will "finally touch." The method shapes the ritual's mechanics, provides the dominant visual motif, and charges the final vow. Present in all three gates with high specificity and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The midnight glade provides vivid atmosphere and a ritual space that pressures Nadia's breath ("choking beauty…squeezed her chest") and releases it at closure. The flat stone table appears "placed there for exactly this purpose," offering a functional altar. However, the glade supplies revelation rather than constraining Nadia's choices—she ascends, performs, descends—without the setting forcing tactical adaptation. Present in setup, middle ritual, and closure release; atmospheric role is strong, but tactical constraint is limited.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Three months after the birth" anchors the timeframe early, and the infant's small hand ("three-month-old palm") sharpens the urgency of lost early weeks. The birthday "next week" tightens the decision to act now. Time pressure is felt (she left her daughter sleeping, she rushes home at dawn), and the irreversibility of lost time is the story's thematic and emotional engine. Present in all three gates; the timeframe drives motivation and charges the closure image of future birthdays.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where lost time accumulates" is stated early and dramatized through the ritual: Nadia sees time "pooling like water, collecting in the negative spaces of our lives." Her guilt over missed hours (feeding times, first smiles traded for clients) creates friction between her cartomancer work and motherhood, and the ritual confronts this directly. The motivation shapes the ascent, the ritual, and the final resolve to "trace new hands together." Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; visible cost is the aching wisdom that lost hours are irretrievable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Choking beauty" is introduced at the glade's materialization ("so exquisite it squeezed her chest, made breathing an act of deliberation") and recurs at closure when "the choking beauty…released her chest, letting her breathe freely for the first time since the birth." The tone modulates with pressure: suffocating awe during the ritual, release at descent. This tonal arc charges the final image and ties directly to Nadia's emotional state, satisfying both coherence and closure-linkage tests.</comment>
