<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mapkeeper's interiority is concrete and embodied through her ripple-mark tattoos and decades of cave knowledge. Her motivation to restore harmony is clear and consistent, driving her descent and the conjuring action. The "hammered repose" at the end reads as earned endurance rather than decisive change, fitting the closure form. Minor slip: the energy beings remain abstract obstacles without adaptation or resistance that would test her methods.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the mapkeeper sits in achieved balance, having restructured the caves' resonance with visible cost (exhaustion, the need to remap). The accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly—density increases through ice-pattern reading, harmonic layering, and the bloom's spread. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the echo stone warms and the bloom unfurls, reweighting the dominant stake with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The harmonic caves, ice gallery, and echo chamber stone constrain the mapkeeper's choices throughout. The frozen pool's crack patterns function as micro-setting, directly enabling her method and charging the final image with phosphorescence. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "gently luminous," "electric scream," "hammered repose." The ice patterns and geode structure are irreplaceable to the plot's hinge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring acoustic balance—is signaled early and tightens in the ice gallery when she threads harmonics through crack-revealed sequences. The bloom's expansion provides one meaningful deepening that narrows options (she must sit in exhaustion, will need to remap). Agency is clear: her humming and pattern-reading conjure the effect. The energy beings' lack of resistance or adaptation slightly weakens escalation, keeping this below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete image: silence as active presence, listening as power, fossils as memory. The final realization—"The quiet had been there all along, she realized. It had simply needed someone to remember where to look"—risks moralizing but is saved by the prior embodied work (ice, stone, humming) that earns the insight. The bloom of hush as "fullness that was simultaneously empty" offers non-literal resonance. No forced recurrence or token motifs; the ripple-marks and mineral striations anchor her identity without symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (acoustics, resonance, fossil memory). Diction stays consistent: "ripple-mark tattoos," "oscillation preserved in sandstone," "hammered repose." The echo chamber stone and frozen pool are filtered through professional expertise without Wikipedia intrusion. Minor slip: "gently luminous" recurs three times in similar phrasing, slightly blunting the textural signature under peak pressure. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Gently luminous" appears identically in three separate beats (lantern, ice cracks, final glow), creating a decorative loop rather than evolved meaning. The phrase "energy beings" repeats five times without variation, and "echo chamber stone" runs through multiple paragraphs with minor template cadence. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "bloom of hush," "hammered repose," "lightning caught in stone." The loops and scaffold prevent entry to the high band despite strong rhythm and clarity elsewhere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—acoustic mapkeeper restoring resonance through fossil patterns and harmonic conjuring—synthesizes geology, music theory, and lyric fantasy into a specific, non-obvious whole. "Bloom of hush" and "hammered repose" are fresh coinages that serve character and theme. The transformation from mapkeeper-as-observer to mapkeeper-as-conjurer feels earned. Risk-taking in the non-linear accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mapkeeper frames the story, descends with purpose, examines the ice, conjures the bloom, and sits in exhaustion—four distinct beats. Her decision to hum the specific harmonics drives the climax. Early signal (opening paragraph), causal pressure (her knowledge enables the conjuring), and closure participation (she sits feeling the result) are all present. Visible cost: exhaustion, need to remap.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The echo chamber stone appears in three beats: carried in her pack with backstory, held against ice during examination, and warming during the bloom's unfurling. It enables her method (absorbing/reflecting frequencies) and charges the closure moment. Early signal (third paragraph), causal pressure (grandmother's use establishes credibility), closure linkage (warms as the bloom spreads). Specificity: quartz points tuned to frequencies matter to the plot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "bloom of hush" is named, explained as mapkeeper lore, conjured on-page, and observed spreading through the caves—it is the story's climactic action and redefines the energy beings' chaos into balance. It shapes stakes (can she achieve it?) and alters the outcome with visible cost. Early signal (paragraph seven), beat involvement (conjuring sequence, expansion), closure participation (the peace taking root). Irreplaceable: removing it collapses the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Gently luminous" appears three times: the lantern flame (paragraph nine), the ice cracks (paragraph twelve), and implicitly in the final glow. It enables low-disturbance observation in darkness and charges the final image. The trait constrains her method (she needs non-disruptive light) but does not impose a visible cost or tradeoff. Present in setup, development (ice examination), and closure (arms reflecting glow), meeting two gates. Lyric reprise reweights the stake slightly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Conjure" names her climactic action: she hums, finds harmonics, and unfurls the bloom of hush. This act is irreplaceable—swapping it would break causality. Early signal (paragraph seven: "trying to conjure"), causal pressure (her voice and stone together create the effect), closure participation (the bloom spreads, restructuring resonance). The conjuring redefines the story's options and carries exhaustion as cost. Three beats: attempt, expansion, aftermath.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Examining crack patterns in ice is the method that reveals the harmonic sequence she needs. It appears in two beats: tracing with her finger (paragraph ten) and overlaying patterns in her mind (paragraph eleven). Early signal (paragraph ten), causal pressure (the cracks form "a language" that guides her pitch adjustments), closure linkage (the cracks glow as the bloom spreads). Specificity: the method is tied to her expertise and irreplaceable to the plot's hinge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are present in every paragraph: they frame the problem (shattered acoustics), guide her descent (seeking older chambers), provide the ice gallery and frozen pool, and are restructured by the bloom. Setting supplies the method (crack patterns) and the closure image (peace taking root in stone). Early signal (opening line), beat involvement (descent, examination, bloom spread), closure participation (caves breathe differently). Irreplaceable: the story's logic depends on acoustic geology.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the energy beings arrived" establishes the inciting disruption and the dominant stake (restore pre-arrival harmony). It is named in paragraph two and drives her motivation throughout. However, it does not create urgent time pressure or a ticking clock that alters tactics. Present in setup and implied throughout, but not visibly tightened or paid off with time-based cost at closure. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the quiet in the storm" is dramatized through her descent, her use of the echo stone, and her conjuring attempt. She seeks the bloom of hush explicitly (paragraph seven) and achieves a version of it. The motivation is signaled early (paragraph three), tested by the energy beings' frantic vibrations, and fulfilled with cost (exhaustion, future remapping). Friction between goal and difficulty is clear; the final realization ("quiet had been there all along") reweights her search.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Hammered repose" appears once in the penultimate paragraph as a metaphor for her exhaustion and the achieved balance. Tone throughout is contemplative and textural, modulating from discord (electric scream) to calm (balanced breath). The phrase charges the final image but does not constrain earlier choices. Present in closure, purposeful, but not threaded through beats. Lyric reprise of "gently luminous" supports tonal coherence. Two gates (development, closure), strong closure linkage.</comment>
