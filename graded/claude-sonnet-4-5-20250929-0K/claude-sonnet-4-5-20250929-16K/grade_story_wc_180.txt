<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and well-embodied ("surprised by her own admission"), and her hierarchy of values—craft over family—drives her choices with visible regret. Lisel's resentment is earned and her manufactured eye with "hairline fractures" becomes a physical manifestation of neglect. The final choice to work together forecloses the old isolation with felt cost, though the renunciation could land harder. Minor slip: "endearingly feisty" reads label-only in its single appearance rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (Mara, crumbling stairs, searching six months). The drive lens is Causal with accumulative texture: Mara's broken vows → Guild notice → search → confrontation → shared work, each step narrowing options. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): tying the ribbon around both wrists creates a new, deliberate vow with visible cost (forsaking solitary craft for collaborative teaching). One meaningful tightening when Lisel's accusation forces Mara's admission and tool-sharing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The impossible orchard—gnarled trees threading roots through stone and timber, fruit among crossbeams—pressures Mara's climb and provides the medicine-growing context that bridges their crafts. Spatial choreography is clean: branch by branch, beam thirty feet up, legs dangling. The half-finished quartz eye as micro-setting object charges the final teaching moment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "ripening pears and old incense," "dappled sunlight," "copper hair in a practical braid." The orchard constrains movement and enables the closure collaboration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bridging the generational rift—is signaled early and tightens when Lisel's fractured eye becomes both accusation and opportunity. Mara's climb and admission are protagonist-driven agency; the unfinished eye's geometry flaw ("perfection makes them look dead") deepens the thematic pressure. The ribbon-tying forecloses solitary mastery with visible cost: Mara must share control and learn from Lisel's wild methods. One clean reversal when Mara admits fault rather than defending her vows, altering the power dynamic and opening collaboration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—legacy through shared imperfection rather than solo mastery—emerges organically from the flawed quartz eye and deciduous vows. The final image of "carefully flawed craft" and apples ripening overhead answers the opening's broken promises with earned synthesis. Minor drag: "Wisdom falls when it's ready, like leaves" is flagged by the narrator as "not meaning to sound profound but somehow landing there anyway," a meta-hedge that slightly undercuts the resonance. Subtext operates well in gesture (ribbon around wrists) and the bottles of rainwater as parallel craft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single POV holds cleanly; Mara's perceptual signature—seeing geometry, angles, facets—is consistent and voice-specific. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: Lisel's "I told Mother I didn't want to be found" and Mara's "You're right" carry subtext (resentment, admission). Diction remains within Mara's artisan register without drift. Free indirect style is clean. Minor note: "endearingly feisty nature" briefly slips into narrator observation rather than Mara's precise lens, but the lapse is brief and does not recur.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is strong; rhythm varies naturally and syntax accelerates under pressure ("breathing hard," "fumbled with her bag"). Information density is high: most lines do double duty (the ribbon is both object and emotional anchor; the orchard is setting and thematic mirror). Minor scaffold: "Among the usual tools—grinding stones, polishing cloths, calibration rods—her fingers found something forgotten" uses a list interrupter that slightly stalls momentum. No loops or template cadence; figurative language ("apple blossoms," "fruit ripened") is selective and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard fusion and quartz-eye craft offer fresh specificity; the deciduous-vows concept transforms the broken-promise trope through seasonal metaphor. The resolution—mutual teaching rather than one-way forgiveness—avoids the predictable reconciliation arc. Risks are moderate: the impossible orchard and medicine-growing feel conceptually bold but are not pushed to structural extremism. Proximity check clean; no famous echoes. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat, though the ending's "carefully flawed craft" phrase edges toward thematic summary.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices—persisting up the stairs, admitting fault, offering the unfinished eye, tying the ribbon—drive every key turn. Her decision to repair Lisel's eye and accept collaborative teaching alters the final stance with visible cost (forsaking solitary mastery). Setup early, middle admission beat, closure participation through tool-sharing. Causal pressure: her craft and regret narrow options. Swappability low: the quartz-eye mender's geometry obsession is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ribbon appears in the opening ("the only thing her granddaughter had left behind") and returns at closure when Mara ties it around both wrists as a new vow. Two-beat use with reweighted meaning: from absence-marker to bond-symbol. Setup strong, closure linkage clear. Missing middle development: the ribbon is not handled or referenced between opening and ending. Swappability moderate: another keepsake could serve similar function with minor edits. Lyric reprise lifts score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Deciduous vows frame the premise (opening: "sixteen deciduous vows," "Meant to be shed") and shape Mara's justification for breaking Guild rules. The concept constrains her past choices and enables the thematic synthesis at closure ("a new vow, neither permanent nor thoughtless"). Setup strong, thematic payoff at ending. Missing middle causal pressure: the vows are discussed but do not narrow Mara's options in the confrontation scene. Cost connection moderate: the concept reweights the final image but does not force a visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Endearingly feisty" appears once as narrator label ("her endearingly feisty nature showed in how she crossed her arms") without constraining or enabling an on-page action with cost. Lisel's stubbornness is shown through dialogue and perch-balancing, but the specific attribute "feisty" does not alter tactics or outcomes. Ornamental use; swappability high. Late first appearance (mid-story). No closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Persist drives Mara's climb ("She persisted forward, branch by careful branch") and frames the collaborative resolution ("Then let's both persist"). The verb recurs with reweighted meaning: physical persistence becomes shared commitment. Two-beat use, closure linkage strong. Causal pressure moderate: the climb itself is necessary but the verb "persist" could be replaced with "continue" or "climb" without breaking logic. Specificity moderate; irreplaceability borderline. Cost connection: persistence forecloses retreat, enabling the final collaboration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The forgotten bag contents—the half-finished quartz eye—are signaled early ("her worn leather bag") and discovered mid-scene ("Among the usual tools… her fingers found something forgotten"). The unfinished eye enables the teaching moment and embodies the flawed-craft theme. Two beats: discovery and use at closure. Causal pressure: the eye's geometry flaw reframes perfection and opens collaboration. Swappability low: the specific mechanics (grinding stones, calibration, facets) are irreplaceable. Cost connection: offering the flawed eye admits past failure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral setting pressures every move: Mara's climb tests endurance, the thirty-foot height creates physical stakes, and the impossible trees provide the medicine-growing context that bridges their crafts. Setup immediate (paragraph 3), middle choreography (balancing on beams), closure participation (fruit ripening overhead as they work). Causal pressure high: the verticality and inaccessibility force Mara's vulnerability. Irreplaceability high: removing the orchard-cathedral fusion would collapse the story's logic and thematic synthesis. Specificity strong: roots threading stone, dappled light, glass bottles.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The breach-of-contract timeframe is signaled in the opening ("sixteen deciduous vows before the Guild finally noticed") and motivates Mara's search ("six months"). The past breach drives present urgency but does not create a live clock in the confrontation scene. Setup strong, middle pressure moderate (the search duration implies stakes), closure participation weak (time does not tighten the final decision). Swappability moderate: the story could function with a different inciting breach. Cost connection: the Guild's notice forces exile but does not narrow tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bridging generational wisdom is dramatized through conflicting wants: Mara's need to repair Lisel's eye versus her guilt over past neglect, Lisel's resentment versus her parallel Guild-breaking. The motivation shapes every beat: the climb, the admission, the tool-sharing. Three beats with escalating friction. Causal pressure high: the desire to teach and learn narrows options to mutual vulnerability. Closure linkage strong: "You show me what you've learned… I'll show you what I should have taught you years ago" crystallizes the bridge with visible cost (Mara forsakes solo mastery). Irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Accidental wisdom is embodied in Mara's meta-hedge ("not meaning to sound profound but somehow landing there anyway") and the unplanned discovery of the forgotten eye. Tone modulates from urgency (the climb) to vulnerability (the admission) to collaborative calm (the ending). Setup subtle, middle tone shift strong, closure charged by the ribbon-tying and ripening apples. The hedge slightly undercuts the tone's coherence by calling attention to itself. Cost connection moderate: the tone supports the theme but does not independently alter stakes. Swappability moderate: intentional wisdom would require only minor edits.</comment>
