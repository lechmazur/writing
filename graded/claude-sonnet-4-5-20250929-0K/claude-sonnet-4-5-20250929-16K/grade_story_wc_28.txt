<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vessa's interiority is concrete and embodied through her mechanical hands and retrocognitive gift. The choice to pocket the tessera demonstrates internal conflict between justice and mercy, though the motivation relies heavily on reflective exposition rather than real-time pressure. The final renunciation carries visible cost—she accepts the burden of hidden truth—but the emotional progression reads somewhat tidy given the complexity of the moral calculus.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece follows a causal structure: Vessa discovers truth via retrocognition → weighs exposure → chooses concealment, creating a legible before/after. The closure lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost (carrying the truth as burden), though the escalation is primarily internal reflection rather than mounting external pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when she removes the tessera, foreclosing the path of revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The shattered sky and ancient plaza function as more than backdrop—the fractured atmosphere mirrors the moral fracture, and the mosaic tessera constrains the central choice by providing access to retrocognitive truth. Sensory details are selective and purposeful: "fractured light," "sounds like wind chimes made of knives," "warm coldness of metal on ancient stone." The environment charges the final image when Vessa walks away under the reconfiguring sky.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to expose Davos or protect survivors' need for heroes—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs: the Council's vote forces the decision to closure. The cost is legible (Vessa carries the truth as weight), though the escalation unfolds mostly through reflection rather than rising external pressure. Agency is clear in the final choice to pocket the tessera, foreclosing revelation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of the fractured tessera and the distinction between Davos's arson and heroism. "Aberrant mercy" is dramatized rather than stated until the final third, where it becomes slightly explicit. The closing image of the shattered sky "finding temporary harmony" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether redemption can coexist with hidden truth. The concept of forgetting serving better than remembering charges the ending without reduction to a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: "retrocognitively trapped," texture filtered through mechanical augmentations and moral sensitivity. Diction is controlled and distinctive—"gentle radical," "cradle empathy in arms of steel"—though occasional phrases edge toward prompt echo ("aberrant mercy" articulated in narration). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the retrocognitive vision and opening for the final reflective turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Opening and closing images are charged and specific. Minor overwriting appears in the reflection: "another weight in her steel hands" and "Perhaps that was the burden" deliver the theme a bit directly. One paraphrase loop: the "shattered sky" recurs four times with similar descriptive function, though the final recurrence reweights it successfully. Information density is high in the retrocognitive sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core synthesis—retrocognitive gift + post-apocalyptic empathy augmentation + moral choice about renaming—feels purposeful and specific. The "gentle radical" who weaponizes softness rather than armor offers a fresh angle on post-catastrophe survivors. However, the broader frame (protagonist with special knowledge must decide whether to expose a flawed hero) follows a familiar template. The transformation occurs through the specific details of augmentation and setting rather than the central dilemma itself.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vessa as "gentle radical" is established early, drives the retrocognitive investigation, and her choice to conceal rather than expose defines the closure. The character trait shapes tactics (seeking the tessera, examining the mosaic) and the final stance. Removing this specific characterization would fundamentally alter the story's moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The blue tessera appears in paragraph one, enables the retrocognitive vision in the middle, and is physically removed at closure to break the connection to the past. It returns with reweighted meaning: from evidence to burden. The object's specificity (from the minaret, blue-tiled, chipped) matters causally—its damage enables the vision, and its removal forecloses revelation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" is named explicitly in the text but also dramatized through Vessa's choice to forgive Davos's crime by concealing it. The concept shapes the central stake (exposure vs. concealment) and alters the final option set. However, the term itself feels slightly inserted rather than emerging purely from action, lowering integration slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Being "retrocognitively trapped" is established early, enables the discovery of Davos's true history, and constrains Vessa's options (she cannot unsee what the tessera reveals). The trait carries visible cost—she is cursed to see past damage—and drives two key beats: the vision sequence and the decision to remove the evidence. The gift is irreplaceable to the plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The renaming of the plaza drives the time pressure (monument at dawn) and defines the binary choice at closure. Vessa's decision to allow the renaming by concealing evidence forms the story's climactic action. The rename could theoretically be replaced with another memorial act, but it ties specifically to the plaza setting and provides clear before/after stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The chipped mosaic patterns enable retrocognition and are signaled early ("The chipped patterns on the mosaic stepping stone told her everything"). The method appears in the discovery beat and shapes the concealment tactic (pocket the tessera to stop the visions). However, the specific mechanism (why damage enables past-sight) remains unexplained, slightly reducing causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ancient plaza provides the tessera that enables discovery, houses the past crime (minaret fire), and will host the monument. The shattered sky mirrors the moral fracture and reconfigures at closure. The setting is not merely backdrop—its history and physical state constrain Vessa's choices and charge the final image. Removing this exact locale would break multiple causal links.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the great fire" establishes backstory that motivates augmentations and survivor culture. The time pressure (monument at dawn) tightens the decision window. However, the timeframe functions more as context than active constraint—no ticking clock alters tactics on the page, and "after the fire" could be replaced with another catastrophe without major revision.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To cradle empathy in arms of steel" is stated early, demonstrated through Vessa's augmentation choices (sensors for trembling, soft voice modulator), and tested at closure when empathy conflicts with justice. The motivation is dramatized in micro-choices (tracing the mosaic gently, considering survivors' needs) and shapes the final renunciation. The friction between this want and the cost of mercy is visible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Warm coldness" is explicitly named and embodied: "warm coldness of metal on ancient stone." The tone modulates through the piece—detached observation during retrocognition, warmer reflection on survivors' needs, cool resolve at closure. The oxymoronic quality charges the ending when Vessa's steel hands carry empathy's weight. The tone could be more implicit, but it coheres and supports pressure.</comment>
