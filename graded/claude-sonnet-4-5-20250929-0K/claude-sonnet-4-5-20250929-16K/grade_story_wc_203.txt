<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation (discovering what ceilings hide) is established with backstory grounding, and his skillful observation drives key choices. The ghost's interiority is clear and her desperation embodied through gesture ("clutched something small against her chest with desperate fingers"). However, Marcus's emotional arc is flat—he moves from assessment to discovery to documentation without internal friction or visible cost. The final reflection "some repairs had nothing to do with cables" reads as unearned wisdom rather than dramatized realization through struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the opening paragraph. The core causal chain—Marcus examines elevator → ghost reveals hidden evidence → Marcus retrieves photographs → ghost finds peace—is clear and motivated. Closure qualifies as Decisive Change (ghost released, truth surfaced) with conceptual cost (70-year injustice finally addressed). However, the closure effect lacks felt cost for Marcus himself; he experiences no meaningful tightening or trade-off, merely carries out a retrieval task. The mainspring barrel's fusion with the elevator mechanism is asserted but never constrains his actions or raises stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned circus setting is vividly anchored with sensory detail ("rust and old popcorn," "peeling paint and warped floorboards") and the pressed tin ceiling tiles with deliberate fracture patterns constrain Marcus's discovery path. Dust accumulation on cables is mentioned but never shown affecting his analysis. Spatial choreography across elevator shaft, ceiling crawlspace, and office floor remains clear. The horologist's mainspring barrel wedged in the pulley system charges the closure image when it loosens as the ghost fades, creating a resonant mechanical-spiritual link.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (uncovering hidden truth) is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marcus finds the photographs and understands the ghost's murder, narrowing options to documentation. However, pressure never escalates—Marcus encounters no obstacles, no competing demands, no cost to his retrieval. The ghost's revelation is cooperative rather than conflicted. Coincidence (the mainspring barrel just happens to be visible, the box perfectly preserved) enables rather than complicates. No agency-driven reversal tests Marcus's commitment; he simply executes a task.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (hidden truths in overlooked spaces, the weight of unresolved injustice) emerges organically from Marcus's profession and the ghost's plight. The "cracks in the façade" motif is seeded early (ceiling fractures as map) and returns with the mainspring loosening, though the connection feels ornamental rather than causally charged. The final line "some repairs had nothing to do with cables and counterweights, and everything to do with the cracks we learn to see" articulates theme directly rather than letting the image resonate. The "weightless burden" paradox is asserted in the prose but not fully dramatized—the photographs have emotional weight for the ghost, but Marcus carries them without struggle or transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is clean throughout with no head-hopping. Marcus's perceptual signature (reading buildings as books, analyzing dust patterns) is established and remains consistent. The ghost's dialogue feels natural and purposeful, carrying subtext in her desperate prayer-like gesture. Psychic distance modulates appropriately from analytical opening to the ghost's emotional revelation. However, voice texture is generic professional-observer rather than distinctly idiomatic. The final reflection shifts into elevated, thesis-statement register ("cracks we learn to see") that feels authorial rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and strong sensory anchors. Information density is high in the opening paragraph. However, template cadence appears in the ghost's exposition ("Before they came for me" / "About why they burned" / "About why they burned") and summary-only beats flatten key moments—"Marcus documented the photographs" compresses what should be a discovery beat. The phrase "weightless burden" recurs without developing new meaning. Minor filter-verb stacking ("Marcus followed her gesture, his skillfully observant nature catching") dulls immediacy in a key observation moment. No loops or paraphrase cycles, but momentum sags during the ghost's backstory dump.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise (elevator technician who sees ghosts helps solve a circus fire mystery) combines familiar tropes without transforming them through surprising choices. The ghost-with-unfinished-business and hidden-evidence-in-old-building beats follow predictable paths. Marcus's dual skills (mechanical + supernatural perception) are asserted but never create interesting friction or force a difficult choice. The horologist's mainspring barrel is a vivid detail, but its symbolic function (mechanical heart, loosening = release) is conventional. The story commits fully to its premise but takes no narrative risks; every element arrives when needed without complication or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus (elevator technician who sees ghosts) is present throughout and his dual skills frame the narrative. However, his ghost-sight enables discovery passively—the ghost simply appears and explains everything. His technical skill (analyzing dust patterns) is mentioned but never shown affecting his approach. He makes no difficult choices; the ghost directs him, and he complies. Present in closure as he descends with the photographs, but the ending is his professional task completion rather than a choice that costs him something. Functional but replaceable with any helper figure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The horologist's mainspring barrel appears early (wedged in pulley system), is handled in the middle beat (its hollow core holds the photographs), and returns at closure when it loosens as the ghost fades. Three distinct beats. However, its properties are largely ornamental—it could be any small hollow container. The mechanical-spiritual link (barrel loosens = ghost released) charges the ending image with symbolic resonance. Causal pressure is weak; it enables hiding but doesn't constrain Marcus's retrieval. Visible in closure but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Cracks in the façade" appears as literal ceiling fractures forming a map, guiding Marcus to the hidden box. Present in setup and development, shaping one choice (where to look). However, it functions as helpful signpost rather than constraint. The metaphorical resonance (structural cracks reveal hidden truths) is asserted in the final line but not dramatized through Marcus's arc—he experiences no façade-cracking of his own beliefs or defenses. The concept is more thematic echo than stake-shaping force. Functional but one-dimensional.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Skillfully observant" is established with backstory (reading dust patterns, finding grandmother's letters) and label-mentioned when Marcus spots ceiling fractures. However, the trait is told rather than demonstrated through on-page constraint or tradeoff. We never see his observation method in action (the dust analysis is mentioned but not shown). No visible cost or limitation—hyper-competence without struggle. Present but not meaningfully tested. The attribute enables but doesn't complicate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Engage" (with the ceiling) drives the middle turn when Marcus removes tiles and finds the hidden box. Present in development and causally linked to discovery. However, the action itself is generic retrieval; "engage" could be replaced with "search" or "investigate" without changing story logic. The specificity (removing pressed tin tiles to access crawlspace) adds texture but the mechanical engagement doesn't create friction or cost. Functional and present across beats but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Analyzing dust accumulation patterns" is mentioned in the opening paragraph as Marcus's skill but never shown on the page. He examines cables and spots the mainspring barrel, but we don't see dust analysis affecting his conclusions or shaping his approach. The method is setup-only, absent from development and closure. Ornamental mention that establishes competence without dramatized application. Could be cut without altering any beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office provides vivid sensory anchors (rust, popcorn smell, warped floors, grimy windows) and its vertical architecture (elevator shaft, ceiling crawlspace) structures Marcus's physical investigation. The setting enables the ghost's appearance (she appears when fluorescent buzz dies) and supplies the material constraint (ceiling tiles, shaft access) that shape his retrieval method. Present in all three beats and the ending descent. The circus history provides thematic resonance (burnt big top, dead performers). Essential to the story's spatial logic and atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"When the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off" triggers the ghost's appearance, establishing a clear before/after threshold. Present in setup (ghost appears) and echoed at closure (lights hum back to life as ghost fades). However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions or create urgency—Marcus has unlimited time to investigate. The buzz/silence serves as atmospheric cue rather than pressure device. Functional marker but not a ticking clock that alters tactics. Lyric reprise at closure adds resonance without causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover what ceilings hide" is established with backstory (grandmother's letters in false panels) and drives Marcus's willingness to investigate the crawlspace. Present in setup and directly shapes the development beat (he climbs to search). However, the motivation faces no friction—no competing priorities, no cost to his curiosity. The desire is stated and satisfied without complication. Present across structure but never conflicted or tested under pressure. Functional but one-dimensional.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Weightless burden" is invoked twice: the ghost's "weightless burden evident in the way she moved" and Marcus carrying "their weightless burden into the world" at closure. The paradox (emotional weight without physical mass) is apt for ghost story and captures the theme of unresolved injustice. Tone modulates from analytical opening to the ghost's desperate revelation to the quiet, elegiac ending. However, the phrase is asserted rather than embodied through Marcus's experience—he never feels burdened. Lyric reprise charges the final image but doesn't reshape prior material with new cost.</comment>
