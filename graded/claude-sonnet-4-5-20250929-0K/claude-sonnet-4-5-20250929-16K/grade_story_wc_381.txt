<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation is clear and consistent, but her competence is almost frictionless—she completes her task without genuine struggle or internal contradiction. The work lacks embodied emotion; phrases like "tranquil blaze of focus" and "smoothed hush" feel abstract rather than viscerally felt. No meaningful cost forecloses a path; she simply succeeds and smiles, making the ending feel more like wish fulfillment than earned transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with light Accumulative texture (gathering embers). Orientation anchors arrive early enough. The closure—crumbling wing, erased journal, world saved—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual only (ignorance as salvation) without visible sacrifice or foreclosed option for the protagonist herself. The prophecy's spread and reversal follow because/therefore logic, but the summoner's seventeen-year solitude and her grandmother's teachings feel like convenient setup rather than pressure that tightens choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the brook is anchored early and returns at closure (dawn sanctuary). Sensory details—cricket songs, rustling leaves, cool night air, burbling brook—are vivid and filtered through the summoner's trance state. However, the environment does not constrain a single choice; it provides ambiance but never alters tactics or imposes cost. The origami wing as micro-setting object appears in multiple beats and charges the final image when it crumbles, lifting the score slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hush the prophecy before alignment—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The summoner's method (tracing embers, offering peace) constitutes a single meaningful tightening as she gathers the prophecy back to its source. Yet there is no reversal, no moment where her plan falters or forces a trade-off; she simply succeeds hour by hour. The spilled-water ending solves the problem without dramatized resistance, and the protagonist's smile suggests satisfaction without visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (silence as salvation, ignorance as protection) emerges from concrete actions—mapping embers, dissolving prophecy—rather than assertion. The crane's wing recurs with shifted meaning (worn soft to dust), and the final image of the world's unknowing resonates. However, the ending borders on moralizing: "that ignorance, she knew, was the truest form of salvation" articulates the thesis overtly rather than letting the image speak. The thematic question is posed but answered too neatly without ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (prophecy as embers, consciousness as ripples) and voice carries a lyric, slightly elevated register consistent with the summoner's meditative state. However, diction occasionally drifts into stock lyricism: "whispered secrets that filtered through the darkness like smoke through silk," "tranquil blaze," "smoothed hush." Under pressure (the gathering sequence), the prose maintains its tone without compression or urgency shift, which flattens momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and carries a consistent lyric rhythm. Some figurative language is fresh ("roots drinking starlight"), but several phrases feel overwritten or abstract: "tranquil blaze of focus," "smoothed hush," "terrestrially cosmic alignment." Minor template cadence in the gathering sequence: "She touched…she offered…they forgot" follows a repetitive stem pattern. The final paragraph moralizes slightly ("that ignorance…was the truest form of salvation"), telling rather than trusting the image. No severe loops or artifacts, but density could be higher.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—reverse a prophecy by erasing collective memory—is a fresh angle on fate-versus-agency material. The summoner's grandmother's teachings and the "mapping silence" method add specificity. However, the execution feels templated: lone magical practitioner, forbidden texts, cosmic alignment, ancient code, seventeen years of solitude—these are well-worn genre furniture. The ending's ease (spilled water, crumbled wing, smile) lacks the friction or surprise that would elevate synthesis to inevitability. Transformation test marginal: swap names and setting, much of the arc remains.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The solitary summoner is present throughout and her choices (enter trance, trace embers, offer peace, blur the journal) drive all key turns. Setup early, involved in gathering beats, and shapes the ending. However, her isolation is told more than tested—no scene dramatizes the cost of seventeen years alone or forces her to weigh solitude against connection. She simply acts, succeeds, and smiles. Causal role clear but cost connection weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crane's origami wing appears in three beats: arrival (setup), handling during trance (middle use as anchor object), and crumbling at dawn (closure). Its worn-soft texture signals repeated handling, and its dust-form ending visually marks completion. However, the wing does not constrain a choice or impose cost—it is a messenger and symbol, not a tool whose properties alter tactics. Closure linkage and reprise earn mid-range; irreplaceability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Smoothed hush" appears as the summoner's offering to those who hold the prophecy—a "sensation of peace so profound that the prophecy's sharp edges dissolved into irrelevance." It shapes her method (trade peace for memory) but does not narrow options or create visible friction. The concept is present in one middle beat and echoes thematically at closure ("hushed the future itself"), yet its mechanics feel abstract rather than dramatized with cost. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic alignment" names the prophecy's event—stars positioning to open a barrier—but the trait itself does not constrain or enable on-page action. The summoner never confronts the alignment directly; she simply erases human attention before it arrives. The phrase is mentioned early and colors tone, but remains label-only without mechanical consequence. Present across beats as context, not as lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Flow" appears explicitly: the summoner's "awareness flowing through the night" and drawing the prophecy "back to its source." It structures the gathering sequence and links setup to closure. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown with friction—she simply flows, gathers, offers, succeeds. The action is central but could be replaced by "search" or "pull" with minor wording changes. Causal role clear; irreplaceability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is signaled early (grandmother's teaching) and explicitly named: "by mapping silence…one could see sound's inverse." It frames the summoner's method—tracing embers (sound) via the gaps (silence)—and appears in setup, middle trance, and closure (prophecy returned to silence). However, the method's mechanics remain abstract; no scene shows how silence-mapping constrains her choices or imposes cost. Functional across beats but not irreplaceable in specifics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the quiet brook anchors orientation early, returns at closure (dawn sanctuary), and the brook's "burbling became her anchor" during trance. The setting supplies a resource (calm focus) but does not constrain choice or impose spatial cost. Micro-setting (flat stone, satchel) is handled but static. Early setup, middle touch, closure reprise earn mid-range; causal pressure weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" as timeframe is metaphoric—the period when the prophecy spreads. It colors tone early and motivates urgency, but the text does not track a live clock or show time pressure tightening tactics. "Five days" until alignment is mentioned once but never resurfaces to narrow options. The summoner works "hour by hour" with no dramatized race. Present as context, not as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To hush a prophecy spoken in code" is the summoner's explicit goal, stated early and pursued across all beats to closure. The motivation is clear and consistent. However, it is not dramatized as conflicted—no scene shows her weighing silence against other values (connection, transparency, agency of others). She simply executes her plan without friction between want and cost. Causal driver present; internal tension absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is invoked by name once ("a tranquil blaze of focus") and the tone holds throughout—meditative calm layered with urgency. The prose maintains lyric distance even during the gathering sequence, and the ending's smile ("In her solitude, she smiled") sustains the paradox of serene intensity. However, tone does not modulate under pressure or deepen at closure; it remains static. Coherent and purposeful but without the cadence shift that would charge the final image.</comment>
