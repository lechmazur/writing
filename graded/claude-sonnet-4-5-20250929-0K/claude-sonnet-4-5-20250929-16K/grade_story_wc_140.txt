<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent—uncovering erased histories—but interiority remains abstract and declarative rather than embodied. "She'd been discovering the texture of memories wasn't smooth but rough, contaminated with lies" reads as thesis rather than lived perception under pressure. The protagonist makes no meaningful on-page choices that foreclose a path with visible cost; she collects and climbs but never faces a trade-off. The ending crystallizes purpose but doesn't earn a change or renunciation through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: who, where, and when anchor by ~120 words (woman, containers, low tide), so no deduction applied there. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—fragments layered toward a thematic reconfiguration. However, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the protagonist's tactics remain unchanged from first beat to last. The closure offers Charged Poise (keeper of erased histories) but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized on the page: no visible forfeiture, no option foreclosed, no price paid. The inferred lens holds, but the closure lacks felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The container labyrinth and tide rhythm create vivid, purposeful atmosphere. The poison label anchors the inciting discovery, and the port's spatial choreography (roof, lowest level, high tide retreat) remains clear and functional. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image beyond mood; the protagonist moves freely without environmental friction. Strong sensory detail and consistent world logic elevate the score, but the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges closure) is not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resurrecting buried truths—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Yet no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options: she collects fragments in paragraph two, collects more in paragraphs four through six, and continues collecting at the end. The resolution ("she would continue her work") is stasis without visible cost or trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required; the piece offers thematic accumulation but no pressure escalation that forecloses a path or changes tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—erasure, silencing, toxic truths—emerges organically from the protagonist's arc and the container/tide imagery. The poison label and "legally dead" status function as charged particulars rather than symbols-for-hire. The final image ("keeper of erased histories") offers resonance but hovers close to thesis statement rather than non-literal answer. No overt moralizing, and the complexity (whistleblower consequences, complicity of forgetting) resists binary resolution. Strong thematic coherence, but the ending articulates rather than dramatizes the central question's answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person-limited with consistent perceptual signature: "filter reality differently," "sedimentary evidence," "texture of memories." Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, though some phrasing ("the woman who didn't exist") reads slightly overwritten. The dock workers' dialogue is brief but naturalistic. Minor register drift: "repository of erased histories" and "illegally buried" elevate diction beyond the gritty port setting at peak moments. No head-hopping, and psychic distance is coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm, but several patterns accumulate: "She'd been discovering," "She'd been a whistleblower," "She'd fled" repeat the past-perfect scaffold. "Fragments" appears seven times, creating lexical monotony. The phrase "those who'd resisted had their histories erased more permanently" and the immediate reveal "Like hers" form a paraphrase loop. Figurative density ("sedimentary evidence," "texture of memories," "contaminated with lies") clusters without pattern-teaching or payoff. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and loops, plus −0.3 for register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "legally dead whistleblower living in shipping containers" premise offers a specific, non-obvious angle. The tide rhythm as narrative clock and the container labyrinth as archive are fresh inflections. However, the emotional arc (outsider collects evidence of institutional wrongdoing, vows to continue) follows a recognizable template without transformative risk. The poison label and erased identity integrate well but do not surprise in hindsight. Solid synthesis of elements, but the piece plays it safe rather than taking a bold structural or thematic leap.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The death-certificate-error survivor frames the entire premise and appears in the opening, middle backstory, and closing vow. However, the protagonist makes no key on-page choices that turn because of this status; it enables her invisibility but doesn't force a trade-off or constrain tactics. Present across beats but more attribute than active choice-driver.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The poison label appears early (inciting discovery), reappears mid-story as "talisman," and is tucked back into the notebook near the end. It seeds the investigation but does not return with reweighted meaning or constrain a choice at closure. Two touches (discovery, reprise) meet minimal use, but the label remains static rather than evolving or charging the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Erased histories shape the dominant stake and drive every beat: the plant scrubbed from records, the protagonist's voided identity, the workers' silenced stories. The concept alters tactics (she collects fragments to layer evidence) and charges the closing vow. Present in setup, middle development, and closure, with causal pressure throughout. Does not quite reach indispensability because the story could function with a slightly different injustice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Filters reality differently" is named in the opening and once more as "filter reality through the cracks" but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The trait remains label-only; we don't see her perception differ in a way that forecloses an option or creates friction. Mentioned but not dramatized through choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Layer" appears explicitly ("layered each whisper," "layered like sedimentary rock") and structures the accumulative logic. The action shapes the middle beats and the closing vow to continue. However, no major turn traces uniquely to layering; she could "compile" or "assemble" with minor edits. Present across beats with causal relevance but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Collecting fragments of overheard stories is signaled in paragraph two, executed in paragraphs four through six (dock workers, old woman), and restated at closure ("collector of toxic truths"). The method drives every attempt and shapes the protagonist's tactics (positioning in shadows, moving with tides). Mechanics matter: eavesdropping at low tide, notebook in hand. Essential to the story's logic and present at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The container labyrinth provides spatial structure (roof vantage, lowest level, shadows between boxes), enables the protagonist's invisibility, and symbolically mirrors the stacked, erased histories. The setting constrains movement (tide rhythm governs access) and charges the final image (container home). Present in setup, pressures middle choices, and anchors closure. Removing the containers would fundamentally break the story's spatial and thematic logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Tide rhythm is named early ("low tide," "high tide," "spring tide," "evening tide") and structures the protagonist's appearances, but it does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than a live clock; no choice is forced by an approaching tide. Present across beats but functions more as setting texture than pressure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Discover the texture of memories" appears mid-story as reflection and is restated at closure ("texture of memories wasn't smooth"). The desire frames the investigation but is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice. No visible friction between the want and a cost; she collects without obstacle or trade-off. Present but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Nameless identity is established in the opening ("no name anymore"), sustained through "the Ghost" epithet, and anchors the closing paradox ("The nameless would speak"). Tone is coherent—quiet, elegiac, determined—and modulates with the backstory revelation. The tone charges the final image (legally dead resurrecting the buried) but does not shift under pressure; it remains static throughout. Present at closure with thematic weight but no dynamic range.</comment>
