<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is concrete and her motivation—carrying thirteen lives—drives her return visits, but her choices lack genuine conflict or cost. The entangled memories provide texture yet never create contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; she moves through the garden in smooth contemplation without meaningful internal friction. The "quietly rebellious" trait is mentioned but doesn't constrain a choice with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present ("her fingers ached") but the peak beats lean toward poetic summary rather than decisions under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Maya enters, drums, remembers, and leaves with density building through layered imagery. Orientation anchors clearly (Maya, garden, pre-dawn) within the first paragraph. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she will "return tomorrow night to make them sing again"—with the felt cost of carrying thirteen lifetimes and the weight of "auroral sorrow." One deduction: the final paragraph's "Because that's what guinea pigs do" shifts into overt thematic summary rather than letting the image carry the cost, weakening closure purity by ~0.3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly realized with purposeful sensory detail: "visible ripples," "colors that shouldn't exist," the auric lagoon as "liquid gold" made of overlapping frequencies. Setting constrains Maya's ritual (she must come during silent hours, drum to activate the garden) and charges the final image when the lagoon "faded back to ordinary silence." Spatial choreography is clean (gate, path, lagoon rim, return path). The micro-setting of her hands on the stone rim and the drumming surface functions as both body and tool, grounding the abstract concept in tactile action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the entangled memories can persist and matter—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maya moves from solitary drumming to feeling "them all with her" at the lagoon, then the universe exhales and the moment passes, narrowing her to the knowledge that she must return repeatedly. The cost is legible (bearing thirteen lifetimes, the ache in her fingers, the ephemeral nature of contact), but Maya's agency is more endurance than decision; she doesn't foreclose a live option so much as reaffirm a ritual, which under Accumulative lens is acceptable but trends toward the middle of the band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory as preservation, the cost of carrying others' lives, the intersection of sound and existence—emerges through concrete imagery (the drumming, the lagoon, the "symphony of selves"). The final line attempts to answer the thematic question ("they survive the experiment, and then they prove what's possible") but edges into overt statement rather than pure resonance. The "auroral sorrow, beautiful and crushing" phrase is vivid yet borders on decorative; the story would benefit from letting the fading lagoon and her return commitment carry the weight without the guinea-pig meta-commentary. No token motifs; the sound waves and drumming recur with purpose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature: Maya notices sound made visible, remembers dual timelines, filters the world through her entangled consciousness. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("quietly rebellious," "cosmic hush," "tissue paper"). One friction: the narrator occasionally drifts into elevated, writerly register ("auroral sorrow," "cathedral of vibration") that, while beautiful, risks pulling away from Maya's immediate lived experience in peak moments. Psychic distance is intentional and serves the lyric accumulation, though some lines read more as authorial poetry than character-specific perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with strong imagery and varied syntax, but several artifacts lower the score. Paraphrase loop: "The garden existed only for patients like her—experimental treatment guinea pigs" immediately followed by detailed explanation of what we just learned. Template cadence in paragraph four: "remembered being five and eighty-three simultaneously, remembered a first kiss... remembered learning to walk and learning to use a walker" stacks three identical stems without tension. The phrase "auric lagoon" appears five times, crossing from motif into repetitive anchor. Minor filter-verb stack in paragraph seven ("she felt them all with her") during a peak beat. These accumulate to −1.2 total within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The entangled-memory premise offers a fresh angle on grief and preservation, and the sound-made-visible garden is vividly particular. However, the core emotional arc—visiting a memorial space to commune with the dead—is familiar, and the story doesn't fully transform it through Maya's unique synthesis. The drumming method and the "quietly rebellious" visit during forbidden hours add texture but feel somewhat ornamental rather than driving inevitable turns. The final guinea-pig line pulls the premise toward prompt-fulfillment rather than organic closure. Solid specificity in world-building (frequencies creating illusions, memories via vibration) elevates the piece but doesn't reach the non-obvious synthesis that would warrant higher originality scores.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya is identified as an "experimental treatment guinea pig" in paragraph one and this status motivates her access to the garden and her burden of carrying thirteen lives. The trait shapes two beats: her decision to come during forbidden hours and her commitment to return. It appears in the final line ("that's what guinea pigs do") to reweight her endurance. However, her choices within the scene are more ritual than turn; she doesn't face a decision that tests or costs her this role. Present in setup, development (implicit in her actions), and payoff, qualifying for mid-band; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The auric lagoon appears in paragraph five (setup), Maya sits at its edge and drums against it (development—one distinct beat of interaction), and it "blazed brighter" then "faded back to ordinary silence" at closure (payoff with reweighted meaning). It is handled physically (palms against surface, drumming on stone rim) and its changing state (bright to faded) marks the story's emotional arc. The lagoon is not easily swappable—its sound-based illusory nature ties directly to the memory-entanglement premise. All three gates present; causal involvement in two beats; closure linkage strong. Specificity high but could be more irreplaceable (another liminal space might serve similar function with edits).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Entangled memories are introduced in paragraph one, constrain Maya's experience throughout (dual timelines, thirteen voices), and directly shape the middle beat where she feels all donors present. The concept defines the stakes (can memory persist through entanglement?) and alters her perception on every page. It participates in closure when the moment passes and she accepts the need to return. Setup clear, development sustained, payoff present. Strong causal pressure and high specificity—remove this exact concept and the story's logic collapses. Minor friction: the mechanics are told more than dramatized in peak beats, trending explanatory rather than experientially immediate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Quietly rebellious" is stated in the opening line and justifies her forbidden visit, but the trait is label-only without on-page cost or constraint. We don't see her weigh risk, face consequence, or make a choice that tests this attribute; she simply arrives during silent hours. The trait does not recur or complicate later action. Present in setup but missing development and closure participation; decorative rather than causal. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; further lowered for label-only execution and lack of visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Perch" appears once in paragraph five: Maya sits at the lagoon's edge, "letting herself perch on the smooth stone rim." This enables her to place palms on the surface and drum, but the action itself (sitting/perching) is not load-bearing—"sit" or "settle" would serve equally well. The verb adds a small texture (delicate, temporary positioning) but does not create a turn or redefine options. Present in one beat with minor thematic coloring (provisional stance) but easily swappable. Cap at 3.8 for swappability; lifted slightly for its contribution to the lyric image of transience.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drumming is introduced in paragraph two ("began drumming on everything within reach"), drives the middle beats (sending ripples, building sound waves, coaxing patterns), and continues until the climax ("drummed faster," "drummed until her fingers ached"). The method is Maya's primary tool for agency, enabling her to activate the garden and "make them sing." It shapes at least three distinct beats and is present at closure (the ache in her fingers, the commitment to return and drum again). Setup early, development strong, payoff clear. High causal pressure and specificity—no other method would produce the sound-wave visuals or connect to the vibration-based memory sharing. Irreplaceable and essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is established in paragraph one, structures all action (Maya must navigate it, the garden "responds" to her drumming, its rules about silent hours create the forbidden-visit frame), and its fading at dawn closes the scene. Setting supplies the key resource (sound-sculpted reality) and constrains Maya's ritual (timing, method). It participates in every major beat and charges the final image when ordinary silence returns. Setup immediate, development sustained, payoff integral. Strong causal pressure, high specificity (few settings could deliver sound-made-visible mechanics), and closure linkage unmistakable. Just shy of indispensable because a different liminal space might serve with heavier rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "at the hush of the universe inhaling" is metaphorically rich and established in paragraph one, creates the urgency for Maya's visit (she must come during this brief window), and the ending explicitly marks the moment's passing ("until the universe exhaled and the moment passed"). However, the time pressure is more poetic than tactical—there is no visible countdown or cost tied to staying too long versus leaving earlier. Setup clear, payoff present, but development is weak; the time doesn't tighten her choices within the scene. Lyric resonance (early seed to final reprise) pushes it into mid-band despite limited causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to "breathe life into a shared dream" is stated in paragraph six, framing her grandmother's dying wish and the ritual's purpose. It drives her return visits and her drumming to activate the garden. The motivation appears in setup (implied in paragraphs one and two, explicit in six), shapes the middle beat (feeling the donors present), and recurs at closure (commitment to return and "make them sing again"). However, the desire is more contemplative than conflicted—Maya doesn't face friction between this want and a competing cost on the page; she simply enacts the ritual. Setup present, development moderate (one choice-adjacent beat), payoff clear. Friction between want and cost is conceptual (the burden of thirteen lives) rather than dramatized in a choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow, beautiful and crushing as the northern lights" is explicit in paragraph seven and permeates the piece: the bittersweet weight of carrying thirteen lives, the ephemeral contact at the lagoon, the fading moment. Tone modulates from quiet rebellion (opening) through accumulating grief (middle) to earned endurance (close), remaining coherent under pressure. It charges the final image (the fading lagoon, the ache, the commitment to return). However, the phrase "auroral sorrow" itself is stated rather than purely evoked, and the tone occasionally tips toward decorative lyricism. Setup implicit, development sustained through imagery, payoff strong. Coherent modulation and closure linkage present; slight deduction for overt labeling in a peak beat.</comment>
