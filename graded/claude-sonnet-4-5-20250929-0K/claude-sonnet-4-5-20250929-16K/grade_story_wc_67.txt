<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and specific, rooted in the tactile world of charcoal and ash. Her contradictory impulses—honoring the vanishing practice while secretly preserving—act simultaneously in scene through physical choices (drawing technique, shard gathering). The relationship with Cassius pressures her stance and the final choice to preserve him is earned by the established pattern of secret reconstruction. Minor: her emotional progression during Cassius's death reads slightly smoothed; the grief could degrade perception more.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (gallery, Mira, Cassius's decline) by the second paragraph. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered reveals (ash scattering, wife's urn, secret preservation) that reweight the premise. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the final image of gathering porcelain shards reconfigures the gallery's stated purpose with undeniable conceptual cost (the lie embedded in every "vanishing"). The rocking chair stopping provides a clear before/after. Cost is legible: Mira's practice is now exposed as duplicitous preservation, not honest release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The gallery space, charcoal tools, porcelain shards, and rocking chair all constrain choices and charge the ending. The chair's slowing tempo operates as both clock and environment, pressuring Mira's drawing speed. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's occupational lens (charcoal powder, smudge technique, exhaust vents). Spatial choreography—easel, chair, wall mask—tracks cleanly. Minor: the "back room" filters are mentioned once without prior grounding, a small late anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve Cassius while maintaining the vanishing practice) is signaled early and tightens as his death approaches. The revelation that Mira has been secretly preserving fragments all along is a meaningful deepening that reweights her entire practice. Agency is expressed through the decision to rebuild him, foreclosing the path of honest scattering with visible cost (the gallery's foundational lie is now permanent). The rocking chair's deceleration creates organic escalation. One tightening is sufficient for this length; the cost is unmistakable on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely from concrete action: the conflict between impermanence and preservation, honesty and mercy, art's purpose. The mask made from the wife's shattered urn is a charged particular that returns with reweighted meaning at closure. Mira's final gathering of porcelain shards offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "what does art preserve?" without stating a moral. Subtext operates richly in Mira's half-truths to Cassius. The piece invites genuine ambiguity: is her preservation an agony or a kindness? No thematic echo or sermonizing mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; focalization through Mira remains clean throughout. Perceptual signature is strong: she notices charcoal texture, light quality, hand tremors—professional and personal priorities shape what is seen. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon (compressed carbon, smudge technique, exhaust vents). Dialogue carries subtext; her partial truths to Cassius function as evasion and kindness simultaneously. Purposeful withholding (the wife's urn secret) is paid off on the page and charges the closure. Distance modulates appropriately with emotional pressure at Cassius's death.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances character, world, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating as the chair slows. Figurative language (wind through hollow reeds, powdered hands) is purposeful and sparse. Clarity is excellent; spatial and temporal tracking never falters. Minor deduction: "the paradox of finding beauty in dissolution" in paragraph 5 edges toward abstract philosophizing, though it remains anchored in the moment. The opening and closing lines frame and recharge cleanly. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence structures vary throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The core synthesis—art as controlled disappearance versus secret preservation—feels fresh and specific to this character and practice. The ash-scatterer occupation is unusual and grounds the metaphor in tactile detail. The porcelain-shard mask technique transforms the urn accident into both art object and moral calculus. Risk-taking is present in the multiple nested secrets and the quiet ending. Minor: the vanishing-art-gallery frame has some proximity to existing conceptual-art tropes, though the execution through charcoal portraiture and physical reconstruction is distinctive enough to avoid derivative scoring.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's choices create every key turn: drawing Cassius's hands as they were, withholding the urn truth, deciding to rebuild him as mask. She is on the page throughout and her decisions alter tactics (incomplete truths, secret preservation) and drive the closure unit (gathering shards).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mask appears in paragraph 5 and returns in concept at closure when Mira plans to create Cassius's mask. It is handled (she made it from the wife's urn shards) and its meaning reweights: from praised masterpiece to embodiment of Mira's deception. The closure image of gathering porcelain shards directly invokes and extends the mask's function. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mirage of safety shapes stakes throughout: Mira gives Cassius safety through incomplete information about his wife's ashes and about the gallery's true purpose. It constrains her speech choices (what to tell, what to omit) and is named explicitly in the final paragraph as the gallery's ongoing work. The concept is indispensable to the plot logic and moral calculus; removing it would collapse the story's central tension.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The attribute "weaves truth carefully" is dramatized in every exchange with Cassius: "which was true but incomplete," "the truth but not its entirety," "entirely true" followed by omission. It constrains her dialogue choices and enables the dual operation of honesty and deception. Visible cost: she must live with the accumulated weight of these half-truths. Present across multiple beats and essential to the closure's moral charge.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Powdering appears in memory (Cassius teaching her), in the present technique (charcoal to palm), and in the planned future (ashes to porcelain dust). It is the physical method linking all three timeframes and the transformation mechanism. It enables the secret preservation practice. The action is specific and irreplaceable; substituting "grind" or "crush" would lose the textural signature. Drives two beats and contributes to ending charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Incomplete information is the story's operating principle. It shapes every tactic: Mira's partial answers, the mask's hidden origin, the secret filters, the entire preservation practice. The method is signaled early ("weaves truth carefully") and its mechanics matter at every turn—what is told, what is omitted, what is transformed. The closure explicitly names it as the gallery's method. Indispensable; the plot logic depends entirely on this exact mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gallery is introduced in the first sentence and its purpose evolves across the story: initially a site of impermanence, revealed as a site of secret permanence. The back-room filters supply the means for preservation. The setting's conceptual architecture (vanishing as stated purpose vs. preservation as hidden function) drives the thematic stakes. It constrains Mira's practice and provides the resources (exhaust system) that enable her deception. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rocking chair's deceleration is introduced early, tracked across three beats (rhythm slowing, pace slowing further, stopped), and creates immediate pressure: Mira must finish the portrait before Cassius dies. It tightens her drawing speed ("moved faster, desperate") and marks the decisive moment of death. The timeframe is live, tracked, and alters her tactics. It provides both the story's internal clock and its emotional crescendo.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Crystallizing fleeting emotion is named as Cassius's taught belief and Mira's stated practice. It is dramatized in her urgent drawing ("desperate to capture") and in the closure choice to preserve rather than scatter. The friction between the stated motivation (release) and secret motivation (preserve) creates the story's central conflict. The motivation shapes multiple on-page choices and is causally active at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Somber marvel is sustained throughout: the paradox of finding beauty in dissolution, the "fragile peace," the light falling across Cassius's face. Tone modulates appropriately with pressure (urgency as the chair slows) without breaking into sentimentality or melodrama. The final image—gathering shards—carries both somberness (death, deception) and marvel (art's transformation). The tone charges the closure and is coherent through all turns.</comment>
