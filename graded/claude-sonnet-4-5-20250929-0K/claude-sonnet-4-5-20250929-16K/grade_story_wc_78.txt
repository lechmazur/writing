<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to "turn obstacles into instruments" is stated but her interiority remains largely declarative rather than contradictory. The three-hour vigil shows endurance under pressure, and the final choice to rest carries modest cost, but internal conflict is thin—her doubts are sketched rather than felt in competing impulses. Embodied emotion is present (racing pulse, exhaustion) yet the stakes feel more conceptual than visceral. The renunciation of further action at dawn qualifies as Earned Stasis with visible fatigue, meeting the length's requirement, but the psychological texture lacks the specificity that would elevate it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The orchard's resonance mapping accumulates through the blue hour, peaks during the three-hour tide sequence, and closes with a quiet image of survival and drift. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure lands on the page—Kael's exhaustion and the orchard's survival constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—and the cost is legible: three hours of physical exertion, the transformation of desperate action into catalogued knowledge. One meaningful deepening (the fractal tide arriving and being matched) tightens options under the accumulative lens, satisfying the scope requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating orchard supplies vivid constraint: roots drinking seawater, driftwood framework as instrument, spatial isolation on open water. The xylophone mallet and resonance points (tree trunks, ropes) are handled tactilely and shape Kael's survival tactics. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—blue hour indistinguishability of sky and ocean, salt taste in the apple. The orchard's circular drift and the fractal cloud patterns charge the final image of "alive and singing still," meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice and charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: orchard survival against a vast tide. The fractal cloud warning initiates pressure, the tide's arrival forces the three-hour resonance performance, and Kael's pattern-matching narrows options to "harmonize or be destroyed." Agency is clear: her striking pattern enables survival. The cost is legible on the page—exhaustion, three hours of physical labor, the translation of desperation into catalogued knowledge. One meaningful tightening (tide arrival) and deepening (resonance discovery) satisfy the scope requirement. Escalation is driven by protagonist action under the Accumulative lens, and the price (fatigue, transformation of threat into symphony) charges the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: obstacles as instruments, fractal patterns in nature and human response, survival through resonance rather than resistance. The xylophone mallet shifts from tool to "extension of her interpretation," and the final apple "tasted like salt and victory" offers a concrete, non-literal answer to the central question of transformation. Subtext operates in the naming of resonances ("Mercy," "Hold," "Bend," "Become") and the orchard's post-crisis song. The piece avoids overt thesis statements, though "turn obstacles into instruments" is articulated as motivation rather than purely emergent. The ending reweights prior material—mapping desperation into catalog—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Kael reads clouds as prophecy, hears driftwood sing, interprets fractal recursion. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("leeward tide prophet," "restless euphony," "dubbing"), with purposeful compression in peak moments ("The tide arrived at full dark, invisible but audible"). No dialogue; interiority is concrete and filtered through her specialized lens. Psychic distance modulates appropriately—closer during the three-hour vigil, broader at the reflective close. Minor lexical elevation ("recursive," "euphony," "dubbing") fits the narrator's technical expertise without breaking voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and sentence openings shift, but figurative density is high throughout without always serving immediacy: "fractal clouds," "recursive patterns," "geometric ghosts," "restless euphony," "agitated beauty" cluster in descriptive passages. The opening's "roots that had learned to drink from the sea itself" and "clouds sketch their prophecies" are vivid, yet the metaphor load in the middle third (fractal rules, resonance as instructions, tide as symphony) risks overwriting. Information density is strong—most lines advance situation or atmosphere—but the line "The orchard began to sing, a restless euphony of creaking wood and humming fiber, anxious but controlled, agitated beauty that matched her racing pulse" stacks modifiers without full clarity. No loops or scaffold; clarity holds. Deduction for elevated metaphor density in peak beats: −0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating orchard and resonance-mapping premise offer a fresh synthesis of survival-tale and musical transformation. The fractal tide as both threat and pattern to be matched is non-obvious and grows from prior setup (cloud warnings, mallet use). The xylophone mallet as survival tool and the blue-hour frame are specific and memorable. Tropes (lone protagonist, nature-as-adversary) are transformed through the particular mechanics of sound and pattern. The naming of tides ("Mercy," "Hold," "Bend," "Become") and the salt-and-victory apple ground emotional truth in sensory detail. Risk-taking is modest—structure is linear, stakes are clear—but the conceptual integrity (resonance as survival strategy) commits fully and follows through to closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael as "leeward tide prophet" is introduced in paragraph one, her three years of guiding the orchard establish credibility, and her decision to strike the resonance pattern drives the survival sequence. Her choice to map resonances (setup), her real-time pattern-matching during the tide (development), and her post-crisis decision to catalog the night and rest (payoff) span all three gates. Causal pressure: her interpretation of fractal clouds and resonance striking narrows options and enables survival. Closure linkage: she collapses against the tree, tastes victory, and commits to cataloging—her agency shapes the ending. Specificity: the role's mechanics (reading downwind patterns, dubbing tides) are irreplaceable. Visible cost: three hours of exertion, exhaustion. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost +0.5 = strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The xylophone mallet appears in paragraph three ("pulled the xylophone mallet from her belt, its rubber head worn smooth"), is used to strike resonance points across paragraphs four through seven (development), and is tucked back into her belt in the final sequence (payoff). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Beat involvement: distinct use in the mapping beat (para 3), the tide vigil (paras 5–7), and the post-crisis reflection (para 9) = three beats +1.4. Causal pressure: the mallet enables the resonance pattern that saves the orchard +1.3. Closure linkage: "She tucked the mallet back into her belt" in the penultimate paragraph charges the resolution with the tool's return +1.0. Specificity: "rubber head worn smooth" and "extension of her interpretation" make it irreplaceable +0.7. Cost: the three-hour performance tied to mallet use +0.4. Early signal +0.6. Total strong integration; minor deduction for the mallet not appearing in the final image itself, only the penultimate beat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Sketched resonance" appears as "patterns appearing briefly on the ocean's surface where sound waves intersected with swells, geometric ghosts that showed her the tide's hidden architecture" (paragraph four) and returns in "Tomorrow she would sketch the resonance patterns into her journal" (final paragraph). Setup by the one-third mark, payoff in the ending reflection. Middle development is implicit: the resonance patterns are the instructions she follows during the tide sequence. Two gates clearly met; middle is interpretive. Causal pressure: the visible patterns guide her response +0.9. Closure linkage: the commitment to "sketch the resonance patterns" in the journal reweights the crisis as knowledge +1.0. Specificity: "geometric ghosts" and "fractal generating sequence" are distinctive +0.5. Beat involvement: one explicit dramatized beat (para 4) and one reflective beat (para 9) = two beats +0.9. Early signal +0.5. Lyric reprise qualifies under the allowance. Late summary in final para rather than middle dramatization: −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cloud interpretation is introduced in paragraph two ("watched the clouds sketch their prophecies," "Tonight the clouds moved wrong. They fractured into recursive patterns"), actively used in paragraph six ("She watched the cloud movements shift in response, as if the sky itself were listening"), and returns in the final paragraph ("watched the dawn clouds sketch themselves into simple, peaceful shapes"). Setup, development, payoff gates met. Causal pressure: interpreting fractal clouds provides the warning and tactical framework for survival +1.1. Beat involvement: warning beat (para 2), real-time adjustment beat (para 6), resolution beat (para 9) = three beats +1.4. Closure linkage: the dawn clouds' peaceful shapes contrast the earlier recursive warnings, charging the ending +1.0. Specificity: "fractal generating pattern," "recursive curls" distinguish this from generic weather-reading +0.6. Cost: misreading would mean destruction; the trait imposes interpretive burden +0.4. Early signal +0.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Dub" appears in paragraph seven: "Kael struck her pattern harder, faster, dubbing each resonance point with names whispered between strikes: 'Mercy,' 'Hold,' 'Bend,' 'Become.'" And in the final paragraph: "add this night's dubbing to her catalog of named tides." Setup is late (para 7, well past one-third mark); development and payoff occur in the same two beats. Late first appearance: −0.7. Beat involvement: naming during the vigil and cataloging afterward = two beats +0.9. Causal pressure: the naming itself does not narrow options; the striking does. The dubbing is ritualistic overlay rather than enabling action: mild pressure +0.3. Closure linkage: "add this night's dubbing" ties the action to ongoing practice +0.6. Specificity: the exact names ("Mercy," "Hold," "Bend," "Become") are memorable +0.5. Swappability: she could catalog without naming aloud; the dubbing is atmospheric rather than mechanically necessary −0.5. Late intro and limited causal role constrain score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Fractal generating" is introduced in paragraph two ("fractured into recursive patterns, each wisp containing smaller versions of itself, branching like the apple trees' roots"), developed in paragraph five ("its force followed fractal rules, each wave containing eddies that contained smaller eddies"), and referenced in the final paragraph ("map the fractal generating sequence that had emerged from desperation"). Setup, development, payoff gates met. Causal pressure: understanding the fractal structure enables Kael to match the tide's rhythm rather than fight it +1.0. Beat involvement: cloud observation (para 2), tactical realization (para 5), post-crisis reflection (para 9) = three beats +1.4. Closure linkage: "fractal generating sequence" in the final paragraph reweights the crisis as pattern discovery +0.8. Specificity: the exact recursion mechanics (eddies within eddies, branches within branches) are distinctive +0.6. Early signal +0.6. Slight abstraction—fractal logic is described more than enacted in micro-choices—limits top-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The orchard afloat on driftwood is introduced in the opening sentence, its resonance points (driftwood circle, tree trunks, ropes) are struck throughout the tide sequence (paras 4–7), and it remains "alive and singing still" in the final line. Setup, development, payoff gates met. Causal pressure: the orchard's physical structure as instrument is the survival mechanism; its buoyancy and resonance points constrain and enable all tactics +1.5. Beat involvement: framing (para 1), mapping (para 3), striking sequence (paras 5–7), resolution (para 9) = four beats +1.4 (capped guidance). Closure linkage: "The orchard turned its slow circle, alive and singing still" charges the final image with the setting's survival +1.6. Specificity: driftwood, salt-weathered rope, roots drinking seawater are irreplaceable details +0.8. Cost: the three-hour vigil to save the structure +0.5. Early signal +0.8. Strongly integrated across all beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Blue hour" is introduced in the opening sentence ("during the blue hour, when sky and ocean became indistinguishable") and returns in paragraph eight ("When the blue hour returned") and final paragraph ("whatever transformations the next blue hour might demand"). Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is absent—the three-hour tide sequence occurs "at full dark," not during blue hour. Two gates: eligible to ~6.0 per guidance. Lyric reprise (opening → closing) that reweights the stake qualifies under the allowance. Closure linkage: the return of blue hour frames survival and cyclical vigilance +0.9. Beat involvement: framing beat (para 1) and resolution beat (para 8–9) = two beats +0.9. Specificity: "when sky and ocean became indistinguishable" is evocative +0.4. Early signal +0.6. No causal pressure: the timeframe does not constrain tactics during the main action −0.5. Missing middle development: the crisis occurs outside blue hour −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To turn obstacles into instruments" is articulated in paragraph three ("Her motivation had always been simple: to turn obstacles into instruments, to make the threatening sea speak in harmonies she could understand and answer") and enacted throughout the tide sequence (paras 5–7), culminating in "she had transformed the largest obstacle she'd faced into a symphony that saved them all" (para 8). Setup, development, payoff gates met. Causal pressure: the motivation drives her three years of mapping and the real-time response to the fractal tide +1.2. Beat involvement: stated motivation (para 3), enacted strategy (paras 5–7), reflective closure (para 8) = three beats +1.4. Closure linkage: "transformed the largest obstacle... into a symphony" directly fulfills and reweights the motivation +1.3. Specificity: the exact phrasing and the instrument metaphor are thematically distinctive +0.6. Cost: three hours of exertion to enact the philosophy +0.4. Early signal +0.6. Minor friction: the motivation is told rather than discovered through friction between wants and costs in the heat of action −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Restless euphony" appears in paragraph six ("The orchard began to sing, a restless euphony of creaking wood and humming fiber, anxious but controlled, agitated beauty that matched her racing pulse") and returns in the final paragraph ("as the restless euphony of wind through leaves settled into morning's calm"). Setup late (para 6, past one-third mark), development in the vigil sequence, payoff in the closing image. Late first appearance: −0.4. Beat involvement: vigil (para 6) and resolution (para 9) = two beats +0.9. Tone coherence: the pairing of restlessness and euphony (tension and beauty) holds through the crisis and modulates to calm at closure +0.8. Closure linkage: "settled into morning's calm" reweights the earlier agitation, charging the final image +1.0. Specificity: "anxious but controlled, agitated beauty" is a distinctive tonal signature +0.6. Early signal absent: the tone is not named or cued in the opening −0.3. The exact phrase "restless euphony" is used twice, creating a reprise that reweights meaning under the lyric allowance.</comment>
