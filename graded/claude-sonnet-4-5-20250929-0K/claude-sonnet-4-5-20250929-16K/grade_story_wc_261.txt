<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's arc from broken healer to renewed practitioner is embodied through micro-choices (pouring water for the ivy, placing palms on glass) and contradictory impulses (seeking closure while opening wounds). Her guilt over Mrs. Kowalski's death drives concrete actions and the scar examination provides physical grounding. The therapy-speak phrase "inadequacy, guilt, the terrible knowledge" in early reflection lowers what would otherwise be strong interiority, and the final realization feels slightly over-articulated, but the embodied cost (the scar, the displaced miracle) keeps motivation credible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: coffee-ring reading, plant telepathy, and the hourglass accrue density until the final image reweights healing as "delivered exactly where it needed to go." Orientation anchors (Maya, tower, post-surgery) land by line 2. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Maya's hands warm, the hourglass resumes, and she channels healing into the ivy with visible cost (acceptance of her fragmented attention, the persistent scar). One meaningful deepening occurs when she reinterprets the gap in the coffee ring. Cost is legible: she must accept imperfection and her gift's altered form.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tower setting and body-as-setting (the scar, her warming hands) constrain multiple choices: examining the scar, studying coffee rings, touching the window where ivy presses. The frosted hourglass, ivy, and coffee rings return with reweighted meaning at closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maya's healer perspective. The "meteor hush" dawn image charges the final beat. Spatial choreography (windowsill, window box, corner ferns) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Maya's broken gift, signaled immediately. Pressure tightens when she reinterprets the coffee-ring gap (her fragmented attention wasn't carelessness but simultaneous care), then escalates to the final beat where she tests her gift on the ivy. The cost is visible: accepting that her healing now "looks different than expected" and that perfection is impossible. Agency is clear—she chooses to channel healing despite uncertainty. One meaningful deepening (the coffee-ring insight) narrows her understanding and enables the final action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—wounds as stories, closure as opening rather than sealing—emerges from coffee rings, scars, and the ivy's needs without overt thesis. The final image (healing the ivy, scar aching less) offers a resonant answer to the opening question. However, the penultimate paragraph's explicit statement "they were about what remained open, what stayed tender" borders on theme summary, pulling back from full subtextual emergence. The hourglass and displaced miracle motifs constrain meaning effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited to Maya with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is clear: healer's attention to scars, coffee rings, plant distress. The ivy's italicized telepathy (*thirsty-dying-roots-dry*) provides voice distinction. Filter verbs ("thought about," "felt like") are present but not excessive. The phrase "that peculiar meteor hush" introduces a narrator-level descriptor not clearly anchored in Maya's prior lexicon, a minor register drift. No head-hopping; focalization stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. "The anesthesia wore off slowly, leaving Maya suspended between dreaming and dawn" opens strongly. Information density is high in the coffee-ring examination beat. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "opening wounds she'd rather leave sealed" echoes "seeking closure" without adding pressure, and "both acts were rooted in care. Both mattered" restates the same idea across adjacent sentences. The "stories written in flesh were never just about closing" penultimate paragraph summary slightly dulls momentum. No major artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The displaced-miracle premise offers a fresh angle on healer-failure narratives; the accidental plant telepathy and coffee-ring divination are specific, non-obvious choices. The story transforms the "broken gift" trope through Maya's realization that imperfection and fragmentation are inherent, not failures. The final turn (healing the ivy as proof rather than error) feels earned in hindsight. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation without overt confrontation—and the ending commits fully to its premise without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya as closure-seeker is signaled early ("sought closure by coming to this tower") and her realization that "closure wasn't about sealing everything away" shapes the ending. She makes on-page choices: examining the scar, studying coffee rings, channeling healing into the ivy. The character drives at least two beats (coffee-ring insight, final healing attempt) and contributes to closure. Present in setup, middle choice, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The frosted hourglass appears in three beats: initial description with symbolic link to the displaced miracle, Master Yoon's explanation, and its sand resuming at the climax. It charges the final sequence by marking the moment Maya's gift returns. However, its function is largely symbolic—Maya does not handle or use it, and removing it would weaken but not break the closure. Two gates (setup, payoff) are met; middle development is absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The displaced miracle is the inciting incident (Mrs. Kowalski's death, stranger's cure) and defines Maya's dominant stake throughout. It shapes her guilt, her study under Master Yoon, and her fear of healing. The final realization—"displaced miracle hadn't been failure"—directly reweights the concept at closure. The miracle's mechanics (healing "tunneled sideways through space") constrain her understanding and enable the ending's conceptual repricing. Present in all three gates with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plant telepathy appears in three beats: ivy's panic, pouring water, and the final healing. It enables the climactic action (healing the ivy as proof) and provides a visible trade-off (Maya "couldn't control it," constant broadcast). The trait constrains her comfort and enables the ending choice. However, its connection to the displaced miracle (gift "spilled sideways into the green world") is asserted rather than causally demonstrated. Setup, middle use, and payoff are present.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Tunnel" describes both the displaced miracle's mechanics ("healing had tunneled sideways through space") and the final act ("let the healing tunnel through her into its roots"). It appears in setup and payoff, and the verb choice unifies the problem and solution. However, it functions more as recurring metaphor than distinct action—Maya does not perform "tunneling" as a technique; the verb describes the gift's behavior. Two gates met; swappability is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Coffee-ring examination is taught early ("examining coffee rings, the patterns left behind"), used in the middle beat where Maya studies her cup and discovers "the tiniest gap where her attention had fractured," and this insight directly enables her final realization. The method shapes her understanding of the displaced miracle and provides the causal bridge to acceptance. Present in setup, middle development (constrains understanding), and contributes to closure. Removing it would break the story's investigative logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "quiet tower where healers went to fail" frames Maya's journey and provides the window, ivy, and Master Yoon. "True dawn" at the climax charges the final image. The tower enables isolation for reflection and the ivy's proximity for the healing test. However, "at dawn" is more backdrop than constraint—the timing shapes tone but does not force urgency. Setup and payoff are strong; middle development is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the anesthesia wears off" anchors the opening and links to Maya's scar, establishing recent surgery. The timeframe provides a threshold moment (emergence from sedation mirrors gift's return). However, no time pressure operates—the story could unfold over hours or days without affecting choices. Anesthesia wearing off is mentioned once and does not constrain later action. Setup is present; middle and closure participation are minimal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maya's desire "to learn to read the stories in scars" drives her study under Master Yoon, the coffee-ring examination, and her final insight that scars are "about what remained open." The motivation is dramatized through on-page choices (lifting the cup, touching her scar) and conflicts with her desire for tidy closure. It shapes middle tactics (studying patterns) and reweights at the ending when she accepts partial healing. Friction between wanting understanding and fearing inadequacy is embodied. All three gates present with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears in the climactic dawn sentence ("that peculiar meteor hush—the world holding its breath before something irrevocable and beautiful") and establishes a tone of poised anticipation. The quiet, charged atmosphere is consistent throughout (sedation, study, whispered plant voices) and modulates appropriately—introspective early, building to the final image. However, "meteor hush" as a phrase appears only once; the tone it names is present but the element itself is ornamental. Mood is coherent and charges the ending; the exact phrase is not load-bearing.</comment>
