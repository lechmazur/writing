<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper's interiority is consistent and her motivation coheres (witness without judgment), but her choices remain observational rather than pressured. The moment with the obsidian refuge feels enacted upon her rather than through her agency—she watches the swan refold itself and receives a vision, but makes no contradictory choice under strain. The final decision to place the swan on the shelf carries minimal visible cost; it reads as gentle curation rather than a foreclosed path. Embodiment is present but abstract ("grips reality loosely") without specific physical contradiction or mistake that compounds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers motifs (decay/growth, folding/unfolding, witnessing) toward a final image of integration. Orientation anchors arrive slowly—who/where/when are legible by ~150 words (acceptable for lyric accumulation). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she incorporates the artifact into the swan, sealing her method with new geometry), but the cost is conceptual and oblique; no on-page sentence makes the price undeniable. The vision sequence introduces new information (future flowers, perpetual visitors) without prior causality to earn it, weakening the "because/therefore" chain even under an accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The catacombs are vividly rendered with purposeful decay (mushrooms on spines, roots drinking from springs) and the setting charges the final image—the swan placed among illegible volumes completes the cycle motif. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (her lantern, the stone's cool density). The underground ecosystem functions as micro-setting that constrains her method (preservation through decomposition), satisfying the 9+ gate for environment shaping choice. Minor dock: spatial choreography of her descent and return ("weeks or years later") remains vague, but does not obscure present action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to record transformation—is signaled early and the obsidian refuge introduces one meaningful complication. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens remains gentle: the stone folds the swan into new patterns, but this happens *to* her without tactical friction or a choice that narrows options. No reversal tests her devotion to witnessing; the vision of future decay confirms rather than challenges her stance. The cost of incorporating the artifact (weight, forgetting the moment precisely) is told in future-tense summary rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (impermanence, witnessing change, regenerative decay) emerges organically from the library's ecosystem and her origami method. The final image—swan on the highest shelf among melted titles—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the record becomes part of the decay it documents. Subtext operates in the artifact's "strange gravity" and the paradox of "regenerative silence." Minor weaknesses: "the wisdom was in the losing, in the letting go" edges toward stated moral, and "grips reality loosely" functions as a thematic label more than embodied contradiction. Still, the particulars (mushrooms fed by ink-washed soil) anchor universals effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature (she sees transformation as devotion, hears decay as music). Diction is elevated and consistent, matching her archivist role. However, register drifts toward essay-like philosophizing in several beats: "permanence was merely a story people told themselves," "the only way to keep true record of a world forever in the act of becoming something else." These lines read as authorial thesis rather than her lived thought under pressure. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately from sensory anchor (lantern, stone) to reflective conclusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several beats loop conceptually: "witness change without judgment" / "chronicle transformation as an act of devotion rather than preservation" / "witnessing changes you even as you remain still" all restate her stance without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle ("The paper showed… She had watched… She had witnessed…") with parallel "She had" stems. Figurative language is dense ("fractal architecture that hurt to perceive," "cryptic symbols," "strange gravity") but mostly coherent. The final paragraph's summarizing reflection ("she would not remember… but she would feel") tells the aftermath rather than showing the present cost, dulling the closure beat's immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The combination of catacombs/origami/transformation is specific and the obsidian-as-catalyst offers a non-obvious synthesis. The vision of "flowers that only bloomed in darkness" fed by ink-washed soil is a memorable particular. However, the core emotional arc (archivist witnesses decay and accepts impermanence) follows a familiar contemplative template without a sharp turn or trade-off. The piece commits fully to its premise but chooses the safety middle: she loses nothing, gains augmented perception, and her stance is confirmed rather than tested. The transformation test is marginal—swap catacombs for any decaying archive and the arc holds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Chronicle keeper is present throughout and her motivation (witness without judgment) frames the piece. Setup and payoff gates are met (she descends with purpose, places the swan at the end). However, her choices are observational: she unfolds, watches the stone act, refolds, and shelves. No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost. The role is functional but replaceable with "archivist" or "curator" with minimal edits. Mid-band: one key involvement (incorporating the artifact) but low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge appears early (carried down), is handled in two beats (placed on the swan, incorporated into its folds), and charges the closure by enabling new geometry. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, its mechanics are vague ("strange gravity," "hum with possibility") and it resolves a problem (how to see transformation more deeply) it did not help create. The name "refuge along the river" is poetic but the "river" detail never returns or constrains action. Swappable with "artifact" or "stone talisman" with minor edits. Mid-band: functional across beats but lacks irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Regenerative silence is named once and described ("not the silence of endings, but the quiet hum of constant becoming"). It functions as thematic atmosphere rather than shaping stakes or tactics on the page. No choice depends on silence versus noise; no cost is tied to it. The concept echoes the decay/growth motif but remains ornamental. Present and thematically consistent, but replaceable with "patient stillness" or "watchful quiet." Low-mid band: ornamental presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is labeled twice (opening and closing paragraphs) but never dramatized as a constraint or enabler. No on-page moment shows her unable to act because of loose grip, nor does it allow a unique tactic. The trait tells her stance without cost or trade-off. Could be swapped with "accepts impermanence" or "embraces flux" with no structural change. Low band: label-only trait without visible friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Burrow" appears once in the vision ("Visitors would come… to burrow through the ruins") as a metaphor for future searchers, not a present action by the protagonist. No major turn traces to burrowing; roots burrow through the ceiling but as setting detail, not the required action. The element is present but ornamental and easily replaceable with "search" or "dig." Low band: mentioned without causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Origami swan is signaled early (waiting on her desk), its mechanics matter (each fold holds a memory, creases mark transformation), and it returns charged at closure (refolded with the artifact, placed on the high shelf). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The method shapes two key beats: unfolding to reveal the map, refolding with new geometry. The swan's "fractal architecture" and self-folding via the stone's gravity create irreplaceable specificity. High band: essential across beats and integral to the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Overgrown library/catacombs is anchored early and pressures her method: decay (mushrooms on books, collapsing shelves) becomes the ecosystem she chronicles. The setting supplies resources (roots, springs, soil) that feed the transformation cycle central to her stake. The deepest chamber functions as ritual space where the swan awaits. The final image (swan among illegible volumes) gains charge from the setting's particulars. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. High band: setting drives the dominant stake and charges the closure image with specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Across the drift of untold seasons" appears in the opening and "weeks or years later" in the closing, but time remains vague and does not tighten decisions. No clock pressures her; the catacombs exist outside urgent chronology. The timeframe is thematic (long duration underscores impermanence) but does not alter tactics or choices. Replaceable with "over many years" or "across ages." Low band: ornamental presence without causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation "to witness change without judgment" is stated explicitly and frames her actions (tending the library, unfolding the swan, incorporating the artifact). Setup and payoff gates are met. However, the desire is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—no moment tempts her to intervene or judge, no friction between witnessing and acting. The motivation is told and confirmed rather than tested. Mid-band: shapes the arc but lacks on-page friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tone "crumbling peace" is coherent throughout: decay coexists with devotion, collapse with reverence. The prose maintains this doubled register (trembling shadows, dissolving spines, yet "equanimity," "regenerative silence"). Tone modulates subtly—the artifact introduces "strange gravity" and "fractal architecture that hurt to perceive," intensifying wonder without breaking the peace. The final image (swan shelved among melted titles) charges with quiet acceptance. Setup and closure gates are met; the tone supports rather than transforms pressure. Mid-high band: coherent and purposeful, charges the ending without decisive intensity shift.</comment>
