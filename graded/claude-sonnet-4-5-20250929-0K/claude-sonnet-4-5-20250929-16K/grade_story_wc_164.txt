<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Calla's interiority is consistently filtered through her work and remains coherent. The "cheerful gloom" emotional register is embodied through specific contradiction—"a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes"—and her choices (planting seeds, promising to remember) track logically from her motivations. However, the final turn toward "bearing witness to disappearance was itself a kind of preservation" arrives without genuine internal conflict or visible cost; no path is foreclosed, no prior impulse is contradicted on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 2 (who, where). The piece accumulates pattern through repeated transliteration beats and tightens via the revelation that paths fade from lack of repetition, then shifts cadence in the final third when Calla plants the new seed and reframes her mission. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: "bearing witness to disappearance was itself a kind of preservation." Cost is conceptual—she relinquishes restoration in favor of documentation—but the final image (palm against crystal, promise to remember) makes the reweighting undeniable and the piece teaches its accumulative method early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The iridescent cave's geode walls and crystalline surfaces actively constrain Calla's method—she presses the crater glass against leaves, traces vines, and plants seeds in mineral darkness. The cave pulses with light that reflects her emotional state and the temporal swallow's arrival/departure brackets her discovery. Spatial choreography is clean (outcropping, wall, her open hand) and the cave's "soft rainbow light, beautiful and cold simultaneously" charges the final beat when the walls pulse brighter as if approving. The setting shapes both her process and the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: discover why paths disappear, driven by childhood loss. Pressure accumulates through each transliteration cycle (joy-turning-to-doubt, anticipation-confusion-resignation) and tightens when the crater glass reveals paths need repeated walking to remain real. The final seed and its "hope-choosing-to-return" inscription deepens understanding and narrows her mission from restoration to witness. Agency is primarily observational—Calla responds to what the glass reveals—but her decision to plant seeds and reframe her covenant forecloses the restoration path with conceptual cost visible in her acceptance that "some losses were inevitable."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from concrete particulars: the vanished road to grandmother's house, seeds sprouting maps, paths fading without footsteps. The piece resists easy morals—losses are "inevitable, like foam dissolving into sea"—and the final image (palm on crystal, promise to remember) offers a non-literal answer to the central question without stating a thesis. The recurring sea-foam motif charges the ending when Calla accepts that "bearing witness to disappearance was itself a kind of preservation." However, "making her conjecture into covenant" edges toward overt thematic statement rather than letting the scene pressure speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with consistent perceptual signature: Calla notices emotional script, warmth of memory, and the cave's approving pulse. Diction stays within her specialist register ("transliterate," "path-memory," "pilgrimage") without unmotivated elevation. The single line of dialogue to the path-memory ("People walked you once...") feels natural and goal-driven. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—zooming to her palm when the glass warms, pulling back for the cave's response. Free indirect style is clean throughout with no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most sentences do double work. The opening grounds voice and stakes efficiently. However, several template stems recur under pressure: "She had devoted," "She had always assumed," "She couldn't restore." Minor paraphrase loop: "each one a small tragedy, each one perfectly, necessarily temporary" restates without added detail. The figurative language ("like memories dissolving into mist," "like foam dissolving into sea") is coherent but the sea-foam/dissolution pairing appears three times in a short text. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; these are hairline slips that don't touch closure but prevent entry to the 8-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "recollectionist" occupation and emotional transliteration via crater glass offer a fresh synthesis. The piece transforms the standard "archivist discovers secret" template by rooting stakes in childhood loss and reframing success as witness rather than restoration. The temporal swallow and seed-maps are specific and purposeful. However, the core emotional arc—someone mourning lost connections chooses to honor them instead—is familiar, and the final turn toward acceptance follows a well-worn path. Specificity and voice elevate the material but the transformation remains modest.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Calla is present throughout and her decisions to plant seeds and reframe her mission drive the final third. However, most of the story's pressure comes from what the crater glass reveals to her rather than from her active choices. She observes, processes, and accepts, but the key turns (understanding paths need repetition, finding the hope-choosing-to-return seed) happen to her via the temporal swallow's drops. Her agency is primarily reactive until the final beat when she makes her covenant, which does alter her stance and foreclose the restoration path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The crater glass appears in at least four distinct beats: initial fragment description, transliteration of joy-doubt-wonder-sorrow, the revelation about paths needing footsteps, and the final "hope-choosing-to-return" transliteration. Its function evolves—early it reveals fragments, later it delivers the central insight, finally it shows a path someone chose to walk repeatedly. The glass enables the plot's causal linkage and participates in closure by transliterating the hope-emotion that reweights Calla's understanding. However, it remains primarily a tool she uses rather than an object with its own charged presence or irreplaceable specificity beyond "it transliterates emotions."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "missing pieces" concept is foregrounded early ("recovering the missing pieces of paths") and structures the entire investigation. It shapes stakes—Calla's childhood road is a missing piece—and her revelation that paths fade without repetition directly addresses why pieces go missing. The final reframing from restoration to witness pivots on accepting that "missing pieces" cannot always be recovered. The concept drives her tactics (transliterating, planting seeds) and charges the closure when she promises to remember the ten thousand vanished paths. It functions causally, not just thematically.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "transliterates emotions" attribute is established early and used in multiple beats—converting ineffable feelings to visible script. It enables key plot moments: the joy-doubt-sorrow fragments, the "paths need footsteps" revelation, and the hope-choosing-to-return inscription. However, the transliteration itself carries no visible cost or constraint on the page; it functions smoothly as a convenient mechanism. The glass grows warm, she reads the script, insight follows. No tradeoff is dramatized—no failed transliteration, no price for using it, no moment where the ability constrains her choices or forces a difficult decision.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "conjecture" action appears only in the final paragraph as a descriptor for Calla's interpretive leap: "making her conjecture into covenant." It's a label for what she does (interpret, theorize) rather than a dramatized action that drives turns. The actual work of the story—transliterating, planting seeds, discovering—would remain identical if "conjecture" were replaced with "hypothesis," "interpretation," or "understanding." The word does not constrain or enable on-page choices; it's a thematic flourish rather than a structural element.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scattered seeds from the temporal swallow are signaled early ("Three weeks ago"), establish the mechanism (seeds sprout silver vines with path-maps), and drive the central discovery arc. The bird's drops provide the initial clue, the mid-story pattern (seeds sprouting into legible maps), and the final seed that reveals "hope-choosing-to-return." The mechanics matter: seeds dropped in mineral darkness shouldn't grow, yet they do, and this impossibility is part of the world's logic. The method shapes Calla's attempts (she plants immediately, racing against time) and the final seed's arrival triggers her reframing. The bird's exit—dropping three more seeds and vanishing—bookends the closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The iridescent cave/geode is established in the opening line and remains spatially active throughout. The crystalline walls enable Calla's work (she presses glass against them, traces vines on their surfaces), and the cave's pulsing light responds to her emotional state and "approves" at the end. The mineral darkness matters: seeds shouldn't grow there, yet they do. The cool crystal wall supports her when she processes the revelation. At closure, she presses her palm against the crystal feeling "ten thousand vanished paths humming beneath," and the walls pulse brighter. The setting constrains her method (she must work inside the geode with its specific surfaces) and charges the final image through its responsive luminescence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "before memory fades completely" appears once in the final third ("racing against time, working urgently before memory fades"). It's asserted as pressure but not dramatized through tightening choices or tracked consequences. Calla has been working "seventeen days" but no clock visibly ticks down, no traces vanish mid-scene, no earlier moment establishes what happens if she's too slow. The urgency is told in a single phrase rather than shaping her tactics across beats. The temporal swallow's visits could suggest a deadline, but their timing is vague and doesn't constrain her decision sequence on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Calla's desire "to discover why some paths disappear" is established through her career focus and childhood memory (the vanished road to grandmother's house), which provides emotional weight and specificity. The motivation drives her transliteration work and culminates in the revelation that paths need repetition to remain real. Friction appears when she realizes she "couldn't restore the missing pieces" and must instead "document them, honor them" and choose which paths to walk repeatedly. This reframing involves trading restoration (her original implicit goal) for witness, a shift with conceptual cost. However, the friction is brief and resolved quickly; she accepts the limitation without visible struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "cheerful gloom" tone is embodied early and sustained: "a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes," "her voice echoing cheerfully through the gloom," "melancholy optimism," "energized by her cheerful gloom," "smiling through the gentle sorrow." The tone is coherent through turns—she remains brightly sad even as she gains understanding—and it charges the final image when she promises to remember "smiling through the gentle sorrow." The paradox isn't just asserted; it's enacted in her speech ("People walked you once") and her choice to bear witness with "gentle sorrow" rather than despair. The tone doesn't merely persist; it defines her stance and makes the closure's emotional register specific and inevitable.</comment>
