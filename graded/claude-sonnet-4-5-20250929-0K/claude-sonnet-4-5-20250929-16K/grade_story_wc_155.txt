<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's internal journey from work-focused artist to rediscovering joy is embodied through concrete choices: she sets down equipment "with careful reverence," makes the decision to amplify rather than impose, and laughs at the absurdity—a sound she "hadn't heard from her own throat in months." The realization that "joy wasn't lost in the past" feels earned through her embodied engagement with the fresco and fog. Minor slip: the streaming-to-network moment risks convenience, though the viewer comments do provide pressure that validates her shift. The breath-holding metaphor ("she'd been holding her breath for months, maybe years") edges toward therapy-speak but is anchored in the physical space and action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: artist, ruined orchard, fog-soaked district. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Mira's realization that "joy wasn't lost in the past, waiting to be excavated. It was right here" reweights her artistic practice and the dominant stake (rediscovering lost joy). The cost is visible: she releases the need for permanence and embraces ephemeral connection, a meaningful shift from her opening state. The fog-as-developer metaphor and light-painting sequence build density that peaks in the final paragraph's reconfiguration of her relationship to erasure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fog functions as both canvas and constraint, shaping Mira's choice to amplify rather than impose new images. Skeletal apple trees with "silver-gray stone" bark and the fresco jutting from a collapsed wall create a vivid, decayed world. The projectors and batteries impose a time limit that pressures the scene. The orchard's spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the fog's acceptance of light charges the closure image: "some things—the best things—only needed to exist for a moment."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rediscovering joy—is signaled early and tightens when Mira shifts from imposing to amplifying, a choice that narrows her artistic approach and tests her willingness to let go of permanence. The batteries dimming and dawn threatening create time pressure. The knowledge network provides external validation that raises the emotional stakes. Cost is present: she releases the need for lasting murals and accepts erasure, foregrounding connection over permanence. One meaningful deepening occurs when she completes the fresco child's reach, a choice that crystallizes her new stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between permanence and ephemera, amplification versus imposition, and the fog's dual role as destroyer and canvas. The fresco child's eternally outstretched hand versus Mira's light-completion enacts the theme without stating it. "Joy wasn't lost in the past...It was right here, in the reaching" reweights prior material without moralizing. The final image—fog swallowing footsteps, Mira not minding erasure—offers a resonant answer to whether art must endure. Minor slip: "pensive mirth" is named rather than fully embodied in late paragraphs, though the laughing moment earlier dramatizes it well.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and textured, with a distinct perceptual signature: "photograph developing in reverse, light slowly stealing the image," "fog had pooled for centuries like spilled milk." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the projection sequence. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register wobble: "that loosely connected web of historians, urban explorers, and romantics" reads slightly expository for the established voice, and "pensive mirth, her old teacher would have called this mood" names rather than enacts. Diction and rhythm support pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent: fog as spilled milk, photograph developing in reverse, edible stars. Minor muddle: "fog-space" and "daydream fold" blur slightly without adding precision. Template cadence appears in the knowledge network comments section: three nearly identical "I remember/My grandmother's/This is the feeling" structures, creating a brief rhythm stall. Paraphrase loop: "The fog became her canvas" and earlier "fog made everything uncertain, dreamlike" restate mood without advancing pressure. Information density is otherwise strong, and the final paragraph propels cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The light-projection artist in a ruined fog-soaked orchard offers a fresh synthesis, and the shift from imposing to amplifying provides a non-obvious inflection. The fresco fragment as anchor and the "knowledge network" streaming dimension add specificity. However, the "artist rediscovers joy through connection to the past" premise trends familiar, and the streaming-validation beat risks convenience. The "exposed film" concept is claimed in reflection but does not deeply constrain on-page choices. Transformation test: the arc could migrate to other media and settings with modest edits, suggesting mid-range originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout, and her decision to amplify rather than impose creates the story's key turn. She unpacks projectors, adjusts them to complete the child's reach, and streams the display—all on-page choices. Her realization at the end ("joy wasn't lost in the past") drives the closure. Setup and development gates met; closure participation solid. Cost is tied to her choice to embrace ephemera. Minor friction: some reflection summarizes rather than enacts, and the streaming moment feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The fresco fragment is introduced early, examined closely ("child reaching toward painted fruit"), and returns at the end when Mira realizes the girl "still reaching in her bubble of painted time." It drives Mira's choice to amplify rather than create new images. However, it does not evolve in state or reweight meaning as dramatically as full integration would require. Three gates met; causal pressure solid; closure linkage present but not transformative.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "exposed film" concept appears as a reflective metaphor ("photograph developing in reverse") but does not constrain on-page choices or alter tactics. It enriches tone and theme but remains ornamental. Setup gate met (early metaphor); development and payoff gates weak. No visible cost tied to this concept; swappable with other metaphors of impermanence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is her defining method, shaping every on-page action: unpacking projectors, tracing the fresco's lines with light, projecting imagined fruit onto fog. The trait enables her key choice to amplify rather than impose, and the batteries' limits impose time pressure. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. Cost is present: ephemeral medium ties directly to her acceptance of erasure. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The display action is the story's centerpiece: Mira projects blooming trees and impossible-colored fruit, streams it to the knowledge network, and receives comments that validate her shift. This action drives the middle turn and connects to the closure realization. Setup and development gates met; payoff indirect (the display ends, but the insight it generates drives closure). Moderate causal pressure; could be replaced with a different amplification method without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The knowledge network is introduced early (first paragraph: "whispers from the knowledge network"), used in the middle (streaming the display, receiving comments), and mentioned at the end (ten thousand viewers, coordinates to other places). However, its mechanics are vague, and it does not constrain Mira's choices—it validates rather than complicates. Setup and development gates met; payoff weak. Moderate swappability: another connection method would function similarly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district with centuries of fog is introduced immediately and shapes every choice: fog as canvas, skeletal stone trees as spatial anchors, the fresco fragment as discovery, and fog's erasure as the final acceptance. The setting pressures Mira's realization that "permanence seemed beside the point" and charges the closure image. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. High causal pressure; irreplaceable specificity; visible cost tied to environment.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "daydream fold" is named once early ("if this was all happening within the fold of a daydream") and echoed weakly ("that timeless fog-space"). It does not tighten decisions or create temporal pressure—batteries and dawn do that work. The phrase adds tonal color but does not constrain tactics. Setup gate met; development and payoff gates missed. Highly swappable; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to rediscover lost joy is dramatized through her recognition of the fresco child's expression ("She'd worn it herself once, before art became work"), her laughter ("a sound she hadn't heard from her own throat in months"), and her realization that joy is "right here, in the reaching." The motivation drives her choice to amplify rather than impose and charges the closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Friction between past joy and present work is embodied; cost is visible in her acceptance of ephemera.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pensive mirth is named explicitly ("her old teacher would have called this mood, that particular cocktail of melancholy and delight") and enacted in the laughing moment ("The absurdity of it struck her"). The tone modulates with pressure and charges the final acceptance of erasure. However, the direct naming undercuts subtlety, and the tone does not deepen as dramatically as full integration would require. Setup and development gates met; payoff solid but not transformative.</comment>
