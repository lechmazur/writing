<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is specific and perceptual ("shards of hush," recognizing orris root from childhood), with embodied knowledge driving her actions. The final choice to help the house remember is motivated by the orris root revelation and her grandmother's journals. However, the insight arrives through discovery rather than internal contradiction, and the emotional stakes remain largely intellectual curiosity about house-memory rather than personal cost or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Maya's understanding shifts from "creeping normality" to "creeping memory," reconfiguring her documentary project and future participation. The orris root placement acts as a micro-turn that crystallizes the house's pattern. Cost is legible but oblique—her prior framework is abandoned, and she commits to active intervention rather than observation. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bay, abandoned house, and spring evening are rendered with selective sensory detail (lilac and salt, hammered silver water, amber streetlights) that consistently filters through Maya's noticing lens. The orris root shard functions as micro-setting, constraining the revelation beat and charging the closure when placed on the windowsill where "pale rectangles in the paint suggested something had always rested." Spatial choreography through the house rooms is clear and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is signaled early and tightens when Maya realizes objects map the house's original arrangement. The orris root placement acts as one meaningful deepening that changes her knowledge and future tactics. However, the escalation relies on discovery rather than protagonist agency forcing a trade-off, and the cost (abandoning her observer role) is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from the house-memory conceit without thesis statements: "Houses feel alive when they remember" arises from the displaced-objects pattern. The orris root's three-year curing mirrors the house's three-year abandonment, creating earned resonance. The final image—Maya returning with journals to "help the house remember faster"—offers a non-literal answer about participation in sanctification. "Inadvertently profound" risks label-speak but is anchored to the house's unconscious archaeology.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: she notices "imperceptible shifts" and "shards of hush" with a perfumer's vocabulary inherited from her grandmother. Distance is stable third-limited with clean focalization. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts above the POV's operational register ("sanctifying its own history through patient archaeology"), and the prose leans toward summary-interiority in key beats rather than embodied perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory specifics are strong ("pale as bone, still faintly fragrant with its violet-iris scent"). However, figurative density clusters without pattern-teaching: "hushed blaze," "quiet bay held its breath," "floorboards singing," "thresholds hum," "rooms expand with presence" appear in rapid succession without differentiation or escalation. The phrase "inadvertently profound" and "sanctifying its own history" drift into academic register. Minor paraphrase loops: "teaching itself to remember" / "help the house remember faster."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise of a house self-restoring its original object arrangement is fresh and specific, avoiding stock haunting tropes. The orris root's three-year curing period as material memory offers a non-obvious synthesis. However, the "creeping normality noticer" frame reads as prompt-adjacent, and the emotional arc—observer becomes participant—follows a familiar trajectory. The risk is conceptual rather than stakes-driven, maintaining coherence but not pushing into bold structural choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's noticing establishes the premise and her documentation habit shapes early beats. Her realization that objects map the original arrangement creates the story's central turn. However, her role is primarily interpretive; the key decision to place the orris root and return with journals occurs in the final third without visible cost or tactical constraint earlier.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orris root appears early (found that morning, carried in pocket), is handled at the key turn (placed on windowsill where paint rectangles suggest prior presence), and its three-year curing mirrors the house's timeline. It enables the revelation about Mrs. Ashford being a perfumer. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, though the middle development is compressed into one beat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Shards of hush" is defined early as "displacements that created pockets of profound silence" and recurs in the final paragraph's "some silences aren't empty." However, it functions primarily as thematic vocabulary rather than constraining choices or altering tactics. The concept describes rather than shapes Maya's actions.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" appears once in direct application ("inadvertently profound, it was teaching her") as a label for the house's unconscious work. It does not constrain Maya's choices or create a visible tradeoff; it describes an authorial interpretation of the house's effect rather than a trait that shapes action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Sanctify" and "sanctification" appear in the final third, framing Maya's new understanding of the house's self-restoration. The term reweights her prior observation but does not drive earlier beats or create tactical choices. Swappable with "restore" or "reclaim" without breaking story logic, though "sanctification" carries religious resonance that elevates tone.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Displaced objects are signaled in paragraph two (chair moved, painting facing wall, books in doorways), structure the middle revelation (cups and plates migrated to new shelves), and frame the ending insight about the house's "first language of placement." The method shapes Maya's investigation and the orris root placement validates the pattern. Present across all three structural sections with causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The quiet bay brackets the story (opening and closing paragraphs), and spring density with "lilac and salt" establishes atmosphere. However, the bay functions as backdrop rather than constraint; Maya's walk and the house investigation would proceed identically in another setting. The house interior does more spatial work than the bay itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydream into their amber glow" opens the story and "the streetlights fully woke into their evening watch" closes it, creating a lyric bracket. However, no tactical pressure or decision timing depends on this dusk window; the timeframe is atmospheric rather than structural. Maya's actions are not timed or constrained by the streetlight cycle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The desire to understand why houses feel alive is stated in paragraph one and drives Maya's documentation habit. The orris root revelation reweights this question toward memory rather than mere presence. The ending crystallizes her shift from observer to participant. However, the motivation is intellectual curiosity without competing wants or visible personal cost that creates friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" appears once in the phrase "The hushed blaze of understanding burned through her—quiet but absolute." The pairing of quiet intensity and burning clarity modulates appropriately for the revelation beat. However, the tone does not evolve across pressure points or distinctly charge the final image; it remains consistently reverent and meditative throughout.</comment>
