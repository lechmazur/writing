<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and her grief is embodied early (crushing grief, screamed at unfairness). However, the shift from skeptic-mystic to believer happens through passive observation rather than contradiction—she watches the prism warm and the frost speak without wrestling with competing impulses in the moment. The final stance ("finally firmly grounded") reads as summary rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority occasionally drifts into label-speak ("shifted hush," "truthful lies") without dramatizing the emotional friction those concepts create.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (arbor, prism, frost) toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara accepts her mentor's hidden work. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure effect is a stance crystallization ("she would continue her mentor's real work"), which qualifies as Earned Stasis, but the cost is conceptual and oblique—no on-page action or renunciation makes the price legible in the final beat. The mist "embracing her like an answer" gestures at resonance but does not reweight prior material with a sharp, visible consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The quartz arbor and frost patterns are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Mara's professional mystic lens. The prism constrains her method (she uses it to read frost) and the arbor's "battery" function charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and tied to action (prism warming, frost speaking). Minor: the arbor's function as an emotional repository is told rather than shown altering a tactic, but the frost-reading beat demonstrates setting-as-tool effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: prove objects absorb emotions to honor her mentor's truth. The frost-reading scene provides one meaningful tightening—Mara releases certainty and observes, the prism darkens with absorbed grief. However, escalation is primarily observational; Mara does not face a trade-off or choose between competing goods. The arbor revelation (stones as archive) deepens understanding but does not narrow options or force a visible sacrifice at closure. Cost is conceptual (inheriting a secret legacy) rather than a felt price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—hidden truths beneath scientific respectability—emerges through the mentor's "truthful lies" and Mara's shift from half-belief to acceptance. The prism's transformation from teaching tool to grief-absorber is a strong particular. The final image ("mist embraced her like an answer") offers resonance but borders on affirming the premise rather than reweighting it. "Truthful lies" recurs as a phrase without the story complicating or challenging the paradox; the mentor's double life is told more than dramatized. No overt moralizing in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, third limited, holds cleanly. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices refractions, geometries, emotional residue. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("skeletal cathedral," "frozen echo"). The prose modulates well under pressure (soft vision at the frost-reading, sharp realization at "shattered with an almost audible crack"). Minor: "shifted hush" and "firmly grounded" appear as concept labels rather than embodied sensations, but the overall texture is distinct and the focalization never leaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high. Strong images: "quartz arbor," "frost… ferns and spirals," "prism itself darkened, shot through with cloudy threads." However, several lines loop concepts: "shifted hush—that peculiar silence"; "truthful lies" is defined twice; "commune with the world" and "learn to see properly" overlap. The final paragraph stacks summary claims ("objects absorbed emotions," "world was stranger," "impossible truth") instead of letting the prism image do the work. Template cadence appears in the backstory section ("He had taught… He had also whispered…"). No scaffold or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—objects absorb emotions, readable through sympathetic tools—is internally coherent and the frost-reading method is specific. However, the "skeptical scientist hiding mystical truth" frame is familiar, and the mentor's deathbed confession is a stock inciting move. Mara's acceptance comes without friction or risk; no counter-pressure tests her new belief. The arbor as "battery" and prism as "archive" read as explanatory metaphors rather than discoveries with narrative surprise. Transformation of the trope is partial; emotional honesty is present but the turn feels anticipated rather than earned in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her role as "attentive mystic" frames her observation skills. However, her key choice—releasing certainty to observe—is passive and does not create a turn; the prism and frost act on their own. She decides to "continue her mentor's real work" at the end, but this is summary rather than a dramatized decision with cost. Setup and closure participation are present; causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass prism appears in three beats: carried for a decade as a teaching tool, used to read frost patterns, and transformed by absorbing grief (darkens with cloudy threads). It constrains her method and its transformation supplies the proof she seeks. The prism's evolution from light-bender to grief-absorber is irreplaceable and charges the closure. Strong setup, development, and payoff; causal pressure and closure linkage are clear.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Shifted hush" appears early as a descriptor ("that peculiar silence that follows the shattering of deeply held beliefs") and recurs at the climax ("shifted hush deepened"). However, it functions as atmospheric labeling rather than shaping stakes or altering tactics. The concept does not constrain a choice or change options; it remains thematic decoration. Setup and closure echo are present but without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Firmly grounded" is mentioned twice: Castellan taught her to be "firmly grounded" and she becomes "finally firmly grounded in this impossible truth." The phrase is ironic (grounding in the impossible) but does not constrain or enable an on-page action. It functions as a thematic toggle rather than a trait with visible cost. Label-only use; no development beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Commune" is stated as her need ("to commune with the world in a way she had always been taught was impossible") but the action itself—observing frost patterns—is described rather than felt as communion. The major turn (prism absorbing grief) happens to her rather than through her communing. The word appears in setup and the concept underlies closure, but the action is not dramatized as a distinct, irreplaceable beat. Functional but replaceable with "understand" or "connect."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (Castellan's cryptic journal) and executed on the page: Mara places the prism against frost, softens her vision, and reads emotional residue in ice crystals. The mechanics matter—rainbow shards, jagged lines from her hands, whorls near the driver's seat. The prism absorbs the frost's echo, proving the method. Setup, development (the reading itself), and payoff (prism transformation) are all present. The method is specific and shapes the proof attempt.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The quartz arbor is vividly described (skeletal cathedral, translucent columns refracting light) and returns at the climax as "a battery, a repository, a living archive." This revelation reweights the setting, but Mara does not use the arbor to alter a tactic—she walks past it to her car. The arbor frames the scene and supplies thematic depth but does not constrain a choice. Setup, closure participation (she understands it), but weak development.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"When assumptions shatter" is embodied early ("her carefully constructed understanding lay in pieces") and recurs at the climax ("Mara's assumptions about reality shattered with an almost audible crack"). The timeframe tightens her urgency—she grieves her mentor's death and must act now to honor his truth. However, no on-page clock pressures her tactics; the shattering is more thematic marker than ticking constraint. Setup and closure reprise are strong; middle pressure is thin.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation—"to prove that objects absorb emotions"—is stated early and drives the frost-reading attempt. Conflict is present: she needs proof "not for academic validation, but to honor the hidden truth." However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through competing desires or a visible cost. The frost experiment succeeds without friction, and her final commitment ("she would continue") is summary. Setup, one middle beat (the proof attempt), and closure mention; friction is light.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Truthful lies" is introduced as Castellan's phrase for "facts that sound like fiction" and returns when Mara realizes he "had been a guardian of dangerous knowledge, speaking truthful lies." The tone of paradox is coherent but static—the phrase is repeated rather than charged with new meaning. The tone does not modulate with pressure or complicate the final image; it functions as a thematic label. Setup and closure echo without development or tonal shift under stress.</comment>
