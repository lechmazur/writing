<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivations are clear and grounded in family legacy, with embodied interiority ("feeling the slope give way beneath her like history itself crumbling"). Her purposeful curiosity drives visible choices—planting beacons, placing the sand grain—and the final stance (walking away after preserving what she can) feels earned. Minor: the internal voice occasionally drifts toward elevated narration ("erasure," "cosmic time") that sits slightly above immediate experience, and the grandfather backstory, while purposeful, occupies substantial space without fully altering present tactics beyond the symbolic grain placement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (crater inspector, moonlit summit, three-hour window). The closure unit—Maya's act of preservation through chemical photography and her departure as the consortium arrives—qualifies as Earned Stasis with visible cost (she cannot save the crater but succeeds in documenting it). Causality holds under a Causal lens: beacons planted → sunrise triggers reactions → photographs develop → she leaves. The cost is felt (loss of Valentina, but images endure), though the final paragraph's "golden, eternal, and hers" tilts slightly declarative where the image could speak alone. One meaningful tightening present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The moonlit summit and crater environment are vivid and purposeful: regolith texture, temperature swing physics, and the terminator line all ground the setting. The chemical beacons (copper sulfate, magnesium) are specific and shape her method. Spatial choreography is clear across descent and ascent. The setting constrains choice (three-hour window, temperature trigger) and charges the final image ("amber light," "golden"). Small excess: some details (shocked rock, melted glass) are catalogued without immediate tactical pressure, and the portable darkroom materializes late without prior setup.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving Valentina before destruction—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens through the countdown (three hours, then dawn arrival) and Maya's agency drives the resolution (planting beacons, photographing, departing). The temperature-triggered reactions create one meaningful escalation beat. Cost is legible: she loses the physical crater but gains its documented memory. However, the consortium's bulldozers never materialize on-page; the threat remains abstract, and the final "machines arrived" is told rather than shown, softening the confrontation's visceral weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—preservation versus erasure, memory's defiance of time—emerges organically through the hourglass grain, the chemical reactions, and the photographs. The final image (Valentina "golden, eternal, and hers") reweights prior material without explicit moralizing, offering a non-literal answer to the cost of progress. The sand grain's placement is quietly resonant, linking personal and cosmic timescales. Minor: "Progress, they called it. Maya called it erasure" edges toward thesis statement, and "what would soon be gone forever" slightly over-signals meaning the beacons already embody.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly bound to Maya's perceptions. Diction is largely controlled with character-specific filters ("practiced grace," "dawning hush"), and psychic distance modulates effectively. The hourglass backstory anchors in present handling of the grain, maintaining coherence. Small slips: "feeling nothing but knowing everything" is abstracted and declarative; "dressed in chemical fire" and "dawnlit melancholy" tilt slightly ornamental. Narration occasionally ascends into poetic register ("history itself crumbling") that slightly exceeds immediate experience, though it remains legible and voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clear and propulsive with varied syntax. Information density is high in the beacon-planting sequence, and sensory details (emerald copper, magnesium blooms) are vivid. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "crater inspector moved" / "Maya had three hours" restates WHO; "couldn't outlast the consortium's lawyers" / "could at least outlast the darkness" recycles structure; "Valentina was different. Valentina was perfect" is synonym churn. The final paragraph stacks modifiers ("golden, eternal, and hers") where one would suffice. Template cadence in backstory paragraphs ("He'd fallen... He'd filled...") and minor filter-verb clusters ("feeling the slope give way") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats. Deduction −0.6 for loops and stacks, plus −0.2 for filter density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lunar-crater preservation premise offers a fresh angle on heritage-versus-development conflict, and the chemical-beacon photography method is specific and inventive. The hourglass grain provides a distinct emotional anchor. However, the core frame—lone scientist racing to document a threatened site before corporate destruction—follows a recognizable template (eleventh-hour preservation against faceless consortium). Transformation is partial: the lunar setting and timed-reaction method add specificity, but the emotional beats (family legacy, bittersweet loss, symbolic final gesture) align closely with conservation-narrative conventions. The consortium remains abstract, and Maya's victory is entirely internal, reducing moral friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maya is on-page throughout and makes key choices: descending into the crater, planting seven beacons, placing the sand grain, and walking away. Her decisions create the documentary preservation that defines the ending. She appears early (first line) and drives all major beats. However, her choices, while purposeful, follow a linear plan without friction or reversal—she executes her method without complication, and no on-page obstacle forces tactical adaptation. Cost is legible but tied to the abstract consortium threat rather than her own competing impulses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sand grain is introduced in paragraph one (wrapped in grandmother's handkerchief), appears in backstory (grandfather's hourglass broke), and is placed in the crater's center in a charged moment. It returns implicitly in the final image ("one grain among billions, but purposeful"). The grain bridges personal and cosmic scales and adds symbolic weight to the preservation theme. However, its handling is largely ceremonial—Maya presses it into dust, but the grain does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. It enriches meaning without driving causality, landing it in the lyric-resonance allowance zone (5.5–6.3) for purposeful early seed with thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" appears as a phrase in paragraph seven ("The dawning hush arrived not with sound but with the absence of stars") and colors the ending's tone. It names the transition moment when Maya's beacons ignite. However, it functions more as atmospheric label than active stake-shaper—the sunrise itself (temperature shift triggering reactions) drives the plot mechanics, while "hush" describes the mood. The concept is present but does not constrain Maya's choices or create friction; it could be replaced with "sunrise" or "dawn" without structural change. It enriches tone (lyric质感) but lacks causal grip.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious" is stated in paragraph three ("She was purposefully curious by nature, always the child who'd asked why stars died...") and motivates her role as crater inspector. It explains her career and her drive to document Valentina. However, the trait remains background motivation rather than an on-page constraint—her actions (planting beacons, photographing) follow from her professional role and personal legacy, not from a curiosity that creates visible trade-offs or complications. The label informs character but does not shape a beat where curiosity costs her or narrows options. It appears after the opening and does not return with altered weight.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Outlast" is seeded early ("If she couldn't outlast the consortium's lawyers... she could at least outlast the darkness") and structures the entire middle: Maya races the three-hour countdown to preserve Valentina before bulldozers arrive. Her timed beacons and photographs are the means of outlasting through documentation. The action drives escalation (clock ticking toward dawn) and defines the closure (she succeeds in making images that will "outlast them all"). Cost is visible: she cannot outlast physically but does so symbolically. The verb is irreplaceable—removing "outlast" would require reframing the entire temporal strategy and thematic hinge (time, memory, endurance). Present in all three beats (setup, middle execution, ending reflection), with causal and thematic grip.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Chemical reactions for timed messages are introduced in paragraph four ("phosphorescent compounds... triggered by the temperature shift at sunrise"), detailed in paragraph seven (silver nitrate, copper sulfate, thermochromic crystals, magnesium), planted across the middle, and ignite at the climax ("one by one, her chemical reactions ignited"). The method is specific, pre-signaled, and mechanically sound (300-degree swing triggers). It enables Maya's strategy, drives the visual peak (emerald, magnesium blooms), and produces the photographs that fulfill her goal. Without this exact method, the preservation would require a different mechanism. The reactions appear early, shape multiple beats (planting, ignition, photograph development), and charge the ending image. Irreplaceable and causally active.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The moonlit summit and Crater Valentina anchor the entire story spatially and thematically. Maya descends into the crater (paragraph five), plants beacons at its heart and rim, and the crater's "perfection" justifies her mission. The lunar environment supplies key constraints: regolith texture, temperature swing physics, the terminator line timing. The setting is named in the opening line, pressures her three-hour window, and provides the visual subject of the final image ("Valentina was golden"). Removing the moonlit crater would collapse the plot. However, much of the crater description is observational (shocked rock, ejecta spray) rather than tactically engaged; Maya moves through it more than she is constrained by its micro-geography.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Space age" is mentioned in paragraph one ("the dawn of the space age" sixty years ago) as historical context for her grandfather's work. It frames the setting's era and explains how lunar regolith reached Earth for the hourglass. However, the timeframe does not tighten present decisions—Maya's countdown is measured in hours to dawn, not by space-age periodization. The element is functional for backstory coherence but swappable (any past exploratory era would serve). It appears once, does not shape middle tactics, and is absent from the closure. Present but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The desire to photograph the last untouched crater is stated early (paragraph one: "last untouched impact site"; paragraph four: "preserving Valentina's portrait") and drives every beat: calibrating cameras, planting beacons, developing images. The motivation is dramatized through her actions and charged by family legacy (grandfather's mapping). Friction arises between her goal and the consortium's claim, creating the countdown pressure. Cost is visible: she loses the physical site but gains its documented memory. The final image ("these would outlast them all") directly fulfills and reweights the motivation. The "last of something precious" phrasing captures both scarcity and value, making it indispensable to the story's logic and emotional arc. Present across all three beats with strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dawnlit melancholy is embodied throughout: the moonlit opening, the countdown to dawn, the "dawnlit melancholy" of the developed photographs, and the amber-golden final image. Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure—quiet determination in the planting sequence, visual crescendo at ignition, subdued closure in the walk away. The melancholy charges the ending (loss tempered by preservation). However, the exact phrase "dawnlit melancholy" appears once as a descriptor of the photographs rather than emerging fully through image and action. The tone could be named "bittersweet" or "elegiac" with minor edits, suggesting partial replaceability. Strong tonal coherence and closure linkage, but the specific label is not structurally indispensable.</comment>
