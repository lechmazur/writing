<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silas is established through embodied isolation and micro-choices (placing the box, studying patterns, making a new box), with his motivation rooted in trauma from "voices became weapons." The ghost keeper is purposeful but remains a catalyst rather than a fully realized character with internal contradiction. The final choice to preserve the list is earned by the pattern of observation and understanding, though the emotional progression is somewhat linear without competing impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through recursive observation (ghost's pattern, box mechanics, list revelation) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Silas commits to witness-keeping, foreclosing his prior aimless exile with visible cost (ongoing duty). The tightening is meaningful—discovery of the list reweights his isolation from self-imposed exile to sacred task. Cost is legible in the final image: he will remain, tending memory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The apiary setting constrains choices throughout: cracked windows and wax seals ground Silas's isolation, abandoned hives provide the spatial pattern that unlocks the box, and the "last good wood" frames the closure commitment. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("scorched breath," crystallized honey, stained glass colors "impossible in this bleached world"). The wasteland charges the oasis as a pocket of preservation against erasure, directly shaping the final stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the ghost keeper's purpose and the box's covenant—is signaled early and tightens through observation, failed attempts, and pattern recognition. The escalation is driven by Silas's agency (study, experimentation, rotation sequence) under the Accumulative lens, narrowing from mystery to actionable insight. The resolution costs him continued isolation without purpose, converting it to witness-keeper duty. One minor friction: the ghost's fade feels slightly convenient rather than a consequence Silas must accept as ongoing pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the list of names, the ghost's movement pattern, the unopenable box. The covenant between silence and acknowledgment is enacted rather than stated, and the ending image (Silas tending the new box) offers a resonant answer to the question of what survives erasure—not words spoken, but witness borne. The piece resists explaining its own insight ("words gained power by remaining unspoken" is the closest to thesis-stating but is grounded in the dramatized list). No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the act of preservation speaks.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Silas notices patterns, seals, and tool absences. Diction remains controlled ("tranquil perception," "mute eloquence") without register drift, and the narrator's certainty matches Silas's knowledge. The phrase "whatever catastrophe had rendered the dead visible" is efficient compression rather than evasion. One minor slip: "She'd been a keeper here" reads as narratorial certainty rather than Silas's inference, though context suggests he's piecing it together.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, paragraph structure supports beats, and information density is high (the box description does triple work: anchors mystery, signals craft, establishes color scarcity). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor opacity: "tangled and strange" in "The box was a covenant, tangled and strange" leans abstract where concrete stakes would sharpen. "Mute eloquence" and "tranquil perception" recur slightly more than needed, though they remain voice-motivated. Propulsion is steady; no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting, ghost visibility, and beekeeping heritage creates a non-obvious frame. The list of worker acknowledgments is a fresh particularization of "witness" as a stake. However, the core emotional arc—recluse finds purpose through ghostly request—follows a familiar template (hermit called to duty). The stained-glass puzzle and movement-pattern unlock add ingenuity to the middle, and the choice to remain rather than simply release the ghost avoids the easiest resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas ("astonished recluse") drives all key turns: noticing the box (setup), studying the ghost's pattern (development), rotating the panels (climax), committing to preserve the list (closure). His astonishment is embodied in the initial overlooking and his decision to stay converts surprise into purpose with visible cost (ongoing duty in the wasteland). Present early, active in every beat, indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stained glass box appears in paragraph three, is handled in multiple beats (lifted, studied, placed for the ghost, rotated), and its opening delivers the climax. Its properties matter: no seam, light-through-panels clue, bee motifs that echo the setting. The final image recharges it as Silas plans a new box, reweighting preservation as ongoing practice. Swapping for a generic locked container would require rewriting the unlock mechanism and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Tangled covenant" is named mid-story and shapes Silas's tactics (he seeks to open without destroying). The covenant concept—preserve silence with weight—drives the closure choice (tend the list rather than simply releasing it). However, the mechanics of "tangled" remain somewhat abstract; the story could function with "hidden agreement" with minor edits. Present by midpoint, active in closure, but not maximally specific.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The ghost keeper is described as "tranquilly perceptive" and her gaze is "tranquil intensity" throughout. The trait enables Silas's understanding (she observes without threatening, allowing him to interpret her pattern) but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. It flavors her presence more than it alters tactics. Functional but closer to atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Gaze" appears in multiple beats: the ghost's fixed gaze on Silas, her glances toward the box and tools, Silas watching her pattern, her final look after the box opens. The ghost's gaze signals her purposefulness and guides Silas's attention to the hive pattern. Removing gaze would require rewriting how information is conveyed. Active in setup, middle pattern-reading, and closure recognition; not easily swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Through contextual clues" is the method throughout: ghost movement between hives, pauses at tool locations, inability to touch the box, light-cast shadows. The mechanics are signaled early (paragraph five: "through contextual clues") and each clue drives an attempt (placement, pattern recognition, panel rotation). The method is not late-breaking; it structures the middle and unlocks the climax. Swapping for verbal instruction or dream would break the mute-eloquence tone.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "abandoned beekeeping oasis in a scorched wasteland" pressures every choice: seals constrain access, hive layout provides the unlock pattern, crystallized honey supplies a failed attempt, "last good wood" frames the closure cost (staying in scarcity to preserve memory). The setting is not postcard; it is resource and constraint. Micro-setting (the shelf, specific hives) alters tactics. Removing the apiary context would collapse the puzzle and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After ghosts become visible" anchors the timeframe in the opening sentence and recurs (three months, post-catastrophe). It licenses the ghost keeper's presence and signals a changed world, but does not create a ticking clock that alters Silas's tactics beat-to-beat. The timeframe enables the premise more than it tightens decisions. Functional setup, light development, ambient at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"To preserve the weight of unspoken words" is Silas's motivation, dramatized through his choice of silence, his care with the box (not smashing it), and his final commitment to tend the list. The motivation is inferred from actions rather than stated until late, and the friction between isolation-as-escape and isolation-as-duty creates cost. The ghost's need and the list's contents provide the conflict. Active in closure with visible cost (he stays).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Mute eloquence" is coherent throughout: Silas's wordlessness, the ghost's gesture-based communication, the box's silent opening, the list as written witness rather than spoken praise. Tone modulates from wary observation to purposeful understanding without breaking the quiet register. The final image (tending in silence) charges the tone with weight. Diction supports it ("tranquil," "without sound," "nodded once"). Integral to voice and closure.</comment>
