<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is vivid and consistent—her bewilderment evolving to comprehension reads as earned. The "grandfather's eyes" reveal at the end carries conceptual weight but feels slightly unmoored from prior causality; the leap from curator to self-inheriting ancestor is declared more than dramatized. Embodied contradiction is present (pursuing forbidden knowledge despite dismissals), though the bathroom breakthrough borders on convenient epiphany without sufficient on-page struggle. Minor penalty for the final-beat insight arriving as assertion rather than through a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly by the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: Mara's realization that she will inherit herself backward reweights the entire premise with conceptual cost (she is both curator and subject of the archive's logic). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered examples of nonlinear inheritance until the tree/cameo moment crystallizes the pattern. One meaningful deepening occurs when the cameo fits the tree, shifting her from bewildered to participant. Cost is conceptual and felt (she must eventually become her own grandfather), though the final image could make that price more viscerally undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The astral orchard and greenhouse dome are vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail—silver fruit blooming backward, luminous unease, breath forming crystals. The pistachio shell cameo and the carved tree at the orchard's heart function as micro-setting that constrains and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear (greenhouse → bathroom → orchard at midnight → tree's trunk). The bathroom as the quiet place for breakthroughs is a specific, character-filtered anchor that shapes a key choice. Minor gap: the asteroid's rotation and distant galaxy ribbon are scenic but don't alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Mara must understand the archive's nonlinear logic to function as curator and satisfy her drive for forbidden knowledge. Pressure accumulates through examples (pomegranate, fig, then the undocumented tree) until the cameo/tree moment tightens her comprehension and forecloses her prior bewilderment. The escalation is Accumulative rather than Causal—density increases until the pattern snaps into focus. Cost is visible (she must eventually inherit herself backward, foreclosing linear identity), though the final beat asserts this more than it dramatizes a trade-off in present action. One meaningful deepening satisfies the length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the nonlinear inheritance premise: identity, causality, and the cost of knowledge loop through particulars (fruit that plants its own tree, the half-carved cameo, the curator who becomes his own grandfather). The final image—Mara recognizing her grandfather's eyes in the mirror—resonates without stating a moral, reweighting her role from observer to participant. Subtext operates in the phrase "simply complicated" and the recurring "between the first and last page" motif. The bathroom breakthrough borders on convenient epiphany, slightly undercutting the otherwise earned thematic revelation. No overt sermonizing; the conceptual cost (nonlinear selfhood) charges the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable and apt; narrative certainty matches Mara's knowledge state. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices temporal paradoxes, philosophical patterns, the trees' "brightened disquiet." Diction is controlled and purposeful ("inheritance here was simply complicated," "brightened disquiet," "blooming backward through time"). The phrase "brightened disquiet" recurs but feels slightly forced, a prompt-fulfillment tic rather than Mara's natural idiom. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Minor register drift: "curator of the Hesperides Archive" and "Artifact 77: Do Not Inquire" read slightly expository rather than Mara's lived voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong images ("silver fruit bloom backward through time," "breath forming crystals"). Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Paraphrase loops appear: "backward blossoming" / "bloom backward" and "simply complicated" recurs three times without escalating pressure, feeling like scaffold. The phrase "between the first and last page" appears four times, crossing from motif into churn. Filter-verb stack in the bathroom scene ("she'd discovered," "she held," "she understood") slightly dulls immediacy. Minor template cadence in the catalog of trees (pomegranate tree / fig tree / one tree). Closure image is vivid but the "grandfather's eyes" line borders on over-explicit thematic capping.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The nonlinear inheritance premise is fresh and the astral orchard setting is specific and memorable. The synthesis of temporal paradox, botanical archive, and identity feels original rather than templated. The pistachio shell cameo as the key artifact is particular and non-obvious. Risk: the self-inheriting curator concept is bold and coherent. The bathroom-breakthrough detail humanizes the speculative frame. Minor penalty: the "curator becomes his own grandfather" twist feels slightly telegraphed by the "previous curator disappeared" setup, reducing surprise. The final mirror image (grandfather's eyes) is effective but borders on over-literal symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her choices (checking documentation, approaching the tree, placing the cameo, carving her name) drive key beats. Setup is immediate (opening line). Development: her systematic inquiry and the midnight orchard visit constrain middle action. Closure: she places the cameo back and recognizes her role in the loop. Two distinct beats (cameo discovery, tree encounter) and causal pressure (her inquiry enables the realization). "Bewildered" to "no longer quite so bewildered" tracks a stance shift with cost (she must eventually become her own grandfather). Swappability: a different archetype (archivist, researcher) could work with minor edits, capping below 7.0. Closure linkage is strong but the cost is conceptual rather than a visible forfeit in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cameo appears in three beats: discovery in the restricted section, bathroom examination, and placement in the tree's trunk. Setup is early (second section). Development: bathroom reflection shapes her hypothesis. Closure: it fits the tree's gap, triggering her realization and is then returned to the archive with reweighted meaning ("someone between the first and last page would need it next"). Causal pressure: the cameo's incomplete carving enables the conceptual breakthrough. Specificity: pistachio shell, pale green, thumbnail-sized, half-carved profile—irreplaceable details. Cost connection: the cameo's incompleteness mirrors Mara's unfinished role. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement. Minor cap: the cameo is described more than handled with visible physical cost; it functions symbolically rather than as a tool that alters tactics under duress.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance is present from the opening line ("silver fruit bloom backward through time") and structures every beat: apples planting their past trees, the previous curator inheriting himself into his grandfather, Mara's eventual self-inheritance. Setup is immediate. Development: pomegranate/fig examples, the undocumented tree, and the cameo's fit all demonstrate the concept's mechanics. Closure: the final realization ("she would inherit herself into becoming") completes the conceptual arc with undeniable cost. Causal pressure: the concept changes Mara's options (she cannot remain a passive observer; she is part of the loop). Specificity: inheritance moving "in spirals, not lines" and "offspring to parent" are irreplaceable to the story's logic. All three gates met; beat involvement spans the entire narrative; closure linkage is decisive.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The phrase "simply complicated" appears three times: in the previous curator's margins, Mara's reflection, and the final paragraph. Setup is early (second paragraph). Development: it describes the inheritance logic, shaping her approach. Closure: it recurs in the final line, charging the ending with tonal consistency. However, the attribute is label-only—it describes rather than constrains an on-page action with visible cost. Mara does not face a choice where simplicity and complexity are in tension; the phrase is thematic ornament. Swappability: "paradoxically elegant" or "deceptively intricate" could replace it with minor edits. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) allows up to ~6.0, but lack of middle beat involvement and causal pressure caps it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Inquire" is signaled in the catalog label ("Artifact 77: Do Not Inquire") and Mara's character setup ("asking questions...was precisely why she'd accepted this position"). Development: she "began to inquire systematically, checking each tree's documentation," which leads to discovering the undocumented tree. Closure: her inquiry enables the tree/cameo breakthrough. Two distinct beats (catalog label, systematic check) and causal pressure (inquiry narrows options to the uncataloged tree). Cost connection: pursuing forbidden knowledge forecloses her role as passive curator. Swappability: "investigate" or "examine" could replace with edits, capping below 8.0. Strong development and closure linkage, but the action is slightly generic (many curator stories involve inquiry).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The bathroom breakthrough appears in one extended beat (midpoint reflection). Setup: Mara "had discovered that philosophical breakthroughs came easier in bathrooms" frames expectation. Development: she holds the cameo under fluorescent light and formulates the hypothesis ("what if she was simply the custodian between the first and last page"). However, the method does not shape the ending—her realization at the tree supersedes the bathroom insight. The breakthrough is told rather than shown under pressure; we see her hypothesis, not a visible cost or tactical shift tied to the bathroom setting. Late-middle introduction and single-beat use cap it at ~5.0. Specificity (white tiles, flowing water) adds texture but the method is replaceable (she could reflect in the orchard or archive).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The astral orchard is present from the opening line and structures every beat: greenhouse glass, silver fruit, time-twisted trees, the midnight rotation revealing the galaxy, the carved tree at the orchard's heart. Setup is immediate. Development: the orchard's examples (pomegranate, fig) constrain Mara's understanding and the undocumented tree at the heart becomes the site of the closure choice. Closure: the tree's trunk with the carved gap, where the cameo fits, charges the final realization. Causal pressure: the orchard's nonlinear logic narrows her options (she must participate, not merely observe). Specificity: "astral orchard," "lonely asteroid," "dome," "brightened disquiet"—irreplaceable to the story's logic. All three gates met; beat involvement is pervasive; closure linkage is decisive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Between the first and last page" appears four times as a recurring motif: Mara's hypothesis about the cameo, her role as custodian, and twice in the closing beats. Setup is mid-story (bathroom scene). Development: the phrase shapes her understanding of her role as intermediary. Closure: it recurs in the final paragraph, charging the ending with conceptual cost ("someone between the first and last page would need it next"). However, the timeframe is metaphorical rather than a live clock that alters tactics—there is no ticking deadline or schedule pressure. The asteroid's rotation and "three weeks managing" ground duration but don't tighten decisions. Two-gate presence (development, closure) and lyric reprise allow ~6.0–6.3, but lack of tactical constraint and early setup cap it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara's drive to pursue forbidden knowledge is established in paragraph four ("dismissed from three universities for asking questions...precisely why she'd accepted this position"). Setup is early. Development: she violates the catalog's "Do Not Inquire" label, retreats to the bathroom to theorize, and approaches the undocumented tree at midnight—all choices that enact her motivation. Closure: her inquiry leads to the self-inheritance realization, foreclosing her role as detached observer with conceptual cost. Causal pressure: the motivation narrows options (she cannot remain passive). Friction: she weighs "forbidden knowledge" against her bewilderment, creating internal conflict. Beat involvement spans three distinct moments (catalog, bathroom, tree). Specificity: "asking questions about temporal causality" ties the motivation to the premise. Strong closure linkage and visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The phrase "brightened disquiet" appears twice: describing the trees' glow and Mara's final state. Setup is mid-story (midnight orchard scene). Development: the tone charges the orchard description ("beautiful and wrong, hopeful and haunted") and Mara's emotional state. Closure: it recurs in the final paragraph, modulating with her shift from bewilderment to acceptance. However, the tone is label-reliant—"brightened" and "disquiet" are asserted rather than embodied through syntax and rhythm that intensify under pressure. The piece teaches unease (inheritance paradoxes) but "brightened" feels forced, a prompt-fulfillment tic rather than an organic tonal quality. Two-gate presence (development, closure) and lyric reprise allow ~6.0–6.6, but lack of early setup and limited embodiment in cadence cap it.</comment>
