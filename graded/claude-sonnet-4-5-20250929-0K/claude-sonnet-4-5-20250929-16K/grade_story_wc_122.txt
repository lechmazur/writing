<comment>Mira's motivation to combat emotional numbness is clear and her professional identity as a deaf music teacher is well-established, but her interior life remains largely expository rather than contradictory or embodied under pressure. The piece tells us she "recognized" numbness and "felt drawn" to the phonograph without showing competing impulses or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final transformation is summarized across weeks and seasons rather than dramatized in a single choice with visible cost. The backstory about her students occupies significant space but doesn't anchor to present micro-decisions that alter her stance on the page.</comment>

<comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens through Mira's discovery of the drum maker's techniques leading to her experimentation and eventual student sessions. However, the closure—"a whisper, then a song, then a resurrection"—remains abstract and told rather than shown with a specific decisive change or felt cost on the page. The multi-week/seasonal time compression elides the key moments where choices narrow options or stakes rise. Orientation is adequate (deaf teacher descends into cavern in autumn/winter), but the causality chain lacks a visible pivot where Mira's agency forecloses a path with legible price.</comment>

<comment>The drum maker's cavern functions as more than backdrop: Mira hangs fabrics to absorb echoes, uses the stone floor to transmit vibrations, and the space's "mirrored hush" directly shapes her method. The broken phonograph needle, workbench, and drum frames are handled across multiple beats and constrain her choices. However, the setting details remain somewhat generic (heavy fabrics, stone floor) without the specificity that would make this cavern irreplaceable, and the seasonal timeframe ("autumn's last breath met winter's first whisper") is more ornamental than constraining.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and coherent throughout. However, the escalation is summarized ("spent weeks preparing," "by the time winter truly settled") rather than dramatized through on-page choices that narrow options or raise visible cost. The backward phonograph discovery and student sessions happen in sequence without a meaningful tightening or reversal where Mira must trade off competing goods. The piece tells us the technique "worked its strange alchemy" without showing a moment where success or failure hangs on her decision under pressure.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The theme—that emotion lives in pauses and silence rather than sound—emerges through the concrete particulars of vibration, backward recordings, and the "filament of hush." The final image of the broken needle as reminder of necessary fracture offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. However, lines like "sometimes things must break apart to reveal what exists in the fracture" and "the thin, vital space where feeling breathes" edge toward thematic statement rather than letting the image carry full weight. The convergence of deafness, backward music, and emotional revival feels purposeful but occasionally explained rather than purely dramatized.</comment>

<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is controlled. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that sits awkwardly with the immediacy of the premise: "architecture of feeling itself," "strange alchemy," "resurrection of all they'd thought they'd lost." The perceptual signature—filtering through a deaf teacher's vibration-based awareness—is present but not consistently embodied in syntax or rhythm. Dialogue appears only in one signed instruction ("Don't play. Just feel") which functions adequately but offers no test of voice distinction or subtext.</comment>

<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Clarity is generally maintained and sentence structure varies, but several passages loop conceptually: "a numbing, a silence deeper than deafness, an emotional void" restates the same idea three ways without added pressure. The opening's "architecture of feeling itself" and closure's "thin, vital space where feeling breathes" carry similar abstract elevation that slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language clusters in some beats ("filament of hush," "mirrored hush," "strange alchemy," "resurrection") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. The piece compresses weeks into summary rather than maintaining tight scene-level propulsion, and the final paragraph's "a whisper, then a song, then a resurrection" reads as rhythmic escalation but lacks concrete grounding.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of deaf music teacher, backward recordings, and emotional numbness offers a fresh angle on the "art heals" premise. The specific mechanism—vibration through stone, reversed melodies, the broken needle as emblem—avoids generic abstractions. However, the core arc (isolated artist discovers technique, shares it, becomes guide) follows a familiar template without a turn that resists expectation. The piece commits to its premise but doesn't take a bold structural or perspectival risk; the multi-week summary and pilgrimage-site ending feel safe rather than inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
