<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is concrete and her choice to remain as vessel shows motivation, but the arc from loneliness to connection reads abstract rather than embodied. The transition "She no longer felt lonely, despite her isolation" tells rather than dramatizes the shift. Internal conflict is present in her position between factions, but the final smile and switch-off feel like closure gestures without visible cost that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is sparse; most interior beats use declarative summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the radio messages accrete, factions form, and the final transmission reweights Vera's role. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"You have always been both the question and the answer" crystallizes her stance with felt pressure. Cost is conceptual but legible: she switches off the transmitter knowing her work is "just beginning," accepting isolation as necessary. The piece coheres under the lens and the ending image holds, though the price could be more viscerally anchored.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico and stormlit observatory are vivid and purposeful, constraining Vera's isolation and charging the closure scene where she watches the storm break. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric ("ozone and burnt coffee," "taste copper"). The portico becomes both pulpit and prison, a recurring anchor that shapes her public role and final realization. Spatial choreography is clear throughout; the setting participates in the ending image with intentional weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Vera's role as Prophet mediating between factions—is signaled early and tightens as both camps claim her allegiance. The tightening is meaningful: pilgrims climb, soldiers position, interpretations conflict. Her final choice to continue broadcasting while refusing to interpret beyond her own vision forecloses alignment with either faction, a visible stance crystallization. The cost is understated but present: she remains "understood by no one." Agency is clear; escalation coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between "ancient shadows" and "new dawn," resisting binary resolution. "Variant allegiance as the only honest path" is stated but also shown through Vera's refusal to edit or choose sides. The final radio message—"You have always been both the question and the answer"—reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in image and action: the storm breaking into morning is resonant and non-literal. The piece embraces complexity without false equivalence; Vera's isolation becomes connection through transmission.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; distance control is clean with no head-hopping. Diction is purposeful and consistent, mixing mythic register ("lyrically prophetic," "ancient shadows") with grounded detail ("vacuum tubes, copper coils"). Perceptual signature is present: Vera notices electrical phenomena with technical specificity. Some phrasing leans toward elevated summary—"lonely visionary," "whimsically true"—that risks distancing at peak beats. The final paragraph sustains voice under pressure without major slips, though the rhythm flattens slightly in the middle exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is controlled with strong opening and closing images. Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. Minor scaffold appears in the middle: "The truth was grittier than either side wanted, whimsical as a drunk oracle, practical as a farmer's almanac" uses parallel construction that feels decorative. "Gritty and strange and perfectly, whimsically true" in the final line echoes the earlier pattern without adding pressure. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; figurative language is mostly coherent. Propulsion is steady; the piece breathes appropriately at transitions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The frame—solitary radio operator receiving prophetic transmissions—is familiar, but the piece elevates it through specific detail (cobalt glass portico, vacuum tubes) and the variant-allegiance complication. Vera's refusal to choose sides offers a non-obvious moral calculus. The synthesis of ancient wisdom and modern technology through fragmented frequencies feels purposeful. Risk-taking is moderate: the piece commits to its mythic register without retreating, though the emotional arc follows a recognizable trajectory from isolation to integration. Transformation is present but not radical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vera ("lonely visionary") is present throughout and her choices—broadcasting without interpretation, switching off the transmitter—create key turns. Setup is immediate; she makes decisions at the ending that crystallize her stance. However, much of the middle is observational (factions forming, pilgrims climbing) rather than choice-driven. The final switch-off and acceptance of ongoing work shape closure with moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico appears in multiple beats: first as atmospheric anchor, then as "pulpit and prison" where pilgrims touch its surface, finally as the location where Vera receives the last transmission and watches the storm break. It frames her public role and charges the closure image. The object is handled and reweighted across the arc, though its mechanical properties remain symbolic rather than tactile. Strong integration with closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Variant allegiance" is explicitly named and shown through the factions' competing claims and Vera's refusal to choose. It shapes stakes on the page: soldiers position themselves, interpretations clash, Vera laughs at being "claimed by everyone." The concept drives her final stance—continuing to transmit without editing. However, the phrase "variant allegiances" itself feels prompt-adjacent and the dramatization relies partly on summary. Shapes tactics and closure with moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Lyrically prophetic" appears as a label in paragraph three and recurs in "lyrically prophetic broadcasts." The trait enables her broadcasts and constrains how people interpret her, but the lyrical quality is told more than enacted in the dialogue or transmissions. The prophecies' poetic cadence is asserted ("dance rather than speak") but sample text is sparse. Present across beats with moderate cost (misunderstanding), but could demonstrate the trait more concretely in on-page speech.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Unfold" governs the entire narrative: messages "unfold across multiple frequencies," she lets them "unfold as they would," instructions "unfold" in metaphor. The action is continuous and central—each transmission unfolds new material that escalates pressure. The final message unfolds "clear for once, unfragmented." The verb is signaled early, sustained through middle beats, and returns at closure with reweighted clarity. Essential to the accumulative structure; swapping for another verb would require substantial rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fragmented radio frequencies are introduced in paragraph one, deliver the first message in paragraph two, and Vera continues working "through fragmented radio frequencies" in paragraph six. The method shapes attempts: she records, broadcasts, refuses to edit. The final message arrives "clear for once, unfragmented," reversing the pattern with closure weight. The mechanics matter throughout—vacuum tubes, copper coils, multiple frequencies—and the fragmentation/clarity shift charges the ending. Strong causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds is anchored immediately and pressures every choice: isolation enables reception, altitude makes pilgrimage arduous, storm activity mirrors transmission intensity. The setting supplies resources (the radio array, cobalt portico) and constrains Vera's access to the valleys. The final beat—"watched the storm break into morning"—uses the setting to crystallize transformation. The observatory is inseparable from plot and closure; micro-setting (body at equipment) and macro (mountain isolation) both function causally.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Across the rise of a prophet" is enacted through narrative progression: first message Tuesday, messages "kept coming," "months passed," prophecies "proved increasingly accurate." The timeframe structures the arc from reception to realization. However, clock pressure is loose—no urgent deadline tightens tactics. The "three years" of prior solitude and the unfolding months shape context but do not create beat-level tension. Present and purposeful, but time does not constrain decisions as tightly as other elements.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Vera's motivation "to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated explicitly in paragraph four and dramatized through her refusal to choose between tradition and revolution. The friction between wants (connection, understanding) and costs (isolation, being claimed by no one) is on the page. Her final acceptance—"knowing her work was just beginning"—enacts the motivation with forward pressure. However, the phrasing feels prompt-like and some of the desire is told rather than shown in earlier micro-choices. Shapes closure with moderate embodiment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Gritty details (rust, burnt coffee, vacuum tubes) combine with whimsical phrasing ("whimsical as a drunk oracle," "gritty and strange and perfectly, whimsically true"). The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure—grounded technical work vs. mythic prophet framing. The labels "gritty" and "whimsical" are stated twice, which feels self-conscious. Tone charges the final image where practical action (switching off transmitter) meets lyric realization. Present across beats and functional at closure, though the explicit naming undercuts organic integration.</comment>
