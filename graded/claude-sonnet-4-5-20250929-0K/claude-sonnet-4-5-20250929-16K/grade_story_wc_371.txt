<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is strong and consistent—her observational stance drives the narrative, and her complicity realization ("Her own complicity tasted bitter") carries weight. The old woman's arrival feels somewhat convenient, though her dialogue serves to externalize Mira's internal conflict effectively. Minor issue: the protagonist's micro-choices could bear more visible cost; planting is portrayed as resistance but never shown to foreclose other paths or exact a tangible price beyond time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens cleanly, building density through layered images (moss, vines, bread, seeds) that converge at closure. The tea-house discovery and old woman's appearance constitute a meaningful tightening that reweights Mira's project from beautification to archaeology. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of seeds and memory recharges prior material with undeniable pressure. Cost is conceptual—Mira accepts the insufficiency ("not everything, perhaps not enough") and commits anyway—legible in "The ordinary against oblivion."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard is vividly rendered with purposeful detail (moss creep, vine accumulation, brambles, broken windows). The tea house functions as micro-setting that charges the encounter and final image. Sensory hierarchy fits Mira's botanical focus (caraway seeds, chrysanthemum tea, sage between stones). The east wing detail at the end—"stonework looked somehow younger each week"—adds a fresh constraint that will shape her next planting, satisfying the choice-shaping test for high-7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resistance to erasure through guerrilla gardening—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The bread's arrival constitutes a meaningful pressure point: it proves her gardens uncloak the vanished, raising the stakes from beautification to recovery. The old woman's framing of absolution versus sacredness deepens the moral calculus. Cost is visible in Mira's acceptance of partial success and her commitment to continue despite uncertainty, forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete acts: planting as witness, "small acts of creation against erasure," memory encoded in root systems. The bread/tea moment earns the insight without stating a moral. The closing image—"leaves across the courtyard, each one a small act of memory, falling and falling into earth that remembered everything"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to resist forgetting. The "sacred in the ordinary" motif constrains Mira's stance (she seeks divinity in persistence, not guilt-driven absolution) and charges the final choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filters detail through Mira's botanical lens. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices moss creep, seed dispersal, vine patterns. The old woman's dialogue carries subtext effectively ("Demyan seeks absolution. Tenuous, perhaps impossible"). One slip: "heuristically gentle hands—touching softly, learning through careful exploration" reads as authorial gloss rather than Mira's lived experience. Otherwise, diction remains controlled and voice-specific under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean with strong rhythm and controlled density. Opening line anchors voice and stakes efficiently. Information layering is purposeful: "creeping normality" defined through concrete examples before being named. Minor loop: "small act" appears twice in the final paragraph ("small act of memory," "small acts of creation"), slight synonym pressure. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats. Sentence variety supports momentum; figurative language ("morning mist," "earth that remembered") is coherent and restrained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Creeping normality" as erasure mechanism is a strong conceptual frame. Guerrilla gardening as counter-archaeology offers a fresh angle on memory/resistance themes. The bread from a vanished bakery is a vivid, specific detail that avoids generic abstraction. Risk: the tea-house encounter leans toward familiar wise-elder trope, though the old woman's complicity framing (Demyan "knew and said nothing") adds moral complexity. The piece synthesizes its elements into a coherent vision but stops short of a fully non-obvious inflection at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's noticing frames the opening and drives the discovery of the tea house. Her observation leads to the realization that gardens "uncloak" what's hidden, which reweights her project. However, her choices after the encounter—continuing to plant—echo prior behavior rather than altering tactics meaningfully. Present in setup, development (tea-house scene), and closure (tomorrow's planting), but the final decision feels confirmatory rather than transformative.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bread appears in two distinct beats: discovery in the tea house (Mira examines it, tastes caraway seeds) and wrap-up (she packs it with her seeds). Its warmth and blue-cloth wrapping anchor Demyan's impossible presence. The bread enables the old woman's exposition about absolution and validates that gardens bring things back. It charges the closure by linking sustenance to witness. Specific properties (Demyan's signature rye, caraway) matter; generic bread would not carry the same proof-of-return weight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution" is named explicitly by the old woman and shapes the moral calculus: Demyan offers bread to atone, Mira plants not for guilt but to find the sacred. The concept pressures Mira's self-examination ("Is that why I keep planting? For absolution too?") and the answer distinguishes her motivation. Present in setup (complicity reflection), middle dialogue, and implicit in closure (she continues planting as witness, not penance). However, it remains more thematic accent than tactical constraint; removing "absolution" would not break the closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" appears once as an adjectival phrase when Mira handles the bread, defined mid-sentence as "touching softly, learning through careful exploration." The trait fits her careful noticing but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost—she would handle mysterious bread gently regardless. No reprise or tactical pressure tied to this specific phrasing. Essentially ornamental; label-only mention without beat involvement beyond the single descriptive moment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Uncloak" is the old woman's key verb ("gardens will uncloak more—memories, people, moments") and reframes Mira's guerrilla gardening from beautification to revelation. The term drives the conceptual turn and charges the closure: planting becomes a method of making the erased visible. Signaled in setup via "disappearance," developed in the tea-house dialogue, and implicit in the final image of earth remembering. Removing "uncloak" would weaken the archaeology metaphor but the core action (planting to resist forgetting) could survive with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Guerrilla gardening is introduced early ("part of her guerrilla gardening campaign"), enables the tea-house discovery (brambles she planted guide her there), and is reframed by the old woman as archaeology. The method's mechanics—scattering seeds, coaxing life from neglect—shape Mira's tactics and are scheduled to continue ("Tomorrow she would plant the palace's east wing"). Present in setup, middle development (gardens bring things back), and closure (seed packets listed, future planting planned). The method is causally indispensable: without it, no tea house, no bread, no validation of memory-recovery.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tea house is introduced after the midpoint but its discovery is earned by Mira's prior planting (behind brambles she planted three autumns ago). The structure enables the encounter with the old woman and the bread revelation. Its "paper screens somehow intact" signals the uncanny, and its reappearance in Mira's final gaze ("Through the screen, she watched her gardens") charges the closure by framing persistence. The setting is specific (traditional, low table, ceramic cups) and its hidden/revealed status mirrors the story's erasure theme. Removing the tea house would collapse the central encounter.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the birds flew south" anchors the timeframe in the opening and establishes autumn (leaves scatter at closure). The season suits the elegiac tone and dying-world imagery. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Mira's planting is ongoing, and the encounter unfolds without clock pressure. The element is present and tonally consistent but functionally replaceable; any post-abandonment season would serve equally well. No middle development or tactical constraint tied to this specific temporal marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To find the sacred in the ordinary" is articulated by the old woman as Mira's motivation, distinguishing it from guilt-driven absolution. The desire is dramatized in Mira's sustained planting and her careful handling of the bread. The motivation shapes her final choice to continue despite uncertainty ("not everything, perhaps not enough, but something"). Present in setup (noticing moss, vines), named in dialogue, and implicit in closure (seeds as ordinary acts of memory). However, the friction between this desire and competing costs is thin—Mira never faces a choice that tests the sacred-seeking impulse against a meaningful sacrifice.</comment>
