<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is rendered through concrete imagery (ash, scars, the doorknocker) and her choices show contradictory impulses—she sends Sienna away yet hands her the ring. However, the final turn toward teaching feels unmotivated; no on-page pressure compels Maya to reverse her three-year isolation beyond recognizing a mirror. The burn scars function as embodied history, but the shift from "you can't stay" to collaborative destruction lacks a dramatized internal cost that would justify abandoning her sanctuary ethos.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The piece infers as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered imagery (ash, starlight, the ring, scars) toward a final image of collaborative destruction. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the phone on the ground and Maya's instruction crystallize a threshold moment—but the cost remains prospective rather than paid on the page. The reversal (Maya accepting a student) is signaled but not earned through prior friction; her three years of solitude dissolve without visible sacrifice or a dramatized internal tightening that would make the "careful encroachment of teaching" feel like a true foreclosure of her former stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ashen sanctuary under starlight is vividly rendered and serves as more than backdrop—the scorched ground, the freestanding gate, and the tactile doorknocker constrain and charge Maya's rituals. Spatial choreography is clear (threshold, ash/grass boundary, phone placed "between them"), and the setting's desolation mirrors Maya's carved-out isolation. The final image of collaborative fire integrates environment into action, pushing this toward the micro-setting threshold where place shapes choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Maya's sanctuary versus the "encroachment" of connection—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Sienna crosses the threshold, narrowing Maya's options from absolute refusal to provisional teaching. However, the escalation lacks a visible cost: Maya's shift from "you can't stay" to "teach me" is accomplished by recognition and empathy rather than a trade-off that forecloses her isolation with on-page consequence. The phone's placement is a promising beat, but the story closes before that choice exacts a price, leaving pressure prospective rather than paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—the cost of self-preservation through destruction—emerges through concrete imagery (burned letters, scars, ash) rather than assertion. The doorknocker and the phone function as charged objects that shift meaning across beats. Yet the final image leans toward platitude: "tender work of destruction" verges on aesthetic prettification of what the story frames as brutal severance. The piece resists a stated moral, but the collaborative turn soft-pedals the isolation ethic Maya ostensibly defends, undermining thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds throughout, with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature—Maya notices ash texture, cold brass, the tremor in Sienna's hands. Dialogue feels purposeful and advances the stakes without exposition dumps. However, minor filter-verb stacks ("She thought," "She saw," "She met") dull immediacy in a few high-pressure lines, and the final beat's diction ("careful encroachment of teaching, of connection, begin to fill the loaded emptiness") drifts toward abstraction that undercuts the physicality of the prior imagery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with strong rhythm control and vivid imagery ("watercolor bleeding into paper," "drowning on dry land"). A paraphrase loop appears mid-story: "I burned it all" followed immediately by a list restating the same act. The phrase "loaded emptiness" recurs three times without accumulating new meaning, verging on decorative repetition. Two scaffold phrases—"Neither did I, at first" and "Good," Maya said softly—read as template-cadence beats that could be cut without loss. No severe artifacts touch the closure image, so deductions remain modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—a burned sanctuary for those suffocating under connection—offers a fresh angle on isolation and self-care discourse. The doorknocker as the sole surviving object and the starlit ash field are specific, memorable details. However, the emotional arc (solitary keeper takes on a student) follows a familiar mentor-template without a non-obvious turn. The metaphor of "burning bridges carefully" is worked through on the page, but the collaborative ending sacrifices the story's harsher implications for a more comfortable resolution, reducing the risk and ingenuity of the initial concept.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya ("tender shadow keeper") makes the key choice to hand Sienna the ring and later to teach her, driving two beats. However, her role is more reactor than active agent—Sienna's arrival initiates the turn—and Maya's internal resistance dissolves off-page without a dramatized cost. Present in setup and closure, but her decisions feel more responsive than causally generative.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The doorknocker ring appears in three beats: Maya touches it (early), hands it to Sienna (middle turn), and re-hangs it (closure section). It carries symbolic weight as the sole unmelted metal and functions as a ritual object. However, its physical properties (weight, coldness) don't constrain a choice—Sienna's acceptance is verbal, not tactile—and the rehanging feels more ornamental than causal. Strong setup and reprise, but lacks irreplaceability in the middle escalation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Fading threshold" is named explicitly and staged spatially (ash meets grass, Sienna at the boundary). It shapes one key turn—Sienna crosses it—but the concept remains more atmospheric than causal. The boundary's indistinctness is described but doesn't alter Maya's options; she could refuse or accept anywhere. Present in setup, middle, and closure section, but the stakes would function identically with a simple "gate" or "edge."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Burns bridges carefully" is named, illustrated through backstory (letters, phone numbers), and embodied in the scars Maya reveals. It shapes the teaching beat—Maya instructs Sienna in intentional destruction—but the attribute itself doesn't constrain the final choice. The specificity (surgical precision, no bleeding) adds texture, yet the story could function with "severs ties" without structural loss. Setup and closure participation are solid; middle causal pressure is weaker.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Encroach" appears twice: Maya fears entanglements that encroach, then accepts "the careful encroachment of teaching." The word signals the threat to her sanctuary and returns with reweighted meaning at closure. However, the action itself—connection creeping in—happens passively; Maya doesn't actively encroach, and Sienna's arrival is the engine. The reversal (encroachment as threat → encroachment as acceptance) is legible but not causally indispensable; the story could stage the same turn with "intrude" or "enter."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Linking through scars" is named once in dialogue ("this linkage, this connection through scars not yet visible") but never shown as a method. Maya reveals her burn scars to Sienna, but no mechanics of bonding-through-wounding occur on the page. The concept is asserted at closure without prior demonstration or middle-beat use. Late signal, no causal work, highly swappable with any mentor-student bond language.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight" is established early, rendered with sensory specificity (silver-looking ash, cold brass, scorched ground), and returns in the final image as the site of collaborative burning. The setting constrains choice—Maya's three-year isolation is spatially defined—and the starlight charges both the opening and closing beats. The freestanding gate and the ash/grass boundary provide micro-topography that stages the threshold crossing. Strong setup, middle use, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After cutting off all contact" is stated in the opening and frames Maya's three-year isolation, providing motive for her resistance. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions in real-time; the story unfolds in one continuous present scene without a clock that alters tactics. The "after" is backstory context rather than a live constraint. Setup only, no middle or closure pressure tied to duration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To teach suffocating to breathe" is articulated in Maya's dialogue and drives the final collaborative beat. Maya's motive shifts from protecting solitude to instructing Sienna, but the shift occurs via recognition rather than friction—no on-page conflict between her desire to isolate and her empathy. The motivation is present in setup (implicitly) and closure (explicitly), but the middle turn lacks dramatized cost that would make teaching a hard-won choice rather than an automatic empathic response.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Loaded emptiness" is named three times and defines the sanctuary's atmosphere. The tone is coherent—quiet, elegiac, charged with absence—and modulates slightly as Sienna's arrival introduces tension. The phrase recurs in the closure line, reweighting emptiness from solitary to shared. However, the recurrence feels more decorative than earned; the emotional charge in the final image comes from the collaborative act, not the tonal shift. Solid setup and closure participation, modest middle use.</comment>
