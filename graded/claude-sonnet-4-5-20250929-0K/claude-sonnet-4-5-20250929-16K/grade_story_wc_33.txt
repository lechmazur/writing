<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivations are clear and rooted in his role as border-crossing mailman, with embodied micro-choices ("paused beneath an archway") reflecting professional caution. The exchange with Mira demonstrates relationship under pressure with status clarity. Internal contradiction appears lightly when Kael nervously carries the storm yet moves "respectfully rebellious," though this could deepen. The final gesture of continuing with seventeen more deliveries earns a credible Earned Stasis with visible cost (ongoing risk, exhaustion), but the emotional arc remains steady rather than internally conflicted throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph (Kael, cobalt arcade, twilight). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the density of border-crossing details (drones, defunct fountain, uniform friction) builds to the final image of "seventeen more deliveries before dawn" that reweights the opening stake with undeniable cost. Closure is Earned Stasis—Kael continues his work knowing the price—and the cost is legible on the page in "the brittle hush settled around him like a blessing." One micro turn when Mira receives the bottle; the final paragraph recharges prior images (drones vanished, shops shuttered) to deepen the portrait of sustained defiance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade is vividly realized with blue-tinted glass, defunct fountain at the territorial line, and metal shutters closing in practiced silence. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kael's professional filter: he notices drones, sight lines, and the invisible border markers. The bottle's "tiny lightning" is a tactile, recurring object that charges the exchange beat. However, the arcade itself does not constrain a choice—Kael moves through it without spatial obstacles shaping his decisions—so the 9+ gate is not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—delivering the thunderstorm bottle across the border—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira explains the wedding context, raising emotional cost. Kael's agency is endurance and continuation (Earned Stasis), not a decision that narrows options within this scene. The drones provide atmospheric pressure but do not force a tactical pivot. Escalation is mild; the piece deepens understanding rather than intensifying external conflict, fitting the Accumulative lens but limiting the score here.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Kael's method: "by linking absences" and "evidence that people don't forget, even when borders insist they should." The thunderstorm bottle is a concrete particular that embodies the father's promise without stating a moral. Mira's question "where broken promises heal" and Kael's answer—"in the careful hands of those who refused to let absence mean abandonment"—is abstract but earned by prior action. The final image of Kael walking on, "respectfully rebellious, carrying what the borders couldn't stop," offers a resonant non-literal answer to the central question. Minor deduction for the phrase "he kept his promises by linking absences," which edges toward overt theme statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Kael's professional lens: "nobody spoke loudly here, where words could be weaponized." Dialogue between Kael and Mira is economical, carries subtext, and advances plot without exposition. Narrative distance is consistent; perceptual signature is evident in the mailman's focus on routes, packages, and the invisible line. Slight vocabulary elevation in "brittle hush of the border zone" and "fractured geography of separation" reads borderline formal for the moment but remains within an educated narrator's register. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates appropriately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean with varied syntax and strong verbs ("skimming," "cradling," "reweights"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor scaffold appears in the third paragraph's passive construction "the brittle hush...settled" immediately after "owners pulling down metal shutters with practiced silence"—two mood-setting gestures in sequence without advancing action. The phrase "fractured geography of separation" in the penultimate exchange is slightly elevated. Final line "carrying what the borders couldn't stop" provides propulsion and image. No major loops or template cadence; figurative language (cobalt, oceanic shadow, indigo) is controlled and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The mailman archetype is transformed through the border-smuggling context and the specific cargo (weather in a bottle). The "thunderstorm from the night his daughter was born" is a memorable, non-obvious particular. The method "by linking absences" synthesizes the mail-carrier role with the emotional stakes in a way that feels organic rather than mechanical. However, the forbidden-border-crossing setup and the neutral go-between protagonist are familiar tropes executed well but not radically reimagined. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids safety hedging, earning the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael (disputed territory mailman) drives the story, frames the opening, and makes the key decision to continue ("seventeen more deliveries before dawn"). His professional caution (pausing for drones) and the handoff to Mira are on-page choices. He appears in all three gates (setup, middle exchange, ending). However, his role is steady facilitation rather than a turn that narrows options; the closure is continuation, not transformation. Strong causal presence but limited high-stakes pivot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The thunderstorm in a bottle is introduced early with vivid detail ("tiny lightning flickered against the glass"), handled in the exchange with Mira, and its backstory (storm from the daughter's birth night) reweights the stakes emotionally. It shapes the middle beat (Mira's tears, wedding context) and is referenced in the final paragraph ("a girl would open a bottle and hear her father's promise thunder alive again"). Present in all three gates with clear causal and thematic pressure. Does not itself constrain Kael's tactics, preventing the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The smuggling drones appear in one beat (Kael pauses to let them pass) and serve as atmospheric parallel ("they all served the gaps between official reality and human need"). They do not shape Kael's choices, alter tactics, or return at closure. The border itself is central, but the drones as core concept remain ornamental. Present in setup, absent from development and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Respectfully rebellious" is named in the final line and demonstrated throughout: Kael follows "enough rules to avoid arrest while breaking the ones that separated families." His careful pause for the drones and his continuation despite risk embody the trait. However, it does not constrain a specific choice with visible cost in a single beat; it describes his ongoing method. Present across beats but functions more as summary than pivot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Foster" appears twice with specificity: Mira fosters refugee children (illegal), Kael fosters "connections, correspondence, the fragile threads." The action shapes Mira's stakes (harboring undocumented minors) and Kael's identity. It is signaled early, informs the middle exchange, and the final image of continued deliveries reinforces the fostering method. Drives two beats and contributes to closure. Not indispensable—other verbs could work—but deeply integrated.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"By linking absences" is explicitly named and explained: Kael maps empty spaces (father missing from wedding) and fills them with deliverable objects. The method is introduced in the exchange with Mira, shapes the thunderstorm bottle's meaning, and the final image ("carrying what the borders couldn't stop") enacts it. Mechanics matter: the what (letters, objects) and the how (crossing the border) drive plot and theme. Present in all three gates with clear causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade is vividly rendered (blue-tinted glass, defunct fountain at the territorial line, closing shops) and frames the entire scene. It signals the border geography early and provides the meeting point. However, it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; Kael and Mira could meet elsewhere with minor edits. Atmosphere is strong, but spatial constraint on tactics is absent. Present in setup and throughout, weak in causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Today's lone mail drop" appears in the second paragraph, but no time pressure tightens decisions. The piece moves from twilight to "deepening twilight" to "before dawn," establishing duration but not urgency. Kael has "seventeen more deliveries before dawn," implying a clock, but it does not alter his tactics in this scene. Present in setup, absent from middle pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where broken promises heal" is dramatized through Mira's question and Kael's answer, tied concretely to the thunderstorm bottle and the father's absence. The motivation drives the exchange and the final realization ("in the careful hands of those who refused to let absence mean abandonment"). However, it is more thematic reflection than an on-page friction between wants and costs within Kael's choices. Present in all three gates with clear conceptual weight but limited internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Brittle hush" is named twice and embodied throughout: practiced silence, whisper-engines, Mira's voice "barely above a whisper," and the final line "the brittle hush settled around him like a blessing." Tone is coherent, modulates with the emotional beats (nervousness with the storm, tenderness in the exchange, resolve at the end), and charges the closure image by reframing the hush as protective rather than oppressive. Present in setup, middle, and ending with clear tonal arc.</comment>
