<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation ("discover what walls dream about") is poetic but remains abstract until the diaries force a shift in understanding. Her interior access is strong—equipment clicks, breath catches, perceptual awareness cultivated over years—but the final choice to archive and honor the research feels more like acceptance than a pivot with visible cost. The flashback to Eleanor's writing and the grandfather's theories provides depth without hijacking present action, anchoring in the diaries she holds. No embodied contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the closure beat; the decision to gather and document is rational and aligned rather than conflicted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Pressure accumulates through ivy recoil → equipment anomaly → film negatives → acoustic pattern → building consciousness confirmed, then deepens when Mara understands Eleanor's burden. The closure—honoring dreams before walls forget—reconfigures the cartographer role with felt cost (the burden of knowing what no one believes). Orientation is clean by ~60 words (ivy passage, equipment, abandoned manor). One meaningful tightening occurs when the acoustic visualization reveals intentional modulation, altering Mara's stance from mapper to advocate. Cost is conceptual and emotional but legible in the final paragraph's shift from documentation to honoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage constrains movement and signals building sentience early, the fireplace delivers the diaries, and the corridor's acoustic anomaly becomes a tactile presence. Sensory hierarchy tilts toward sound (equipment whine, echo patterns) with touch (ivy whispers, recoils) and sight (film negatives, dim light through ivy). The climate-shift premise remains scenic rather than pressuring a choice; "after the shifts" frames backstory but doesn't tighten present options. Spatial choreography is coherent (passage → fireplace → exit), and the ivy parting as she leaves charges the final image with reciprocal awareness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: confirm architectural consciousness and complete the mapping before the building collapses. The acoustic anomaly narrows interpretation, forcing Mara from data-collector to believer. The discovery of Eleanor's burden deepens the stakes by revealing the social cost of knowing. Agency is present: Mara chooses to gather diaries and finish the work, but the stakes don't narrow options—her mission remains unchanged, only enriched. The closure forecloses the path of ignorance with felt cost (carrying Eleanor's burden forward), though the decision itself is acceptance rather than a trade-off under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—memory embedded in space, the burden of solitary truth—emerges through Eleanor's diary fragments, the grandfather's research, and Mara's realization that cartographers honor dreams. The film negatives concretize "architectural consciousness" without stating a thesis. Subtext operates in the ivy's rustling urgency and the corridor's sigh, implying reciprocal perception. The final image ("corridor sighed") answers the central question (what do walls dream?) through sensory implication and Mara's shift from documenting to honoring. No overt moralizing; the cost of belief versus disbelief is dramatized in Eleanor's legacy and Mara's new burden.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly; Mara's perceptual signature (listening to buildings, trusting environmental cues, "sensitively perceptive awareness") is consistent and voice-specific. Diction remains within an acoustician's lexicon ("sonic signatures," "acoustic anomaly," "echo pattern") without jargon dumps. No dialogue present. The prose modulates under pressure: short bursts during the equipment whine ("Her breath caught"), longer reflective sentences when processing Eleanor's writing. Focalization stays tight to Mara's knowledge; the ivy and corridor's intentions are filtered through her cultivated awareness, not asserted as omniscient fact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or layer meaning (ivy recoils, equipment detects, negatives reveal, understanding shifts). Minimal scaffolding; one paraphrase near "He believed buildings remember. That they store our lives..." recaps the diary content but adds frantic tone. Sentence openings vary; rhythm accelerates during the anomaly beat and slows for reflection. One stock phrase: "her breath caught" is functional but generic. The final beat ("corridor sighed") is clean and charged. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs. A few elevated abstractions ("emotional archaeology," "legacy's burden") fit the intellectual register but edge toward thematic labeling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "corridor echo cartographer" profession and "architectural consciousness" premise are specific and fresh, transforming haunted-house material through acoustic mapping and climate-driven flora encroachment. The film negatives capturing building movement in long exposures add tangible evidence. Eleanor's burden—knowing the truth no one believes—echoes familiar isolation but is grounded in inherited debt and a crumbling estate. The ending avoids moralizing and offers a resonant image (ivy parts, corridor sighs). Risk is moderate: the speculative element is committed but the emotional arc (discovery → acceptance) follows a well-worn path without a sharp inflection that redefines prior stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's profession frames the entire mission and motivates her presence, equipment use, and interpretive lens. She makes one key choice at closure: to gather the diaries and finish the mapping, which shifts her role from documenter to advocate. The cartographer identity enables the acoustic discovery (equipment, visualization software) and constrains her to complete the assignment. Early signal strong; causal pressure moderate (profession enables, doesn't narrow); closure linkage present but the decision aligns with her existing goal rather than forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The film negatives appear mid-story, tucked in the diaries. Mara handles them once (holds to light, interprets moving patterns), and they reappear conceptually in her final understanding ("those moving patterns weren't errors—they were the building itself, captured in a moment of dreaming"). Two beats: discovery and reinterpretation. The negatives provide evidence that shifts Mara's interpretation from theory to proof, but they don't constrain a choice or alter tactics. Specificity is high (long exposures, light-and-shadow patterns), but the object's function is evidentiary rather than operationally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Legacy's burden" is named explicitly in Eleanor's diary and restated in Mara's realization ("It wasn't the debt... it was knowing the truth and being unable to make anyone else believe it"). The concept drives Mara's final choice to archive and honor the research, accepting Eleanor's burden as her own. Early signal via diary, middle development through Mara's processing, closure participation when she shoulders the burden. Causal pressure: the concept reframes Mara's mission from neutral documentation to advocacy with social cost. Irreplaceability high; the story hinges on inherited, isolating knowledge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" appears early as a cultivated skill ("she'd learned to trust these subtle environmental cues") and enables the closure beat when Mara perceives the building's response "not with her eyes, but with that sensitively perceptive awareness." The trait constrains method (listening, trusting cues) and enables the acoustic anomaly discovery. No visible trade-off or cost tied to the trait itself; hyper-perception grants access without a downside. Early signal, middle use (ivy recoil noted), closure enabler. Swappability moderate; "acute sensitivity" would substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Glimpsed it then" is the pivot where Mara perceives the walls modulating sound intentionally, confirming architectural consciousness. This beat redefines her mission from mapping echoes to honoring living structures and triggers the final understanding. The glimpse is not visual but perceptual, fitting the acoustic focus. Positioned late-middle, it drives the closure realization and Mara's acceptance of Eleanor's burden. Irreplaceability high; without this perceptual turn, the story remains data-collection without transformation. Causal linkage strong; the glimpse changes interpretation and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The diaries are discovered mid-passage (fireplace, half-burned), handled on the page (Mara kneels, extracts pages), read for Eleanor's frantic account, and yield the film negatives. They provide the research thread (grandfather's theories, Eleanor's burden) that reframes Mara's work at closure. Three beats: discovery, reading/interpretation, final decision to add them to archives. Causal pressure: the diaries supply the conceptual framework (buildings remember) and emotional weight (burden of belief) that Mara accepts. Specificity high (charred, spilling, half-burned); mechanics matter (someone tried to destroy them but couldn't finish). Closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage frames the opening, signals building sentience (recoils, whispers, rustles urgently, parts at exit), and supplies tactile feedback. Early signal strong; development moderate (ivy behavior noted but doesn't alter Mara's path); closure participation present (ivy parts, adding reciprocal acknowledgment). The passage constrains movement (Mara presses through, moves deeper) but doesn't force a tactical choice. Swappability low for the ivy's behavior; high for the corridor as mere location. The setting charges the final image but doesn't pressure a mid-story decision.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the climate shifts" anchors the premise (flora driven into buildings) and explains the ivy's density but doesn't tighten decisions or create a live clock. Mentioned once in the opening; no follow-up pressure. The timeframe is backstory scenery rather than a tactical constraint. No escalation tied to climate; Mara's urgency ("before they collapsed entirely") is general rather than driven by this shift. Swappable with any post-disaster setting. Functional for world-building but ornamental for stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's desire to "discover what walls dream about" is stated early, puzzles colleagues, and drives her interpretive stance throughout. The motivation is tested when the acoustic anomaly confirms the theory, and it's fulfilled/deepened at closure when she understands Eleanor's burden and commits to honoring the dreams. Internal friction is mild: colleagues dismiss the work, but Mara's conviction is unwavering rather than conflicted. Cost is social isolation and the burden of solitary knowledge. Causal linkage strong; specificity high ("walls dream" is unique phrasing); closure participation direct.</comment>
