<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her "reckless idealist" trait shows in her willingness to try reversing the trade despite knowing the cost. Internal contradiction appears when she recognizes her naivety but immediately calculates whether another impossible feat is possible. The interiority occasionally slips into label-speak ("dusky resolve," "controlled anguish") and Kael's sudden appearance with full knowledge feels under-motivated—we don't see how he learned the mechanics or tracked her down. The final choice to "try" and "be gentle with the impossible" lacks embodied cost in the moment; it reads as thematic summary rather than a dramatized forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean: who (Mira), where (catacomb orchard), and when (tonight) anchor by the opening paragraph. The piece operates under a Causal lens with Kael's revelation narrowing Mira's options, but the closure unit is weak—"ready to unmake what never should have been made" is poise without visible cost or a decisive change on the page. The cost of reversing the trade remains hypothetical; we don't see what Mira forfeits or what mechanics she will attempt. The backstory about Senna exceeds 30% of the text and much of it (the bridge collapse, Senna's wealth vs. Kael's poverty) does not anchor to present stimuli or alter a present micro-choice; it flattens present pressure into exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid and specific: gnarled trees with roots threading through skulls, phosphorescent fruit, carved symbols. Mira's lantern and the burned tarot card are handled objects that recur and the setting's macabre details (bones, half-lit corridors) support the tone. The setting constrains the final moment—Mira and Kael step "into the web of meanings she'd inlaid everywhere"—charging the closure image with the orchard's symbolic architecture. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Mira will attempt to reverse Kael's trade—is signaled when he asks her to "trade it back." The revelation that Senna was Kael's destined wife tightens the ethical calculus, but the turn lacks on-page cost; Mira's decision to "try" is stated intention rather than a forfeiture or renunciation that forecloses a path. Kael's agency is mostly declarative (he arrived with cards, he asks for the reversal) rather than a choice under pressure. The escalation depends on backstory revelation more than present dramatized pressure, and the cost of attempting the reversal remains off-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—the limits of reckless idealism and the permanence of bartered consequences—emerges from Mira's history and Kael's confrontation. The burned Tower and Lovers cards function as non-literal markers of disrupted fate. The final image of stepping "into the web of meanings" offers a resonant answer: Mira will remain gentle with the impossible even when it means unmaking her own work. However, "holes in the soul" is repeated three times and borders on thematic echo, and the phrase "reckless idealist" is stated twice, nudging the implicit into the explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV through Mira is stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a elevated, slightly archaic register ("trammeled," "dusky resolve") that fits the gothic-fantasy milieu. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: Kael's lines ("You saved *a* life") carry subtext and challenge Mira's self-perception. Filter verbs ("she recognized," "she'd learned") appear but are voice-consistent. Perceptual signature is present—Mira notices symbols she carved, the phosphorescence of fruit—though under peak stress the diction remains ornate rather than compressing into urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with strong imagery (roots threading through ribcages, fruit glowing phosphorescent). Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports pacing. However, multiple lines carry overwriting: "dusky resolve," "fiercely gentle," "the great web of exchanged futures" pile figurative language without clear necessity. Paraphrase loops appear: "she would try. She would always try" and "wondering if...wondering if" in adjacent lines. The phrase "half-lit corridors" is used in both the opening and near the end without reweighting. Template cadence in the closing paragraph ("even knowing...even knowing") and the ornate register in high-pressure moments (Kael's revelation) slow momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard where life feeds on death is a fresh synthesis of necromancy and cultivation. The premise of bartered destinies is familiar in fantasy but gains specificity through the carved symbols and the Senna/Kael entanglement. The ethical calculus—trading suffering for joy by swapping fates—offers a non-obvious moral question. However, the resolution arc (idealist confronted by unintended consequences, chooses to undo her work) follows a recognizable template, and the final image of stepping into the web does not transform the premise in a way that surprises in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira's reckless idealism is named in the opening and drives the inciting trade (giving Kael a borrowed lifespan). Her decision to "try" the reversal at the end enacts the trait again. The trait constrains her twice: she cannot refuse Kael's plea, and she cannot accept inaction. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The burned Tower card arrives in a box and signals Kael's message; the burned Lovers card appears when Kael reveals Senna's role. Two distinct beats, but the cards function as symbolic messengers rather than objects Mira handles or uses to alter tactics. They reweight meaning (Tower = collapse of Mira's confidence, Lovers = the romantic bond she severed) but do not constrain a choice or enable an action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Bartered destinies is the story's engine: Mira traded Kael's early death for Senna's lifespan, Kael asks her to reverse it, and the finale is Mira stepping into the mechanism to attempt the unbarter. The concept shapes stakes (can she undo it?) and tactics (she measures "the roots and symbols around them, wondering if it was possible"). Present in setup, development, and closure with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Fiercely gentle" is declared in the backstory ("She'd been fiercely gentle with him then, holding his shaking hands") and echoed at the end ("learn to be gentle with the impossible"). Label-only in both instances; no on-page action demonstrates the trait under pressure. The trait does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Trammel" appears once in narration: "destiny...wasn't meant to be trammeled so completely." The word underscores the thematic problem (Mira interfered too deeply) but does not function as an action Mira performs on the page. The story would hold if the sentence read "manipulated" or "altered"; the specific verb does not redefine options or constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Inlaying meaning everywhere" is introduced early (Mira carved symbols on bark, root, stone "so that every trunk...told part of the great web") and returns at closure when she and Kael "stepped into the web of meanings she'd inlaid everywhere." The method shapes the world's mechanics (symbols are the interface for trades) and charges the final image. Two-beat presence with closure linkage, though the mechanics remain abstract—we don't see her carve or activate a symbol in real time.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is introduced immediately and remains the sole location. Roots threading through bones, phosphorescent fruit, and carved symbols create a vivid micro-setting. The orchard's architecture matters: Mira moves "through the half-lit corridors between trees" and measures "the roots and symbols around them" to assess whether reversal is possible. The setting supplies the mechanism (symbols, roots) that will enable the final attempt. Present in setup, middle navigation, and closure with causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Within the glow of half-lit corridors" signals low-light ambience and the orchard's enclosed space but does not function as a ticking clock. Time is marked only as "tonight" and "three days ago"; no urgency or deadline tightens Mira's decision. The element contributes tone but does not alter tactics or pressure choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To patch holes in the soul" is Mira's stated motivation and recurs twice: in her self-description (opening) and her reflection before the final choice ("wondering if this was where she finally learned that some holes in the soul couldn't be patched"). The desire drives her history (trading destinies) and her willingness to attempt the reversal. Friction appears when she realizes patching may have torn more than it mended. Setup, middle friction, and closure presence with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Dusky resolve" is declared once to describe Kael's eyes and implicitly governs the closing tone: Mira's somber determination ("She would try") and the image of stepping into the web together. The tone is coherent through exposition and dialogue, though it remains static—grief and resolve do not modulate sharply under pressure. The final image carries the tone's weight but does not recharge or break it.</comment>
