<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mirena's interiority is concrete and particular—her clipboard ritual, her brother's death in Kordas's battles, her resolve to "show up again and again with gentle hands." The contradiction between her moral weight and her persistence drives credible choices. Threll and Kordas remain functional but thinner, serving as foils rather than fully embodied agents. The final turn ("a promise rooted in practice") is earned but rests primarily on Mirena's arc, limiting the felt cost of the ensemble moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph; the lens is Causal with symbolic overtones. The closure—planting seeds together and the promise to return—qualifies as Charged Poise: options crystallize (continued war vs. fragile collaboration) with undeniable pressure even though the social cost is deferred. The ritual mechanic is taught early and paid off at midnight, creating a clean tightening. One micro reversal (Threll's shift from brittle refusal to kneeling) narrows options and the final image reweights the clipboard from memorial to "fragile beginning."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ancient terrace, twin moons, and urns of soil are vivid and purposeful, grounding the ritual spatially. The celestial alignment functions as both atmosphere and tactical clock, tightening the window for action. Spatial choreography is clean (arrival sequence, kneeling at the altar). The valleywood trees and combined soils charge the closure image, making the setting essential rather than decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—ending the forever war through ritual commitment—is signaled early and tightens toward midnight. The reversal (Threll's arrival → grief-driven resistance → her kneeling and sharing her daughter's love of gardening) narrows options and forecloses pure refusal. The agency is shared across three characters; Mirena's role is facilitative, which diffuses some pressure but remains coherent. The planting and promise to return impose a visible cost (continued proximity to enemies, ongoing vulnerability) that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme—"the price of redemption is showing up again and again"—emerges organically from the clipboard ritual, the mixed soils, and the promise to tend seeds together. The piece resists tidy resolution: "It wasn't a treaty. It was something more dangerous." The final image (adding the date as "a fragile beginning") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor abstraction appears in "anchor our ideals in practice," but it's dramatized through the planting action immediately after.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mirena; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and elevated without slipping into register mismatch—"operatively gentle," "flawed beauty," "patient stars" feel voice-motivated. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext: Threll's "You ask too much" and Kordas's "Symbolic gardening won't stop the killing" advance conflict and reveal stance. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mirena notices names, rituals, and the weight of objects (the clipboard, the urns). Minor filter-verb density ("She had waited," "She had carved," "She had known") slightly dulls immediacy but remains within voice tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the opening long sentence contrasts with short declarations later ("No," Mirena agreed.). Information density is high: most lines advance setting, character, or stakes. Minor scaffold appears in the reflection block ("The price of redemption, she had learned, was remembering every failure" / "The price of redemption, Mirena thought...") which loops a phrase across paragraphs. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language ("brittle as old parchment," "flawed beauty") is sparing and apt. The clipboard's physical weight and texture are concretely rendered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—ritual gardening as peace-building—is familiar but executed with specific detail: the seventeen-year midsummer alignment, the clipboard carved with names, valleywood seeds. The turn (Ambassador and General planting together under celestial witness) feels earned in hindsight rather than contrived. The "flawed beauty" framing and the distinction between treaty and practice offer a non-obvious angle. Risk is modest: the piece commits to its symbolic register without undercutting it, but the core arc (enemies forced to cooperate in ritual) echoes widely used templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mirena, the peace negotiator, is present throughout and drives key turns: she greets Kordas with "operatively gentle" touch, reframes stakes with the clipboard reveal, and orchestrates the midnight planting. Her choices narrow options (insisting on the ritual despite resistance) and her final thought charges the closure image. The role is indispensable: without her facilitation, no planting occurs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ebony clipboard appears in beat one (against her hip), beat two (lifted to reveal sketches), and the final beat (adding the date). Its carved names embody the "price of redemption" and its transformation from memorial to record of "fragile beginning" reweights prior material. Removing it would eliminate the story's emotional through-line and the closure's symbolic anchor.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"The price of redemption" is explicitly named twice and shapes Mirena's arc: her clipboard ritual, her acknowledgment of failure, and the final image ("showing up again and again with gentle hands and an honest reckoning"). It constrains her stance (she cannot ignore past deaths) and charges the closure. The concept is more thematically resonant than tactically determinative, trending toward 7–8 range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Operatively gentle" appears once in action: Mirena's shoulder touch to Kordas "acknowledged his pain without pretending it didn't exist." The trait is visible in her dialogue and the ritual framing, but the exact phrase does not recur or constrain a second beat. It colors her approach but could be swapped for similar phrasing ("carefully tender") without structural breakage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Muster" appears twice: Mirena's line "I ask you to muster what remains of your humanity" and the internal reflection linking it to her own daily effort. The word frames the central demand (summoning endurance and grace under grief) and drives Threll's choice to approach the urns. Swapping for "gather" or "summon" would weaken the ritualistic register but not break causality; thus mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ritual significance is seeded early ("warriors met on this terrace during the celestial dance to pledge truces"), its erosion acknowledged, and its mechanics enacted at midnight: mixing soils, pressing seeds, speaking old words. The method shapes the entire structure—arrival, resistance, kneeling, planting—and the promise to return ("We return tomorrow. To tend what we've planted") extends ritual into practice. Removing ritual would collapse the story's logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ancient terrace is anchored in the opening line, provides spatial choreography (the altar, the urns), and its history (meeting place → memorial → renewed meeting place) drives thematic weight. The setting enables the midnight ritual and its legacy pressures the characters' choices. The terrace's transformation charges the final image: "a fragile beginning" occurs *here*, nowhere else.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The celestial dance (twin moons aligning at midnight) is established in paragraph one, creates a visible clock ("The moons will align fully at midnight"), and tightens the window for decision. The alignment occurs on-page ("As midnight arrived and the moons aligned perfectly"), and their separation afterward marks the ritual's completion. The timeframe shapes pacing and charges the moment with cosmic witness.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"To anchor ideals in practice" is Mirena's stated motivation and drives her concrete choices: bringing soil and seeds, orchestrating the planting, insisting on shared tending. The desire is tested against Kordas's skepticism and Threll's grief, creating friction. The final promise ("We return tomorrow. To tend what we've planted") dramatizes the motivation's enactment. Removing this motivation would empty the story of its moral engine.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Flawed beauty" is named once in Mirena's reflection on the moment: "how it required standing with enemies, acknowledging that redemption came not from erasing the past but from choosing differently despite it." The tone—scarred hope, fragile collaboration under grief—pervades the piece through diction ("brittle," "terrible," "patient stars") and modulates with pressure (Threll's whisper, the planting, the departure). It charges the final image ("fragile beginning") without overstating.</comment>
