<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied through her handling of the wood and the kettle ritual. The grief work is shown through micro-choices—picking up the blank, making the first cut—rather than summarized. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between haunting and practicality, though the final stance feels slightly too settled for peak tension. The carving practice earns the shift from raw grief to "rust-hued peace" through accumulated particulars.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation is swift (workshop, skylight, October rain by line two). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: density builds through the carving ritual, Viktor's particulars, and the final image's reconfiguration of "here and gone and here again." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Mira's continued carving practice forecloses raw paralysis with visible cost (the cooling tea, the patient rain, the gallery of gestures). One meaningful deepening occurs when she commits the first cut and the form emerges, reweighting her relationship to loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight, workbench, ash wood grain, and kettle all constrain micro-choices and charge the final image. The skylight frames the "here and gone" of raindrops, priming the theme. The blank's grain and the knife's weight anchor sensory perception in craft detail that reflects Mira's professional lens. The cooling tea in the final beat supplies a temporal marker and embodied neglect that deepens the closure's cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: contain what cannot be contained, honor Viktor through carving. The first cut (commitment to subtract) is the key tightening—it narrows options from blank contemplation to active form-making. The cost is visible: time passing (tea cooling, light darkening), solitary repetition ("Tomorrow she would begin another"), and the acceptance that carved gestures replace presence. One point of escalation is sufficient at this length, and the agency is renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—impermanence, the alchemy of grief into craft—emerges organically from the carving ritual and circus metaphors without thesis statement. The final image ("here and gone and here again, held in ash and memory") reweights the opening's "here and gone in the space of a breath" without moralizing. The "crystallized time" method and Viktor's lion-taming philosophy (working with the nature of the thing) interweave to answer the thematic question: how does one hold loss without being crushed?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-close with Mira's perceptual signature throughout: she notices grain, weight, Viktor's gestures with craft-focused specificity. Diction remains consistent—"humble alchemy," "rust-hued peace"—voice-motivated and free of head-hopping. The phrase "rust-hued peace" in the final paragraph flirts with over-articulation but remains within her reflective lexicon. Psychic distance tightens during the carving and eases during tea-making, modulating purposefully with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, information density is high (most lines do two jobs), and sentence openings diversify. Minor overwriting in the final third: "humble alchemy of blade and wood and crystallized time" stacks abstractions, and "rust-hued peace of acceptance" edges toward label-speak in a high-stakes closure beat. The paraphrase loop "Viktor had been here. He was gone. But...he remained" recaps without added pressure. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, preventing entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The widow-as-sculptor premise transforms familiar grief narrative through the "crystallized time" method and circus particulars (lion taming as conversation with nature). The carving-not-likeness angle is fresh, and Viktor's backstage heart-stop on "an ordinary Tuesday" avoids melodrama. However, the piece does not fully escape the contemplative-artist-processing-loss template; the emotional arc and final stance feel anticipated rather than surprising. One strong inflection—carving moments rather than faces—but the ending's peace arrives on schedule.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's identity as Viktor's widow and her craft practice (twenty-three circus years, learning impermanence, now carving) frame every choice. Her decision to pick up the blank and commit the first cut are key turns. The widow status is not ornamental—it drives the stakes (how to contain the irreplaceable) and her method (carving gestures, not likeness). Present early, shapes multiple beats, and the final image depends on her ongoing practice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ash wood blank is handled in at least four distinct beats: initial assessment (feeling weight, promise of form), grain study, the first cut (commitment to subtract), and the emergence of the laughing figure. Its material properties—"honest timber, neither too soft nor too hard"—constrain her technique and echo Viktor's philosophy. The blank's transformation tracks causally and its final state ("suggestion of movement visible in the wood") charges the closure. Indispensable to the plot and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Here and gone" is established in the opening raindrops, explicitly tied to circus impermanence and Viktor's death, then drives the carving method (capturing transient moments). It shapes Mira's tactics: she cannot freeze Viktor in static photos, so she carves gestures. The concept returns transformed in the final line—"here and gone and here again, held in ash"—reweighting the opening image with earned cost. The stakes and closure image would collapse without this exact concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Hauntingly practical" appears once as a label when the grief counselor calls her approach "unusual." Mira demonstrates the trait through action (making tea with deliberate care, working methodically through grief), but the phrase itself does no causal work. The duality is embodied rather than leveraged as a constraint that alters a key choice. Functional characterization but the label is somewhat ornamental; the trait would operate without the explicit phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Contain" is the story's engine: Mira "couldn't contain Viktor in photographs alone," so she carves. The verb recurs charged—"this quiet space where she contained what couldn't be contained"—and the paradox drives her method and stakes. The final image resolves the impossibility by showing containment as ongoing practice rather than static capture. Removing "contain" would require wholesale reframing; it defines the problem and the closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Crystallized time" is named early as Mira's accidental discovery and her method for selecting moments (Viktor's hand to chest pocket, chin angle in rain). It constrains what she carves—not likeness but "particular instances that grief had preserved in perfect, painful detail." The phrase recurs in the final paragraph, charging the closure. However, the mechanics remain abstract; we do not see her *choose* which moment to freeze in this session beyond "his laugh." Present across beats but could be more tactile.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight anchors the setting from the opening and supplies the "here and gone" raindrop image that primes the theme. The loft becomes "a cave of soft gray light" that isolates Mira for her ritual. The skylight's changing light (pearl to slate) tracks time and pressure. The rain drumming "turned the loft into a cave"—the space itself shapes her stance by creating sanctuary. Present early, recurs functionally, and participates in the tonal closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The kettle's whisper, scream, and silencing bracket the carving session, and "until the tea grew cold" marks elapsed time. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Mira pauses to make tea without visible cost to the work, and the piece does not build urgency around the boil cycle. The kettle serves as ambient punctuation rather than a constraint that alters her choices. Functional atmosphere but replaceable with any domestic timer.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Harvest lessons from loss" is Mira's explicit motivation in the penultimate paragraph and implicit throughout: she learns impermanence from circus life, patience from Viktor's lion work, and applies those to her carving. The desire is dramatized in every knife stroke and the decision to continue ("Tomorrow she would begin another"). Friction appears in the cooling tea and solitary repetition—the cost of the practice. The final clause ("harvesting what only grief could teach") closes the loop with visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Rust-hued peace" is named once in the final paragraph but the tone is established early through "soft gray light," "patient rain," and the measured pace of ritual. The mood modulates subtly—grief acknowledged ("painful detail") but not raw—and the ending deepens rather than disrupts it. The color and temperature (rust, cooling tea, darkening skylight) cohere. However, the single naming feels slightly imposed rather than fully earned through accumulated imagery; a stronger through-line of rust or warmth imagery earlier would lift this.</comment>
