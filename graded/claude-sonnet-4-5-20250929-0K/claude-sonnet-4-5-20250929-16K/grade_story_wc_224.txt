<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Isla's interior life is rendered through concrete, embodied imagery—mercury glass, texture-reading, the hollow ache—that avoids therapy-speak. The breakthrough moment where "buried talents rising like water from a forgotten well" carries genuine discovery, and her agency drives the resolution through choosing to write a tactile book. However, the emotional arc from pain to "precious" memories resolves too smoothly without visible ambivalence in the peak beat; the grandmother's stone delivery feels like convenient setup rather than earned complication. The final stance crystallization lacks a moment of genuine hesitation that would make the cost of choosing to stay and teach feel visceral rather than thematic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (Isla, bookstore-mountain, three years post-trauma). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: nightly memory substitution → stone discovery ritual → feather-触发 breakthrough → valley-memory flood → seed metaphor → book creation, with each beat deepening the texture of "home as practice." Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the seed/belonging insight that reweights her exile, and the final image of sprouting words charges prior material. Cost is felt (grief quieting, acceptance of scattering) but could be sharper—there's no on-page moment where she visibly relinquishes a concrete hope (e.g., returning to the physical valley) in favor of this new practice, which keeps the ending in the strong but not exceptional band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly particular—books growing like mineral deposits, seventeen turns through poetry/philosophy, greenhouse level where words sprout—and these details constrain Isla's movements and frame her ritual. The feather dropping through the ventilation shaft is a concrete spatial event that triggers the breakthrough. The lost language stone functions as micro-setting, its textured surface enabling the tactile-reading discovery that charges the closure. Spatial choreography remains clean throughout; the mountain's scale and the bookstore's strata create a coherent pressure-vessel for memory work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding her lost home—is signaled early and sustained through nightly rituals. The feather arrival provides one meaningful complication that tightens the search, and the texture-reading breakthrough narrows options by forcing her to confront the flood of painful memories she'd been substituting. However, escalation is primarily accumulative rather than a sharpening dilemma; there's no moment where she must choose between forgetting (safety) and remembering (pain) with a visible tradeoff on the page. The seed metaphor arrives as insight rather than hard-won choice, which keeps pressure coherent but not knife-edged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the texture-language conceit: "belonging is what you carry, not what you left behind" is earned through the grandmother's stone, the tactile breakthrough, and the final act of planting a textured book. The piece resists easy comfort—exile and scattering carry real grief—while the seed metaphor reweights loss as generative dispersal without sentimentality. The final image of sprouting words offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "what is home?" that deepens prior material. Minor slip: "hidden thunder in her chest" is named rather than left to accumulate, but it doesn't undercut the ending's earned wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: Isla notices through texture ("scratch of wind through canyon grass, smoothness of river stones") in ways that reflect her people's tactile epistemology. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("elicit," "articulate," "forecloses") that reads slightly outside a trauma survivor's immediate idiom, though it remains legible. No head-hopping; the crow's feather and stone are filtered cleanly through her focalization. Free indirect style is controlled, and the prose modulates appropriately from tight ritual description to the flood of memory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or theme. However, several scaffold patterns appear: "The mercury-glass seer had wandered… ever since remembering became painful" front-loads exposition rather than anchoring in immediate scene, and "But the fiction never satisfied" / "But seeds… were meant to travel" repeats the contrastive opener. "This was her home's language. Her people had shaped meaning…" loops the concept across adjacent lines without added pressure. The metaphor "buried talents rising like water from a forgotten well" stacks vehicles (buried/rising, talents/water, forgotten/well) in ways that blur rather than sharpen. No artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping the score in the solid band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tactile-language conceit is specific and non-obvious, transforming the familiar "lost home" premise through the feather-triggered breakthrough and the choice to encode memory in varied cloth textures. The bookstore-as-mountain and books-that-grow details feel organically integrated rather than ornamental. Risk is present in the accumulative structure and the quiet ending, both of which succeed. Minor friction: the grandmother's stone delivery and the drought backstory follow template refuge-narrative beats, but the texture method and the seed-as-practice closure synthesize these into something that feels earned rather than assembled.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Isla is present throughout and makes the key choice to write a tactile book, but much of her arc is interior realization rather than decision under pressure. The nightly substitution is described as habit; the stone discovery is past-tense setup. The feather moment prompts discovery, and the final teaching resolve alters her stance, but these read more as recognitions than contested turns. Present in all three gates (setup, middle touch via stone, closure via book creation) with moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lost language stone appears early (deep chamber discovery), is handled in the breakthrough beat (tracing symbols with feather), and directly shapes closure (used as guide to write the textured book). It enables the tactile-reading method and carries the grandmother's message, making it irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Not quite indispensable—a different artifact could theoretically serve—but the stone's specific carved-texture properties are leveraged across beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Buried talents" manifests on-page when Isla's hands move "with practiced certainty she didn't know she possessed" during the feather-触发 reading. This moment drives the memory flood and shapes the final choice to teach. However, the concept is more thematic backdrop than active constraint—she doesn't struggle against or leverage the hidden skill in multiple beats. Present in setup (implied in her pain/forgetting), middle (breakthrough), and closure (teaching), but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Substitutes reality nightly" is described early and frames her pain-avoidance pattern. It constrains her present state (hollow ache persisting despite nightly rewrites) and provides contrast for the closure turn toward acceptance. However, the substitution itself is told rather than shown in a specific beat; we never witness an actual nightly rewrite or see her choose between substituting and confronting. The attribute enables thematic setup but lacks on-page demonstration with immediate cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Seed" operates at two levels: literal (grandmother's "seeds were meant to travel" advice) and enacted (Isla plants a textured book in the greenhouse). The metaphor reweights her scattering from loss to generative dispersal and directly shapes the closure action. It appears late (second half) but transforms all prior grief-material, and the greenhouse seeding is the final turn. Strong closure linkage and thematic irreplaceability; slightly reduced for late signal but the payoff is undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The feather is introduced at the breakthrough beat, and its specific mechanics—"delicate barbs catching on the carved grooves"—enable the texture-reading discovery that no other method could. It triggers the memory flood and validates the tactile-language premise. Signaled via the ventilation shaft (plausible arrival), used in one extended beat with high causal pressure, and its effect directly shapes closure (the tactile book method). Not present in setup, but the middle and closure work is strong and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly rendered and provides the spatial frame (seventeen turns, deep chamber, greenhouse level) that organizes Isla's ritual and final action. The mountain's scale and the ventilation shaft enable the feather arrival. However, the setting pressures choices primarily through atmosphere rather than hard constraint—she could theoretically have her breakthrough elsewhere. Strong setup and closure participation (greenhouse planting), but the labyrinth itself doesn't force a tactical decision. Micro-setting (stone, feather, textures) does more causal work than the macro-location.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After remembering becomes painful" anchors the story's emotional present and explains the three-year refuge, but the timeframe itself doesn't create urgency or narrow options. There's no ticking clock or escalating temporal pressure; the breakthrough happens when the feather arrives, not because time is running out. The phrase frames Isla's state but functions more as backstory marker than active constraint. Present in setup, loose connection to middle and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"To understand the shape of home" is dramatized through the nightly stone visits, the texture-reading breakthrough, and the realization that "belonging is what you carry." The desire drives her sustained ritual and shapes the final choice to teach rather than mourn. Friction is present—grief versus acceptance, fixed location versus portable practice—and the closure directly answers this motivation. Strong setup, middle, and closure participation with visible cost (quieting the hidden thunder, accepting dispersal).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Hidden thunder" is named once ("hidden thunder in her chest—that constant rumble of grief and longing") and operates as a tonal anchor for sustained, submerged intensity beneath the ritual calm. The tone modulates appropriately from nightly substitution (muted) to breakthrough (flooding) to closure (quieting), and the final image of spring rain and sprouting words charges the rumble-to-growth arc. However, the phrase itself is somewhat decorative; the tone would function without the explicit thunder label. Coherent tonal arc with moderate closure linkage.</comment>
