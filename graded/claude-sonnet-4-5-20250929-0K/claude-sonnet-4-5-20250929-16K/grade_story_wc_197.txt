<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her resourcefulness shapes key beats (collecting archives, finding the key, uploading transmissions). However, her internal experience remains thin—we see competence without genuine struggle or contradictory impulses under pressure. The ending choice (swimming away) feels procedurally clean rather than costly; she's already uploaded everything, so departure reads more like tactical withdrawal than a foreclosed path. The "tyranny of indifference" thesis is articulated directly rather than embodied in micro-choices that test competing values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with Mira escaping and transmissions complete, creating a before/after (archives now spreading versus suppressed). The cost is present but muted: she loses the archive room and must flee, yet the mission succeeds cleanly without visible trade-off in the final image. Causality is mostly clean (key → puddle-map → hidden room → upload → escape), though the convenient pre-revision transmission equipment and the Bureau's timing feel arranged. Drive lens reads as Causal with situational pressure; the lens holds through closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The auric lagoon with bioluminescent plankton is vivid and the puddle-map carved into stone is a memorable micro-setting detail that enables the key discovery. Spatial choreography is clear (embankment, passage, room, lagoon). However, the setting functions more as backdrop and puzzle than as constraint—Mira moves through it without environmental resistance shaping her choices. The stars-doubling-in-water motif appears twice but remains decorative rather than charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (spread pre-revision archives before capture) is clear and tightens when three safe houses are raided. The pressure escalates through the discovery sequence and Bureau arrival, creating one meaningful turn. However, agency at closure is undercut: Mira completes her upload before the Bureau arrives, so the escape reads as cleanup rather than a high-cost choice. The transmissions succeed without visible sacrifice—no failed upload, no ally left behind, no information she must destroy to protect others.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus erasure emerges through concrete images (photographs, vanished neighborhoods, the water-map), and the "tyranny of indifference" offers moral weight. However, the final paragraph shifts into thematic summary ("coded messages of freedom…written in the language of memory itself") rather than letting the image resonate. The piece articulates its question clearly but answers it too tidily: transmission complete, Mira free, no ambiguity or cost that reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with a slight YA-register tilt ("the real enemy…not soldiers or surveillance, but the collective shrug") that reads as character voice rather than intrusion. The courier's coded message ("When plans unravel, seek the map that lives between earth and sky") elevates briefly but serves the puzzle. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance modulates appropriately across reflection and action beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean with strong information density and varied sentence rhythm. No loops, template cadence, or significant artifacts. A few lines approach stock phrasing ("the ghost geography of the vanished coastal district," "comfortable tyranny of indifference") but remain functional. The puddle-map sequence is concretely rendered. Clarity and propulsion are consistent; the piece moves efficiently without scaffolding. Minor hedge: "more than that" is a small connector crutch, but overall line-level craft is solid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The puddle-carved map is a fresh detail that elevates the premise beyond standard resistance-archive plots. However, the core structure (lone rebel, hidden archive, regime closing in, escape after uploading truth) follows a familiar template without transformation. The "tyranny of indifference" thesis is earnest but stated rather than dramatized through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The bioluminescent lagoon and phone booth key add texture but don't fundamentally alter the emotional or thematic arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and dismissed as "idealistic student…too young and insignificant," fulfilling the underestimated-rebel trait. She makes key choices (kneeling to study puddles, pressing the key, uploading archives, escaping through the lagoon). However, the "underestimated" dimension is told in exposition rather than dramatized—no on-page moment where an antagonist dismisses her to her tactical advantage. Setup clear, development solid via choices, closure participation present (escape choice).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The phone booth key appears early (warm in her palm, coordinates etched), drives the middle beat (fits the stone depression to open the passage), and is causally essential to accessing the archive room. Three distinct beats: discovery mention, coordinate significance, physical use. Removing it would break story logic. It does not return with reweighted meaning at closure, limiting top-band entry, but causal pressure and irreplaceability are high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Revised histories shape the premise (lagoon falsely claimed as always restricted, villages erased) and Mira's goal (spreading pre-revision archives to counter the erasure). The concept constrains her tactics (hiding evidence, using forgotten channels) and the climax hinges on transmitting true history. It is woven through setup, development, and payoff. However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract—"revised histories" functions more as thematic backdrop than a visible rule that alters a specific choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is demonstrated on-page: three years collecting fragments, unearthing the key from a condemned building, decoding coordinates, following the puddle-map, and using pre-revision transmission tech. However, the trait enables success without visible cost or trade-off—every resourceful move works cleanly. No moment where her caution costs time, or her resourcefulness exhausts a limited supply. Label is embodied in action but lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Reappear" is mentioned in the penultimate paragraph ("Tomorrow, she would reappear somewhere they'd never expect"), but it is a stated intention rather than an on-page action. The actual closure action is swimming away and the transmissions completing. The reappear beat is future-tense setup, not dramatized, and does not create a turn or redefine present options. Swappable with "vanish," "strike again," or any continuation phrase.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The puddle-map method is signaled early (courier's coded message about "the map that lives between earth and sky"), discovered in the middle beat (Mira studies puddles, traces water-streams, finds the depression), and its mechanics matter (channels carved into stone, convergence point for the key). Removing this exact method would require structural rewrite. It shapes one key attempt and enables the passage discovery. Does not return at closure, capping upper range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The auric lagoon is present throughout: opening image, the embankment with carved channels, Mira's escape by swimming through it, and the final image of stars reflected in golden water. It provides spatial coherence and a specific sensory signature. However, it functions more as atmospheric container than active constraint—the water does not impose cost (temperature, visibility, pursuers) or supply a tactical resource that alters her choices. Setup strong, development thin, closure participation present but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"When plans unravel" is the named timeframe and dramatized on-page: three safe houses raided in one evening, Mira has "hours, maybe less" before connection. The ticking clock pressures her sequence (study puddles at dusk, descend, upload, hear boots, escape). Time tracking is loose but functional—dusk deepens to night, "by morning" transmissions will spread. The urgency shapes pacing but does not force a specific tactical trade-off (upload speed versus file selection, for instance).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Hold the line against the tyranny of indifference" is articulated directly in Mira's reflection ("Citizens who didn't question…that was the real enemy") and motivates her three-year effort and the climactic upload. However, the desire is told rather than tested—no on-page moment where Mira must choose between spreading the archives and, say, protecting an indifferent ally who could betray her. The motivation is consistent but lacks friction or contradictory pull.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Coded freedom" as tone is present in the courier's riddle, the coordinates etched on the key tag, the pre-revision transmission channels, and the final line ("coded messages of freedom…spreading through the city"). The tone coheres across beats and modulates from reflective urgency to action to quiet resolve. However, it risks becoming a stated theme rather than a felt texture—"coded" is named more than embodied in sentence rhythm or image indirection. The final image of doubled stars gestures toward it but does not fully charge the concept.</comment>
