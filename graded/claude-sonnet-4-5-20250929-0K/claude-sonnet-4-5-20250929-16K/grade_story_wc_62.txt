<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's journey from isolated monument carving to collective-grief understanding shows clear motivation, though the transformation leans heavily on Thomas's spectral instruction rather than her own pressure-tested choices. The epiphany feels more received than earned through on-page struggle. Interior moments like "fiercely meditative in her stillness" gesture toward depth but remain somewhat abstract. The final readiness to "carve differently" lacks a specific on-page micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is swift (gravestone carver, autumn, monarchs migrating). The story opts for an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elena visits the greenhouse nightly, receives lessons, and the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration where she "gathered her tools and the ribbon roll, ready to return" with new understanding. However, the closure unit is primarily summary and assertion ("she would carve differently now") rather than a decisive on-page act or image that makes the cost undeniable. The cost remains conceptual and the final beat tells transformation rather than dramatizing it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vivid and purposeful: "cracked panes and rust-eaten frames," "orange light filtered through glass and vine," monarchs migrating through the open roof. It functions as both a retreat and a teaching space, constraining Elena's attention and charging the final departure. The ribbon roll—a micro-object as setting element—guides her new carving method. Setting shapes choice and charges the ending, meeting the 9+ gate criterion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding collective grief to improve her carving—is clear and signals early. Escalation occurs through Elena's nightly returns and progressive lessons, but the tightening is episodic rather than a single on-page pressure point that forces a trade-off. The final decision to "carve differently" is stated, not tested. No visible cost appears on the page; the forfeited approach and the new method remain abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the woven ribbon's deliberate imperfections model collective grief's rhythm, the monarchs' migration mirrors sorrow's communal flow. The ending avoids moralizing; Elena's realization that "sorrow migrated through the living, transforming them as it moved" grows from the ribbon's physical pattern and Thomas's lessons. The final image of the greenhouse "holding its lessons in the gathering dark" offers resonance without stating a thesis, though the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elena; no head-hopping. Voice carries a literary register consistent with the reflective tone: "vessels for remembrance," "weather patterns," "heat shimmer." Thomas's brief dialogue feels natural and mentorial. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply character-particular; the prose could belong to any thoughtful artisan. No elision debt; filter verbs are voice-appropriate ("she found herself drawn").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean and rhythmically varied. Information density is good in descriptive passages ("ancient structure, with its cracked panes and rust-eaten frames"), but several beats loop thematically: the ribbon's lesson is stated twice (rhythm/variations, then music/chorus), and the penultimate paragraph summarizes insights already conveyed. Opening and closing lines anchor effectively. Minor register drift into elevated diction ("thundering calm," "fiercely meditative") that feels slightly imposed rather than POV-organic. No serious artifacts, but propulsion slows in the final third as summary overtakes scene.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship is a familiar frame, and the monarchs-as-migration-metaphor is well-worn. The piece transforms through specificity: the woven ribbon's pattern as a literal map of grief's connections is a fresh synthesis. The gravestone-carver angle and the family dinner poem custom add texture. However, the emotional arc follows a predictable path from isolation to communal understanding, and the climax remains abstract rather than a non-obvious turn. Solid craft elevates familiar material without breaking new ground.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena's occupation frames the story and her work on stones appears early and late. She makes the on-page choice to "retrace her previous work in her mind" and to incorporate the ribbon's variations into new carvings, shaping at least two beats. However, her decisions are largely observational and receptive; Thomas drives the mentorship, and the final carving change is declared, not dramatized. Present across setup, middle reflection, and ending assertion, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ribbon roll appears in the third evening, is examined and unspooled with Thomas, returns as Elena's guide for new carving patterns, and is gathered at the end. It constrains her new method and charges the closure by becoming "a map of connections." Present in three distinct beats (discovery, lesson application, final gathering) with specificity that makes it irreplaceable. Strong integration; the element drives understanding and the ending gesture.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship structures the narrative: Thomas appears at dusk on the third evening, unfolds lessons "across the butterfly migration, lesson by lesson," and fades at the end. His presence enables Elena's learning and shapes the episodic escalation. The concept is signaled early, drives middle beats, and is present at closure when "Thomas faded as the last light died." It alters Elena's options by providing the ribbon insight and poem exchanges, making it essential rather than ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Fiercely meditative" appears once as a descriptor ("fiercely meditative in her stillness") but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. It labels Elena's greenhouse posture without shaping a tactical choice or creating visible friction. The attribute does not recur or evolve. Present but ornamental; swappable with "deeply reflective" or similar without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elena begins to "retrace her previous work in her mind, visiting graves she'd carved years ago" after Thomas's lessons. This action enables her realization that she "isolated each sorrow" and drives her decision to create connected stones. The retracing appears mid-story and links to the ending ("ready to return to her stones"), shaping a key turn. However, the action is mental and summarized rather than physically dramatized, limiting its causal weight. Present in setup and payoff with moderate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The family custom of trading poems at dinner is mentioned once: Elena "brought her family's custom with her" and recites poems to Thomas, who responds with elegies. This enables the lesson that "the poem changes when voices share it," modeling collective grief. The method appears mid-story and informs the thematic insight but does not shape a climactic choice or return at closure. Functional in one beat; its mechanics matter but it remains secondary to the ribbon roll.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse is introduced early ("abandoned greenhouse behind the cemetery each evening at dusk") and serves as the sole setting for the spectral encounters. Its open roof admits migrating monarchs, its workbench holds the ribbon roll, and Elena returns "each dusk that followed." It constrains the narrative window and charges the ending: "The greenhouse stood silent behind her, holding its lessons in the gathering dark." Present in setup, middle, and closure with causal and atmospheric weight; essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The butterfly migration provides the timeframe, signaled in the opening ("monarchs began their journey south") and tracked through "the third evening," "each dusk that followed," "as autumn deepened and the last monarchs passed through," and "the final evening, as the greenhouse stood empty of butterflies." The migration structures the episodic lessons and marks closure when Thomas fades with the last butterflies. Time pressures the narrative arc and shapes the ending, though individual dusks remain undifferentiated. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elena's desire to understand "the shape of collective grief" is established via Thomas's dying words and drives her nightly greenhouse visits. The motivation is stated early and tested through her receptive learning and mental retracing. However, it remains largely intellectual; friction between wants and costs is minimal, and the final choice to carve differently is asserted rather than enacted with on-page resistance. Present in setup and middle with thematic payoff, but lacks dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Thundering calm" appears once as a descriptor for Thomas's presence: "Thomas watched with thundering calm, his presence both powerful and peaceful." The phrase fits the spectral mentor's paradoxical authority but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. Tone overall is meditative and consistent, but the specific phrase feels ornamental rather than structurally necessary. Present in middle beat only; swappable without loss.</comment>
