<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cornelius is motivated by his covenant and gift, with the affliction near dishonesty providing texture. However, his mastery is so complete—no genuine struggle, no moment where his fingers truly tremble or vision blurs under the work's pressure—that the restoration feels inevitable rather than earned. The seven boxes are processed mechanically without individual resistance or a single failure that costs him. Internal contradiction is absent; he moves through the night in unbroken competence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Cornelius, resonance chamber, commission) arrive cleanly. The piece accumulates through the seven-box restoration and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (the boxes play, covenant fulfilled). However, the cost is asserted rather than shown: no moment where a thread scatters, no box that resists, no price paid for the night's work beyond elapsed time. The closure image is resonant but the felt cost required for RR in this mode is not legible on the page—"warm and content" signals satisfaction, not sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The resonance chamber as curved-wall amplifier is vivid and specific, shaping Cornelius's humming method throughout. The philosopher's chip returns with reweighted warmth at closure. Tools "sang their readiness" and the swan's garnet eyes anchor the first box. Spatial choreography (spiral stairs, workbench, high windows) tracks cleanly and the setting charges the ending image when all seven boxes braid melodies below.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore stolen melodies) is clear. The accumulative lens allows pressure to build through the seven-box sequence. Yet no single box resists or forces a tactical shift—each restoration follows the same humming-and-tethering method. "Everything hung in the balance" declares jeopardy, but the narrative never dramatizes a near-miss or a thread that scatters. The resolution is smooth and cost-free, weakening the felt escalation required even in accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The covenant-of-rust theme (beauty persists through relationship, not force) emerges organically from the repair work and the philosopher's-chip mechanic. The distinction between "mending what isn't torn" and ordinary repair is specific. The final image—melodies "older than midnight, brighter than any darkness"—resonates without stating a moral. Subtext operates in "bereft" versus "broken" and in the detail that midnight drank the songs. Minor slip: "tinkersong wonder" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward theme summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Cornelius with a consistent register: "the covenant of rust," "gossamer filaments," "Pythagoras himself." Perceptual signature (seeing golden threads, hearing tool-song) is character-specific. However, elevated diction pervades even high-pressure beats ("manifest restoration," "spheres of celestial music") without modulation, creating a static lyric tone rather than rhythmic response to stakes. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. Psychic distance remains controlled; focalization is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmically varied with strong images: "silver swan with garnets for eyes," "dandelion seed," "dawn breaking." Information density is high. However, multiple lines loop conceptually without adding pressure: "bereft" is named, then "mending what isn't torn" restates it, then "restoring the invisible covenant" paraphrases again. The peak restoration beat summarizes "Box by box" rather than dramatizing one struggle. Figurative language ("cathedral song," "gossamer filaments," "celestial music") stacks densely in the middle third without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Template stems: "He [verb]" structures appear in the final paragraph ("He climbed," where customers "would arrive," "would illuminate"). Combined: paraphrase loops −0.3, summary of climax −0.4, figurative density −0.3, template cadence −0.2 = baseline ~7.8 reduced to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of music-box repair, philosopher's stone as memory tool, and the covenant-of-rust frame is specific and non-obvious. "Mending what isn't torn" and the affliction near dishonesty add fresh angles. However, the lyric-fable register and the frictionless restoration arc follow familiar fantasy-craft templates: master artisan, magical heirloom, night-long work, triumphant dawn. The piece does not transform the template through lived friction or a non-obvious moral calculus—Cornelius succeeds without cost, and the ending's "tinkersong wonder" phrase edges toward stock whimsy.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cornelius appears early, decides to restore the boxes, and executes the work across multiple beats. His choice to use the philosopher's chip and his humming method drive the restoration. However, the work is monolithic—no single box forces a tactical pivot or a renunciation. The climax is summarized ("Box by box") rather than showing a pivotal choice under pressure. Present in setup, middle, and ending; shapes two beats (first swan, then the set); but swappable with any skilled artisan.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The chip is signaled early (vest pocket, humming against heart), used actively in the swan restoration (held above, glows, becomes needle), and returns warm and content at closure. It enables the tethering method and is irreplaceable (passed down seven generations, remembers what objects forgot). Present across three beats with causal pressure and closure linkage. Minor friction: the chip's glow colors and dawn-amber detail are ornamental; the core function (memory/tethering) could work without them.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The covenant is named early and explained (tend boundary between mechanism and music, preserve relationship so song survives silence). It frames Cornelius's motivation. However, it does not constrain a single on-page choice—he never weighs breaking the covenant, nor does the covenant's rule prevent a tactic or force a trade-off. It functions as thematic backdrop rather than active stake-shaper. Present in setup and thematically at closure, but no middle beat where the covenant's terms alter options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Wilts near dishonesty" is mentioned once as "a peculiar affliction" that makes fingers tremble and vision blur near lies, explaining why he perceives golden threads. But the trait never constrains an on-page action—Cornelius works alone in truth throughout, so the affliction has no dramatized cost or enablement. It is label-only exposition. Introduced early but absent from middle and closure beats; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Tether" is the verb for the restoration: Cornelius "began to tether the severed connections" using the chip as needle. The action is specific to his method and shapes the swan's repair and the summary seven-box sequence. However, the tethering itself is described rather than dramatized with resistance—no moment where a tether snaps or a connection eludes him. Present in setup (implicit in covenant/threadwork), executed in middle, and implicit at closure (boxes play). Drives one key beat with causal role, but the particulars (how tethering differs from ordinary repair) remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Mending what isn't torn" is named explicitly ("This was his particular gift") and contrasted with ordinary repair (replacing gears, straightening pins). The method (reweaving covenant via humming and chip) is signaled and executed in the swan beat. However, the mechanics remain abstract—what does "reaching into the space between sound and silence" look like as observable action? The method shapes the attempt but is not tested or refined; it works on the first try. Functional but mid-replaceable: "restoring invisible bonds" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is introduced early, used actively (catches voice, returns chorus, amplifies intention), and present at closure (boxes play below, melodies braid). The curved walls "like the inside of a violin" and the acoustics enable Cornelius's humming method—without the chamber's amplification, the tethering might fail. Spatial details (spiral stairs, workbench, high windows) track across beats. The chamber supplies a resource (resonance) that affects outcome and charges the final image. Present in all three gates; drives two beats; irreplaceable for this method.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Everything hung in the balance" declares the timeframe once, mid-story. The night-long work and dawn's arrival at closure provide temporal boundaries. However, no live clock tightens decisions—Cornelius works at his own pace with no risk of interruption, fatigue, or a box that might take too long. The phrase "in the balance" is ornamental; time does not pressure a single choice. Present as ambient frame (night to dawn) but does not alter tactics or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation (restore melodies stolen by midnight, fulfill the covenant) is stated early and drives the entire night's work. Cornelius's goal is consistent and his labor serves it across multiple beats. However, the motivation is never conflicted—no moment where he weighs stopping, no cost that tempts him to abandon a box. The desire is told and enacted without friction between want and price. Present in setup, pursued in middle, achieved at closure; functional but lacks the dramatized tension required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tone is consistent: lyric, reverent, wonder-inflected diction ("cathedral song," "gossamer filaments," "tinkersong wonder"). The prose maintains this register through calm and peak beats without modulation—restoration and dawn receive the same elevated style. The final image ("brighter than any darkness could swallow") charges with the tone, and "tinkersong wonder" in the penultimate paragraph makes the tone explicit. Coherent and present at closure, but static mood rather than dynamic modulation under pressure.</comment>
