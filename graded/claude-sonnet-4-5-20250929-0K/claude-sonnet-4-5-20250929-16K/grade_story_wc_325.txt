<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent—returning to retrieve her sister's research—but her claustrophobia functions mostly as a told trait rather than a live contradiction that forces hard choices under pressure. The internal conflict between fear and loyalty is stated but never dramatizes Maya hesitating, altering tactics, or paying a visible cost for pushing through. The sister exists only in backstory; no on-page relationship pressure tests Maya's commitment. Embodied emotion is present in "throat close and vision narrow" but remains surface-level description rather than shaping micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Maya, facility, tidal window) land by ~100 words. The piece accumulates pressure through deepening levels and rising water, building to a final image where the codex glows and Maya vows to return—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that crystallizes her stance with felt cost (repeated descent into terror). However, the cost remains abstract: we see her emerge and resolve to return, but no on-page forfeiture or tactical price paid in this specific descent. The closure reweights "between the tides, between states" but the conceptual cost is more asserted than demonstrated in a concrete trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The facility is vividly rendered with selective, pressure-driven detail: "barnacled walls," "rusted walkways," "pools of standing water starting to freeze." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through four descending levels. The rising tide creates urgency and the monitoring station provides a concrete goal-object. The codex's gold flecks shift from decorative to conductive, constraining perception and charging the final image. Micro-setting (codex, equipment, screens) alters tactics and shapes the ending, satisfying the 9+ gate for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve data, honor sister's memory) is signaled early and sustained. The tidal clock provides external pressure and one tightening moment: "Water began seeping under the door. The tide was returning early." But this reversal is brief and resolved by summary ("She emerged as the sea crashed back"). Maya's agency at closure is a vow to return rather than a decision that forecloses a live option with visible cost in this scene. The escalation is more atmospheric accumulation than a choice-driven narrowing of options, placing it at the high end of mid-band under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: witnessing the erased, tracking invisible things, descent as loyalty. The codex's transformation from decorative to conductive offers a concrete vehicle for the invisible-made-visible motif. "Some acts of remembering required descent into the very spaces that terrified you most" hovers near moralizing but stays grounded in Maya's embodied experience. The final image (glowing codex, vow to return) reweights prior material without stating a thesis. Minor penalty for the closing generalization "Some loyalties demanded you track what others refused to see," which drifts toward abstraction rather than letting the image resonate alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization through Maya. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices electromagnetic traces, compass trembles, phase transitions—details filtered through her expertise and obsession. Diction remains controlled and voice-specific: "crashing hush," "invisible highways of data," "forgotten state beneath the waves." No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts. The prose reflects Maya's mind under pressure without therapy-speak or filter-verb stacks. Clean execution with distinct texture throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing atmosphere or plot. Minor scaffold appears in "The facility seemed to breathe, moving between states: exposed and submerged, air and water, remembered and forgotten"—the list feels slightly mechanical. "Crashing hush, crashing hush" as onomatopoeia works but borders on over-writing. The closing paragraph edge toward summary ("Tomorrow she would return again, gathering piece by piece") rather than image. Overall clean with strong propulsion, but the final beats soften into exposition rather than leaving the codex glow to carry closure alone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—electromagnetic signals in undersea cables suggesting non-human consciousness—offers a fresh angle on "messages from the deep." The sister's erasure and Maya's claustrophobic return create genuine stakes. However, the story leans on familiar genre beats: abandoned research station, erased records, the protagonist as sole witness to forbidden knowledge. The codex's gold flecks as conductive tracers provide a specific, memorable detail. Transformation is partial: the emotional core (loyalty through terror) feels earned, but the broader plot could swap in other "forbidden knowledge" frameworks with minor edits. Mid-band for synthesis with one strong particular (the codex) elevating it above template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout and makes the decision to descend, retrieve data, and vow to return. Her claustrophobia is mentioned but does not force a visible tactical choice or trade-off on the page. The character drives the action but without a key turn that narrows options with cost. She succeeds in her goal and emerges unchanged beyond reaffirming her prior commitment. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but the choices are linear rather than transformative.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The codex appears in the opening (setup), is consulted mid-descent (development: "added her own notes beside her sister's annotations"), and glows in the final image (closure). Its gold flecks shift from decorative to conductive, a functional reweighting. The codex is handled across three beats and charges the ending. Strong causal involvement and specificity, though the mechanical role (how it guides her choices in real time) is somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Undersea cables are the premise: the research station studied them, the sister tracked signals through them, and Maya's equipment detects electromagnetic anomalies along cable routes. The concept shapes the backstory and motivates the descent. It appears in setup, middle (monitoring station displays cable data), and informs the closure (proof of what was learned). However, the cables themselves do not constrain a live on-page choice or alter tactics during this specific descent; they function more as context than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Tracks invisible things" is Maya's defining skill: she detects electromagnetic anomalies through compass trembles and instrument readings. This trait enables her to interpret the data and understand the codex's conductive properties. It appears in setup and middle, shaping her perception. At closure, it allows her to recognize the gold flecks' true function. The trait is causally active but does not impose a visible cost or force a trade-off; it functions as competence rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Return" is the story's spine: Maya has returned "tide after tide" and will "keep returning until every forgotten name was spoken again." The action frames the opening, motivates every beat, and structures the ending vow. This specific descent is one iteration of a repeating action, and the decision to return again is the closure image. The act of return defines the stakes, tactics, and thematic question. High integration; the story would collapse without this exact repeating action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Phase transitions appear in the facility's dual states (exposed/submerged) and in the physical environment: "pools of standing water starting to freeze," "condensation forming on metal walls as pressure changed." The method is signaled early and creates the tidal urgency. It shapes the middle (Maya moves quickly, knowing the tide will return) and the exit (rising water). The transitions function as atmospheric pressure and clock rather than a puzzle or tactical constraint Maya must navigate in a specific way. Present in all three beats, with moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The facility is the story's crucible: its four descending levels, corroded state, and tidal exposure create all the pressure. It houses the monitoring station (goal-object), constrains movement (narrowing corridors, rising water), and embodies the theme (forgotten, submerged, remembered). The setting is present in every beat, shapes tactics (40-minute window, portable generator), and charges the final image (emerging as the sea reclaims it). Strong integration across setup, middle, and closure; essential to both plot and theme.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tidal window is signaled early ("maybe forty minutes before the tide returned") and creates urgency throughout. It tightens in the middle ("Water began seeping under the door. The tide was returning early") and forces the exit. The timeframe constrains Maya's choices (move quickly, seal the pack) and shapes the rhythm of descent and escape. Present in setup, middle, and closure. The clock is somewhat abstract—no on-page moment where Maya checks time or abandons a task due to the deadline—but it provides coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To stand by the unremembered" is stated explicitly and dramatized through Maya's repeated descents despite her claustrophobia. The motivation is present in setup (sister's erasure), middle (downloading data, adding notes), and closure (vow to return, speak forgotten names). It drives the action and aligns with theme. However, the desire is more told than conflicted: Maya never hesitates, questions the cost, or faces friction between this loyalty and another want. The motivation is clear and consistent but lacks on-page tension between competing impulses.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Crashing hush" appears twice explicitly and is woven throughout in images of muffled ocean, dripping water, profound silence after the sea returns. The tone modulates from creeping dread (descent, narrowing corridors) to quiet resolve (final vow). It charges the opening and closing images and remains coherent under pressure. The phrase itself is evocative but borders on over-statement when repeated. The tone supports atmosphere and theme without becoming static, though it could integrate more tightly into micro-beats rather than relying on the refrain.</comment>
