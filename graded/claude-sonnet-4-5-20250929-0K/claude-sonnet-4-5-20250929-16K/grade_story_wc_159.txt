<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miren's interior is consistently rendered through her careful reverence and systematic approach, and her work carries embodied weight. The foxglove regret functions as felt emotion rather than diagnostic label. However, the protagonist operates in relative isolation without meaningful relational friction, and the final emotional state—"purpose mixed with sorrow, like love directed toward ghosts"—leans toward articulated summary rather than enacted contradiction. The choice to fashion the new chime feels inevitable given her role rather than a difficult renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, what) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Miren discovers the crack, descends to the archives, plays recordings to recalibrate, and fashions a new chime that creates harmonies. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes her purpose amid the singing orchids with felt cost ("foxglove regret bloomed deeper now"). One tightening occurs when the cracked tube creates a new frequency, deepening the dominant stake. Causality remains clean; no teleporting props or retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The opal library's translucent walls, climate-controlled alcoves, and eastern wing anchor spatial choreography throughout. The cracked bamboo tube and glass fragments constrain Miren's tactical choices on the page. Sensory selection—rose and amber light, the wheeze of the broken tube, the hum of orchids—filters through Miren's professional attention and reinforces urgency. The floating library three miles above clouds charges the final image by isolating her preservation work from the world below, making the cost of her devotion legible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve the orchid collection's emotional signatures—is signaled early and tightens when the chime cracks. One meaningful turn occurs when Miren discovers the cracked tube produces a new frequency "between nostalgia and discovery," reweighting the problem as partial solution. The resolution (fashioning a new chime from a shattered orchid) is earned by her prior choices and carries visible cost: she uses a fragment from an orchid she "had been unable to save." Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres and the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—the cost of preserving what humanity has chosen to forget—emerges through Miren's work rather than assertion. The glass orchids, extinct feelings, and the Severance frame the question without explicit moralizing. The final image offers a non-literal answer: her purpose-with-sorrow embodies the price of tending "deserted marvels." Foxglove regret recurs purposefully, accumulating weight. Minor slip: the phrase "an emotion that might have had a name once" flirts with thematic echo but stops short of sermonizing, remaining grounded in her embodied experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; Miren's perceptual signature—her careful reverence, systematic approach—remains consistent. Diction stays within her lexicon (glass-orchid caretaker, climate-controlled alcoves, sympathetic vibration). Purposeful compression ("gently systematic") and elevated register ("bittersweet ache," "fractured rose and amber") fit the voice without jarring. Minor strain: "the sound of forgotten names" and "the museum of extinct feelings" verge on conceptual ornament, but they remain anchored to her present task and do not float free of the scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; no hard loops or template cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, or atmosphere. Minor overwriting: "deserted marvels" appears three times, "foxglove regret" twice, and phrases like "the voices of people speaking words that no longer existed" lean slightly purple without muddling clarity. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and reweight motifs cleanly. Clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—a floating library preserving extinct emotions as crystallized orchids—offers a fresh synthesis of museum-work and speculative anthropology. The cracked chime creating a new frequency is a non-obvious turn that grows from prior particulars. Risk: the pre-Severance frame and "museum of extinct feelings" echo familiar dystopian emotional-pruning tropes without fully transforming them through Miren's lived stakes. The piece commits fully to its concept and follows implications without retreat, but the core emotional-archive premise trends recognizable within the genre.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miren drives all major beats: she discovers the crack, descends to the archives, plays recordings, documents resonances, and fashions the new chime. Her choices alter tactics twice (playing recordings instead of seeking a replacement, using a shattered orchid fragment). Present in setup, middle, and closure; her agency shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cracked bamboo tube appears in the inciting beat, drives the middle search for recalibration, and returns at the end when Miren hangs the new glass chime beside it to create combined harmonies. It constrains her options (must find another method) and charges the final image. Three distinct beats; causal pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Deserted marvels" names the orchids and recurs three times, framing the thematic question of preservation. It shapes the dominant stake (preserve these relics) and charges the final reflection. However, it functions primarily as thematic resonance rather than constraining a specific on-page choice; removing the exact phrase would not break the logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" describes Miren's approach in the opening and recurs when she documents tones in the middle ("carefully, gently systematic"). It enables her method—playing recordings methodically—but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. Present in setup and middle; modest causal role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Light threads through the opening (dawn light in opalescent walls), the discovery beat (holding the tube "to the light"), the climax (orchids "blazed with inner light"), and the closing (opal light, twilight, stars). It charges the final image and recurs with reweighted meaning. Three beats; shapes atmosphere and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The phrase "by the echo of a long-forgotten song" signals the method in the descent paragraph. Miren then activates the phonograph, plays pre-Severance recordings, and uses their tones to recalibrate the orchids—the exact mechanics matter and drive two beats. Present in setup (as search cue), middle (as enacted method), and implied in closure (the combined harmonies). Causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The opal library provides the spatial frame and charges the final image ("opal light... above the world"). Climate-controlled alcoves and the eastern wing supply resources. The setting isolates Miren's work from the world below, underscoring the cost of her devotion. Present in setup, middle, and closure; modest constraint on tactics (she must work within the library's systems).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Across the museum of extinct feelings" functions as thematic frame and spatial metaphor (the archives house the oldest specimens). Time of day shifts from dawn to sunset to twilight, marking duration. However, no urgent deadline tightens decisions; Miren works across hours without a live clock that alters tactics. Present but does not constrain choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To preserve the sound of forgotten names" is named explicitly in the middle ("This was it—the method to preserve the sound of forgotten names") and drives Miren's descent, the recording playback, and the chime-fashioning. It shapes two beats and charges the final reflection. The desire is dramatized through her actions and carries friction (she uses a fragment from an orchid she couldn't save). Cost is visible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Foxglove regret" is named twice and embodies Miren's emotional state: "bittersweet ache of knowing something beautiful was slipping away" and "bloomed deeper now, but also sweeter" at closure. The tone modulates from discovery to resolution, charging the final image. Coherent through turns; tone that fits the elegiac premise without flattening into single-note melancholy.</comment>
