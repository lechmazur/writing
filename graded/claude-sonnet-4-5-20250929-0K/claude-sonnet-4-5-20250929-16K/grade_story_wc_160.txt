<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to harmonize conflicting values is established early and drives her decisions, but her interior life remains generic—no contradictory impulses or embodied stress during the three-day restoration. The predecessor's message functions more as puzzle than character pressure. The ending grants understanding to the elders without showing them struggle with prior distrust, flattening what could be a charged moment of renunciation or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; the causal chain from envelope clue → chain measurement → hidden valve is clear and motivated. The closure—water flowing and communities standing together—lands on the page, but the cost remains abstract: no visible sacrifice, no foreclosed path, no felt price for either village or Elena. The final image of "understanding dappled their faces" tells resolution rather than showing a decisive change with weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amphitheater's volcanic breathing—stone expanding/contracting with thermal cycles—is vivid and recurs purposefully, charging the final image of the building as "steady and eternal." Spatial choreography (terraced seats, orchestra, floodgate chamber descent) remains clear. The surveyor's chain and hidden valve are handled tactilely. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric without becoming a catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (resolve upstream flood protection vs. downstream seasonal flow) is signaled early. The hidden valve discovery narrows options and provides a meaningful turn. However, the escalation lacks visible cost: Elena's three-day restoration encounters no setbacks, resource limits, or meaningful opposition. The elders' resistance melts instantly upon demonstration, undercutting the premise that "neither side believed compromise possible."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of compassion encoded in infrastructure emerges through the bypass valve and the predecessor's cryptic message. The closing image of communities "harmonized at last" and the building breathing attempts resonance, but "He encrypted it, waiting for someone who'd look beyond the obvious conflict" states the thesis rather than letting particulars speak. The ease of resolution—no trade-off, no ambiguity—simplifies what the setup promised as intractable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is controlled. Diction is consistent and slightly elevated ("slyly heartfelt," "dappled") without breaking character plausibility. The dialogue in the final scene ("Your ancestor built compassion into the stone itself...") functions cleanly but edges toward expository summary. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the perceptual signature is steady if not highly distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and strong imagery ("throat of stone," "amber" walls at sunset). Minor loops appear: "the building breathed" recurs three times in similar phrasing, and "compassion" + "encrypted" + "harmonize" cycle without fresh angles. The phrase "fragile as hope" and "steady as breath" are stock constructions. Information density is adequate; no major clarity issues, but the final third summarizes Elena's three-day work rather than dramatizing a key moment of struggle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The volcanic amphitheater setting and the adhesive-impression message offer specific, non-obvious details. However, the core plot—engineer discovers hidden mechanism that perfectly solves opposing needs—is a familiar template (the "secret third option" structure). The ease with which Elena deciphers the clue, retrieves the chain, and restores the valve without meaningful friction or ingenuity under pressure reduces freshness. Emotional truth is present but not surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elena's floodgate expertise enables the valve restoration and drives the middle discovery beat (measuring with the chain, finding the hidden mechanism). Her role is functional across setup, development, and payoff, but her decisions feel procedural rather than constrained by ingenuity under pressure—no failed attempts or resource limits test her skills.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The surveyor's chain appears in the message clue, is retrieved from the elder's house, and provides the measurement (66 feet ÷ 3 = 22 feet) that locates the valve. It bridges two beats and links to closure causally. However, the chain's specific properties (why 66 feet, why this chain) are not irreplaceable; any measuring tool with a known length could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Encrypted compassion" is named explicitly in the adhesive message and again in Elena's explanation to the elders, framing the hidden valve as moral design. It shapes the central stakes (harmonizing conflicting values) and reappears at closure. Yet the concept functions more as thematic label than tactical constraint—Elena does not wrestle with what compassion demands or face a moral calculus; she simply decodes and restores.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Slyly heartfelt" describes the predecessor's message once and colors Elena's reaction to it, but the attribute does not constrain an on-page action or create visible cost. It remains a tonal descriptor without causal pressure or trade-off in Elena's choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The envelope trembles in Elena's hands when she lifts it, cueing its fragility and her reverence. This moment seeds the adhesive analysis that follows and recurs subtly in "fragile as hope." The tremble bridges discovery and method, but the action itself is easily swappable (she could "notice," "examine," "unfold") without altering story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Analyzing leftover adhesive with volcanic ash paste is the method that reveals the hidden message, driving the middle turn and enabling the chain measurement. It appears in both setup (the empty envelope) and development (the paste mixture), and the specificity (adhesive impressions, ash chemistry) is harder to replace. However, the method resolves a problem it did not complicate—no earlier failed attempts or resource scarcity test its use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amphitheater inside the volcano provides the floodgate chamber entrance, supplies volcanic ash for Elena's paste, and houses the hidden valve. The stone's thermal breathing (expansion/contraction) marks time and charges the final image of the communities standing together. The setting constrains access (descent into the chamber) and enables the solution (ash resource), appearing in setup, development, and closure with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The building's thermal breathing—stone expanding in morning warmth, contracting in evening cool—appears in the opening, middle, and final paragraph, marking time more organically than clock minutes. It lends rhythm and charges the closure image ("steady and eternal"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions; Elena's three-day restoration is summarized without deadline pressure or urgency that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elena's task to harmonize conflicting values (upstream flood protection vs. downstream seasonal flow) is her stated motivation from the second paragraph and drives her search for the bypass valve. It reappears at closure when she demonstrates the solution to both villages. Yet the motivation is told rather than dramatized through internal conflict or competing loyalties—Elena never doubts, weighs costs, or sacrifices an option.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Dappled" recurs three times (shadows dappling the seats, understanding dappling faces, tone implication) and "resolve" threads through Elena's steady problem-solving. The tone modulates from wonder (opening) to focus (restoration) to quiet triumph (closure), cohering across beats. However, the effect is more atmospheric consistency than pressure modulation—no tonal shift heightens stakes or undercuts expectation at a key turn.</comment>
