<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and her technical competence balanced with genuine stakes, but her internal conflict is thin—she has one moment of doubt ("instincts screamed at her to surface") immediately overridden without complication. Thalia remains a cipher; we see her urgent gestures but no contradictory impulses, rendering the preserved priestess more symbol than character. The vial-memory flood offers rich backstory but does not tilt Marina's present stance through micro-choices; it informs rather than pressures. Embodiment is adequate ("hands trembled," "chest ache") but leans toward stock gestures rather than character-particular reactions under duress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (Marina, submersible, trench temple) and the causal chain is clean: distress signal → discovery → vial memories → field collapse → rescue. The closure lands on the page with a legible decisive change (Thalia freed, temple fulfilled) and the final image reweights the material from solitary distress to shared ascent. However, the cost feels abstract—"they had captured something more precious than time" tells theme rather than showing a visible trade-off or foreclosed path at the ending beat. The inferred lens is Causal with an Accumulative accent at closure; it holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underwater temple is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: "coral-encrusted pillars...like bones," "cathedral of stone and shadow," brass helmet and preservation field shimmering with "impossible technology." The submersible's manipulator arms and energy probe constrain Marina's rescue attempt, making setting tools integral to the climax. The collapse of the temple at closure charges the final image with visible consequence. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the shift from temple interior to ascent through "dark water" to "stars" provides a clear environmental arc that mirrors the thematic movement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing Thalia before the field fails—is signaled early and tightens cleanly when Marina realizes "there were no experts." The key reversal ("This will free you or kill you") narrows options and Marina's choice to trigger the sequence is protagonist-driven with legible risk. The cost is visible in action (helmet cracks, temple collapses, gasped breath) but the preservation field's "hours" deadline never manifests as urgent pressure on the page; the tightening comes from knowledge rather than a live clock forcing errors. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the temple's history and the contrast between isolation and connection: "those who refused to be forgotten" resonates without moralizing. The vial shifts from relic to vessel to heart-held keepsake, accumulating meaning across beats. The final image—"two women who had both been alone...rising toward a surface neither had expected to see again"—offers a non-literal answer to loneliness and preservation without thesis statement. The phrase "lonesome splendor" recurs purposefully, charging the closure. Minor slip: "They had preserved the memory" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward overt thematic summary rather than letting the image carry it alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Marina with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "coral-encrusted pillars," "lonesome splendor," "refining it, waiting." Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven ("I'm here. I received your signal.") and Thalia's mouthed "Please" carries subtext and urgency. The prose modulates with pressure:短er sentences during the field collapse, longer reflective rhythm in the opening and close. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; perceptual signature is consistent (Marina notices tech, Thalia's gestures, light refraction). The final shift to dual focalization ("two women") is brief and warranted by closure without confusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance character, setting, or pressure. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor loop: "lonesome splendor" appears in paragraph one and the penultimate line, which is intentional callback but borders on self-echo. Template cadence in the memory-flood paragraph: "She saw...The priests had gathered...They had nearly succeeded. Then the earthquakes came" uses repetitive sentence stems without pattern-teaching, costing momentum (−0.4). No significant filter stacks or metaphor muddle. Clarity and propulsion remain strong through the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The underwater-temple + preservation-field premise is executed with vivid specificity (brass helmet, crystal vial holding captured time) that lifts it above stock lost-civilization tropes. The emotional truth—two isolated figures finding connection—feels earned rather than imposed. The temple's "gathered hush" and the vial's dual function (memory vessel, temporal key) offer fresh synthesis. However, the core beats (distress signal, trapped figure, race-to-save) follow a familiar adventure template without a bold structural or moral twist. The transformation is competent but not paradigm-shifting; removing Marina's occupation and swapping the vial for another artifact would leave the arc largely intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thalia (the distress signal sender) is present from paragraph two, suspended and watching. Her gestures guide Marina's work at multiple beats (pointing to nodes, pressing the vial, mouthing "Please"), making her an active participant rather than passive object. Her choice to send and refine the signal for decades establishes agency before Marina arrives. Her final swim toward the rescue pod and clutching the vial "against her heart" contribute to closure. The character drives two key beats (memory transfer, final consent) and shapes the ending's emotional charge.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The crystal perfume vial appears in paragraph three (Thalia clutches it), returns as memory vessel in paragraph six (flood of temple history), becomes the key mechanism in paragraphs eight–nine ("transfer the field's energy into it"), and charges the ending ("held...against her heart"). It is handled across four distinct beats, its properties (captures time, holds memories, receives stasis energy) are irreplaceable, and removing it would collapse the rescue logic and thematic resonance. The vial's facets "throwing rainbows" and final glow tie its physical presence to the story's emotional and conceptual closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Gathered hush" appears explicitly twice: paragraph one ("lonesome splendor") and paragraph nine ("the temple's gathered hush seemed to pulse"). It names the atmosphere but does not constrain Marina's choices or alter tactics on the page. The concept enriches tone and connects to the priests' reverent work, offering thematic color, but Marina's actions (maneuvering, calculating, triggering) would proceed identically without it. Lyric reprise at closure is present but the concept remains atmospheric rather than pressure-shaping.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Touches memories" is dramatized on the page when Marina touches the preservation field's outer membrane and "the vial's memories flooded through her" (paragraph six). This attribute enables a key turn: Marina gains the knowledge needed to attempt the rescue, seeing the temple's history and understanding the vial's function. The cost is visible—she must act on incomplete, ancient knowledge with no backup. The trait appears in one major beat and directly shapes the climax, but it does not recur or constrain later choices beyond that single flood.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" appears once in paragraph seven: "waiting for someone with the knowledge to unsnarl the ancient mechanism." Marina's subsequent work—aligning probe, calculating trajectories, triggering the sequence—enacts this action across two beats. The concept is specific (disentangling preservation tech) and irreplaceable in context, but the mechanics remain abstract; we see Marina "work" and "calculate" without on-page friction or false starts. The action drives closure but could be replaced with "unlock" or "reconfigure" without structural loss. Setup is late (second third) but payoff is strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"By overriding instinct" is seeded in paragraph seven ("Marina's instincts screamed at her to surface") and enacted in paragraph eight ("By overriding instinct, she opened...and began to work"). The method is signaled before use and the internal conflict (instinct vs. choice) is legible. However, the override happens in a single line without complication or visible cost—Marina simply proceeds. The method could be swapped for "by trusting Thalia" or "by accepting the risk" with minimal edits. It drives one beat but does not shape the rescue's tactics or recur at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "forgotten underwater temple" is anchored in paragraph one and provides the story's spatial and causal spine. The preservation field (temple tech), the chamber layout (Marina maneuvers closer), the field's nodes (Thalia points), and the temple's collapse at closure all constrain and enable action. The setting is irreplaceable: removing the temple removes the entire premise. It appears across five beats (discovery, field interaction, memory flood, rescue work, collapse) and the final collapse ("its purpose finally fulfilled") charges the ending image. Early signal, sustained pressure, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"As time runs short" is invoked in paragraph seven ("the preservation field would fail in hours") but the deadline never tightens Marina's actions on the page. She studies, calculates, and triggers the sequence without visible urgency, false starts, or time-driven errors. The timeframe is told rather than felt; no clock or degrading field forces her hand. The element sets stakes conceptually but does not alter tactics or rhythm. Late signal, minimal causal work, absent from closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" is dramatized in the memory flood (paragraph six): the priests worked "to capture time's passage in crystalline form." The motivation drives the temple's backstory and explains the vial's function, priming Marina's rescue attempt. However, the desire belongs to the long-dead priests, not Marina or Thalia on the page. Marina's own want (to answer the distress signal, to free Thalia) is present but not conflicted with cost. The motivation shapes one key beat (knowledge transfer) and enriches theme but does not create friction in Marina's choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is named in paragraph one ("lonesome splendor that made her chest ache") and returns in the final line ("The lonesome splendor of the deep gave way to stars"). The tone is consistent through discovery, urgency, and resolution, modulating from solitary awe to shared ascent without tonal rupture. The phrase charges the ending by reweighting solitude as a state transformed rather than escaped. Diction throughout ("cathedral of stone and shadow," "gathered hush," "rising toward a surface neither had expected") sustains the elegiac register. The reprise tightens closure and the tone coheres across all beats.</comment>
