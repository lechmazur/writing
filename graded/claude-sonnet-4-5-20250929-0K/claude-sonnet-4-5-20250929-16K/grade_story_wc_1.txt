<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's internal journey from seeking narrative meaning in survival to accepting "meaning...accumulated like condensation" is earned through concrete sensory engagement (frost patterns, canyon wall warmth). The "steadily adaptive" trait manifests in scarred hands that "still knew how to shape molten glass," showing endurance with cost. Minor weakness: the patron's mapping feels slightly convenient in hindsight rather than seeded with micro-choices that would have revealed Elena's blindness earlier. The final decision to testify and rebuild carries visible cost—returning to the city, facing investigators—and forecloses the retreat into canyon silence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates through layered images (glass/light, frost/water, fire/ash) that converge at the ending to reweight Elena's survival from providential to ordinary. Orientation anchors quickly (canyon, stars, three weeks post-fire). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena's realization that she was "simply geography" loosens her chest, and the decision to return with the ledger reweights her artistic practice ("pieces about survival and emptiness"). Cost is conceptual—the loss of a comforting narrative—but legible in "something loosened" and the shift from seeking silence to choosing action. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The canyon under stars provides concrete sensory anchors (warm stone, silver shadows, frost retreat at dawn) that are filtered through Elena's glass-artist lens ("light could become trapped and transformed"). The frost patterns function as micro-setting, constraining her investigative method by modeling how "invisible streams beneath the surface" guide her reading of the ledger gaps. The kiln's "heat capacity" detail seeds the patron's mapping. Minor gap: the patron's monthly visits and cash payments are told rather than shown through a recalled micro-interaction that would have grounded his presence more vividly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: making sense of survival (why she lived, what it means). The ledger's pattern-gaps provide the tightening—Elena moves from emotional searching to forensic seeing, which narrows options from abstract meaning to concrete testimony. The frost-as-model deepens her method, showing "what exists in the gaps." Agency manifests in the choice to return and testify, foreclosing the retreat into canyon silence with visible cost (scarred hands, facing investigators). The patron reveal slightly reduces pressure because it externalizes the threat—"wasn't about her at all"—which should feel diminishing but instead "loosened" her, a reversal that works thematically yet softens the escalation slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through glass-as-metaphor (holding/releasing light, existing "between states") applied to survival without becoming thesis statement. The frost image—delicate networks revealing "invisible streams beneath the surface"—returns with reweighted meaning at closure, modeling both investigative method and thematic insight about accumulated rather than revealed meaning. "To discover purpose in the pauses" is voiced by the teacher but dramatized through Elena's ledger analysis (gaps, not data). The "loosening" moment resists tidy epiphany—she rejects providence narratives—and the final image ("everything that continues after the fire goes out") charges closure without moralizing. Minor slip: "steadily adaptive" appears twice as phrase, risking label-speak, though it's anchored in scarred hands and glass-shaping knowledge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited with tight Elena focalization; perceptual signature is glass-artist specific ("thought of glass—always glass," frost as "luminous quality"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during hand/scar moments, slightly elevated during the frost-watching passage to allow accumulative rhythm. The teacher's aphorism ("purpose in the pauses") risks exposition but is framed as recalled lesson applied in scene. No dialogue; the patron's questions are summarized rather than quoted, a minor missed opportunity for subtext. Diction stays consistent (studio, kiln, molten) with one slight register lift at "drifting resonance" in the final line, which reads voice-motivated (lyric closure) rather than drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance character (scarred hands), investigation (ledger gaps), or atmosphere (frost retreat). Rhythm varies—short declaratives at the reveal ("She was simply geography"), longer accumulative sentences during the frost passage. Minor loop: "steadily adaptive" appears in paragraph one and late-story interiority without functional change. The metaphor strand (glass/light/frost) is coherent and pays off, though "silver shadows" is near-cliché. No major artifacts. The final sentence risks overwriting with three similes stacked ("like breath, like the hum of cooling glass, like everything that continues"), but the parallelism reads purposeful (lyric closure) rather than muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass-artist-as-investigator synthesis is fresh—her kiln knowledge makes her both victim and key. The frost-as-model for seeing gaps is specific and non-obvious. However, the arson-with-hidden-evidence premise leans on familiar crime-fiction scaffolding (ledger, monthly patron, cash payments), and the "wasn't about her" reveal is a known beat. The story transforms this through thematic depth (survival meaning, adaptive practice) and the lyric frost/glass braiding, lifting it above template. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and quiet ending is solid but not bold enough to reach high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's glass-artist identity is seeded early (studio, kiln, "luminous glass sculptures"), drives her investigative lens (seeing light/patterns), and shapes the ending choice (rebuild studio, create new work about survival). Her artistic practice—"learning to see what lingered after the bright moment passed"—enables her to read the ledger gaps. The choice to return and testify, then rebuild, is causally rooted in her artist's understanding of transformation through heat. Present in setup, middle (frost observation as artist's seeing), and closure (new work about emptiness and frost). Cost: scarred hands, lost studio, facing investigators.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ledger strip is found post-fire (setup), studied in the canyon (middle), and drives the return-to-testify decision (closure). It appears in three beats but is more plot device than charged object—Elena handles it, but its physical state (charred edges, faded ink) doesn't constrain her reading or charge the final image beyond functional use. The ledger enables the investigation but doesn't carry symbolic weight or reweight meaning at the end; it's tucked into her jacket and exits the narrative. Functional integration, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Scorched testament" is signaled early ("a scorched testament, fragmentary records") and the fire/ash imagery recurs (burned edges, studio consumed). However, as core concept it stays largely thematic/atmospheric rather than shaping tactics. The ledger's burned state matters (someone tried to erase evidence) but doesn't constrain Elena's ability to decode it—she reads the gaps, not the charring. The concept charges the setting and backstory but doesn't alter on-page choices in a way that another investigative puzzle wouldn't. Present and coherent, but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Steadily adaptive" is named in paragraph one (survival trait) and demonstrated twice: scarred hands that "still knew how to shape molten glass" and the pivot from seeking silence to choosing testimony/rebuilding. The trait enables her endurance (kept breathing through fire) and future action (will build new studio) with visible cost (scars, lost work). It constrains the ending—she cannot stay in the canyon—because adaptation means continuing practice. Present in setup (survival) and closure (rebuild decision), with cost legible. However, the phrase itself appears twice as label, risking tell-over-show, and the middle investigative beats don't foreground adaptability as much as observation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Retrace" drives the central investigative turn: Elena retraces the ledger numbers, discovers the pattern of absences ("gaps...every sixth entry"), which leads to the patron memory and the return-to-testify choice. The action is seeded (frost showing her "how: not the data itself but the spaces"), executed on-page ("began to retrace the numbers"), and shapes closure (testify, then rebuild). The frost explicitly models the method, making "retrace" specific to this story's logic rather than generic investigation. Essential to the plot's tightening and the final decision. Present across all three beats with causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Morning frost appears in the middle section, teaching Elena to see patterns through "invisible streams beneath the surface," which she applies to the ledger gaps. The frost is observed across multiple paragraphs, and its retreat at dawn parallels her shift from searching for meaning to finding method. However, the mechanics are more metaphorical than procedural—frost doesn't constrain her tactics, it inspires insight. It's present in middle and echoed at closure ("luminous quality of morning frost"), but the connection is thematic (seeing hidden flows) rather than tool-like. The method shapes attempts but could be replaced with another natural-pattern observation without breaking causality.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The canyon under stars is anchored early (stone wall, stars, frost) and provides the physical space for Elena's investigation and final choice. It supplies the frost resource that models her method, and the canyon's "silence" and "emptiness" pressure her initial desire for retreat, which she ultimately rejects by choosing to return. However, the setting is more crucible than constraint—it enables reflection but doesn't limit her options in a way that alters tactics. The "wind through stone" echoes at the end but doesn't charge the closure beyond atmosphere. Present across all three gates, but functional rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Three weeks after surviving the attempt" is stated early and contextualizes her drive to the canyon (recent trauma, need for distance). However, the timeframe doesn't tighten on-page decisions—there's no urgency imposed by days passing or a deadline approaching. The night-to-dawn passage marks elapsed time but serves the frost observation rather than escalating pressure. The fire is backstory, and the three-week gap is orientation detail, not a live clock. Present in setup, absent from middle and closure pressure. Functional context, but easily replaceable with "recently" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To discover purpose in the pauses" is voiced by the teacher and dramatized through Elena's ledger analysis: she finds meaning not in the data but in the gaps, the "pauses" that "formed their own pattern." Her initial desire for silence (seeking emptiness "that might fill her differently") conflicts with the cost of staying—she has evidence, scarred hands that can still work, and a choice to testify. The motivation is present in setup (why she came to the canyon), middle (shift from emotional to forensic seeking), and closure (choosing testimony/rebuilding over retreat). The friction between wanting silence and the pull of purpose is legible, though the "loosening" moment slightly softens the internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Drifting resonance" is established early through lyric cadence (silver shadows, warm stone, "always glass") and modulates across the story: contemplative in the frost passage, tightening during the ledger analysis, and returning to lyric at closure ("like breath, like the hum of cooling glass"). The tone coheres with the accumulative lens and charges the final image through layered similes that echo earlier motifs (glass, breath, continuation). However, the tone is slightly static—it drifts throughout without sharp modulation at peak pressure (the patron reveal). The "drifting resonance" phrase itself appears only in the final line as descriptor, not as on-page tonal shift. Coherent and purposeful, but could be sharper at the turn.</comment>
