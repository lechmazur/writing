<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is established through backstory (Kiran's promise, the institutional erasure) but her present-scene choices—documenting, weeping, planning the upload—feel more procedural than contradictory under pressure. The vandalized portrait triggers grief, yet the scene lacks micro-choices that reveal competing impulses acting simultaneously. Interiority relies on phrases like "volcanic tenderness" and "delayed grief" that label rather than embody. The final renunciation (becoming a permanent criminal) carries conceptual weight but the cost is declared more than dramatized through a present dilemma.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Marina's upload decision crystallizes her transformation from conservator to arsonist-activist, and the cost (permanent exile, criminal status) is felt even if not yet paid. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—sensory details (carved narratives, tapestry fragment, ruined portrait) build density toward the final documentation act. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraphs. One meaningful deepening occurs when she finds the vandalized portrait and decodes Kiran's embedded message, reweighting her prior arson from destruction to targeted curation. However, the two-year search and the archive discovery are summarized rather than dramatized, flattening the causal spine.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The basalt archive is vividly rendered (carved narratives, stone alcove, dry air, headlamp catching wall after wall) and constrains Marina's choice by existing as the sole proof source. The tapestry fragment and vandalized portrait function as micro-setting, charging the final documentation decision. Sensory hierarchy reflects Marina's conservator training (texture of hide, meticulous border symbols). Spatial choreography remains clear despite the mountain interior. The archive's hidden location and preservation conditions make the stakes legible: this evidence exists nowhere else, so Marina's upload is irreversible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing Kiran's legacy from institutional erasure—is signaled early and drives the documentation/upload decision. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marina discovers the vandalized portrait contains coordinates and evidence, narrowing her mission from abstract vindication to concrete exposure. However, the escalation is largely internal and reflective; the archive itself does not resist her, and no external pressure forces a trade-off. The cost (permanent criminality, no return) is declared but not tested by a present dilemma. Agency reads as completion rather than a pressured choice between competing goods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—institutional erasure versus embodied memory—emerges from the archive's physicality and Marina's arson-as-curation without overt moralizing. The final image ("promises burn too bright to extinguish") reweights the opening fires as targeted acts rather than vandalism, achieving Conceptual Repricing. The tapestry fragment and vandalized portrait function as particulars that resist abstraction. However, the closing paragraphs edge toward thematic echo ("some promises burn too bright") and the story occasionally leans on prompt-like phrasing ("volcanic tenderness," "truth too beautiful to destroy completely") that hovers near declaration. The archive's stone memory metaphor is sustained and specific.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("volcanic tenderness rising in her throat," "stone memory keeping faith") that feels imposed rather than character-specific during peak emotional beats. Perceptual signature (conservator's eye for texture, meticulous documentation) is present but underutilized in the archive—Marina's training "floods back" via summary rather than filtered observation. No dialogue; interiority carries the voice. Psychic distance is consistent. The final apostrophe ("I found you") reads naturally. Narration occasionally claims insights ("analytically intuitive mind") that feel authorial rather than earned through dramatized perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clarity is generally strong, but several artifacts weaken momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "The fires had been necessary" is restated across multiple sentences explaining the poisoned donations. Template cadence in the middle section: "She found X… She worked through Y… She had it…" creates a procedural rhythm that dulls urgency. Stock metaphors cluster in peak beats ("volcanic tenderness," "avalanche of accessible lies," "flames of institutional erasure"). Filter-verb stacks ("she found," "she knew," "she suspected") appear in the discovery sequence. The final image ("promises burn too bright to extinguish") is evocative but borders on cliché. Information density is moderate; some sentences do double duty, but the two-year search summary adds little pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—arsonist burning false evidence to protect truth—offers a fresh inversion of villain/hero dynamics. The Tethani archive and embedded-message conceit read competently but echo familiar "suppressed indigenous knowledge" templates without a non-obvious moral calculus. Marina's conservator-turned-arsonist arc is specific, yet the archive discovery unfolds without significant surprise or friction; the evidence is intact and waiting. The vandalized portrait embedding coordinates is a clever detail, but the resolution (upload everything simultaneously) feels like a checklist answer to the prompt rather than an inevitable synthesis. Emotional specificity (grief for Kiran) elevates the piece above generic execution, yet the core turn is telegraphed early.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marina (lending library arsonist) is present throughout and her past fires frame the stakes, but her present-scene choices are largely procedural (documenting, weeping, planning upload). The arson backstory informs motivation but does not create a key on-page turn; the archive discovery and upload decision would function identically with a different protagonist role. Introduced early but not causally active in the closure beat beyond thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears in the alcove discovery beat, is pressed to Marina's chest with emotional weight, and is gathered at the end to carry out. Two distinct touches with evolving significance: first as confirmation of Kiran's photo, then as a "child" to protect. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the fragment is symbolic cargo rather than a tool or obstacle. Closure linkage is present but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait is the story's linchpin: its discovery triggers Marina's grief, its embedded border symbols provide the coordinates/evidence she needs, and its ruined state dramatizes the institutional violence. Three beats: discovery, decoding, final touch. It drives the middle turn (from searching to possessing proof) and charges the closure ("I found you"). The vandalism itself shapes stakes—proof that exists only in damaged form. Essential to the plot and thematic core.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is mentioned once in the opening summary ("breadcrumbs only her analytically intuitive mind could connect") but never demonstrated through on-page problem-solving or a visible trade-off. The archive's "trail" is found intact, requiring documentation rather than puzzle-solving. Label-only trait without embodied cost or tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Portray" appears in the vandalized self-portrait description ("Kiran had painted themself") but is not an action Marina performs. If interpreted as Kiran's past act, it sets up the portrait discovery but does not turn the present scene; Marina documents rather than creates. If interpreted as Marina's documentation work, the action is mentioned ("photographed everything") but not dramatized with pressure or choice. Passive presence, not a causal hinge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "trail of artistic creations" (geometric patterns → faces → scenes) is signaled in the archive description and Marina "link[s] the artistic elements throughout the archive into their intended sequence." Two beats: initial sensory catalog and the decoding night. The method matters narratively (Tethani designed the trail to require intuition and analysis) but Marina's process is summarized rather than dramatized. It enables the discovery but does not constrain or complicate her approach. Setup and payoff present; middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive (basalt cliffs, carved walls, stone alcove, dry air) appears throughout as the sole location and directly enables Marina's mission—no archive, no proof. It supplies the tapestry fragment, vandalized portrait, and documented evidence. Setting pressures the stakes by existing as a unique, irreplaceable resource and frames the upload as an irreversible broadcast. Early setup, sustained presence, and closure participation (the archive "held her words like an embrace"). Essential to logic and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After going off the grid" establishes the timeframe in the opening and anchors Marina's criminal status, but the two-year search is summarized without tension. The present-scene archive work ("through the night, by dawn") provides a vague elapsed window but does not tighten decisions—no countdown or competing deadline forces Marina's hand. Time is present but does not escalate pressure or alter tactics. Introduced early, participates passively at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation—to rescue Kiran's forgotten promise—is dramatized through the alcove grief beat ("she wept with the fierce tenderness of delayed grief"), the apostrophe ("I found you"), and the upload decision that completes the vow. The promise shapes all three acts: framing the search, charging the portrait discovery, and driving the closure. Friction between personal loss and public stakes is present but underplayed; the upload feels inevitable rather than conflicted. Strong setup and payoff, moderate middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" appears as a phrase in the tapestry beat and again in the grief sequence, functioning as a tonal anchor—rage compressed into care, destruction serving preservation. The tone modulates from procedural documentation to emotional peak (weeping, apostrophe) to resolve (upload decision). However, the phrase itself reads as an imposed label rather than emerging from texture; the story *tells* the tone more than embodying it through rhythm and image. Present in setup and closure, but the descriptor does more work than the prose cadence. Mid-range coherence.</comment>
