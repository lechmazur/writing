<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dye master's shift from watchful observation to magnetic listener is clearly motivated by the donor heart, and her interior voice remains consistent throughout. The proprietor's revelation provides character history that enriches the protagonist's understanding, though the dye master's own active choices remain minimal—she primarily receives information rather than making decisions that foreclose paths. The morpho wing functions well as a teaching object that reflects her values, but the final "nodding" acceptance feels more like resignation than a choice with visible cost. The embodied details (careful fingers, rhythm in chest) ground the interiority effectively.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (dye master, tea house, dawn, post-surgery timeframe). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers observations and confessions to deepen the protagonist's understanding of her inherited magnetism, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where she accepts the work of witnessing. The proprietor's revelation at midpoint provides the crucial reweighting, and the final image—wing blazing on the windowsill—charges prior material with purposeful resonance. One meaningful deepening occurs when she understands the gift rather than burden, and the cost is implicit in her commitment to return and bear stories. Causality is clean, though the coincidence of the proprietor knowing the donor and giving her the same wing strains credibility slightly without undermining closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house is vividly anchored (suspended boulder, moss-thick chains, cloudberry tea in whisper-thin cups) and the eastern window constrains her ritual of tracking sun trails. The morpho wing functions as micro-setting, its changing iridescence guiding her perception and charging the final image. Valley mist, pearl-and-amber dawn light, and golden thread sun trails create a coherent sensory palette filtered through the dye master's professional attention to light and color. The tea house's spatial specificity (her usual seat, the proprietor drifting closer) supports choreography, and the setting's quiet isolation suits the confessional stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why strangers magnetize to her with their stories—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the list of confessors (merchant, pilgrim, baker, soldier, widow) and tightens when the proprietor names the previous owner's work, reframing burden as gift. However, escalation is gentle; the dye master faces no active opposition or difficult choice, only a deepening comprehension. The resolution is acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses an option with sharp cost. One clear tightening occurs when she grasps "iridescent caution" as responsibility, but the stakes remain interior and contemplative rather than pressured by external conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the morpho wing's structure-not-pigment optical truth and the metaphor of prisms transforming light. "Some people are built like prisms" and "watching is its own kind of love" avoid overt moralizing while grounding abstract ideas in the dye master's craft. The final image—wing blazing on the windowsill—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of witnessing without stating a lesson. The piece resists tidy resolution; her commitment to "bear the stories" carries weight without simplifying the complexity of being a vessel for others' truths. Subtext operates well in the proprietor's dialogue ("not quite a question") and in her startled realization that she is also being observed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and filtered through the dye master's professional lens: she tracks light, notes iridescence, and perceives in terms of hue and structure. Perceptual signature is consistent (sun trails, scales, microscopic structures) and diction suits her observant, contemplative stance. The proprietor's dialogue feels natural and purposeful, advancing plot through revelation rather than exposition. Psychic distance remains close-third throughout, and no head-hopping occurs. However, some phrasing edges toward elevation ("inevitable, essential," "shimmer and change") that slightly exceeds the grounded voice established early, and the final paragraph's summary tone ("she would return tomorrow") tells future intent rather than staying in the present moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well across the piece, and sensory detail is vivid without overwriting. However, several scaffold patterns weaken momentum: "She had been watchful all her life—observant of..." restates the same idea across the dash; "Not the polite exchanges...but the quietly explosive confessions" uses a standard not-X-but-Y template; and "inevitable, essential" stacks near-synonyms without adding meaning. The opening's "painting everything in shades of pearl and amber" and later "golden threads" risk stock imagery, though the morpho wing's specific optical mechanics ground the light motif. "Stories found her the way water finds cracks" is effective, but adjacency to "inevitable, essential" in the same sentence creates density without propulsion. Paragraph structure varies purposefully, and grammar is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The donor-heart premise is familiar but handled with restraint; the magnetism effect avoids melodrama and ties credibly to the dye master's existing observant nature. The morpho wing as teaching object—structure bending light rather than pigment—provides a fresh scientific grounding for the metaphor of perception and truth. The tea house setting (floating rock, moss chains) adds specificity. However, the core arc (inheriting a stranger's gift/burden, learning its value through a wise secondary character's explanation) follows a well-worn template without sharp transformation. The proprietor delivering all key revelations reduces the protagonist's agency in discovery. Risk-taking is modest; the piece prioritizes lyrical coherence over structural boldness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The watchful dye master is present throughout and her observation skill is central to her identity, but her choices are minimal. She removes the wing, holds it to light, listens, and nods acceptance—receptive actions rather than decisions that narrow options. The watchfulness itself does not create a turn; the proprietor's information does. Her final commitment to return and bear stories is told rather than dramatized as a choice with visible cost. Present and functional but does not drive key beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The blue morpho wing appears in four distinct beats: opening (removal from case, description of scales and structure), midpoint (held to morning light while wondering about magnetism), proprietor's revelation (he gave it to the donor), and closure (placed on windowsill where it blazes). Its specific property—no blue pigment, only structures bending light—directly supports the "iridescent caution" concept and the theme of truth depending on perspective. The wing's meaning reweights across the arc from teaching object to inherited legacy. Strong integration with minor swappability (another optically interesting object could serve similarly).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Iridescent caution" is named early as what the dye master learned from the wing, and the proprietor later defines it as "the responsibility of making visible what others couldn't see alone." It shapes her understanding of the witnessing burden/gift and connects to the morpho wing's optical mechanics. However, it functions primarily as thematic vocabulary rather than constraining on-page choices—she never faces a moment where caution conflicts with illumination or where the concept alters her tactics. Present in setup and closure with thematic weight but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" is applied to the confessions strangers bring and used once by the proprietor to describe trust. It characterizes the type of stories but does not constrain the dye master's choices or create visible tradeoffs. The label itself is vivid but remains descriptive rather than shaping action. Present and tonally apt but ornamental; easily replaced with "intimate" or "vulnerable" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Illuminate" appears in the protagonist's wondering ("a magnetism"), the proprietor's explanation ("they illuminate it, transform it"), and the final sentence ("illuminate what others needed witnessed"). It ties to the light/prism metaphor and names the inherited work. However, no on-page beat shows her actively illuminating someone's story—the action is declared rather than dramatized. The concept shapes closure understanding but does not drive middle turns. Lyric reprise with thematic charge but limited dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Tracking sun trails" is introduced early as her ritual at the eastern window, recurs when she predicts color angles, and is mentioned by the proprietor as part of the donor's practice. The method connects to her dye-master attention to light and provides concrete texture. However, the mechanics never constrain a choice or alter tactics—it remains observational rather than instrumental. The final paragraph notes "track sun trails until she learned to bear the stories," linking it to closure intent, but the how remains abstract. Present across beats with purpose but limited causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house is vividly established (suspended boulder, chains, cloudberry tea, eastern window) and provides the stable frame for the encounter. The eastern window enables sun-trail tracking, and "her usual seat" signals routine. The proprietor's presence and knowledge create the revelation that reweights the protagonist's understanding. The setting's isolation and ritual space suit the confessional stakes. However, the location itself does not constrain choices—the conversation could occur elsewhere with minor adjustments. Strong atmospheric contribution and structural frame but not indispensable to plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The donor-heart timeframe is signaled in paragraph one ("after receiving the donor heart, her vigilance had transformed") and controls the entire premise—the magnetism is new, the wing was the donor's, and the protagonist is learning to inhabit the gift. The proprietor's "twenty years ago" anchors the donor's history. Time pressure is low (no urgency), but the post-surgery state is causally necessary to the story's logic and present in setup, middle, and closure. Drives premise and one key revelation but does not tighten decisions across beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to learn why some people magnetize stories" is stated in paragraph four ("She wondered if this was what she'd inherited") and dramatized when she asks the proprietor "Did she ever learn why?" His answer provides the thematic resolution. However, the protagonist's desire is contemplative rather than urgent—she wonders rather than pursues, and the answer is delivered rather than discovered through her choices. The motivation frames the question but does not create friction or visible cost when answered. Present and coherent but low-conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Valley-mist wonder" tone is established in the opening (mist painting dawn in pearl and amber) and sustained through cloudberry tea, whisper-thin cups, drifting proprietor, and the morpho wing's impossible azure. The tone modulates gently with the protagonist's shift from confusion to acceptance, and the final image—wing blazing as mist clears—charges the wonder with earned clarity. Sensory vocabulary (shimmer, iridescent, trails of light) maintains coherence without static repetition. The tone suits the accumulative structure and elevates the closure image without overwhelming pressure beats.</comment>
