<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's progression from crisis actor to archivist of small gestures is earned through concrete micro-choices: selecting survivors to interview, guiding their walks with "benevolent ruthlessness," documenting patterns in chalk. Her internal contradiction—cruelty as kindness—drives on-page action when she forces elderly survivors and traumatized children to repeat walks "until the muscle memory emerged pure." The colleague's visit crystallizes her shift from performing disasters to "performing the opposite," and her final stance forecloses pretense with visible cost. Minor issue: the phrase "glowed in her mind" leans toward stock interiority, but embodied choices anchor the rest.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece teaches its method early (chessboard discovery, walking interviews, acoustic memory) and accumulates density through the interregnum's suspension, building toward the final image where "small gestures refused to die." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara's work continues in the luminous absence, crystallizing her role with felt cost—she has abandoned all other survival paths to become this singular archivist. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Mara in whispering gallery during interregnum). One slight density lapse: the colleague's scene could tighten, but it serves to articulate her transformation and does not obscure the closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The whispering gallery's curved acoustics and marble chessboard constrain Mara's archival method throughout: survivors walk patterns that "spelled names, dates, tiny moments," and "footsteps in certain patterns created resonances" that the building learns. The gallery's acoustic properties enable her discovery that "the architecture was becoming the archive," directly shaping her project's tactics and the final image. Nomadic penumbra (shifting firelight) charges both atmosphere and metaphor, filtering perception through "luminous absence." Spatial choreography remains coherent across all beats, and the micro-setting (chessboard, chalk marks, resonant dome) drives the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving memories of the vanished pawns—is signaled at the chessboard discovery and tightens through Mara's escalating method: from observation to guided walks to forcing repetitions "until the muscle memory emerged pure." Her benevolent ruthlessness forecloses gentler approaches with visible cost ("She was cruel because she was kind"). The interregnum's suspension creates persistent situational pressure (no government to document, nomadic survival), and her choice to continue "one footstep at a time" in the final image crystallizes her renunciation of other roles. Minor cap at 8.3: while pressure is coherent, the colleague's scene slightly softens momentum before the ending rather than tightening further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the chessboard's missing pawns, the mother tying shoes during evacuation, the teacher drawing stars on palms, three strangers holding hands during shelling. Mara's realization that "no one will remember" these gestures grows organically from her crisis-actor past and the interregnum's erasure. The closing image—"small gestures refused to die...quiet gestures that unbind us from forgetting"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: memory as bodily archive, not grand narrative. The phrase "luminous absence" recurs with shifted weight, charging the thematic question. Only the phrase "unbind us from forgetting" in the final paragraph edges toward articulation of thesis, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled distance; Mara's perceptual signature filters setting through her crisis-actor training ("real smoke," "authentic panic moved through a crowd like electricity"). Diction is purposeful and voice-consistent: "benevolently ruthless," "nomadic penumbra," "unbind completely from human memory." Dialogue with the colleague is natural and advances plot through subtext ("You're still performing" / "No...I perform the opposite"). Minor slip: "luminous absence" and "unbind" recur as authorial texture rather than strict POV lexicon, creating slight register elevation in peak beats. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, tightening during the chessboard epiphany and the forced-walking scenes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high in the chessboard and method-building passages. No paraphrase loops or template cadence in peak beats. Strong line: "The absence glowed in her mind" sets up the revelation economically. Minor overwriting in the final paragraph: "luminous absence" returns as charged motif but "unbind us from forgetting" and "quiet gestures that unbind" create a near-synonym loop within four lines, reducing sharpness at closure (−0.3). The phrase "small gestures refused to die. They walked themselves into permanence" also edges toward metaphor stack without full clarity. Grammar and sequencing are clean; no filter-verb stacks or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—crisis actor becomes archivist of micro-gestures during interregnum, using acoustic architecture to encode memory through choreographed walking—is specific and non-obvious. The chessboard frame (missing pawns as vanished people) transforms a familiar trope through embodied method (walking as inscription, resonance as storage). Risk-taking in structure (extended reflection + scene + coda) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending feels inevitable in hindsight given the setup. Minor deduction: "nomadic penumbra" and "unbind" occasionally lean toward decorative diction rather than fully earned necessity, and the interregnum-as-opportunity angle is less fresh than the walking-archive mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's dual identity (crisis actor / real survivor) frames the opening and closing, drives her recognition of absence at the chessboard ("she understood it immediately"), and enables her method (performance skill applied to documentation). The contrast appears in three beats: opening survival, chessboard epiphany, colleague conversation ("Before, I performed disasters. Now I perform the opposite"). Her choices—forcing repetitions, refusing to stop—trace directly to this background. Cost is visible: she renounces all other roles to perform this archive work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The chessboard appears in three beats: discovery/epiphany (triggers the project), method explanation to colleague (articulates meaning), and implicit presence in the closing image (the pawns' moves captured). Its specific property—missing all pawns while royalty remains—generates the central metaphor and constraint: she must document the vanished common pieces. The colleague scene explicitly ties closure back to the board ("showed him the chessboard, explained her project"). Removing it breaks the logic of why she documents gestures rather than grand events.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Nomadic penumbra" (shifting firelight from ruined city) appears in two beats: initial scene-setting and the penultimate paragraph ("nomadic penumbra shifted again outside"). It creates atmospheric constraint (unstable light, ongoing danger) and charges the "luminous absence" motif at closure. The concept shapes tone and setting but does not directly alter Mara's tactics—her work continues regardless of the firelight's movement. Lyric reprise reweights the thematic stake (absence as presence), lifting the score into mid-6s despite limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Benevolently ruthless" appears twice with visible cost: label introduction ("She was benevolently ruthless in her pursuit") and enacted choice ("She was cruel because she was kind"). The trait constrains her method in two beats: "making elderly survivors repeat their walks until the muscle memory emerged pure, making traumatized children trace their parents' final routes." This contradiction—forcing pain to preserve memory—drives her archival approach and forecloses gentler alternatives. The specific tradeoff (trauma now for permanence later) is on the page and shapes her stance at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Unbind" appears in three key moments: "gestures would otherwise unbind completely from human memory" (stakes), implicit in the forced repetitions (method to prevent unbinding), and "quiet gestures that unbind us from forgetting" (closure). The action defines both the threat (memory dissolution) and the solution (Mara's work prevents unbinding). Swapping for "dissolve" or "fade" would lose the specific conceptual link to binding memory into architecture. The term charges the final image by inverting its threat into a promise, though the final use edges toward over-articulation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Walking-as-inscription is signaled early (survivors walk memories), developed in method beats ("movements formed shapes—letters, almost" / "footsteps spelled names, dates, tiny moments"), enacted with specific direction ("Walk it again, but curve here"), and pays off at closure ("They walked themselves into permanence, one footstep at a time"). The method constrains her tactics (she must guide, repeat, force precision) and enables the resonance discovery ("footsteps in certain patterns created resonances"). Removing this exact mechanic would break the logic of how memory becomes architecture. The specificity (pattern → letter → resonance) is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The whispering gallery's acoustic properties enable and constrain every major beat: Mara discovers it fleeing looters, the curved walls carry whispers in loops (enabling survivor communication), the resonant dome learns footstep patterns ("vibrations that lingered"), and the architecture becomes the archive at closure. The setting supplies the unique resource (acoustic memory) that makes her project possible. The marble floor provides both the chessboard frame and the inscription surface. Spatial properties (30-meter sound travel, domed resonance) are handled in action, not description. This setting is indispensable; no other location could perform these functions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The interregnum (neither regime claims power) is signaled in the opening, creates the window of opportunity ("The interregnum stretched on. No government formed"), and enables Mara's work (official historians absent). Time pressure is implicit: "When someone finally takes power, they'll record battles and treaties"—her window will close. The timeframe constrains her urgency (must document before new regime arrives) and appears in three beats: opening survival, stretched middle, and the colleague's acknowledgment. The cost of working during chaos (nomadic survival, looter threats) is on the page. Not quite indispensable—the archive could function in other collapsed-state scenarios—but strongly integrated.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The desire to become "historian of small gestures" is dramatized at the chessboard ("That night...Mara began her work"), developed through concrete method (interviews, guided walks, forced repetitions), tested in friction ("She was cruel because she was kind"—the cost of thoroughness), and crystallizes at closure ("her truest role in recording not the grand collapses, but the quiet gestures"). The motivation drives all major choices and forecloses alternatives (she abandons other survival paths, refuses gentler documentation). The colleague scene articulates the shift from crisis actor to this specific role. Desire and cost interweave throughout, with visible trade-offs on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" appears three times: descriptor for nomadic penumbra (firelight as "luminous absence"), thematic phrase ("in the brightness of what was missing"), and implicit in the closing image (gestures preserved through their prior absence). Tone modulates with pressure: matter-of-fact survival opening, epiphanic at the chessboard, elegiac in method beats, crystallized-hopeful at closure. The phrase charges the final image by inverting loss into presence (absence made luminous through documentation). Coherent throughout, though the doubled use in the penultimate paragraph ("nomadic penumbra...luminous absence") slightly dilutes specificity. The tone reweights the dominant stake with undeniable pressure at closure.</comment>
