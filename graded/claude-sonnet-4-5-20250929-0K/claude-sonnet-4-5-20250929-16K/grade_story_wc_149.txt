<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior life remains largely abstract—we see her "learn to grow miracles" but never witness a contradictory impulse or specific micro-choice under pressure that reveals her values. The ghost bride is more atmosphere than agent; her guidance is told rather than dramatized through choices that force Elara into visible trade-offs. Emotional progression is smooth and upward without credible friction: Elara moves from solitude to "mournful elation" without on-page struggle or renunciation that forecloses a path. The carved stone bead and alchemical fruits function as props rather than constraints that shape her decisions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when arrive by ~120 words, so no penalty. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers atmosphere and revelation toward a final image of "mournful elation"—but the closure lacks visible cost: Elara's acceptance of her role is narrated ("she would learn to grow miracles") rather than shown through a decisive action or renunciation with felt consequences. The "debt repaid, lifetime by lifetime" is promised in the future tense, not enacted on the page. Cost proof test fails: no on-page sentence shows what Elara loses or forfeits in the final beat, triggering a −0.6 deduction in Q2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (silver apples that sing, plums that weep mercury, pears with phosphorescence), and the eternal night frames the entire atmosphere. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; no on-page choice hinges on a spatial constraint, tool availability, or object proximity. The carved stone bead is placed "at the greenhouse's heart" in the final beat, but this is a symbolic gesture rather than a tactical necessity that alters outcome. Without a choice-constraining role, Q3 caps at 8.8 per the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"learn to grow miracles" and "repay the debt"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows Elara's options; the ghost bride's guidance is accepted without friction or visible trade-off. The escalation is told ("The fruits grew more potent") rather than dramatized through a decision that forecloses a path or forces Elara to sacrifice something concrete. The story promises future action ("until the debt is repaid") but the pressure does not cohere or tighten on the page under the Accumulative lens, and no felt cost is visible in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of "resonant awakenings" and intergenerational devotion emerges from imagery (the carved stone bead, the luminous fruits) rather than direct statement, which is a strength. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic summary ("mournful elation had a taste") that leans toward label-speak rather than trusting the scene to carry meaning. The "debt repaid, lifetime by lifetime" is a coherent thematic anchor, but because the protagonist's arc lacks a decisive on-page turn with cost, the theme cannot fully reweight prior material. The ending gestures toward resonance without landing a non-literal answer to the central question through action or image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara throughout, with no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("cathedral of glass and twisted iron," "silk and arsenic") that fits the Gothic-alchemical atmosphere. However, perceptual signature is generic: Elara's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias or selectivity. The ghost bride's dialogue ("I have forgotten, but I remember love") leans toward aphorism rather than goal-driven subtext. Diction remains appropriately within the narrator's lexicon, but the voice lacks the distinct rhythmic control or compression under pressure that would elevate into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Opening and closing lines are imagistic and apt, but mid-story pacing suffers from paraphrase loops and summary scaffolding. "She had been alone here for three seasons" is functional exposition, but the next beat—"Then came the first appearance"—reads as template cadence. The phrase "mournful elation" appears in the final paragraph as a label rather than an embodied sensation, reducing immediacy. Several sentences restate content without adding pressure: "Each glimpse lasted only heartbeats" and "ephemeral cameo appearances" cover the same ground. Loop and scaffold issues trigger a −0.6 deduction in Q7, capping the category in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The Gothic-alchemical greenhouse and the ghost bride as teacher offer atmospheric appeal, but the premise—protagonist inherits magical garden and spectral mentor to fulfill intergenerational debt—closely matches widely used templates (mentor ghost, magical inheritance, debt repayment). The specific details (singing apples, mercury plums) are vivid, yet the emotional arc (solitude → guided purpose → acceptance) follows a predictable trajectory without a non-obvious turn. No fresh inflection or risk-taking heightens stakes; the story commits to its premise but does not transform it through lived friction or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The ashen-veil ghost bride appears in setup (first appearance between cherry trees), middle (pointing at diseased branch, gesturing at soil, speaking to explain the debt), and ending (fading after the conversation). She guides Elara's horticultural work and explains the cosmic stakes, but her appearances do not create a key turn where Elara must decide between competing paths. The bride's role is expository and atmospheric rather than a choice-forcing agent; swapping her for another spectral mentor would not structurally alter the arc. Three gates present but causal pressure is low, placing the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The carved stone bead is introduced early ("a single carved stone bead worn smooth by generations"), handled mid-story when Elara holds it to candlelight to discover the inscription "For the one who waited," and placed "at the greenhouse's heart" in the ending to anchor the bride's future appearances. It appears across three beats and its meaning evolves (heirloom → message vessel → anchor), satisfying all three gates. However, the bead does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off; its final placement is symbolic rather than tactically necessary. Early signal, beat involvement, and closure linkage support ~6.1, but lack of causal pressure and swappability (any heirloom object could serve) cap higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Resonant awakenings" is named explicitly in the ghost bride's dialogue ("a space between worlds where resonant awakenings can occur") and thematically present in Elara's learning, but it does not shape on-page tactics or force a decision with cost. The concept is invoked as explanation rather than enacted through choice; removing the phrase would not alter the plot. It appears in the middle third but remains ornamental, scoring in the low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Lovingly venomous" is applied to the ghost bride's voice ("Her voice carried the texture of silk and arsenic, lovingly venomous in its gentleness") but functions as descriptive color rather than a trait that enables or constrains action. The bride's guidance is gentle and supportive throughout; no on-page moment shows the "venomous" quality creating friction or cost. Label-only use without dramatized tradeoff trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The ghost action (ephemeral appearances, guidance, final conversation) is central to the story's atmosphere and exposition, appearing in setup, middle, and ending. The bride's presence enables Elara's learning and explains the debt, but the action is passive guidance rather than a decision catalyst that alters Elara's options with cost. The ghost could be replaced with a living mentor or a journal without major structural change. Beat involvement and closure linkage support mid-band, but swappability and lack of causal pressure cap the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Through ephemeral cameo appearances" is the method by which the ghost bride guides Elara, signaled early ("A flicker at the edge of vision") and sustained through the middle beats (pointing, gesturing) before the bride becomes "more solid" for the final conversation. The method shapes Elara's learning process but does not constrain her tactics or force a choice between options. It appears across multiple beats and is present at the ending, but its mechanics do not create pressure or cost, placing it in functional mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night is vividly established in the opening line, frames every scene, and appears in the ending as the site where Elara will "grow miracles." The eternal darkness is explained as a gift that creates "a space between worlds," and the greenhouse's unique properties (fruits with alchemical power) are integral to the premise. However, the setting does not constrain a specific on-page choice or alter tactics under pressure; it functions as atmospheric frame rather than tactical resource. All three gates present, strong specificity and closure linkage support ~6.9, but lack of choice-pressure caps higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Over the hush of winter-cracked fields" appears in the opening paragraph but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. "Three seasons" of solitude is mentioned, and the narrative unfolds over an unspecified period ("One frozen midnight"), but time does not create urgency or alter Elara's options. The element is present but ornamental, not a live clock that shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to repay a debt across lifetimes" is explained by the ghost bride mid-story and accepted by Elara in the ending ("The debt would be repaid, lifetime by lifetime"). It frames Elara's purpose and appears in setup (inherited garden), middle (debt explained), and ending (commitment affirmed). However, the motivation is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost; Elara accepts the role without on-page friction or renunciation. Setup, development, and payoff gates present, but lack of friction and told-only acceptance place it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Mournful elation" is invoked in the final paragraph ("Elara discovered that mournful elation had a taste") and the tone is coherent throughout—melancholy atmosphere (eternal night, ghost bride) layered with wonder (singing apples, luminous fruits). The tone modulates slightly as Elara moves from solitude to communion, but the final invocation is a label rather than an embodied sensation that charges the image. Coherence and modulation are present, but the ending's reliance on naming the tone rather than enacting it caps the score in mid-band.</comment>
