<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to preserve memory crystallizes clearly when she decides to tattoo her body with moonstone dust. The "spontaneously anchored" moment provides embodied emotional texture. However, the protagonist operates in near-total solitude with no on-page pressure from another character testing her resolve, and the exile choice itself occurs off-page. Internal contradiction is present (dancer seeking stillness within motion) but remains more philosophical than dramatically urgent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story delivers Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: Kael crystallizes her decision to become a living archive, and the final image of her dancing while inscribing memories carries conceptual cost (permanent marking, defiance that will provoke the Empress). Orientation anchors quickly (twilight garden, exiled tide dancer, post-nostalgia-ban). The accumulative lens holds—gathering moonstone dust, understanding the garden as chrysalis, choosing tattoo as archive—with one meaningful deepening when the speck touches her palm and her purpose clarifies. Cost is felt in the commitment to permanent bodily inscription and future confrontation, though the price remains more anticipated than paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The twilight garden functions as micro-setting that constrains Kael's practice space and provides the conditions for moonstone dust to appear. Sensory details—"starlight thickening like honey," silver fruit that never ripens, time pooling like quicksilver—are filtered through a dancer's perception of rhythm and gaps. The garden's perpetual dusk creates atmospheric pressure and the "chrysalis" image charges the transformation. Spatial choreography (hedges, trees, her movement patterns) remains coherent throughout and the environment enables the climactic choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Kael achieves perfect stillness and the moonstone speck appears. The accumulative lens governs: practice → observation of gaps → manifestation of dust → realization of purpose → beginning the tattoo work. One meaningful turn occurs when touching the speck anchors her and crystallizes her motivation to create a living archive. The cost is visible in her commitment to permanent bodily marking and future confrontation, though the Empress remains off-page and no immediate antagonistic pressure tests the choice in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory as resistance, the body as archive—emerges organically from the tide dancer's practice and the Empress's ban. The moonstone dust functions as earned ink rather than convenient symbol, growing from the dance tradition's lore. "The tide pulled at her blood. The stars witnessed. And in the gaps between everything, memory burned eternal" offers resonant closure without moralizing. The final image of inscribing her grandmother's name makes the thematic question concrete: what survives when authority forbids remembering? Subtext operates through the dance vocabulary and the contrast between the Empress's erasure and Kael's embodied preservation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature reflects a dancer's attention: "gaps between movements," "lunar gravity," "obsidian grace." Diction occasionally elevates ("chrysalis," "fledge," "mortal skin") but remains largely voice-consistent for a ritual practitioner. Some filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood," "she knew") dull immediacy in key beats: "she felt spontaneously anchored" tells the physical sensation rather than dramatizing it through action. Purposeful compression in the accumulative structure is legible and serves the lyric design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. Minor issues: "She had been the capital's most skilled tide dancer" front-loads exposition that could anchor through action; "She began with her grandmother's name, pressing the luminous dust into her forearm" summarizes the pivotal tattooing act rather than dwelling in its texture. Template stems appear: "She danced her history," "She stilled completely," "She began with." "Moonstone cabochon dust speck" repeats the full phrase when "speck" or "dust" would suffice. These artifacts remain above the threshold for meaningful penalty but prevent entry to higher bands. No paraphrase loops or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The body-as-archive concept offers a fresh synthesis of memory prohibition and physical inscription. The tide dancer profession and "gaps between movements" provide specific grounding. However, the exile-to-magical-garden frame and the quest for transformative object follow familiar fantasy templates. The tattoo decision feels inevitable in hindsight, but the Empress remains abstract and the nostalgia ban's mechanics are under-explored on the page. Risk-taking in the accumulative, dance-focused structure adds distinction, yet the piece does not fully escape its template origin.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kael's tide-dancer skill shapes her method (observing gaps in movement), enables the moonstone dust manifestation (achieved through perfect stillness within motion), and informs her final choice (using her body as living archive). Present in setup, drives the middle discovery beat, and her dancing continues at closure while inscribing. The skill is causally necessary: only a tide dancer could access lunar gravity in this way and achieve the required state.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The moonstone cabochon dust speck appears when Kael achieves perfect stillness (~mid-story), touches her palm and "anchors" her (physical and conceptual shift), then serves as pigment for the tattoo work at closure. Present across three beats with escalating function: manifestation, realization trigger, and archive medium. Its luminous, cosmic-ink properties are irreplaceable—no other substance could inscribe memory this way. Causal pressure is strong and it directly shapes the ending action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elective exile frames Kael's situation from the opening and explains her presence in the twilight garden. It shapes her stakes (she chose this over surrendering memories) and her isolation enables the introspective practice. The concept recurs when she understands she "had not merely fled to exile—she had come here to fledge." However, the exile itself is backstory; the on-page action is the transformation within exile rather than the choice to leave. Functional but not indispensable to the structure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Spontaneously anchored" describes the physical-spiritual effect when the moonstone speck touches Kael's palm: "invisible roots had driven through her feet into something deeper than earth." This moment crystallizes her motivation and enables the tattoo decision. Present in one key beat with visible consequence (shift from seeking to enacting). The attribute is somewhat ornamental—the story could function with "suddenly grounded" or "rooted"—but the precision adds thematic charge and the effect alters her stance with cost (permanent commitment).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Fledge" (to shed old form and emerge transformed) is introduced when Kael realizes "she had come here to fledge, to shed her old form and emerge as something necessary." This realization drives her decision to become a living archive. Present in the final third, it reframes her exile as metamorphosis and charges the closure choice. The metaphor is replaceable (transformation, rebirth, emergence could substitute), but it resonates with the chrysalis image and her dancer identity. Shapes one key turn but lacks earlier setup or middle-beat pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Observing gaps" is signaled early ("practiced her art by observing gaps—the spaces between movements, between breaths, between one moment and the next") and becomes the method for summoning the moonstone dust: "in the pause between raising her arm and the moment before descent—she saw it." The technique is dance-specific and causally necessary; stillness within motion creates the conditions for the speck to appear. Present in setup and decisive at the manifestation beat. The method shapes her attempt and success, though it does not reappear explicitly at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The twilight garden provides the space where "reality grew thin," enables Kael's practice away from the Empress's reach, and supplies the conditions (perpetual dusk, starlight, temporal fluidity) for moonstone dust to manifest. The garden "responded, starlight thickening like honey" during her dance. It functions as chrysalis, signaling transformation. Present in setup, pressures the middle discovery beat by responding to her movement, and remains the stage for closure. Environment constrains (only here can she achieve this state) and enables (the garden's properties allow the dust to appear).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The nostalgia ban occurred "three seasons past" and frames the inciting exile, establishing the Empress's threat and Kael's stakes. "Dawn would eventually come to the garden—she felt it in the way the stars had begun to pulse with urgency" introduces mild time pressure at the end. However, the timeframe operates more as static backstory than live constraint; the three-season gap is noted but does not tighten on-page decisions. The dawn urgency is present but does not alter her tactics or pace. Functional context but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin" crystallizes as Kael's goal when the moonstone dust touches her palm: "Her body would become the forbidden record...a living archive the Empress could not burn." This motivation drives the climactic action (tattooing her grandmother's name and memories). Present in the final third, it transforms prior seeking into decisive enactment with visible cost (permanent marking, future confrontation). The phrasing is specific and irreplaceable—no generic "preserve memory" substitutes the embodied, defiant poetry of inscription. Shapes closure with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Obsidian grace—hard, reflective, beautiful in their severity" describes Kael's movement quality during the dance sequence. The tone of controlled, austere beauty permeates the prose: "perpetual dusk," "starlit hedges," "moonstone...luminous and impossibly small." Diction remains elevated and precise throughout. The tone coheres across setup and middle beats but does not modulate strongly under pressure or charge the final image in a distinct way; the ending maintains the same lyric register without intensification. Present and consistent but does not transform at closure.</comment>
