<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and specific—"patient attention to what objects whispered" establishes her perceptual mode early. The psychometry readings embody her way of knowing rather than remaining abstract labels. The final renunciation (leaving the compass) feels earned by her shift from commodification to preservation of mystery, with visible cost in forgoing collection. Minor: her uncle's thirst and her own seek-mystery arc run parallel without enough friction to create contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara relinquishes the compass and accepts mystery as irreducible, foreclosing her prior extraction mode with visible cost (she collects but refuses synthesis). The accumulative lens is signaled early through sensory collection and holds through the lagoon sequence to the final image of the compass as offering. Causality is clean: compass → cliffs → lagoon → psychometry → collect/renounce. One tightening occurs when she realizes the scent "resisted capture," shifting her goal mid-sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The subterranean lagoon constrains Mara's collection method—she cannot bottle conventional petrichor and must adapt to "condensation of earth's own breath." The narrow entrance, weeping stone, and interference patterns are filtered through her professional lens (molecular chains, synthesis). The compass and seven vials function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (crack, shore, perimeter, passage out). Minor: the factory and cliffs above receive summary treatment without sensory anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding "fragrances that defied commodification"—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the lagoon offers a scent that "resisted capture." The compass pull creates spatial pressure; the psychometry reading deepens understanding of her uncle's thirst, raising the question of whether to collect or preserve. The resolution (collecting yet leaving the compass) narrows her options with visible cost: she forgoes synthesis and future visits will be pilgrimage, not extraction. One meaningful turn when she shifts from collector to pilgrim.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—mystery as irreducible—emerges through concrete action: Mara moves from "reduced mystery to formula" at the factory to sealing vials of what cannot be synthesized, then leaving the compass as offering. The "hinged awakening" motif (wonder → limits of wonder → beyond) structures her realization without meta-commentary. The final image of stone tears and patient singing answers the thirst question non-literally. The seven vials and compass return charged with thematic weight. No overt moralizing; the ending reweights prior material (factory commodification vs. cathedral preservation) with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "sensibly eccentric," "psychometry reading came unbidden," "cathedral-sized absences" establish a formal-yet-particular register consistent with a chemist-turned-collector. Perceptual signature is chemist-inflected (molecular chains, synthesis, mineral moisture). POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("resonant hush," "irreducible") but remains within Mara's plausible lexicon given her scientific background. Psychic distance is consistent. Free indirect thought is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift purposefully. Information density is high—most lines do double duty (e.g., "thirst, limestone dust, the electric anticipation" conveys setting, uncle's state, and compass history in one beat). Minor issues: "She understood why her uncle had come here—this was a place where explanations failed" is a scaffold explaining what the prior image already showed. "Resonant hush" repeats verbatim three times without reweighting. One paraphrase loop: "precious and irreducible as the scent of stone tears, as the memory of thirst" recycles the same idea. Small deductions keep it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of petrichor collector + psychometry + hinged awakenings + subterranean lagoon feels earned rather than assembled from a prompt checklist. The turn from commodification to preservation offers a non-obvious angle on collector narratives. Specific detail (vials, limestone weeping, interference patterns) grounds the abstraction. Risk: the piece leans into lyric compression and philosophical register without obscuring clarity. Minor: "hinged awakening" as a formal concept risks abstraction; the three-stage articulation (wonder, limits, beyond) borders on thesis statement but is saved by being filtered through the uncle's memory rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout. Setup: introduced as petrichor collector in paragraph one. Development: her choice to follow the compass, perform psychometry, and collect air shapes the middle sequence. Payoff: her decision to leave the compass and shift from extraction to pilgrimage closes the story. Causal pressure: her collector identity drives her to the lagoon and her realization constrains her final action (collect but do not synthesize, leave compass as offering). Specificity: her chemist background and psychometry skill are irreplaceable; a generic seeker would not bottle air or read object memories. Two distinct beats (arrive/collect, renounce compass) plus closure linkage. Cost: she forgoes synthesis and future commodification, foreclosing her prior mode with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: arrives paragraph three. Development: compass delivers psychometry reading of uncle's thirst and pulls Mara northward (two beats). Payoff: she leaves it as offering for "the next collector." Causal pressure: compass enables the journey and uncle's memory, but Mara could have found the lagoon through other means (map, rumor). Swappability: a letter or journal entry could deliver the uncle's thirst and location with minor edits. The compass does not constrain a middle choice under pressure—it is consulted once, then set down. Closure linkage is present but the element is more lyric reprise than causal lever. Mid-band: functional across beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "hinged awakening" appears in the psychometry reading (paragraph following lagoon entrance). Development: the concept structures Mara's realization (wonder → limits → beyond) but does not constrain an on-page choice; it is reflected upon rather than enacted as a tactical decision. Payoff: the final paragraph echoes "hinged awakening that would unfold within her," but this is thematic summary rather than a visible consequence. The concept reweights the story's meaning (her shift from formula to mystery), but it does not alter her options in scene. Mid-band: shapes one turn (the realization) and contributes to closure resonance, but could be implicit rather than named without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: "sensibly eccentric" is a label in paragraph two with no on-page demonstration. Development: no choice visibly traces to this trait; Mara's actions (follow compass, collect air) could be performed by any dedicated collector. Payoff: absent from the ending. The trait is asserted by colleagues' consensus rather than embodied in contradictory impulses or specific quirks. No visible tradeoff or cost tied to eccentricity. Low-functional: present as character background but ornamental to the plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: "delve" appears when Mara enters the crack (paragraph before lagoon reveal). Development: the physical act of delving through the narrow passage constrains her movement ("sideways, her pack catching") and the verb recurs when she prepares to "delve back through the narrow passage." Payoff: the final image contrasts surface ("the world would demand reasons") with below ("the places where explanations bowed"), anchoring the delve as both physical and metaphorical action. Causal pressure: the delve is the threshold that must be crossed to reach the lagoon; without it, no collection or renunciation occurs. Specificity: the narrow crack and physical effort are irreplaceable details. High integration: shapes two beats and closure metaphor with felt cost (physical difficulty, leaving surface world).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: mentioned as established skill in paragraph five ("learned psychometry the way others learned to taste wine"). Development: Mara performs two readings—first when touching the compass (paragraph four), second "properly" at the lagoon shore (paragraph following lagoon description). The second reading reveals the uncle's hinged-awakening insight, which reframes her goal. Payoff: psychometry does not appear in or shape the final image; the compass is left, but the reading skill itself is absent. Causal pressure: the method enables the uncle's memory to reach Mara, which shifts her understanding, but she could have learned the same lesson through direct observation of the lagoon. Swappability: a journal or inscription could replace the readings with minor edits. Mid-band: functional in two beats but not indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: "subterranean lagoon beneath limestone cliffs" is named in paragraph six (quarries/cliffs) and seven (lagoon interior). Development: the lagoon's properties constrain Mara's collection method—no conventional rain, only stone weeping and mineral moisture—forcing her to adapt her technique. The "weeping stone," interference patterns, and narrow entrance shape her physical and conceptual choices. Payoff: the lagoon's "resonant hush" and patient water-against-rock charge the final image; leaving the compass "beside the lagoon" makes the setting the repository of future pilgrimage. Causal pressure: the lagoon's unique scent (time dissolving limestone, stone patience) is irreplaceable; no other setting could offer "the fragrance of waiting." High integration: shapes collection tactic, middle realization, and closure metaphor with undeniable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setup: "after the plant closed" and "three weeks after her last shift" anchor the timeframe in paragraphs one and three. Development: the factory shutdown creates the opening for Mara to seek non-commodified scents, motivating the quest. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions during the lagoon sequence—Mara faces no clock, deadline, or urgency. Payoff: the contrast between factory past and lagoon present structures the thematic closure, but elapsed time within the lagoon visit is untracked. Causal pressure: the "after" motivates departure but does not constrain tactics. Mid-band: shapes the inciting situation and thematic before/after but does not function as a live pressure during peak beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: "seeking fragrances that defied commodification" (paragraph one) and the uncle's search for "something unmappable" (paragraph six) establish the motivation. Development: Mara's realization that the cavern scent "resisted capture" forces a choice—bottle anyway or preserve mystery—creating on-page friction between professional habit (collect, synthesize) and the new desire (let mystery remain intact). Payoff: the final action (sealing vials yet leaving the compass, accepting pilgrimage over visitation) enacts the motivation with visible cost (she forgoes synthesis, future extraction). Causal pressure: the motivation drives two key choices (collect the air, leave the compass). Specificity: "where explanations fail" is embodied in the lagoon's irreducible scent and the hinged-awakening concept. High-mid band: drives beats and ending with felt cost, though the friction could be sharper if Mara's prior extraction habit created more on-page resistance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "resonant hush" is named when Mara enters the lagoon (paragraph eight). Development: the tone recurs through "metronomic patience," "patient weeping of stone," "stubborn faith," modulating from wonder to contemplation as pressure deepens. Payoff: the final image ("the pure, patient singing of water against ancient rock" and "resonant hush" reprise in the penultimate paragraph) charges closure with the same quiet intensity, contrasting "the world would demand reasons" above. Coherence: the tone holds through all turns without rupture; Mara's internal register (formal, reflective) matches the setting's stillness. The hush is not static—it accumulates weight as Mara moves from observation to collection to renunciation. High-mid band: tone modulates with pressure and charges the final image, though one could argue it risks flattening urgency in favor of consistent lyricism.</comment>
