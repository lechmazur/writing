<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and driven by contradictory impulses—obsession with the oracle's work versus the pull of her abandoned merchant life. The progression from discovery through isolation to understanding is earned through embodied micro-choices (pressing against the wall, marking the star's fade, taking up the stylus). Her final choice to continue the work reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost (forsaking family, accepting darkness). Minor: the "mildly obsessed" framing slightly hedges what the actions demonstrate fully.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren commits to mapping the endless night with the star's final vanishing as the pivot that forecloses return. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—the ambered hush deepens through sensory layering until the final beat reweights her stance from student to cartographer. Orientation anchors early (ridge fort, eastern wall, star-watching). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes she's standing inside the map itself, which crystallizes her choice with conceptual cost (navigating starless dark forever).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ridge fort constrains choice throughout: ancient stones, gap in battlements, remaining door, central hearth all shape her movements and frame her vigil. The booklet functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charging the final image when she adds her entry. The ambered hush operates as atmospheric texture that becomes navigational tool—environment as phenomenological map. Sensory detail (wind clawing cracks, gold leaf crumbling, marbled quietude) is selective and POV-filtered, building density without catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the oracle's final silence to navigate the coming darkness—signals early and tightens through one meaningful deepening: the realization that the hush itself is the map. Agency reads as attention and endurance that forecloses normalcy; Maren's choice to continue the work after the star vanishes commits her to isolation with visible cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens as sensory density increases ("anticipation crystallized," "fear made tangible") until the final beat reweights her relationship to darkness from terror to navigation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: silence as cartography, absence speaking as loudly as presence, preservation in amber. The booklet's compression of silences into essential truths seeds the thematic question early; Maren's final entry answers it non-literally by embodying the method (summarizing the ambered hush to guide future navigators). No moralizing; the ending offers experiential wisdom earned through her vigil. The marbled-hush motif recurs with shifted meaning, charging the closure without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady throughout with controlled psychic distance and distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices texture of silence, gold leaf shimmer, wind as storyteller. Diction remains consistent—elevated but character-specific ("pebble-shore oracle," "flaking gold leaf," "ambered hush")—and modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter syntax as star vanishes: "The star flickered once more and vanished"). No head-hopping. The prose rhythm reflects her contemplative focus, slowing for reflection and tightening at the pivot. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood") appear but serve the introspective mode without dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level control is strong: varied sentence openings, purposeful rhythm ("Another blast... Another gale"), high information density with most lines doing double work (setting + character state). Minor scaffold appears in the oracle's backstory paragraph with slight paraphrase loop ("listening to the spaces... the hush... the quiet"). The "summarizing silence" conceit risks abstraction but stays grounded through concrete examples (child's cry, predator's passing, snow falling). No major loops or template cadence runs; figurative language (amber, marble, veins in stone) remains coherent and controlled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—mapping darkness through qualities of silence—offers a fresh synthesis of apocalypse narrative and phenomenological observation. The oracle as eccentric hermit recording silences avoids stock mystic tropes through specificity (driftwood shelter, pebble-shore, decades of wave-listening). Risk-taking in the conceptual pivot (map as experiential rather than literal) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend entirely on this particular method and character obsession. Minor: the "stars dying" frame edges toward familiar last-light territory, though the silence-as-navigation angle freshens it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Present in setup (oracle's death, booklet discovery six months prior) and seeds the method, but creates no on-page turn. The oracle's work motivates Maren but the character herself remains off-page throughout; all pressure comes from Maren's interpretation. Functional but easily replaceable with "found journal" or similar device.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Appears in three distinct beats: discovery moment (backstory anchor), study session at hearth (re-reading entries), final beat (Maren adds her own entry with stylus). The crumbling gold leaf operates as both constraint (fragility) and motif (preservation). Removal would eliminate the causal link between oracle's method and Maren's continuation. The booklet's physical decay mirrors the fading star, charging the final image with thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Seeds early ("ambered hush" in oracle's final entry), shapes middle understanding (Maren feels its texture as "thick and golden"), and defines the closure pivot (standing inside the map). The concept narrows options: only by learning to read this specific silence can she navigate. Visible cost: accepting that navigation now depends on phenomenological skill rather than visible landmarks. Essential to both the method and the final stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Signaled clearly ("mildly obsessed") and demonstrated through action: abandoning caravan, taking residence in ruin, marking star's fade for three days. The trait enables her vigil but "mildly" slightly undercuts the totality shown on-page (she's left her family, accepted isolation). Constrains one major choice (staying through star's death) with opportunity cost visible. Functional across beats but the modifier hedges what actions prove fully.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Appears in three forms: oracle retold silences into booklet entries (backstory anchor), Maren retells oracle's work in her own understanding (middle study beat), Maren retells the ambered hush in her final entry. The method drives the closure—her ability to retell/summarize the new silence becomes the navigation tool. Swapping "retell" for "record" or "transcribe" would lose the synthesis and interpretation emphasis that charges her final stance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Method signaled early (oracle "summarizing silence in delicate script"), mechanics demonstrated through examples (child's cry = anticipation crystallized), and executed at closure when Maren writes her own summary. The compression conceit—distilling silence into essential truth—shapes her approach throughout. Visible at two beats (study, final entry) with the mechanics mattering: only by summarizing can the map exist for future navigators.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fort provides constraint throughout: ancient stones groan, battlements offer star-viewing gap, central hearth anchors fire-building, door rattles. The "storm-tossed" aspect supplies persistent weather pressure that Maren works against. Setting enables her isolation and frames her vigil spatially. The ridge position (above gray beach where oracle lived) creates vertical relationship that matters thematically. Micro-setting (gap in battlements) becomes observation post essential to tracking the star.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Timeframe seeds immediately ("Only one star remained visible now") and creates urgency: Maren has been watching it fade for three days, marking its retreat. The star's weakening pulse in middle beats tightens decision window. Final vanishing triggers closure—darkness arrival forces her method into practice with no further delay. Time pressure is live and visible; the "when" directly alters tactics (must complete understanding before full dark) and charges cost (navigating endless night is now, not theoretical).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Desire stated clearly ("determined to understand," map the endless night) and friction shown: she's abandoned merchant family, isolated herself, accepted obsession despite uncertainty ("couldn't explain her certainty"). The motivation drives two major beats (study, final commitment) and the cost is visible—she chooses continuation over return when star vanishes. Want versus need operates subtly: wanting to understand versus needing to guide future navigators. Final choice embodies the motivation with visible price (permanent darkness accepted).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tone established early ("ambered hush," "marbled quietude") and held through turns: contemplative, textured, phenomenological focus maintained even as star dies. Modulates appropriately—lengthens in reflective beats, tightens slightly at star's vanishing without breaking the hush. The marbled/amber diction recurs purposefully, charging the final image ("sat in her marbled hush") where tone becomes method. Coherent pressure: quietude intensifies rather than dissipates as darkness arrives, making tone inseparable from stakes.</comment>
