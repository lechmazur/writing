<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The weaver's interiority is richly textured with embodied perception ("layers of silence stacked upon silence"), but her motivation remains abstract throughout—collecting burden-weights never generates internal conflict or a micro-choice that forecloses a path. The final "understanding" that she is boundary-lessly trapped arrives as epiphany rather than earned compression of contradictory impulses acting in scene. No meaningful change or renunciation with visible cost occurs; she simply continues the work tomorrow. The protagonist observes and comprehends but never decides under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece orients who/where/when by ~120 words and accumulates density through layered images (calcified weight, coral patterns, fractal threads). However, the closure unit—"understanding that some traps were also sanctuaries"—is a thematic realization delivered via summary rather than a decisive image or reconfiguration that reweights prior material with on-page cost. The weaver's stance does not crystallize through action or refusal; she extinguishes the lamp and sits, then plans to continue tomorrow. Cost is conceptual but not legible in the final beat; no tactic or option visibly forecloses. Oriented properly but closure lacks the decisive pressure or felt cost required for higher bands under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bronze grotto is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail ("oxidized glory," "geometric shadows," "shingled hush") that filters through the weaver's perceptual lens. The lamp burner's cracked chimney and the calcified weights constrain her method across multiple beats. However, the environment does not force a choice or alter her final stance; it remains a rich backdrop rather than a tactical pressure. The body and tools are present but do not charge the closure image in a way that forecloses options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collecting burden-weights—is signaled early but never tightens into a dilemma or trade-off. The weaver encounters a weight "so old it had merged with the bronze itself," which deepens thematic texture but does not escalate pressure or narrow her options. She realizes the weights form "a single vast tapestry," yet this insight prompts no renunciation, endurance with cost, or decision that forecloses a path. The piece accumulates density without a meaningful turn or crystallization of stance under pressure. No visible price alters her tactics or the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the weaver's work and the fractal imagery: infinite burdens, traps as sanctuaries, endless responsibility. The final realization—"some traps were also sanctuaries, and some burdens were also purposes"—offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, it arrives as an articulated thesis rather than a charged image that reweights prior material. The closing line ("calcified memories of pain transformed by attention into something almost like grace") is evocative but edges toward thematic summary. No prominent counter-reading complicates the moral calculus; the piece settles into a single, tidy wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable, third-limited, with a distinct perceptual signature ("shingled hush," "whalebone reverie") and purposeful compression that teaches its lyric pattern early. Diction is elevated and internally consistent, matching the contemplative register. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. One minor slip: "the fractal weaver understood then" at the climax is a filter construction that slightly distances the epiphany rather than immersing us in embodied realization. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the voice is singular and voice-motivated throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied and image-rich, with strong specificity ("kerosene lamp burner, its glass chimney cracked in a pattern that reminded her of branching tributaries"). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent. Two friction points: "shingled hush—layers of silence stacked upon silence, each one slightly different from the last, creating a quietness so profound it became almost audible" is a minor paraphrase loop explaining the coinage in the same breath. The phrase "boundary-lessly trapped" is used twice with identical framing ("trapped... but by"), creating template cadence. Information density is generally high, but the closure paragraph leans toward summary ("understood then why," "some traps were also sanctuaries") rather than propulsive image. No major artifacts touch the final beat, but cumulative minor issues prevent entry to high bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—collecting the weights of burdens in a bronze grotto using lamplight—is specific and offers fresh synthesis of allegory, sensory detail, and character role. The fractal-weaver title and "orienting properly" method are non-obvious. However, the emotional arc and thematic resolution follow a familiar template: isolated artisan discovers her endless task is both trap and purpose, achieving acceptance without transformation. The final wisdom ("some traps were also sanctuaries") is earnest but edges toward platitude. Risk-taking in imagery and structure is present but does not extend to the protagonist's ultimate stance, which settles safely into contemplative equilibrium. Transformation test: swap "burden-weights" for "lost names" or "forgotten songs" and the arc holds unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The fractal weaver is present throughout and performs the central action (collecting burden-weights by orienting the lamp). However, she makes no key decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her "understanding" at the climax is a realization, not a choice. She continues the work tomorrow with no visible cost or change in stance. Observation without agency trends low under the integration rubric.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The kerosene lamp burner appears in the opening, is used methodically at multiple alcoves ("orienting the lamp burner properly at each station," "oriented the lamp burner again and again"), and is extinguished at the closure beat. Its cracked chimney filters light to reveal fractal patterns, shaping the weaver's method. The burner is handled across at least three beats and participates in the ending. However, its properties do not constrain a dilemma or charge the final image with reweighted meaning; it remains a tool rather than a stake-shifter. Setup + development + closure participation present, with beat involvement and specificity, but no causal pressure on choice or visible cost tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Shingled hush" is coined early, defined vividly ("layers of silence stacked upon silence"), and reprised at closure ("the bronze grotto sang its shingled hush"). The concept shapes atmosphere and the weaver's perceptual lens. However, it does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics; it functions as thematic texture rather than a stake or pressure. Lyric reprise reweights tone but not plot. Early signal + closure reprise meet two gates, but lack of causal pressure or cost connection caps the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Boundary-lessly trapped" is introduced at the story's center, defined with specificity ("trapped... by the nature of the task itself, which had no edges"), and reprised in the climactic realization ("understood then why she was boundary-lessly trapped"). The attribute shapes the weaver's understanding of her role and charges the final thematic claim. However, it does not constrain a micro-choice with visible cost or enable a tactic under pressure; it remains a thematic label. Setup in second third (−0.3), development as thematic frame, closure participation via epiphany. No on-page cost tied directly to the trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Calcify" appears early when the weaver finds "a weight that had calcified over decades... hardening into something resembling coral." The verb is specific and irreplaceable, shaping the story's central image vocabulary. At closure, the weights are described as "calcified memories of pain transformed by attention into something almost like grace." The action defines the nature of the burdens and returns with reweighted meaning in the final line. However, it does not drive a turn or constrain a choice; the weaver does not act on or struggle with calcification itself. Early signal + closure reprise, charged specificity, but no beat involvement beyond description. Lyric integration reaches mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"By orienting properly" is the weaver's explicit method, signaled early ("orienting the lamp burner properly at each station") and repeated across beats ("she oriented the lamp burner again and again," "oriented it with infinite care"). The method's mechanics matter: "the burner's wick hole had to face the direction from which the burden-weight had entered." However, the method does not face resistance, fail, or force a trade-off; it simply works each time. Setup + development across multiple beats, but no cost or constraint that alters tactics. Functional use without pressure trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bronze grotto is anchored early with vivid, specific detail ("bronze met bone," "oxidized glory," "geometric shadows") and provides spatial structure for the weaver's descent through alcoves to "the grotto's deepest point." Starlight filters through the mouth, marking time. The setting is irreplaceable and immersive. However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; the weaver moves freely without environmental pressure. Setup + development + closure participation (she sits in the grotto at the end), strong specificity, but no causal pressure on tactics. Micro-setting (body/lamp) contributes more than the larger space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the first snowmelt" anchors the opening and is reprised at closure ("the first snowmelt continued its patient work"). The timeframe evokes seasonal transition and the flow of rivulets, contributing to atmosphere. However, it does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or track progression within the scene. The weaver's work spans "hours" but no clock pressure alters her tactics. Lyric reprise without causal force trends low-mid.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To collect the weights of different burdens" is the weaver's stated motivation, introduced early and dramatized through her actions at multiple alcoves. The motivation is specific and drives her descent into the grotto. However, it is never conflicted or tested; she encounters no obstacle, trade-off, or cost that challenges her desire to collect. The climactic realization redefines the task (weights form "a single vast tapestry") but does not force a choice between collecting and stopping. Setup + development + closure link, but no friction between want and cost. Told and shown, but not pressured.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Whalebone reverie" is coined explicitly ("there was strange beauty in this endless task, a whalebone reverie that sustained her") and modulates the tone toward contemplative, immersive stillness. The coinage is specific and voice-consistent. However, tone does not shift under pressure or charge the final image with new valence; the reverie remains static from mid-story to closure. The phrase is ornamental rather than active. Single-use coinage without progression trends mid-band; it colors but does not constrain or reweight.</comment>
