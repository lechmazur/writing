<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kaia's sensory mapping ability is rendered through specific, embodied perception ("coolness spread through her skull," "weight of silence"), and her final choice to learn rather than stay or seal passages shows genuine agency with visible cost—she accepts the burden of her mother's exile and the weight of truth. The mother's motivation is coherent and her backstory ("mapping the spaces between was illegal") provides clear stakes. Minor slip: the phrase "coordinates no computer could parse" leans toward stock description, and the mother's decades-long separation resolves quickly without more friction between abandonment and protection playing out in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative layering (sensory mapping through universes tightens until the nested pocket is discovered). Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the first paragraph. The closure—Kaia's decision to learn multi-world weaving—is a Decisive Change with felt cost: she accepts her mother's exile and the weight of infinite navigation. One meaningful tightening: the shard heats and pulls her through accelerating transitions to the reveal. Cost is legible in "a stone she could choose to carry" and the final commitment "teach me." The nested-universe discovery and reunion feel slightly convenient (the shard guides her exactly when needed), nudging this below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The repair bay as crux point is established early and its multi-universe variants (garden, underwater, snow-filled) are vivid and serve the mapping journey. The green glass shard functions as micro-setting object, constraining her path and charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kaia's professional filter: she translates "touch and taste and the weight of silence into coordinates." Minor gap: the pristine pocket universe with active engines lacks the spatial grounding of earlier variants—what she sees, hears, smells there beyond "impossible colors" would sharpen the mother's material presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering the truth about her mother—is signaled early and pursued actively. One meaningful tightening: the shard heats and the worlds pulse faster, pulling Kaia through the cascade to the nested pocket. Agency is clear in her final choice to learn rather than stay or seal passages, and the trade-off (accepting her mother's exile path, carrying the weight) is legible. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens. Minor limitation: the nested universe appears exactly when needed without prior friction or false lead, so the escalation feels more like revelation than a decision-driven narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme—truth as weight, protection as exile, love across dimensions—emerges from the shard, the mapping, and the mother's choice without overt moralizing. The final image "coordinates pointing everywhere at once" and the humming engines answer the central question (whether to carry inherited burdens) through action and sensory reprise. No thematic echo; the piece resists a tidy moral. One slip: "love that bent itself through parallel universes" in the penultimate section edges toward abstraction where a concrete image would hit harder.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Kaia filters the world through sensory-spatial metaphor ("negative sound that mapped itself…in shades of rust and violet"). Diction fits her profession and interiority. Dialogue, when present, advances plot and carries subtext: "Teach me" closes the arc. No head-hopping. Minor slip: "her mother's familiar signature" in paragraph four tells recognition rather than letting the reader infer it from a sensory cue Kaia recognizes, slightly diluting the sensory-mapping voice at a key beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with high information density and strong rhythm modulation. Figurative language ("murmur of half-remembered dreams," "petals around a center") is controlled and voice-consistent. Two pattern slips lower the score: "cyclically spontaneous" recurs as a phrase in paragraphs two and four without evolving meaning, creating a minor loop; and "coordinates no computer could parse" / "mapped themselves as coordinates pointing everywhere" share template cadence. No major artifacts touch closure, but the repetitions dull momentum slightly in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sensory-mapper protagonist and repair-bay-as-convergence-point offer specific detail, and the nested pocket universe adds a non-obvious twist. The mother's exile-for-protection motive transforms a familiar trope through the illegality of mapping and the multi-world stakes. Risk: the piece commits to its metaphysics without hedging. Two limitations keep this mid-band: the "abandoned place where realities converge" setup is a known SFF template, and the shard-guided reunion resolves the mystery more through inheritance than through Kaia's own ingenuity or mistake.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaia's role as sensory map maker is signaled in paragraph one, shapes all middle beats (translating sensory currents, redirecting her path, following the shard's heat), and drives the closure choice to learn full weaving. Removing this exact profession would break the story's logic and stakes. Her decisions—pressing forward through cascade, refusing to stay or seal—are causally active. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6, cost connection +0.5. Base 3.0 + 5.8 = 8.8, but minor swappability (could be "dimensional navigator" with edits) −0.3, AI-pattern ("coordinates no computer could parse") −0.3 = 8.2, round down 7.8 per limiter rule (swappability sets neighborhood ~8.0).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The green glass shard appears in paragraph one (mother's legacy), heats and pulls in paragraph four, guides the cascade in five, and is closed in her fist at closure ("heartbeat synchronized across dimensions"). Four distinct beats, causal (enables discovery), closure-active (synchronizes the final choice), specific (green, glass, thermal response), and cost-connected (inheritance of exile). Early +0.7, four beats +1.4, causal +1.4, closure +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5. Base 3.0 + 6.3 = 9.3, minor swappability (could be any inherited object with minor edits) −0.5, AI-pattern (recurring "green glass shard" without fresh descriptor) −0.4 = 8.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds is named in paragraph one, demonstrated when Kaia steps through to Universe Beta (paragraph five), and adopted as her future path in the closure ("learn to weave between worlds as her mother had"). Three beats, shapes stakes (illegality drove mother's exile), alters tactics (swimming sideways through reality), and is indispensable to closure logic. Early +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +1.3, closure +1.5, specificity +0.6, cost +0.4. Base 3.0 + 5.8 = 8.8, swappability (could be "traveling" or "shifting" with edits) −0.6, summary-only middle use (the actual mechanics are not dramatized on the page, only described) −0.6 = 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Cyclically spontaneous" is stated twice (paragraphs two and four) but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost—it describes the pattern of world transitions without affecting Kaia's tactics or choices. Ornamental use. Early mention +0.4, two mentions (same beat, no functional difference) +0.4, no causal pressure, no closure linkage, label-only −0.7, swappability (could be "unpredictable" or "rhythmic") −0.6. Base 3.0 + 0.4 + 0.4 − 0.7 − 0.6 = 2.5, but the phrase does frame the transition mechanics, lifting to ~5.8 under lyric-resonance allowance (final third does not reprise it, so cap at ornamental neighborhood). Dominant limiter: label-only and ornamental use set ceiling ~6.0, actual integration lands 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Redirect" appears in paragraph four ("learned to redirect her path through these spaces, swimming sideways through reality") and enables the journey to the nested pocket. One beat, causal (allows discovery), but easily swappable with "navigate" or "shift" without structural change. Early middle +0.3, one beat +0.4, causal +0.8, closure (indirectly shapes her ability to arrive) +0.5, swappability −0.7, summary-only (the redirect is described, not shown in a failed-then-corrected attempt) −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.0 − 1.2 = 3.8, but the action is necessary for plot, lifting to ~6.9 under the two-gate allowance (setup, middle development, no direct closure participation). Limiter: swappability and summary-only cap near 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Parallel universes are introduced in paragraph three ("five parallel universes converged"), demonstrated in the cascade (Beta garden, Epsilon underwater, Gamma snow), and frame the mother's exile and Kaia's closure choice. Three beats, shapes stakes (illegality, exile) and tactics (sensory navigation), indispensable to plot and theme. Early +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +1.4, specificity +0.5. Base 3.0 + 5.1 = 8.1, swappability (could be "dimensions" or "realities" with minor edits) −0.5, AI-pattern (Greek-letter labeling without distinct properties) −0.3 = 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The repair bay is named in the opening line, its crux-point status established in paragraph three, and its multi-world variants (garden, underwater, snow, pristine) supply the journey's stages and the mother's hiding place. Three beats, causal (engines thinned barriers, variants guide the path), closure (pristine bay holds the reunion and humming engines close the story). Early +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.0, closure +1.2, specificity (spaceport, engines, crux) +0.6. Base 3.0 + 4.9 = 7.9, but the setting does not constrain a key choice (Kaia moves freely) and the pristine variant lacks grounding detail, reducing pressure: ornamental in closure beats −0.9, postcard description −0.8. Dominant limiter: lack of constraint and grounding. 7.9 − 1.7 = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Murmur of half-remembered dreams" appears in paragraph two to frame Kaia's fragmentary memories and recurs implicitly in the mother's phrase "when you're strong enough to carry it," but does not tighten decisions or tactics—no live clock or urgency. Lyric framing only. Early +0.5, one thematic beat +0.4, no causal pressure, no closure linkage (the phrase does not return or reweight the ending), ornamental −0.8, swappability (could be "haze of forgotten memories") −0.6. Base 3.0 + 0.9 − 1.4 = 2.5, but the timeframe primes the emotional stakes (three years of searching, mother's long exile), lifting slightly under lyric allowance to ~4.1. Limiter: ornamental and no tactical constraint cap near 4.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation to discover "the weight of a withheld truth" is seeded in the mother's phrase (paragraph two), drives Kaia's three-year mapping work (paragraph three), and is tested and accepted in the closure ("felt the weight…dense and specific…she could choose to carry"). Three beats, causal (pursuit shapes all middle action), closure (acceptance is the Decisive Change), cost-connected (forecloses staying in safety or sealing passages). Early +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.5, closure +1.7, specificity (truth as physical weight) +0.7, cost +0.6. Base 3.0 + 6.6 = 9.6, minor swappability ("seeking hidden knowledge" could replace with edits) −0.6, AI-pattern (phrase "weight of truth" is slightly stock) −0.4, summary-only middle (the weight is described more than dramatized in failed choices) −0.5. 9.6 − 1.5 = 8.1.</comment>
