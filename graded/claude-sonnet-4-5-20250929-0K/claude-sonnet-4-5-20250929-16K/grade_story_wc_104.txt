<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her embodied actions with the chains show character-particular movement. However, the final transformation relies heavily on telling ("Now you decide what freedom means") rather than dramatized internal contradiction. The soldier's instant conversion lacks earned resistance—his decision arrives too cleanly without visible cost to his prior stance or orders.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The causal chain from chains → puzzle → vault → soldier encounter holds clearly. Closure delivers a Decisive Change (chains fall, collaboration begins) with felt cost (three years of solitary burden ending). The Orientation Test passes: who/where/when anchor by the opening lines. One weakness: the soldier's bolt-cutters appear conveniently without prior setup, and his immediate agreement softens the earned quality of the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The carnival setting supplies the key-arrangement code that drives the puzzle, making it essential to plot mechanics. Spatial details (northeast corner, counter, midway) guide action clearly. The dusty shelves and prize remnants establish decay without catalog bloat. The chains function as micro-setting, constraining movement ("each step calculated") and charging the final image when they fall.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protect the seeds before soldiers arrive—tightens from discovery to decoding to vault retrieval under time pressure. The ticking-clock arrival of boots escalates urgency. However, the confrontation deflates: the soldier's immediate cooperation erases the anticipated cost of impeding him. Mira's agency in the puzzle is strong, but the final beat lacks a trade-off or resistance that would test her stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and knowledge preservation emerges through concrete actions: collecting seeds, decoding patterns, choosing visibility over escape. The final image—hands reaching for seeds—resonates without moralizing. Minor slip: "liberation meant more than toppling statues" edges toward thesis statement in the penultimate paragraph, though it remains tied to the soldier's learning arc rather than pure authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third; Mira's perceptual signature (dancer's choreography with chains, mapping precision) is distinct. Dialogue is sparse but functional: "I'm the librarian" and "Show me" carry subtext and goal pursuit. The prose modulates well under pressure (short sentences as boots approach). One filter-verb cluster in the opening ("she'd worn," "she'd heard," "she'd discovered") slightly dulls immediacy but does not harm voice coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the puzzle sequence. Minor loops: "The chains…she'd worn them" restates possession, and "Seeds…heritage varieties, drought-resistant strains, plants that remembered" drifts into list mode. The phrase "staggering grace" in the final line aims for lyricism but feels slightly forced. No major artifacts touch closure, so deductions remain modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The seed-vault premise offers a fresh synthesis of resistance narrative and agricultural preservation. The carnival-code mechanic is inventive and specific. However, the instant-ally soldier and the convenient bolt-cutters soften the earned quality of the turn, pulling the piece toward a safety middle. The transformation test is borderline: swap carnival for library and keys for book-spine order, and much of the emotional arc holds unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira drives the decoding action, the vault retrieval, and the final confrontation choice to reveal rather than hide. Her agency shapes all three major beats and the closure image (reaching for seeds). The "chained" detail constrains her movement throughout, charging the final release.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The arrow appears once to signal the network's survival and provide thematic fletching (corn husks, wheat stalks). It is deliberately placed on the counter in the confrontation to cue the soldier. Two touches across beats, but no evolving use or causal pressure—swappable with any symbolic message without altering plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The seed vault is the story's central object and stakes anchor: Mira's entire goal is to find and protect it. Its discovery drives the climax, and the final image (jars of seeds, hands reaching) charges closure. The vault's content—heritage varieties with survival encoded—shapes theme and the soldier's decision.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Patiently strategic" is demonstrated in the week-long nightly mapping of the keys and the methodical puzzle-solving under time pressure. It enables the successful decode. However, no visible cost: impatience or haste never tempts her into error, so the trait feels label-supported rather than tested by friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Impede" is stated as intention ("She had to impede them, buy herself minutes") but not executed on the page. The boots arrive, the door bursts open, and Mira immediately pivots to persuasion rather than obstruction. The action is swappable with "retrieve before they arrive" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The piano-bench key arrangement is signaled early, decoded mid-story (mimicking carnival booth layout), and directly enables the vault discovery. The mechanics matter: counting positions, translating to paces. Introduced by the second paragraph and pays off in the vault reveal, shaping two major beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival prize redemption center supplies the spatial code (booth positions visible through the window) that unlocks the vault location. The counter hides the wall panel; the northeast corner anchors the final pace-count. Setting drives plot mechanics and charges the image of faded prizes (hope for children who no longer came) against preservation of seeds.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The wall coming down tonight creates the ticking clock: explosions and chanting audible, boots approaching, urgency explicit. Time pressure drives Mira's rush to decode and the compressed confrontation. The timeframe shapes all tactical choices and the why-now of the story.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—plant resilience in dry soil (literal seeds, human independence)—is stated early and dramatized through her three-year endurance, the nightly mapping, and the final choice to reveal rather than flee. The ending image (free hands reaching for seeds, collaboration with young soldiers) enacts the desire with visible forward cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Staggering grace" appears in the opening (chains as choreography, deliberate movement) and the final line ("chains fell away with staggering grace"). Tone modulates from tense urgency to quiet persuasion. The reprise charges the ending but feels slightly authored—"staggering" strains for lyricism when "deliberate" or "slow" might land more naturally within the established voice.</comment>
