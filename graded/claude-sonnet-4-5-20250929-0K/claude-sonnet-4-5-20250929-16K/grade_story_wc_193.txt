<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's pyramid-scheme past and her choice to volunteer under pressure show clear motivation, and the interiority includes concrete embodied moments ("weathered hands," the bolt growing warm). However, the arc from mushroom farmer to threshold-keeper feels insufficiently earned—the internal conflict between her desire for redemption and the immense cosmic responsibility lacks dramatized hesitation or competing impulses in the moment of volunteering. The final transformation into a permanent anchor reads more like conceptual assertion than a choice with visible psychological cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece attempts a causal-situational hybrid: glitchy texts → bolt appears → threshold discovered → volunteer decision → fusion. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive adequately early. The closure unit—Maya fused to the bolt, holding paradoxes—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant), but the cost remains abstract ("pressure" as metaphor) rather than a legible forfeiture or visible transformation on the page. The Orientation Test penalty is waived, but the Cost Proof Test shows strain: the final image declares she "holds all promises" without showing what she loses or what specific tactic changes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushroom setting constrains choice at closure—the "fault line between mushroom chambers" becomes the literal threshold, and the fungi's glow "blazed brighter as reality stabilized," charging the final image. Sensory detail (blue/green pulses, salt-crusted bolt, flickering glimpses of parallel farms) is selective and purposeful. Micro-setting (the cellar, the bolt as tactile anchor) meets the 9+ gate criterion by shaping the ending, but the "parallel Mayas" glimpse remains visually vague and the spatial choreography of the threshold itself lacks concrete grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor paradoxes to prevent reality collapse) is signaled mid-story and tightens once through Maya's volunteer choice. The escalation reads under a situational lens: mounting pressure from texts → bolt appearance → threshold discovery → decision. However, the resolution relies on a late-breaking rule (the bolt can "hold paradoxes" if she's "strong enough") introduced by the coalesced presence, not earned by prior causality. The cost ("pressure will be immense") is declared but not dramatized with visible forfeiture or altered tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (pressure transforms rather than destroys; redemption through endurance) emerges from concrete particulars: pyramid scheme collapse, mushroom cultivation as "honest growth," the bolt as metaphor for containment under stress. The final line—"She'd finally found a scheme that wasn't a pyramid—it was a portal"—reweights the premise without overt moralizing and offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the pressure-to-diamonds conceit is stated too directly in Maya's reflection ("Perhaps pressure, properly applied, could create diamonds from the coal of her regrets"), weakening subtextual emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (weathered hands, "virtuously mischievous," the bolt "impossibly heavy for its size"). The prose modulates well under pressure: short declaratives at the volunteer moment, lyric density in the final image. Register remains consistent—no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Minor slip: "Their mouths full of glittering fragments" shifts briefly to observed plural without clear POV anchor, and the coalesced presence's dialogue ("We need someone who understands false promises") edges toward expository convenience rather than earned subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, patterned artifacts cluster in key beats: "Perhaps pressure" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs (pressure as reveal / pressure as transformation), creating mild synonym churn. The phrase "quantum promises" is repeated four times without evolving meaning. "Volunteer" appears as both noun and verb across multiple lines, flattening propulsion. The final paragraph stacks three declarative clauses in parallel ("The mushrooms blazed… Maya stood… She smiled…"), creating template cadence at closure. Apply −0.6 for loop/template patterns touching the ending and −0.3 for metaphor density ("sticky residue," "crystalline shards," "coal of regrets," "diamonds") without payoff in a single high-pressure paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of pyramid scheme survivor + quantum paradoxes + submarine bolt is specific and non-obvious. The piece commits to its concept-physics premise (lies leaving residue, promises as crystalline shards) and follows through to closure. However, the "concepts become physical" world-rule and the bolt's paradox-anchoring function arrive as convenient late additions rather than constraints seeded early and tested under pressure. The "virtuously mischievous" label is ornamental, not dramatized. The final turn (portal not pyramid) feels clever but lacks the inevitability of hindsight—Maya's mischief and her past scheming do not causally enable the threshold discovery.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's pyramid-scheme past is seeded early (paragraph 1), colors her mistrust of promises (paragraph 3), and motivates her volunteer choice ("someone who understands false promises"). She appears in all three gates (setup, middle reflection, closure decision). However, the survivor trait does not constrain her choice with visible cost—she volunteers readily without dramatized hesitation between her rebuilt life and cosmic duty. The attribute shapes motivation but does not narrow options under pressure at the pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The submarine porthole bolt appears in beat 2 (Tuesday discovery), is handled and recognized from childhood memory, returns in beat 3 (volunteer moment), and fuses to Maya's chest at closure, reweighted as the literal anchor for paradoxes. It appears in all three gates and drives two distinct beats (discovery, volunteer). The object's specific history (grandfather, "holds back entire oceans") charges the final image. Cap at 7.1: the bolt's paradox-anchoring function is declared by the presence rather than discovered through Maya's experimentation, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Quantum promises are introduced in paragraph 4, explained as "both kept and broken until observed," and drive the central conflict (paradoxes breeding, reality folding). The concept shapes Maya's volunteer decision and is present at closure ("keeping all promises, across all dimensions, simultaneously"). It appears in all three gates and alters options. However, the mechanics remain abstract—quantum promises never constrain Maya's tactics or force a visible tradeoff on the page; they function as thematic backdrop rather than a pressing problem she navigates through specific micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Virtuously mischievous" is labeled in paragraph 6 ("her virtuously mischievous nature… sparked to life") but never dramatized through a specific on-page action with cost. The trait does not constrain or enable a concrete choice. It appears mid-story (missing setup gate) and is absent from closure. The attribute could be removed without altering the volunteer decision or the ending's logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The volunteer action is seeded by the glitchy text instruction ("V0lunteer at the thr3shold"), dramatized on-page ("I volunteer," Maya said), and directly triggers the closure transformation (bolt fuses to chest, reality stabilizes). It appears in all three gates and drives the major turn. The action redefines Maya's options from passive farmer to active anchor. Strong integration; the story's logic hinges on this exact choice. Minor cap: the decision feels slightly under-pressured—Maya does not weigh a visible counter-option or express doubt in the moment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Glitchy texts from parallel dimensions are introduced early (paragraph 2, midnight arrival), recur across beats (multiple messages), and provide the volunteer instruction that shapes the climax. They appear in setup and development gates and are causally linked to closure. However, the mechanics remain ornamental—the texts deliver information but do not constrain Maya's tactics or force her to decode/negotiate their paradoxes on the page. The method could be replaced with a direct vision or dream without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushroom farm is introduced in paragraph 1, provides the threshold location (fault line between chambers in paragraph 7), and charges the final image ("mushrooms blazed brighter as reality stabilized"). It appears in all three gates and supplies the spatial resource for closure. The setting's "honest, predictable growth" contrasts thematically with quantum paradoxes. However, the farm does not constrain Maya's choices under pressure—she does not use mushroom-specific knowledge or tools to solve the threshold problem. The setting pressures atmosphere more than tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "when concepts become physical" is introduced in paragraph 3, illustrated with concrete examples (lies leaving residue, broken promises as shards), and remains active at closure (quantum promises as physical paradoxes). It appears in setup and development gates. However, the rule does not tighten decisions or alter Maya's tactics on the page—she does not navigate the physics of concept-materialization to solve the threshold problem. The timeframe shapes world logic but does not create a live clock or escalating pressure that forces faster/harder choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to translate pressure into diamonds" is dramatized in paragraph 6 ("Perhaps pressure, properly applied, could create diamonds from the coal of her regrets") and echoed at closure ("pressure doesn't destroy what's already been broken and remade. It creates diamonds"). It shapes the volunteer choice and charges the final image. However, the desire is stated rather than conflicted—Maya does not weigh the cost of becoming a permanent anchor against rebuilding her life. The motivation drives theme but lacks on-page friction between wants and visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tone blends wonder (bioluminescent glow, "quantum possibility") with shadow (pyramid scheme collapse, "crushing weight," "brutal new honesty"). The tone modulates with pressure: ominous at the glitchy texts, contemplative at the threshold, elevated at closure. Coherent through turns. However, the final image tips toward triumph ("smiled her mischievous smile") without sufficient shadow to balance the immense cost of eternal fusion, slightly undermining the "shadowseam" blend. The tone charges the ending but does not fully sustain the promised duality.</comment>
