<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mirela's motivation to heal the fracturing community is clear and consistent, but her interiority remains thin—she "sensed" fracturing and "needed them to reexamine," yet we see no embodied contradiction or struggle in her choices. The shift from brief to longer messages lacks internal friction; her decision feels linear rather than conflicted. Secondary characters like Kess provide a glimpse of change under pressure, but Mirela's agency reads more as catalytic observation than a choice with personal cost. The ending gestures at relief ("I CAN REST NOW") but her stake in resting versus continuing was never dramatized as a competing want.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes who (Mirela), where (orchard planet), and when (after settlement) within the opening paragraph, meeting the Orientation Test. The causal chain is legible: fracturing community → chalk messages → Kess opens storehouse → collective action → merchant offer → vote → Mirela's rest. However, the merchant-ship reversal arrives abruptly without prior foreshadowing, weakening earned escalation. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Mirela's release from her task), but the cost—her ceasing to exist as an active presence—is stated rather than felt in a charged final image. The drive lens reads as Causal with some Accumulative texture (chalk messages building), held through closure, though the merchant pivot feels convenient rather than motivated by prior beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches, low gravity, and butterfly gardens is vivid and specific, filtering through Mirela's spectral perception (droplets "hung suspended," "drifting like tears"). Spatial choreography remains clear across the settlement's sectors and domes. The copper bell and chalk materialize as tactile anchors that recur with purpose. However, the nebula of respite is described beautifully but does not constrain a single choice or alter tactics—it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a pressure-bearing element. The setting charges the final image (arches, orchards, violet sky) without directly shaping the climactic vote, placing it in the mid-range for setting utility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving collective economy versus individual wealth—is signaled early and tightens through the merchant offer. Mirela's messages provide one meaningful escalation (Kess opening her storehouse), and the community vote is a clear decision point. However, the merchant ship arrives as an external complication rather than arising from protagonist agency, and the unanimous vote deflates rather than sharpens tension—no visible cost or dissenting voice tests the commitment. The story's pressure is coherent under a Causal lens but lacks a trade-off that forecloses a live option with felt consequence. The resolution is asserted (unanimous agreement) rather than earned through Mirela's specific constraint or sacrifice in that moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between the corporate wars' scarcity logic and the settlement's sharing economy, crystallized in Mirela's climactic message: "I DIED SO YOU COULD LIVE DIFFERENTLY." The butterfly bells, orchards, and chalk messages accumulate thematic weight without overt moralizing. Kess's arc ("YOUR FEAR STARVES TOMORROW'S CHILDREN") demonstrates theme through specific choice rather than abstraction. The final image—settlers continuing the chalk-message tradition—reweights prior material by making the ghost's inheritance collective and ongoing. However, the unanimous vote and the phrase "orchestrate this together" edge toward a stated moral rather than an ambiguous, resonant answer. The theme avoids false equivalence (the merchant offer is rejected, not balanced) and trusts particulars, though the ending's neatness slightly undercuts complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV through Mirela is stable, with psychic distance controlled (she "sensed," "watched," "worked until her essence thinned"). The spectral voice carries distinct texture: "brambled with hope and grief," "cold fire that wouldn't fade." Dialogue is minimal but functional (Kess's speech), and the settlers' collective voice in the final paragraphs avoids head-hopping. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels authorial rather than character-filtered: "nebula of respite," "catalyzed movement," "gossamer." The phrase "something in her refused to disperse" tells rather than showing her refusal through a concrete perceptual signature. The final paragraph's shift to an unattributed "someone" loosens focalization without clear purpose, though it remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening line anchors voice and stakes. Information density is high in early paragraphs (ghost, wars, seeds, settlement, nebula compressed efficiently). However, several phrases loop: "strangers became family" appears three times, and "floating rock arches" recurs without functional variation. The phrase "organize work crews that crossed factional boundaries" and "sharing economy they'd built" read as abstract summary rather than concrete action. Minor filter-verb stacking in the middle ("began organizing," "watched as her words catalyzed") dulls immediacy. The final image ("eternal, violet sky") recharges earlier motifs cleanly, but mid-story beats lean on stock connectors ("But lately," "But success bred") and template cadence. No clarity-breaking artifacts, but momentum sags in the merchant-offer paragraph due to expository summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—altruistic ghost guiding refugee settlement via chalk messages—synthesizes familiar elements (helpful ghost, utopian collective, symbolic objects) without a sharp fresh angle. The orchard-planet setting and floating rock arches offer vivid specificity, and the low-gravity droplets are a memorable detail. However, the emotional arc (fractured community → collective action → unanimous vote) follows a template path: the ghost's wisdom is never in doubt, the opposition dissolves without cost, and the resolution confirms the premise rather than transforming it. The story commits fully to its vision but opts for safety in the climax (no dissent, no sacrifice that costs Mirela something she wants to keep). Removing Mirela's spectral nature and substituting a living elder would leave the plot and emotional beats largely unchanged, suggesting insufficient transformation of the ghost trope.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mirela (altruistic ghost) is present throughout, frames the opening, drives the chalk-message tactic, and her final message "I CAN REST NOW" provides closure participation. Her choices create two key turns: initiating the messages (Kess's storehouse opening) and writing the climactic central-square message that catalyzes the vote. However, her altruism is label-stable rather than conflicted—she never faces a choice between her own desires and the community's needs, nor does resting carry a visible cost (e.g., abandoning them prematurely). The story would fracture without her, but her ghost-status and altruism remain ornamental to the core conflict rather than constraining her tactics or forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The copper bell appears in the opening (watering gardens), recurs when pollination rates surge after sharing ("They shared the butterfly garden watering bells"), and returns in the penultimate beat ("Mirela rang her butterfly bell one last time") with reweighted meaning (laughter, relief, inheritance). It is handled across three distinct beats and its final chime charges the closure image. However, the bell does not constrain a choice under pressure—its use is celebratory rather than tactical. Removing it would weaken the sensory throughline and final resonance but would not break the story's causal logic, as the chalk messages carry the primary escalation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The nebula of respite is described vividly (violet clouds, rose-and-gold light on arches) and appears in the opening, middle, and final paragraphs. It reinforces tone and theme symbolically (refuge, benediction) but does not shape a single on-page stake or tactic. No character uses it as a resource, no choice hinges on its presence, and the story's escalation (messages → vote) proceeds independently of it. It functions as atmospheric backdrop—beautiful and thematically consonant but structurally inert. Late mentions feel like token callbacks rather than causal reprise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy for a specter" is stated in the opening and demonstrated when "the living had learned this slowly" and later when settlers read her messages and act on them. Kess's tears and the community's acceptance of the chalk guidance show the attribute enabling collective action. However, the trait is asserted more than tested—no beat dramatizes suspicion overcome, no cost tied to Mirela proving trustworthiness under doubt. The attribute is causally consistent but does not constrain her choices or create friction; it smooths the path rather than complicating it.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Reexamine" appears explicitly ("She needed them to reexamine what they'd built together") and drives the chalk-message campaign and the climactic central-square message that prompts collective reflection before the vote. The action is signaled early and recurs as method. However, reexamination happens primarily through Mirela's external prompts rather than through a protagonist's internal reexamination under pressure. The community's reexamination is told in summary ("began organizing work crews") rather than dramatized as a difficult, contested process. Swapping "reexamine" for "remember" or "reconsider" would leave the structure largely intact, suggesting mid-level integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method (messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks at dawn) is introduced early ("chalk messages she left on the deserted sidewalks at dawn"), recurs across multiple beats (storehouse, agricultural dome, water reclamation center, Kess's doorstep, central square), and its mechanics matter (ethereal fingers pressing chalk, "cold fire that wouldn't fade"). The method enables Mirela's influence without direct confrontation and its iterative escalation (brief → longer → three-foot blazing letters) tracks pressure. The final beat ("every morning after, someone would take up chalk") reweights the method as collective inheritance. Removing the chalk-and-sidewalk specificity would collapse the story's tactical texture and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches is vividly rendered and recurs in the opening, middle, and final paragraphs. Low gravity affects the watering droplets (a memorable detail), and the orchards supply the survival resource (fruit sustaining two thousand souls). However, the setting does not pressure a key choice—characters move freely between sectors, and the merchant offer is resolved by vote rather than by environmental constraint. The arches and orchards charge the final image but function more as symbolic backdrop than as tactical terrain. The setting enriches atmosphere without altering outcome, placing it in the functional-but-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after strangers become family") is stated three times and frames the premise, but it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The story spans an unspecified duration ("lately," "now," "that night") without urgency. The phrase functions as thematic anchor (trust earned over time) but does not constrain tactics—no countdown pressures the vote, no seasonal deadline forces harvest choices. The timeframe is present and thematically consonant but structurally passive, more label than lever.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mirela's motivation to orchestrate collective effort is stated explicitly and demonstrated through the chalk-message campaign, Kess's storehouse opening, cross-boundary work crews, and the climactic vote. It drives her escalation from brief to blazing letters and shapes the ending (her release depends on collective success). However, the desire is never conflicted—no beat shows her weighing collective effort against rest, autonomy, or doubt. The motivation is told and enacted but not dramatized as a want under friction. Removing "orchestrate" and substituting "inspire" or "guide" would leave the arc intact, suggesting functional but replaceable integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tone (brambled hope) is established through Kess's voice ("brambled with hope and grief"), the nebula imagery (benediction amid war-refugee context), and the interweaving of loss (wars, death, scarcity fears) with growth (orchards, abundance, collective action). Tone modulates purposefully: grief-tinged in the opening, celebratory when pollination surges, tense at the merchant offer, and quietly triumphant in the ending. The brambled texture—hope complicated by cost—charges the final image (Mirela's rest, settlers continuing her work). However, the unanimous vote flattens the bramble by resolving tension too cleanly. The tone is coherent and present in the closure but slightly undercut by the lack of sustained friction in the climax.</comment>
