<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her strategic withering plan shows calculated risk-taking with visible cost (three seasons of declining measurements, risk of dismissal). The marbles ground her interior life in concrete memory without therapeutic label-speak. Marcus functions adequately as witness and foil but remains lightly sketched. Minor deduction for the apprentice's relatively thin presence and the ease with which Elara's gambit succeeds—the Council's instant acceptance lacks friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara's deliberate withering proves the garden's recognition, reweighting measurements against memory with visible professional and reputational cost. The causal chain (bury marbles → withhold care → resume → demonstration) is clear and motivated. Orientation anchors quickly (withered vine dresser, maze, sensors). One micro turn when the hedges respond overnight transforms the setup into proof. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture (marbles as pattern), held cleanly to closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The garden maze provides spatial constraint (junctions, paths) and the marbles function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image when light catches their fractures. Sensor readouts and botanical dyes anchor the Empire's measurement regime. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout excavation and positioning. Minor gap: the maze's physical evolution (six inches overnight, new roots) is described but not deeply integrated into Elara's tactical movement or the Council's spatial verification process.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving relationship survives measurement) is signaled early and escalates through Elara's deliberate tanking of metrics, then the overnight bloom response. The tightening is protagonist-driven: her choice to withhold care and resume creates the reversal. Visible cost includes three seasons of decline and dismissal risk. Minor deduction: the Council's capitulation arrives without meaningful resistance or counter-pressure, softening the final victory's weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (recognition and relationship versus quantification) emerges organically from the marble excavation and garden response without overt statement. The cracked marbles as physical testimony and "Gardens know their gardeners" operate as earned image rather than thesis. The ending's "damage into testimony" and "love survives measurement" resonate without moralizing. The piece resists binary resolution—gardens remain "blooming and withering" simultaneously. Final image of fractured marbles turning "damage into testimony" reweights prior material without explaining it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent access to Elara's memory and perception. Diction fits an aging gardener's practical vocabulary ("wisely pragmatic efficiency," "botanical sensors"). Dialogue is functional and advances plot, though Marcus's lines lean expository. Minor slips: "elaborately remembered—by me and by them" and "turning fractures into proof, damage into testimony" drift slightly toward thematic summary rather than staying rooted in Elara's concrete perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high across the excavation sequence. Clear propulsion through each marble recovery and positioning. Two minor artifacts: "blooming, withering kingdom, both verdant and dying, precisely as gardens truly are" stacks near-synonyms, and "small victories, elaborately remembered" appears twice with slight variation. The paraphrase loop "Gardens know their gardeners" (repeated three times across the piece) functions as motif but borders on redundancy in the final beat where it's rephrased as "Recognition."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The mended-deception premise (buried marbles as private record now serving as proof) offers a fresh angle on garden-as-witness. The strategic withering to demonstrate relationship is non-obvious and grows from character. The marbles' physical transformation (dirt-obscured → polished, cracked yet meaningful) avoids symbolic convenience. Risk: the piece leans into a familiar frame (tech metrics versus organic wisdom) but earns specificity through botanical sensors, junction mapping, and the overnight growth response that literalizes recognition.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's choices drive all major turns: burying marbles (backstory setup), deliberate withering (inciting decision), excavation and polishing (middle escalation), and positioning marbles to prove the thesis (closure participation). Her agency shapes the proof structure. Cost is visible (professional risk, three seasons of decline). High irreplaceability: the vine dresser role is essential to botanical authority and the marble burial.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marbles appear in setup (unearthed), middle excavation (polished at multiple junctions), and closure (positioned, light catches fractures, "damage into testimony"). They constrain Elara's movements (she maps the maze by junction memory) and charge the final image when their cracks become "copper veins." The cracked state matters: fractures testify to root pressure and time, not just presence. High specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Mended deception" is signaled early (previous Master Gardener took credit, marbles as secret record) and transforms in closure when the old lie becomes public evidence. It shapes Elara's tactics: she resurrects a hidden record to prove present relationship. The deception's mending is both literal (polishing dirt away) and conceptual (private pride → testimony). Visible cost: reputational risk if the gambit fails. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Wisely pragmatic" is labeled once ("moved through the maze with wisely pragmatic efficiency") and demonstrated through her calculated withering plan and selective marble placement. It enables the strategic risk but doesn't constrain a choice with visible trade-off on the page—Elara's wisdom feels assured rather than tested. The trait is present in her tactics but not visibly costly or irreplaceable; a similar plan could be described as "methodical" or "deliberate."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Polishing appears across setup (first marble), middle beats (multiple junctions, brown dye emerging, split marble), and closure (all eighteen positioned, gleaming despite damage). The act transforms dirt-obscured marbles into legible testimony and structures the escalation sequence. Removing "polish" would require a different revelation mechanism—the physical cleaning is the proof-making gesture. Highly specific and causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Commemorating small victories elaborately" is introduced early (painted with botanical dyes, interred like seeds) and its mechanics matter: each marble marks a specific triumph (roses saved from blight, wisteria coaxed to climb). The method shapes Elara's excavation route (decision points in the maze) and charges the closure when fractures themselves become proof. Solid setup, development via junctions, and closure participation. The elaborateness (painting, interring) is visible and purposeful.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The garden maze provides spatial structure (junctions, paths, hedges), constrains Elara's movement (she knows which turns lead to oldest plantings), and supplies the proof mechanism (overnight growth toward marble positions). The maze's response is the climax: six inches of hedge growth, rose profusion, wisteria roots. Setting is indispensable to both tactics and closure. High irreplaceability: no other setting could deliver this literal recognition.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Empire's measurement regime (luck through botanical sensors, three seasons of decline, Council's dawn arrival) frames the entire conflict and tightens Elara's deadline. "After luck becomes measurable" shapes stakes: her worth is quantified, making the qualitative (memory, relationship) invisible until she forces its proof. The timeframe enables the strategic withering ("three weeks ago") and the overnight response that serves as climax. Strong setup and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's desire to prove gardens recognize their gardeners drives every choice: excavating marbles, withering to create contrast, resuming care to trigger response, positioning marbles for the Council. The motivation is dramatized through risk (dismissal threat) and tested by Marcus's horror. Cost is visible (three seasons tanked, professional reputation). The final "Recognition" and "love survives measurement" deliver on this want with undeniable pressure. High causal and closure integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Blooming withering" tone is coherent from the opening ("withered vine dresser," "turning leaves") through the closure ("blooming, withering kingdom, both verdant and dying"). The tone modulates with pressure: decay in setup, cleaning and polishing in middle, simultaneous bloom and brown in the ending. The oxymoron charges the final image ("dance of blooming and withering") and reflects the core theme. The doubled phrasing ("blooming and withering," "verdant and dying") risks redundancy but stays purposeful.</comment>
