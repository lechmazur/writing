<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The historian's interior world is rendered through specific sensory attention ("fingertips that had learned to read texture like braille") and her choices show consistent purpose in archival work. However, she remains largely observational; no on-page pressure forces a difficult decision or visible cost. The final act of copying Caroline's words into the ledger feels like continuation rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Internal contradiction and embodied struggle are minimal—she has already accepted her post-human state without dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a layered, reflective structure early and maintains coherent tonal deepening through the historian's handling of objects and reconstruction of fragments. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the final image of gathering fragments "long after the last dream had faded into permanent, bronze silence" reweights the archival purpose with undeniable elegiac cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are clear by the opening paragraphs. One weakness: the escalation is density-driven rather than choice-driven, which fits the lens but limits urgency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The silo library is vividly particular: rust patterns as script, books spiraling against curved walls, the displaced axis made spatial. Micro-setting details (the table, the tapestry wedged between theology texts, the fireplace three levels down) constrain the historian's movements and charge the final image. Sensory selection reflects archival attention (texture, vibration, visual layering) filtered through the POV's professional priorities. The recurring tapestry dragons and the silo's tilt serve as both setting and symbolic architecture without becoming merely ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving human testimony in the aftermath. The pressure is conceptual and existential rather than immediate—no antagonist, no ticking clock within the scene itself. One meaningful deepening occurs when Caroline's diary reveals the mechanism ("We bent the world too far. The axis doesn't hold"), which reweights the historian's purpose from simple archival to witness of ontological collapse. However, the historian's stance never wavers; no on-page choice narrows options or forecloses a path with visible cost. Under Accumulative lens this suffices but does not reach high-band urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the displaced axis, the failure of dreams, and the archive as repository of "witnessed moments" rather than chronology. The final image—building "an archive of the human echo"—offers a resonant answer to the central question (what remains after humanity ends?) without moralizing. Caroline's "We felt everything" and the historian's translation of that into ledger form achieve genuine pathos through particulars. One slip: "dreams required a stable world to return to" edges into abstract philosophizing mid-piece, though it's anchored to Caroline's observations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the historian notices texture, ambient memory, the "bronze quiet." Diction is elevated and lyric ("amber suspension of aftermath") but remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled. One minor wobble: "humanity had torqued reality through its endless wanting" briefly shifts into omniscient register, though it reads as the historian's reconstructed conclusion rather than true POV leakage. Rhythmic control under reflective pressure is strong, with varied sentence architecture supporting the meditative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and dense with purpose. Strong specificity: "charred diary pages," "bronze quiet," "serpentine bodies woven in faded crimson and gold." No loops or paraphrase cycles detected. However, some figurative language trends ornamental rather than causal: "memories of kernels cascading like rain" and "dragons seemed to writhe in peripheral vision" are vivid but do not constrain choice or alter the historian's next move. Stock metaphor "dreams were the psyche's way of processing" appears in an expository paragraph. Overall momentum is steady but not propulsive; the reflective mode fits the design but limits sentence-level urgency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—post-human archivist in a tilted world where dreams have ceased—is fresh and commits fully to its implications. The "displaced axis" as both literal and metaphysical failure is a non-obvious synthesis. Execution is literary and controlled, avoiding stock apocalypse tropes. However, the emotional arc (historian observes, gathers, continues observing) lacks a decisive transformation; the piece reads as a well-rendered tableau rather than a story with an inevitable turn. The tapestry dragons and silo architecture add texture but do not drive a choice that could only occur here. Within-band: solid originality of concept, moderate originality of execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The odd historian is present throughout and her archival purpose frames the piece, but her choices are repetitive (arrange, handle, read, copy) without escalation. No decision alters her tactics or forecloses a path; she continues the work she was already doing. Setup is immediate, middle involvement is observational, and the ending shows her copying Caroline's words—continuation rather than transformation. Functional but replaceable with another archivist role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tapestry appears early (setup gate met) and returns at closure ("those medieval beasts that represented chaos at the edge of order" and "dragon-threaded cloth" in the final paragraph). Two distinct beats: initial description and peripheral motion under the historian's stress. However, it is never handled or used to constrain a choice; it remains symbolic backdrop. The reprise reweights slightly (dragons as chaos mirrors the displaced axis) but does not drive the ending action. Lyric resonance present but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Displaced axis is signaled early ("the displaced axis of the old world"), developed in Caroline's diary ("The axis doesn't hold"), and integrated into the historian's conclusion about why dreams failed. It shapes the ontological stakes on the page: reality bent until consciousness lost anchor. The concept is irreplaceable—removing it would collapse the story's metaphysical logic. Present in all three gates and charged at closure. Does not constrain a tactical choice but reweights the entire premise with conceptual cost, fitting CR closure mode.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Sensitively perceptive is mentioned early ("sensitively perceptive to the whispers") and shown through tactile reading ("fingertips that had learned to read texture like braille") and listening to walls. Setup gate met. However, the trait never constrains a choice or imposes visible cost; it enables observation but no decision hinges on it. No middle development beat where heightened perception creates friction or tradeoff. Present but not causally active beyond flavor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Probe appears in the margin-reading beat ("She began to probe the diary's margins") and leads to the key revelation about the axis. Setup and middle gates met; this action uncovers Caroline's explanation, which reweights the historian's understanding. However, "probe" could be swapped for "examine," "study," or "decipher" with minimal edit—moderate specificity. The action matters but is not irreplaceable. Does not appear in or shape the closure image directly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Half-burned diaries are introduced early (setup gate), handled in the middle reconstruction sequence (development gate), and Caroline's final entry is copied in the closing beat (payoff gate). All three gates met. The burning itself ("someone had tried to erase their thoughts before the ending") adds thematic weight—imperfect destruction mirrors imperfect memory. The method constrains what the historian can recover and charges the fragmentary nature of the archive. Specific and purposeful, though the action of finding them is summarized rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The silo library is present from the opening line, developed through vivid spatial detail (curved walls, rust patterns, spiraling books, fireplace three levels down), and active in the closure image ("surrounded by smoke-damaged confessions and dragon-threaded cloth"). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. The setting's tilt and geometry embody the displaced axis concept. The historian's tactile engagement (pressing palm to wall, feeling vibration) uses the space actively. Irreplaceable—the silo's cylindrical, tilted architecture is integral to the metaphysics and mood.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Timeframe is signaled early ("the time before, when humans still dreamed" / "what came after") and the historian's post-human state is clear throughout. The ending references "after the last dream had faded." Setup and payoff gates met. However, the timeframe does not create urgency or constrain choices within the scene—no ticking clock, no pressure from the passage of time. It sets the ontological condition but does not drive tactics or escalation. Thematic presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation is stated early ("to collect the stories walls have heard") and dramatized through her handling of diary pages, reconstructing entries, copying Caroline's final words, and gathering fragments. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. The work is shown on the page across multiple beats. However, the motivation faces no friction or cost—she simply continues doing what she already does. No competing want or obstacle tests her commitment. Functional and present but not conflicted or deepened through pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Bronze quiet is signaled early ("living in the bronze quiet that followed noise") and sustained throughout via diction ("amber suspension," "permanent, bronze silence" at closure). The tone is elegiac, meditative, and controlled—coherent across all beats. It modulates subtly: the opening's observational calm deepens into Caroline's fragmentary fear, then resolves in the historian's ritualized continuation. The final image is charged by the cumulative weight of that quiet. Tone shapes the final image's resonance and is irreplaceable to the story's mood and thematic closure.</comment>
