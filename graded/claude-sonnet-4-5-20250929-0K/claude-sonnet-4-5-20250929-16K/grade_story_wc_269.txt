<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is specific and embodied through the three-two tapping rhythm, and her choices trace a clear arc from misunderstanding to insight. The micro-choices—studying data, pulling up archives, assembling overlays—feel goal-driven and consistent with her professional expertise. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: she assumes paths are disappearing when they're returning, a misbelief corrected by her own dramatized work. The final revelation is earned through on-page effort, though the emotional cost of this discovery remains oblique rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is swift (who, where, when anchored within 60 words). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-building through data layering, tapping rhythm, atlas markings, tidal cycles, and the final reweighting of "recovery" as memory-driven restoration. The closure is Conceptual Repricing—the ocean assembles itself into what it had always been trying to become—with conceptual cost legible in the understated admission that humanity interrupted. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maya realizes the paths aren't disappearing but returning, a tightening that narrows her interpretive frame and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The monitoring station is vividly anchored: stilts groaning fifty meters below, moored to bedrock yet drifting with the tide. Micro-setting details—the torn atlas page, the desk, the window where sunrise hits the Coral Sea—constrain Maya's workspace and charge the final image when she tapes the page to glass. Sensory selection is strong (the station's creak, the comm crackle, the three-two rhythm felt against surfaces). The ocean's "memory" and the bleaching-event dots function as both setting and thematic engine, enabling the discovery that drives closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why migration paths vanish—is signaled early and tightens when Maya realizes they're returning, not disappearing. One meaningful reversal occurs on the page: her interpretive frame shifts from loss to restoration, narrowing options and reweighting her task. Agency is decision-based (assembling data, calling Jin, using pre-industrial models) with a visible intellectual cost: abandoning her initial framework. The escalation is driven by Maya's choices under the Accumulative lens, though the emotional or professional price of this discovery remains muted rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the ocean's memory, the tapping rhythm, the atlas page, and the concept of "periodically eternal"—cycles too long for human recognition. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: recovery means the ocean assembling itself into what it had always been trying to become, before humanity interrupted. No overt moralizing; the conceptual cost is the admission that human intervention scrambled ancient patterns. The recurring three-two rhythm and the torn atlas page accumulate meaning without symbolic convenience, and the coral's potential memory charges the ending without resolving into neat binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply anchored in Maya's perceptual signature: the three-two tapping, the way she filters data through scientific expertise, her unconscious repetition of the rhythm under stress. Dialogue with Jin is sparse, naturalistic, and goal-driven, advancing plot without filter clutter. Diction remains consistent—technical but not overwrought—and the narrative stance modulates purposefully as Maya's certainty builds. Free indirect style is clean, and the prose rhythm mirrors her acceleration toward insight. No head-hopping, no register drift; voice feels singular and controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances data interpretation, character thought, or thematic layering. Sentence structure varies purposefully, and the three-two rhythm is woven through action and perception without becoming mechanical. Minor scaffolding appears in phrases like "The atlas page lay on her desk, torn deliberately" where "torn deliberately" feels slightly over-explained. One paraphrase loop: "The paths aren't disappearing… They're shifting" followed immediately by "what if the paths aren't disappearing? What if they're returning?" restates the insight without adding pressure. Overall propulsion is strong, figurative language is controlled, and no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—ocean currents reverting to pre-industrial patterns after fossil fuel bans—is fresh and non-obvious, grounded in scientific plausibility and Maya's expertise. The "delayed revelation" transforms a familiar environmental-recovery trope by reframing recovery as deep memory reasserting itself rather than simple healing. The three-two rhythm, the torn atlas page, and the bleaching dates create a specific synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking is moderate: the piece commits fully to its conceptual premise without retreating into sentiment, and the ending resists tidy resolution. The transformation test holds: plot and arc would fail with generic names and places.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya witnessed the first major bleaching event as a graduate student, an experience that frames her misinterpretation of current data and charges her final realization. Her past observation shapes her present misreading (paths disappearing vs. returning) and her decision to use pre-industrial models. The character's witness role enables the closure turn: the coral's children "adapted, persistent, waiting for the paths to resettle." Present in setup, drives the middle interpretive shift, and shapes the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The atlas page is handled in three distinct beats: introduced early with bleaching-event markings, pulled toward the light when Maya sees the pattern ("The dates weren't random. They followed a sequence"), and taped to the window at closure where sunrise hits the Coral Sea beyond. Its markings (dots, dates, tidal rhythm) enable Maya's breakthrough. The torn page's faded pencil annotations function as both clue and metaphor for lost continuity. Without this exact object, the discovery mechanism and final image would fail.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The delayed revelation structures the entire narrative arc: Maya spends the story misinterpreting disappearing paths until she realizes they're returning. The concept governs her tactics (assembling overlays, cross-referencing data) and stakes (understanding the ocean's behavior). The revelation lands on the page with visible cost: abandoning her initial framework and recognizing humanity's interruption. The concept is not merely thematic but operational: it changes options and knowledge at closure. Without the delay, there is no story.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" appears early ("gardens of color that seemed periodically eternal—dying back with warming, resurging with cooling") and returns at closure ("patterns periodically eternal"). It functions thematically to describe cycles too long for human recognition, enabling Maya's realization that the ocean's memory operates on timescales humans miss. The attribute shapes her interpretive shift but does not directly constrain an on-page action with visible cost; it remains more conceptual than tactical. Present in setup and ending, it reweights meaning but lacks middle-beat causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Assembling data drives the entire middle section: Maya pulls up overlays, archived data, tidal charts, bleaching dates, and pre-industrial models. Each assembly step narrows her interpretive frame and escalates pressure. The action enables the major turn ("what if the paths aren't disappearing? What if they're returning?") and is irreplaceable—swapping "assemble" for another verb would break the story's logic. The assembly work is dramatized across multiple beats, and the final image ("assembling itself into what it had always been trying to become") charges the closure with layered meaning.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The three-two tapping rhythm is signaled in the opening line ("three beats then two"), recurs throughout under stress ("three-two rhythm continuing unconsciously against her thigh"), and appears in the final beat ("Three-two. Three-two. The rhythm of tides, of return"). The method is tied causally to Maya's recognition: the rhythm matches the tidal charts and the bleaching-event dates, enabling her breakthrough. Its mechanics matter: the pattern is both character tic and discovery tool. Present in setup, middle recognition, and closure, though its causal role in the middle beat feels slightly understated.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sea level monitoring station anchors the entire story spatially and thematically: moored to bedrock yet drifting, fifty meters above the water, holding six years of data. The station's permanence enables the long-term observation Maya needs, and its physical setting ("stilts groaning," "swaying, moored but moving") mirrors the theme of fixed-yet-drifting paths. The station supplies the archive ("station's previous occupant's effects") that contains the atlas page. The setting constrains Maya's tactics (she works from this fixed point) and charges the final image when she tapes the atlas page to the window. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The post-fossil-fuel-ban timeframe is established early and shapes the premise: temperatures stabilizing but no longer climbing allow the ocean to remember older patterns. The timeframe enables Maya's discovery (reverting currents) and charges the theme (recovery as restoration rather than simple healing). However, the timeframe does not tighten moment-to-moment decisions or tactics; it functions as context rather than a live clock. Present in setup and thematically active at closure, but does not alter mid-story moves with temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maya's motivation—to discover why migration paths disappear—is dramatized immediately ("Migration routes that appeared on her screens one week vanished the next") and drives every tactical choice: studying data streams, pulling up overlays, assembling decades of records, calling Jin, using pre-industrial models. The motivation is conflicted (she must abandon her initial framework) and escalates when she realizes the paths are returning, not disappearing. The discovery forecloses her prior interpretive path with visible cost. Desire is shown through goal-driven action across multiple beats and shapes the closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Drifting moored" is established tonally in the opening (the station "moored permanently to bedrock" yet "drifting with the ancient pull of water") and sustained through Maya's cognitive state: anchored in expertise but uncertain about the data. The tone modulates with pressure—calm data study, quickening realization, the final stillness ("Maya's fingers stilled against the glass"). The oxymoron charges the final image ("fixed yet drifting with the ancient pull") and resonates thematically without becoming static. Tone is coherent through turns and supports the closure effect.</comment>
