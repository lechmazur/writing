<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority shows consistent scholarly caution and obsession with the shadow problem, and the final decision to "trace the final rune sequence" carries weight. However, the discovery that she is a shadow-self arrives late and is absorbed with surprising ease—no dramatized struggle between terror and acceptance, just "the quietly deliberate scholar warred with the terrified shadow-being" told in summary. The choice to merge feels pre-determined rather than wrestled from contradictory impulses acting simultaneously on the page. Embodied emotion remains thin at the pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors (observatory, Mira, post-spoon-bending reality) land cleanly in the opening. The key unlocks the hidden chamber, revealing the sleepers and reframing Mira's identity—a solid causal reversal that narrows options to merge or remain incomplete. Closure is Charged Poise: Mira traces the "return" rune and waits for noon, crystallizing the stakes with undeniable pressure. Cost is felt (foregoing independent existence) though the final act stops just short of consummation. The spoon-bending premise and loop-closure mechanics are seeded early and paid off, but the shadow-original reveal could tighten further if Mira's prior unease were more concretely foreshadowed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating observatory, brass dome, crystal walls, and hidden chamber are vividly realized and integral to the mystery. The clockwork key's magnetic resonances and the floor keyhole provide micro-setting texture that enables the turn. Spatial choreography (Mira sitting before her own case, the dome opening to pre-dawn sky) charges the final image. The nocturnal timeframe and "midnight pressed against the glass like dark water" anchor atmosphere without becoming ornamental. No occupational depth is required here; the scholar-rune work functions cleanly within the fantasy frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—solve the shadow problem and discover her own ontological status—is signaled early and pursued methodically. The key's discovery, the Codex study, and the magnetic mapping cohere into a single investigative pressure. The reveal that Mira is a shadow and the choice to merge or remain incomplete constitute one meaningful tightening with visible cost (losing independent existence vs. remaining translucent and incomplete). The escalation is primarily cognitive rather than externally contested; no antagonist complicates her decision, and the final beat is contemplative rather than forced by immediate danger. Still, agency is clear and the cost legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The shadow-substance dichotomy and the loop-closure metaphysics emerge organically from the rune-scholar premise and the spoon-bending world. The question "where do shadows go at noon" seeds the thematic inquiry early and pays off in the literalized answer: they return to their originals. The final image—Mira tracing "return" as dawn approaches—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the contrast between "quietly deliberate" scholarship and existential vertigo. The piece resists easy resolution; Mira's ultimate choice is poised but not enacted on the page, preserving meaningful ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled; Mira's perceptual signature (scholarly precision, obsessive pattern-matching) is distinct and consistent. Diction—"quietly deliberate," "rune-script that only became legible after spoons bent"—fits the voice. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext tests do not apply. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: close during the discovery, slightly withdrawn during exposition of the Codex lore. The phrase "quietly deliberate" recurs but feels voice-motivated rather than template. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The prose reflects Mira's methodical mind under rising pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance mystery or atmosphere. However, several passages loop or over-explain: "The question seemed trivial until she realized it was fundamental. If shadows could disappear without traveling, then space itself had seams" restates the same insight. "The quietly deliberate scholar in Mira warred with the terrified shadow-being who'd believed herself real" tells rather than showing the internal conflict in action. The phrase "quietly deliberate" appears three times, creating minor scaffold. The spoon-bending exposition ("when ordinary cutlery twisted into impossible geometries and rewrote the laws of causation") is vivid but slightly overwrought for a single beat. No major artifacts touch closure, so penalties remain moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The shadow-as-time-projection premise offers a fresh synthesis of familiar elements (consciousness in stasis, time loops, doppelgänger discovery). The spoon-bending inciting event is specific and memorable. The scholar's methodical investigation and the literal answer to "where do shadows go at noon" feel earned in hindsight rather than arbitrary. However, the sealed-sleepers twist closely echoes the "you are the copy" trope common in SF short fiction, and the rune-scholar frame is well-trodden in fantasy. The piece executes competently but does not take bold structural risks; the contemplative ending is appropriate but safe. Transformation is present but incremental.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's identity as a budding rune scholar frames every beat: she deciphers the key's microscopic runes, maps magnetic resonances, consults the Codex, and traces the final "return" sequence. Her scholarly method enables the discovery and constrains her choices (she must work through "every rune" before deciding). The trait appears in the opening, drives the middle investigative beats, and shapes the closure action. The scholar role is indispensable to the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The clockwork automaton key is handled in multiple beats: found embedded in the floor, it vibrates when Mira studies the Codex, grows warm at midnight alignment, unlocks the hidden chamber, and remains "warm in her hand" as she traces the final rune. Its teeth carry microscopic runes she deciphers, and it returns with reweighted meaning at closure—no longer merely decorative but the literal threshold to her original self. Removing the key would break the discovery sequence and the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sealed awakenings—consciousness stored in stasis with shadow-selves projected forward—is the core concept that redefines Mira's identity and the story's central question. The Codex describes it early; the hidden chamber reveals seven cases (including Mira and Kelm); the spoon-bending is reframed as "reality's loop closure." The concept shapes every tactic: Mira's obsession with vanishing shadows, her search for "seams" in space, and her final choice to merge or remain incomplete. The stakes and closure are unintelligible without it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Quietly deliberate" is mentioned three times and characterizes Mira's scholarly method, but it does not visibly constrain a high-stakes choice with cost. She proceeds methodically throughout—no beat where haste would solve a problem she refuses, or where deliberation costs her an opportunity. The trait colors her voice and approach but remains descriptive rather than causally active in shaping a turn or forfeiture.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Relearn" appears in the opening ("the old texts demanded relearning… every symbol now carried secondary meanings") and recurs implicitly: Mira has spent months deciphering the key, and she must work through "every rune she'd learned and relearned" before the noon deadline. The spoon-bending rewrote reality's rules, forcing scholars to reinterpret all texts. The action is integral to her capability and method, though swapping "relearn" for "decipher" or "decode" would not fundamentally break the plot—it is strongly integrated but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"By closing loops" is seeded early in the Codex description and becomes the literal mechanism: "Consciousness could be projected forward, creating a shadow-self… at noon… the loop could close." The method is not merely cosmetic; it explains why noon matters, why Mira feels translucent in sunlight, and why the observatory holds sleepers. The final choice hinges on voluntarily closing her loop. The mechanics shape the entire investigation and the stakes at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle provides isolation, wonder, and the literal stage for the discovery. The brass dome opening at midnight, the crystal walls, the hidden floor chamber, and the pre-dawn timing all constrain Mira's investigation and charge the final image. The setting is not merely backdrop; the floating isle drifts "toward inevitable noon," pressuring the decision. Removing the observatory or the floating-isle motif would weaken atmosphere and thematic resonance, though the core choice could survive in a different setting with edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "after spoons bend reality" timeframe is established in the opening and recurs: rune-meanings shifted post-bending, the Bent Constellation marks the sky, and the loop-closure became possible only after reality flexed. The time anchors world-rules and Mira's scholarly re-education. However, the timeframe functions primarily as backstory flavor; the immediate pressure comes from the approaching noon, not from the spoon-bending event itself. Swapping "spoons" for another reality-break symbol would require only surface edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira's obsession with "where shadows go at noon" is dramatized early ("The question seemed trivial until she realized it was fundamental") and drives every investigative beat: she searches for "seams" in space, studies the Codex, deciphers the key, and discovers the literal answer (they return to their originals). The motivation is conflicted at closure—she must choose between independent incompleteness and merged wholeness—with visible cost either way. The desire shapes the arc from inciting question to final decision.</comment>
