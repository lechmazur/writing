<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is established through her work as an "ignorance cartographer," but her motivation remains largely asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The night's work is summarized competently, but no moment shows her wrestling with contradictory impulses or internal stakes beyond fulfilling the commission. Embodied emotion is sparse; the quill feels "alive," but Maren's own physical and emotional state during this supposedly trembling threshold remains abstract. The final choice to descend is a completion without visible cost or character alteration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear situational frame—Maren writes three futures for the Council—and executes it cleanly. Orientation is solid (who, where, when by ~100 words). The closure is a Charged Poise: the futures are "suspended between the written page and the choices yet to come," crystallizing the options with conceptual cost (innovation may die, extraction may collapse, warmth may be found). However, the cost remains implied rather than viscerally legible on the page; no tactical constraint or price shapes Maren's night beyond the act of completion itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The obsidian spire, frozen lake, and circular chamber are vivid and purposeful, grounding the reader in a specific, cold, high-stakes environment. The spire's volcanic history becomes a narrative resource (thermal vents), directly affecting the third future and thus the closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren's professional lens. Minor slip: the kingfisher quill is described repeatedly but its tactile reality doesn't evolve or constrain a choice; it remains a beautiful object rather than a micro-setting element that pressures action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—predict futures and recommend innovations within constraints—is clear from the outset. The piece presents three futures with escalating clarity (Fortress, Extraction, Thermal), and the Thermal option introduces a tightening: constraints force "elegant" design. However, the escalation is expository rather than pressurized; Maren never faces a reversal, a failed model, or a choice that costs her something on the page. The "trembling threshold" of possibility is declared but not dramatized. Agency is limited to completion; no path is foreclosed with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: mapping ignorance, seeing beyond what is known, sustaining transformation over revolution. The thermal vents image—warmth beneath the ice—resonates without stating a moral. However, the final paragraph edges toward articulation: "their willingness to see beyond what they already knew" verges on thematic summary. The work earns its question (how to survive with limited resources) through particulars, but the answer feels more illustrated than discovered under pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; Maren's perceptual signature (cartographic vocabulary, "groundedly imaginative," "terra incognita") is distinct and consistent. The prose carries a professional, slightly elevated register appropriate to the intellectual work. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Minor weakness: at peak moments (dipping the quill, writing Future Three), diction remains uniform rather than modulating with urgency. The "trembling threshold" metaphor recurs but doesn't evolve rhythmically under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear, varied in syntax, and free of major loops or scaffolding. Sentence openings vary; paragraphs breathe. Information density is solid; each paragraph advances situation or stakes. Minor issues: "trembling threshold where possibility still breathed" leans purple without grounding; "the quill never faltered, the kingfisher's gift of precision" repeats the quill's symbolic role without fresh detail. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but figurative language occasionally substitutes for concrete action (e.g., "her predictive models flowering across the pages").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—ignorance cartographer mapping unknown unknowns—offers a fresh conceptual frame. The synthesis of predictive modeling, resource constraints, and geothermal solution shows ingenuity. However, the structure is familiar: expert fulfills commission, presents three options, one is best. The thermal vents twist is clever but arrives late and feels convenient (the spire itself is "evidence" of the solution). Risk-averse in execution; no failure or miscalculation pressures Maren's process. Transformation test: swap "ignorance cartographer" for "strategic analyst" and the arc holds with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Maren as ignorance cartographer frames the premise and her professional identity shapes the three futures she writes. However, her choices are expository rather than tactical; she completes the commission without a key reversal or decision that alters options. Present in setup and ending, but does not drive a middle beat with cost. Functional but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The kingfisher quill is described at unpacking, dipped into ink mixed with obsidian, and cleaned at dawn. It appears in three beats but remains ornamental: its "precision" and "flexibility" are asserted, not tested by a difficult stroke or faltering moment. It charges the atmosphere but does not constrain or enable a choice. Swappable with any evocative writing tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Writing the future shapes the entire structure: Maren writes three predictive futures, and the story contrasts "prophecy" with "groundedly imaginative" prediction. The concept appears in setup, development (three futures), and ending (futures "suspended"). It defines stakes and method. However, the writing itself is summarized rather than dramatized; no sentence or model resists her or forces a revision. Present across beats but not pressurized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Groundedly imaginative" is defined early ("one foot in hard data, the other in the terra incognita") and differentiates her from prophecy. However, it remains a label; no on-page moment shows Maren balancing the tension between data and imagination with cost. The thermal vents idea is presented as already complete, not as a risky leap. Told rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Prevail" is the story's governing verb: the colony must prevail, and Maren's work offers three paths to survival. The thermal future promises "sustaining transformation" rather than force. However, "prevail" is conceptual rather than actional; no beat dramatizes prevailing through a test. The word appears once in dialogue-free narration. Thematic presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Predictive modeling is signaled early ("probability lattices," "intricate predictive models woven from historical patterns") and grounds all three futures with survival percentages and failure weights. It shapes Maren's method and the specificity of her recommendations. However, the modeling process is summarized; no model breaks, surprises her, or forces a tactical shift. Present in setup and development, functional in closure, but mechanics remain opaque.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vividly present throughout: Maren climbs the spire, works in its summit chamber, uses powdered obsidian in her ink, and the spire's volcanic origin directly enables the thermal vents solution. Setting supplies a narrative resource that affects outcome. The final image—sun touching the spire's peak, lake stretching below—charges closure. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "before the pen meets the blank page" is announced as a "trembling threshold where possibility still breathed," framing the night's work. However, the phrase is metaphorical; once Maren begins writing, the temporal constraint dissolves. The night passes without a clock or fatigue tightening her choices. Dawn marks completion, but no deadline pressures tactics. Present in setup and ending, but does not escalate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Seeding innovation within constraint is Maren's explicit goal and the story's thematic engine. The thermal solution demonstrates this: "limitation forced elegance," and she repurposes existing equipment. The motivation is present in setup (the Council's "impossible task"), guides the three futures, and lands in closure. However, the constraint never bites; Maren never struggles against resource limits or discards an idea for lack of materials. Told more than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tone is steady, contemplative, and intellectually precise, matching the premise of measured transformation over "sudden revolution." The prose modulates slightly—faster syntax when writing Future Three, calmer at dawn—but remains controlled throughout. The final image (warmth beneath ice, "choices yet to come") sustains the transformative register. Coherent across beats, though a single static elevation rather than dynamic pressure. Charges the ending without jarring notes.</comment>
