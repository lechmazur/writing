<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcella's interiority shows specificity in her cataloging obsession and the frequency-based worldview, but her emotional progression reads too smooth—tears arrive on cue without embodied contradiction. The sister Elena remains a backstory construct whose humanitarian work is told rather than dramatized in present choices. The final epiphany about "courage to bear witness" feels awarded rather than earned through on-page friction, and the therapeutic clarity ("empathy doesn't require protection") flattens what could be contradictory grief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure (Charged Poise: the clasp opens and Marcella gains access, reweighting her understanding of Elena's silence). Cost is present but muted—Marcella sheds tears and gains insight, yet no live option is foreclosed on the page. The causal chain from frequency-tuning to clasp-opening relies on metaphorical logic ("the frequency of love itself") that borders on convenient, but the piece teaches its pattern early and the ending reconfigures prior silences with undeniable thematic weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shadowed workshop with open roof panels and starlight filtering through is vividly anchored early and sustained. Sensory detail is selective: "copper dials," "purple-stained fingers," "brass clasp," fireworks overhead provide concrete anchors that reflect Marcella's priority (the lock, the tools). The diary positioned between speakers and the warming clasp under her touch function as micro-setting that shapes the climactic beat. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: recover what Elena locked away. Pressure accumulates through Marcella's attempts at different frequencies (hesitation, protective silence, love) in a tightening pattern that narrows to the precise vibration needed. The clasp opening is a tightening under the Accumulative lens, and the diary's contents reweight Marcella's fear into understanding. However, the resolution feels awarded by metaphor rather than forced by a tangible trade-off; no live option or resource is visibly spent to achieve the unlock, reducing felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from Marcella's cataloging of silence varieties and Elena's cataloging of resilience, converging without overt statement in the final image of "the silence that follows revelation." The locked diary and its protective closure embody the thematic question of bearing witness versus shielding, and the ending offers a non-literal answer through the clasp's transformation. Minor slip: "empathy begins not in comfort, but in the courage to bear witness without looking away" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary, though it remains tied to Marcella's realization rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Marcella with a distinct perceptual signature: she notices frequencies, textures of silence, molecular structure through touch. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close at the tuning attempts, slightly zoomed during the diary reading. The theatrical self-address ("Every lock remembers the hand that closed it") fits her established voice. Minor diction drift: "bloom" for understanding and "luminous" feel slightly elevated for the technical-sensory texture established earlier, but not enough to break coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening third; the frequency-tuning sequence advances pressure through concrete image. However, the final third shows paraphrase loops: "cataloging human silence and human endurance were two paths toward the same destination" restates the diary's contents just summarized, and "her sister's voice teaching her that empathy begins…" recaps the insight already shown. "Varieties of silence" / "varieties of resilience" is purposeful parallelism but borders on mechanical. No major filter-verb stacks or template cadence, but the closure beat could tighten by one or two lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The frequency-unlocking mechanism offers a fresh angle on grief-and-recovery material, and the twin cataloging (silence vs. resilience) is a non-obvious synthesis. The workshop-under-stars and the fireworks as counterpoint to the quiet unlocking provide specific texture. However, the "humanitarian aid worker's final diary" and "locked secret that turns out to be hope, not horror" follow familiar emotional arcs. The theatrical sincerity and the metaphor of frequencies as persuasion elevate execution but do not fully escape the template of "surviving sibling learns lesson from the departed."</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcella's pacifism is signaled early ("never believed in violence, not even…forcing open a lock") and shapes her method (persuasion through frequencies rather than force). It informs the tuning sequence and the final understanding that Elena's pacifism was different. However, the trait does not create a key turn or constrain a choice with visible cost—Marcella never faces a moment where force would solve the problem faster and she must renounce it. Present across beats and thematically active at closure, but not indispensable to the plot's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The locked diary clasp is introduced in paragraph two, returns in the tuning sequence (trembles, grows warm), clicks open at the climax, and is referenced again in the final paragraph ("the clasp now willing to open whenever asked"). It is handled physically across multiple beats and its state change (locked → open, resistant → willing) embodies the thematic shift. The clasp's warming under "intuitively descriptive touch" and its final transformation tie directly to closure. Removing it would collapse the story's central mechanism and image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The path to empathy is declared as theme in the opening (Marcella's belief in persuasion) and the ending (empathy requires witness, not protection). It shapes Marcella's tuning choices—she seeks the frequency of protective silence, then love—as tactical steps toward understanding. The diary's contents (witnessing resilience) dramatize the concept. However, "empathy" itself does not constrain an on-page choice with trade-off; it functions more as interpretive frame than as a force that narrows options. Present early and at closure, but not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" is introduced mid-story ("her intuitively descriptive touch—she could feel its molecular structure, sense the emotion crystallized within the metal") and enables the climactic frequency-tuning by letting Marcella perceive the clasp's emotional history. The trait is not signaled in the opening third, appears label-only in one line, and does not visibly constrain a choice or impose cost—it is a convenient capability that solves the problem. Late signal and ornamental phrasing lower the score despite its functional role in the unlock.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Recover" is the stated goal in paragraph two ("she worked to recover what her late sister had locked away") and drives the entire tuning sequence. Every beat serves this action: cataloging silences, positioning the diary, adjusting frequencies, opening the clasp, reading the contents. The final paragraph confirms recovery ("recovering not just a diary but a legacy"). The action is present early, middle, and closure, and the story's structure would collapse without it. High score; not 8.5+ because the action itself is straightforward retrieval—complexity comes from method, not from redefining the goal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tuning frequencies is signaled in the opening paragraph ("persuasion through frequencies, finding the precise vibration") and detailed across the middle beats: frequency of hesitation, protective silence, love. The method's mechanics matter—Marcella adjusts dials, the workshop fills with specific sounds, the clasp responds physically. The unlock depends on this exact means; swapping it for a key or password would break the thematic and causal logic. Present early, drives the escalation sequence, and shapes the closure image. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The shadowed workshop under stars is anchored in the opening line and sustained: open roof panels, starlight filtering, salvaged equipment, telescope parts, theremin from copper pipes. The setting supplies the tools (speakers, dials, resonance chambers) that enable the frequency method and the open roof allows fireworks to intrude at closure, contrasting theatrical display with quiet revelation. The workshop's particulars (copper, brass, eclectic salvage) reinforce Marcella's character. Setting constrains method and charges the final image; solid integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"The final stillness before fireworks ignite" is named in paragraph two and the fireworks explode overhead at the climax and continue during the ending. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Marcella works at her own pace, and there is no indication that the fireworks' start imposes a deadline or alters her tactics. The element provides atmosphere and a symbolic counterpoint (public celebration vs. private recovery) but does not function as a live clock that narrows options. Present early and at closure, but ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Cataloging the varieties of silence is Marcella's stated practice ("two decades cataloging") and informs her frequency-tuning method. The desire is dramatized in her choice of which frequencies to try (hesitation, protective silence, love) and recurs in the final image ("the silence that follows revelation"). The parallel with Elena's cataloging of resilience charges the thematic payoff. However, the cataloging itself does not face friction or cost on the page—Marcella's want aligns smoothly with her method. Present early, shapes tactics, and participates in closure, but lacks visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theatrical sincerity is named explicitly ("her voice carrying theatrical sincerity" in paragraph four) and modeled in Marcella's self-address to the workshop and her treatment of the lock as animate. The tone persists through the tuning beats (she speaks to the clasp, the stars "watch") and modulates at the ending into quieter reverence ("Marcella had found something more luminous"). The tone is coherent and charges the final contrast between fireworks' spectacle and the workshop's intimate revelation. However, "theatrical sincerity" as a phrase is told more than demonstrated through rhythm or diction—execution is clean but not indispensable.</comment>
