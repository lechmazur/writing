<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation—to preserve walkers' knowledge—is clear and drives the sacrifice choice. Her "strangely honest" trait is stated but its constraining effect on tactics is thin. The final consecration choice carries visible cost (partial consciousness woven into stone), though the embodied struggle could deepen. Internal contradiction is present but muted; she moves toward sacrifice without significant competing impulse on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: Maya in the pavilion, third morning, prophet arrives. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through ritual description and dialogue toward the consecration act. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Maya commits to weaving herself into the parapet, forecloses her full autonomous life with felt cost. The tightening is legible but gentle; the cost statement ("part of me will remain") is told more than shown in the final image. One meaningful deepening present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet, murmuring pavilion, and singing dunes constrain choice: only line walkers can read the stones' language, and Maya's ritual walk engages the structure actively. Sensory detail is vivid and purpose-driven (vibrations, pressure-sensitive stones, harmonics). The parapet's response to Maya's steps charges the closure image. Micro-setting (the pavilion and parapet beneath) drives the consecration act. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the echo before it fades—signals early and coheres. One meaningful tightening: the prophet's statement "consecration requires sacrifice" narrows Maya's path, and she accepts the cost on the page. Agency is clear (decision to consecrate with visible cost: partial consciousness embedded). The escalation is gentle under the Accumulative lens; the ritual walk and prophet's witness deepen pressure, but no sharp reversal tests commitment. Cost is legible but could be more viscerally felt in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—preserving living knowledge versus silence—emerges through particulars (kinetic parapet, peripheral awareness, conjured clearings). The ending offers a resonant image: "alive in the spaces between footsteps" reweights prior material without moralizing. Maya's arc (willingness to sacrifice self for communal memory) integrates with the thematic question. Subtext operates in gesture and the prophet's calm witness. The final paragraph edges toward thematic echo ("It would hold. It would remember") but remains imagistic enough to avoid sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable single third, clean focalization through Maya. Diction is controlled and distinct: "kinetic parapet," "whisperfield calm," "conjured clearings" build a coherent voice. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and advances the stake. Perceptual signature is present (peripheral awareness, half-mask, soles-of-boots reading). Register remains consistent; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is managed well. Some stock phrasing in interiority ("strangely honest," "touch the echo") but voice holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; information density is high in the opening and middle. Minor scaffold detected: "the prophet said" / "Maya said" alternation is functional but slightly mechanical. "Touch the void," "touch the echo" is near-repetition. Figurative language ("desert thinks," "kinetic parapet rose like breaths") is vivid but sometimes borders decorative. Final paragraph ("It would hold. It would remember") uses parallelism purposefully but risks loop. No major clarity breaks; propulsion is steady but gentle. Zero hard artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The combination—line walker, kinetic parapet, conjured clearings, consecration—feels specific and fresh. "Peripheral awareness" as method and "murmuring pavilion" as setting avoid generic templates. Emotional truth (willingness to embed self for communal memory) elevates the premise beyond surface novelty. The transformation test holds: changing names/places would weaken resonance. No close echoes of famous work detected. The ending avoids the explain-everything trap and offers a charged image. Risk-taking is present but quiet; the piece commits fully to its premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's choice to consecrate—entering the final sequence, beginning the weaving—creates the key turn. She is present throughout, signals her intention early, and her final act drives closure. Two beats: dialogue with prophet, then ritual walk. Causal pressure: her decision forecloses her autonomous future. Closure linkage strong. Specific cost tied to character.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kinetic parapet is handled in multiple beats: initial description (pressure-sensitive stones, rising/falling), Maya's ritual walk (stones rising like breaths, pulsing in rhythm), and closure (her awareness woven into parapet's memory). It constrains choice (only line walkers can read it) and charges the final image. Early signal, two distinct beats, closure participation, specificity all present. Irreplaceable: removing it breaks the consecration logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Conjured clearings" is explained (spaces carved from chaos where meaning takes root), frames Maya's goal (to make the pavilion a living archive), and is present in the final image ("a new clearing was conjured"). Early signal, shapes the dominant stake, and appears at closure. Causal role is present but light: it's more thematic vessel than tactical constraint. Swappable with "sanctuary" or "memory-space" with minor edits. Two gates (setup, payoff); middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Strangely honest" is stated early ("She was strangely honest for someone in her profession") and Maya's forthright explanation to the prophet reflects it. But the trait does not visibly constrain or enable a key choice with cost; most line walkers could speak plainly here. Label-only mention without tactical friction. Setup present, middle/payoff weak. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Consecrate" is signaled early ("I mean to consecrate this place"), drives the dialogue turn (prophet: "consecration requires sacrifice"), and structures the final sequence (Maya begins consecration, becomes part of parapet's memory). The action redefines options: Maya cannot preserve knowledge without embedding herself. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, cost connection, specificity all strong. Removing "consecrate" breaks the logic and ending image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Peripheral awareness—never looking directly, never forcing" is named and demonstrated in Maya's ritual walk. It is signaled mid-story, shapes one beat (the sensing of patterns), and is mentioned again at closure ("those who would learn to listen with more than ears, to see with more than eyes"). Two touches, causal role light, closure participation present but oblique. Setup weak (not in first third); middle and payoff present. Could be replaced with "intuitive attunement" without major loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion is present throughout: silk walls catching vibrations, central cushion where prophet sits, edge where Maya steps, murmuring growing melodic. It supplies the space for the consecration ritual and responds to Maya's movements (murmuring deepens, grows attentive). Early signal, multiple beats, closure participation (pavilion holds the new clearing). Constrains action: the ritual must occur here. Micro-setting that alters tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the prophet arrives" anchors the opening ("third morning," "Maya had been waiting") but time is not tracked as a live constraint. No ticking clock or deadline pressure; the conversation and ritual unfold without urgency. Setup present, middle/payoff absent. Time could be dilated or compressed without altering tactics or cost. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To preserve the echo of wisdom" is stated early, dramatized in Maya's explanation to the prophet, and drives the sacrifice choice. Friction between want (preserve knowledge) and cost (embed consciousness) is present. Two beats: dialogue establishing motive, final act fulfilling it. Causal pressure and closure linkage strong. Desire shapes the consecration choice with felt cost. Not just told; the ending enacts it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Whisperfield calm" is named once and the pavilion's murmuring, the dunes' low frequencies, and the prophet's witnessing all support a hushed, reverent tone. Tone modulates slightly (murmuring grows melodic, then deepens) but remains coherent through the ritual. The final image ("patient as stone, fluid as sand, alive in the spaces between footsteps") charges the calm with durability. Coherent and purposeful; tone supports closure withoutatic monotony.</comment>
