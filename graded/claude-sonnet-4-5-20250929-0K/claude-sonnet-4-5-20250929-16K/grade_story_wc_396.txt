<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's interior is richly embodied through shadow-sense and perception, and her motivation to reconstitute peace through empathy is dramatized in choices (offering the fragment, directing attention to the children). The two leaders' interiorities are accessed cleanly via her shadow power without head-hopping. Minor deduction: the elders' emotional pivot feels slightly rapid given decades of feud, though the fragment mechanism earns some of the shift; embodied contradictory impulses are present but could be sharper in the climactic breath.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory expansion (shadow unfurling, mirror visions, fragment passing) and crystallizes in the leaders' shared smile and request. Closure is a Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: the elders' "Tell us how" and Kael's reply reweight the feud into collaborative possibility, with visible cost (decades of pride foreclosed, vulnerability exposed). One deduction: the cost could be more sharply specified in a concrete image or forfeiture in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard—apple trees thriving in salt-wind, ice floes groaning below—constrains the peace talk spatially and charges the final image (boys collaborating for the branch). The circular room with maritime windows and vintage mirrors grounds action. The setting's impossibility (fruit in cold) is purposeful, mirroring the impossible peace Kael seeks, and the shifting ice becomes a resonant metaphor for reconstitution without being stated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resolving the fishing-rights feud—is signaled early and tightens through Kael's shadow visions and the fragment exchange. The elders' request "Tell us how" is a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, forecloses the collision path, and shifts both leaders' stances. Pressure is coherent throughout. Minor gap: the cost of reconciliation (loss of pride, decades of enmity ended) is felt but could be more vividly specified in tactical trade-offs or a concrete forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of reconstitution through shadow-revealed truth emerges concretely from mirror visions, the fragment, and the ice-floe metaphor. The piece resists moralizing; Kael's insight "peace wasn't the absence of shadows, but the courage to let them reveal what must be reconstituted" is embedded in dramatized action rather than thesis-statement. The final image (shadows dancing with light, empathy-map) offers a resonant, non-literal answer. One phrase—"map empathy onto action"—edges toward abstraction but is quickly grounded in the fragment exchange.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Kael; her perceptual signature (shadow-sense, intuitive reading) is distinct and consistent. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: the elders' lines carry subtext and pursue goals. Register occasionally elevates ("shadow-laced peacekeeper," "weighted breath...thick as fog") but remains voice-motivated and legible. Minor slip: "Tell us how" / "We begin" dialogue could be more idiomatic under stress; the phrasing reads slightly formal for a breakthrough moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong figurative work: "moved through disputes like twilight through trees," "ice floes groaned and separated." Information density is high. Two deductions: mild overwriting in the opening third ("shadow-laced," "impossible fruit," "weighted breath...thick as fog" cluster within 150 words without pattern-teaching). One paraphrase loop near closure: "gathering fragments" echoes earlier "scattered truths...reshaping" within three lines without added pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse orchard, shadow-peacekeeper, and crystal-fragment mediation is specific and memorable. The premise—using darkness and broken mirrors to see truth—transforms the peacekeeper archetype. Minor deduction: the "impossible fruit thriving in salt-wind" detail, while evocative, functions more as symbolic ornament than causal constraint; the orchard could be replaced with another setting without breaking the reconstitution logic. The emotional truth and empathy-map concept are earned through particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael as shadow-laced peacekeeper drives the structure: she initiates the fragment exchange, unfurls shadows to access mirror visions, and redirects the elders' attention to the children. Her choices create the key turn (offering the fragment) and shape closure (the reconstitution offer). Present in setup, development (shadow manipulation), and payoff (final exchange). High causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crystal ball fragment is handled in two distinct beats: Kael holds it while shadow-sensing (middle) and passes it to the elders (climax). It enables the emotional transmission and is linked to her village's shattering, adding personal cost. Present in setup (introduced early with backstory anchor), development (shadow conduit), and payoff (the exchange moment). Swappability is low—another object would lack the "fragment/reconstitute" thematic resonance—but the fragment's mechanics are not sharply specified; it reads somewhat symbolic rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Courageous anomaly" is introduced as a label ("called a courageous anomaly since arriving") and thematically echoed in Kael's practice of wielding darkness/seeking reflection. It frames her outsider status but does not constrain a specific on-page choice with visible cost; the same peace-negotiation could unfold if she were simply "a peacekeeper." Present in setup and thematic payoff, absent from middle development. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" is demonstrated throughout: Kael reads "the pain beneath raised voices," times the fragment offer, and lets shadows guide the elders' attention to the children. It enables her tactical choices (when to unfurl shadows, what to show in mirrors). Present in all three gates. One deduction: the cost or limit of intuition is not tested; she reads correctly every time without misfire or ambiguity that would raise stakes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" is the action anchoring the entire arc: Kael's goal is to reconstitute peace from scattered truths, mirroring her village's shattering. The fragment exchange and mirror visions enact it literally and metaphorically. The climax hinges on the word: "we can...reconstitute—piece by piece, truth by truth." Present in setup (introduced with fragment backstory), development (mirror gathering), and payoff (explicit thematic turn). High causal centrality and irreplaceability; removing "reconstitute" would break the closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vintage store mirrors are signaled early, used in the middle beat (shadow-sense reveals elder's childhood, rival's secret kindness), and shape the ending ("in the mirrors on the wall, her shadows danced"). Mechanics matter: the mirrors are portals via shadow-sense, and their salvaged, tarnished state fits the reconstitution theme. Present in all three gates. Minor gap: the mirrors' specific properties (why vintage, why store mirrors) are not causally necessary; other reflective surfaces could serve.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard perched above shifting ice floes anchors every beat and charges the closure: ice groaning/separating parallels the feud and reconstitution; the boys reaching for an apple in the orchard supplies the key redirection moment; the maritime room with apple trees frames the negotiation spatially. Present in setup, pressures the middle (orchard window view), and charges the ending image. One deduction: the ice floes' shifting is thematically resonant but does not constrain a tactical choice; Kael's methods would work in another high-stakes liminal setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"The weighted breath before reply" is introduced as a suspension moment and frames the shadow-vision sequence, but time remains vague: the story does not track whether seconds or minutes pass, and the breath's duration does not tighten decisions. Present in setup (the opening suspended moment) and thematically echoed at closure, but absent from middle development as a live pressure. Swappable with "a pause" or "a silence."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To map empathy onto action" is Kael's explicit motivation, dramatized through every choice: unfurling shadows, showing mirror truths, offering the fragment, guiding attention to the children. Present in all three gates and drives the reconstitution offer at closure. One deduction: the phrasing "map empathy onto action" appears as an abstraction mid-story, slightly undercutting the otherwise concretely embodied motivation; the concept is strong but the phrase reads instructional.</comment>
