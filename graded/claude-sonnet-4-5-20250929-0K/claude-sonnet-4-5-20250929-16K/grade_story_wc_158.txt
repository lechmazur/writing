<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The poet's motivation is clear and sustained, but her arc is primarily contemplative rather than conflicted. The interiority leans abstract ("photosynthesize pain into beauty") and occasionally label-heavy. Mira's characterization as "shyly unstoppable" functions better when dramatized through action than when announced. The ending shift—from solitary work to collaboration—feels earned by the planting scene but lacks visible internal resistance or cost that would raise the stakes of this choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean: who, where, and when anchor by paragraph two. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through images (postcards, wind-song, bulb) and culminates in a cadence shift at closure when the poet "felt something close to rest." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the final decision reweights centuries of solitary creation with collaborative hope. Cost is implied (collaborative risk, relinquishing solitude) but remains felt rather than dramatized on the page, which holds the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is vividly anchored and recurs purposefully: pearlescent interior, spiral chambers, soil in the deepest chamber. The bulb's planting in that chamber ties setting to closure. Sensory detail (starlight, dust plains, wind howling) is selective and POV-filtered. The shell constrains the action by offering the only soil for the bulb, which elevates integration and directly charges the final collaborative beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: transform longing into sustaining beauty. Mira's arrival with the bulb provides one meaningful tightening that shifts the poet from solitary creation to shared planting. The escalation is gentle rather than sharp; the piece accumulates pressure through imagery and tone rather than reversals. Cost is legible—collaborative vulnerability, departure from centuries of habit—but remains understated, which fits the Accumulative lens but caps the intensity band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the "blossom armistice" poem (beauty coexisting with brevity and grief) and is dramatized through the cherry-bulb planting. Subtext operates in Mira's humming, the poet's rusty voice, and the wind's lullaby. The final image—planting something that might outlive them—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "photosynthesize pain into beauty" borders on thesis-speak, though it's attributed to the character's creative method rather than authorial commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on the poet; distance and tense hold. Voice carries a distinct lyric texture: "reef-shadow joy," "shyly unstoppable," "ensconce." Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven. One minor register slip: "photosynthesize" and "reef-shadow" feel slightly over-curated for a narrator describing desperate survival on a dying planet, though the elevated diction is consistent enough to read as intentional style rather than drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Two frictions pull the score down: "via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" repeats the "off-key" descriptor awkwardly within the same sentence, and "ensconce the bulb" leans purple where "plant" or "nest" would sharpen momentum. Sentence openings vary; no paraphrase loops. Information density is high. The closure image is clean and propulsive, but earlier beats carry slight overwriting that dulls immediacy without obscuring cause.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic poet-gardener premise is familiar but executed with specificity: the shell as sanctuary, postcards as defiance network, the cherry bulb as Earth-stock relic. The blossom armistice concept—beauty and sorrow coexisting—transforms the trope through the planting beat and shared humming. The ending avoids easy epiphany by offering "something close to rest" rather than resolution. No close echoes of famous work detected, and the combination of elements feels organic rather than checklist-driven.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The insomniac poet is present throughout and makes the key closure choice to collaborate ("Let's make them beautiful"). Setup is immediate; development shows her receiving the postcard and then Mira. Closure participation is clear but the decision itself is low-friction—no visible internal resistance dramatized on the page. The three-hundred-year insomnia functions more as atmospheric backdrop than constraint that narrows options in the planting scene.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The galaxy postcard appears early (setup gate met) and is pinned to the wall with "dozens of others," establishing the correspondence network. It does not return or constrain a later choice (no development or payoff gate). The postcards as a category motivate Mira's plan to press petals, but the specific galaxy card remains ornamental after its first beat. Swappable with any other postcard design.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "blossom armistice" is introduced mid-story as a prior poem and dramatized through the cherry bulb planting: "beauty inseparable from brevity." It shapes the thematic stakes and Mira's plan to send pressed petals. Setup is delayed (second half), but development and payoff are strong—the concept directly informs the closure choice and charges the final image of planting. The poet's reflective gloss risks telling over showing, but the bulb action embodies the idea with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Shyly unstoppable" is attributed to Mira in narration ("the poet had written of her once") and then demonstrated when she enters and proposes planting together. Setup and development gates met; closure linkage is present (she hums, digs, and shares the plan). The trait enables the key collaborative turn but does not visibly constrain or cost Mira anything on the page—she succeeds without friction. Functional but closer to character color than causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Ensconce" appears once, describing the act of nestling the bulb into soil in the deepest chamber. Setup is late (final third) but the action is the story's physical closure beat and embodies the thematic armistice. Development is thin (no prior preparation dramatized), but payoff is total—the planting crystallizes the collaborative shift and charges the ending. The word choice itself is slightly purple, but the action it names is indispensable to the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" describes the nightly wind-song twice but does not shape any choice or tactic. Setup is early; no development or payoff. Mira hums "harmonizing with the wind's strange music," which gestures toward the method, but the wind itself remains atmospheric rather than causal. The lullaby frame could be cut without altering the planting or closure; the method is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell anchors every beat: the poet lives inside it, postcards hang on its walls, and the deepest chamber holds soil that makes planting possible. Setup immediate, development continuous (the spiral descent is purposeful), payoff decisive—without the shell's soil, the closure action fails. Spatial choreography is clean and the shell's unique properties (size, visibility, chambers, soil concentration) are irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Across centuries of longing" is established early and colors the poet's endless waking, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions in the present scene. The three hundred years function as context for her fatigue and the weight of her choice to collaborate, but no clock or deadline narrows her options when Mira arrives. Setup met; development and payoff are thematic rather than tactical. The span charges the ending emotionally but does not constrain it causally.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to photosynthesize pain into beauty" is stated early and demonstrated through the postcard constellation and the poet's nightly writing. Setup and development met. The planting scene enacts a shift—collaborative creation rather than solitary transformation—so payoff is present. However, the motivation is somewhat told rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices; the poet's internal friction (centuries of habit versus new partnership) is implied but not enacted with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Reef-shadow joy" is attributed to Mira's voice once and colors her entrance and the planting scene. The tone—melancholy hope, beauty amid ruin—is coherent across beats and modulates appropriately (the poet's fatigue, Mira's warmth, the quiet ending). Setup mid-story, development and payoff present. The phrase itself is striking but appears only once as a label; the tone it names is sustained through action and image (humming, shared digging, the bulb "dreaming of spring"), which elevates integration above mere decoration.</comment>
