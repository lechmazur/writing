<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Layla's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—the freeze response, the palms-flat ritual, the pearl metaphor functioning as a micro-choice anchor. Internal conflict shows simultaneous impulses (wanting to be present while the body keeps score). The ending micro-choice to return to the cuttings after the helicopter trigger earns the stance without therapy-speak intruding at closure. Minor deduction: the "anchoring optimism in realism" phrase in the school-group passage leans slightly abstract for peak interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Layla, arboretum, dawn, clifftop). The helicopter beat forces a stance crystallization via the pearl ritual; the return to cuttings afterward is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—endurance that forecloses escape with felt cost. Closure lands on-page with visible cost: she presses into soil knowing "it was enough... it had to be... almost was" reweights the opening's "quietly talented" survival into a daily renunciation. The inferred lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The arboretum functions as micro-setting: glass walls provide the tactile anchor for the freeze ritual, Mediterranean specimens reflect survival tactics, clifftop exposure mirrors vulnerability. The helicopter intrusion demonstrates spatial constraint—she must walk to the glass to re-ground. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (rosemary scent "sharp and clean," soil texture under fingers). The setting charges the final image: pressing into "dark, rich earth" contrasts the salt wind and automated beacon, grounding the choice to tend rather than flee.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: endure the day's triggers (helicopter, incoming children) without breaking. The helicopter beat provides one meaningful tightening—pulse spikes, vision blurs—then the protagonist's agency (walk to glass, count waves) earns the easing with visible cost: "not perfect. Not whole. But enough." The final return to lavender cuttings crystallizes the stance under accumulative pressure. No reversal required; the deepening shows her ritual working with limits acknowledged. Cost is legible: surviving the violence "and also the endless, ordinary after."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the photograph's worn-soft paper, the automated beacon sweeping emptily, plants "clinging to its cliff." The pearl metaphor develops from alarm-quieting to the final soil-pressing without stating a moral. The ending offers a resonant answer to the survival question: "to tend what could still grow. To freeze when she must, then thaw again" reweights the opening without summary. The "endless, ordinary after" phrase and "it had to be... almost was" cadence avoid sentimentality while admitting incompleteness. Minor: "anchoring optimism in realism" reads slightly prompt-like in the school-group passage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is concrete (soil moisture checks, pruning dead growth). Psychic distance shifts purposefully—tight on the helicopter trigger, wider on the morning tasks. Diction remains within Layla's lexicon except one phrase: "anchoring optimism in realism" in the school-group beat feels slightly elevated for her internal voice under preparation stress. The photograph handling and ritual gestures create rhythmic control. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The final paragraph's cadence ("This was the work... It was enough") modulates voice under earned pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every line advances character or pressure. Rhythm varies naturally with stress (short bursts during the helicopter trigger, longer syntax in the propagation tasks). Minor loop: "It was enough. It had to be. And some days, like today, it almost was" is intentional cadence but borders repetition without added detail. One filter-verb cluster ("begin to ease," "formed slowly") in the recovery beat slightly dulls immediacy. No clarity breaks; the prose propels cleanly to closure with concrete images anchoring each beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "pearl of stillness" metaphor is fresh and integrated into the freeze-thaw cycle without gimmickry. The automated lighthouse detail subtly mirrors her solitary survival work. The wedding-photo beat and the arboretum's cliff-edge persistence feel lived-in rather than symbolic convenience. The ending's honest incompleteness ("it almost was") resists tidy resolution. Minor: the trauma-survivor-finds-grounding-in-nature frame is familiar; the piece elevates it through somatic specificity and the accumulative lens, but the core arc is recognizable. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Layla's survivor status is signaled early (wedding photograph, "Eleven survived"), shapes the helicopter freeze response (middle beat with visible cost), and drives the final choice to return to the cuttings despite the trigger. Her choices—walk to glass, count waves, press into soil—create the key turn from panic to earned stasis. The element is indispensable: without the trauma history, the freeze-thaw cycle and the "endless, ordinary after" lose all pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The photograph appears in three beats: opening pocket-carry, midpoint unfolding over the potting bench, and final tuck "against her heart." Each touch reweights its meaning: anchor → confrontation with loss → renewed talisman. The crinkle sound cues the unfolding; the worn-soft texture is specific. However, the photograph does not constrain a choice—she unfolds it, then simply returns it. It resonates thematically but does not alter tactics or close the ending image. Lyric reprise with cost justifies mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "pearl of stillness" is introduced early ("small, luminous moment when the body's alarm finally quieted"), dramatized in the helicopter beat (layers forming "microscopic" over fear), and shapes the ending stance ("not perfect. Not whole. But enough"). The concept drives on-page choices: she stops work, walks to glass, counts waves to achieve the pearl. The metaphor is specific (pearl = irritant coated in calm) and irreplaceable. Minor: the concept appears more as method than high-stakes goal, but it constrains her tactics under pressure and charges closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Quietly talented" is shown through her propagation skill, understanding of which plants need shelter, and the director hiring her "without questions." The trait enables her job and survival but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. It appears as baseline competence rather than a contested ability. The talent supports the setting's credibility and her access to the space but remains largely ornamental to the helicopter-trigger beat. Two-gate presence (setup, development via plant knowledge) but no closure linkage caps it near 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The freeze action is seeded early (body "keeps score," "freeze, muscles locked"), enacted in the helicopter beat ("made her freeze—a helicopter, low and fast"), and drives the central turn. The freeze is irreplaceable: swapping it for generic panic would erase the somatic specificity and the thaw ritual's logic. The action defines her constraint (involuntary lock-up) and her learned counter-tactic (walk to glass, count). It appears in the final image via the thaw cycle: "freeze when she must, then thaw again." Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through somatic markers" is signaled early ("the trauma lived on... the body keeps score") and mechanics matter: distant plane drone sends heart racing, sudden noises freeze muscles, shoulders tighten as early warning. The method shapes her learned response (palms on glass, wave-counting) and the helicopter beat demonstrates the full sequence. The final paragraph echoes it: "freeze when she must, then thaw again." The method is somewhat abstract but drives two beats and closure linkage. Minor: "somatic markers" as phrasing leans clinical; the embodied description does the real work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The arboretum is present from the opening line, provides the glass wall (tactile anchor for ritual), supplies the lavender cuttings (ending task), and the clifftop exposure mirrors vulnerability. The setting pressures choices: she must prepare for the school group, the open space admits the helicopter sound, the conservatory glass becomes her grounding surface. The final image—pressing fingers into soil while automated light sweeps—uses the setting to charge closure. The Mediterranean plants (survival metaphor) and cliff edge (persistent growth) are irreplaceable details. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse keeper detail appears in the opening paragraph ("retired three years ago, replaced by solar panels") and the final paragraph ("automated light swept emptily"). It establishes mood (human attention replaced by automation, Layla as last keeper of living things) but does not tighten a decision or alter tactics. The timeframe is thematically resonant but functionally replaceable—removing it would not break the helicopter trigger or the school-group prep. Two-beat lyric reprise without middle development or causal pressure caps it under 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To anchor optimism in realism" is stated explicitly in the school-group passage ("conscious choice to anchor optimism in realism, to believe that the world contained both what happened to her and what was happening here"). The motivation is dramatized in her preparation for the children and the decision to return to the cuttings after the trigger. However, the phrase itself reads slightly abstract and prompt-like. The ending enacts the motivation ("to tend what could still grow") with cost acknowledged ("it almost was"). Present in setup and closure but the label-statement in the middle beat lowers specificity.</comment>
