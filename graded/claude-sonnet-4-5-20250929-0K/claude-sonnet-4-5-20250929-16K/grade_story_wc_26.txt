<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior is vivid and specific—the river stone, her profession, her sustained observation of Lyssa across decades. Her motivation to document and her parallel understanding of why the work is "impotent" create layered interiority. However, the character remains observational; she makes no on-page choice that forecloses a path or alters tactics under pressure. The ending gesture (stone against glass) is poetic but does not constitute a meaningful cost or decision that changes her situation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates detail around hope's erosion and lands on a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the stone pressed to glass, smudge fading, "most honest thing she'd documented all day"—that reweights the documentation work with felt cost. Orientation is clear by ~80 words (Maren, library, profession). The closure image carries conceptual weight (authenticity vs. archival performance) but the cost remains oblique; Maren's situation is unchanged, and no live option is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Cloudspire Library setting is vivid and purposeful: golden hour, impossible gardens, flowers that "never died because they'd never truly lived" anchor the theme. The river stone functions as micro-setting, handled twice (pocket, pressed to glass) and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (Preservation Wing, library edge, transparent walls). The setting supplies thematic pressure but does not constrain a present-tense choice or tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: documenting hope's erosion. The piece presents Lyssa's transformation as evidence but offers no on-page tightening or escalation for Maren herself. Maren's task is "softly deliberate" from start to finish; no reversal or deepening alters her options. The final gesture (stone to glass) registers resignation but does not foreclose a path or force a trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates thematically but does not cohere into a visible, felt cost for the protagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—hope's erosion by commodification—emerges organically from Lyssa's paired recordings, the library's airborne remove, and the river stone's weight. The final image (smudge fading, "most honest thing") answers the thematic question without moralizing. Subtext operates cleanly in "preserve the shape of hope without confronting what hope required" and the stone's weight as prayer. No thematic echo or thesis statement mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, focalized through Maren. Diction is controlled and voice-distinct: "topology of hope's erosion," "luminous regret," "flowers that had forgotten how to wilt." Perceptual signature is consistent (archivist's eye, recurring stone). No dialogue present. Minor register elevation ("metamorphosed," "pharmaceutical dilation") risks slight distance from the intimate stakes but remains voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong imagery ("shadow unbound from despair," "breathing cotton"). Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. However, two paraphrase loops reduce momentum: "preserve the shape of hope" is restated as "preserve...without confronting what hope required" within two lines, and "flowers that never died because they'd never truly lived" echoes "flowers that had forgotten how to wilt" without added pressure. Template cadence in the Lyssa-comparison paragraphs ("same chair, same procedure, same electrodes") is intentional parallelism but borders on mechanical. Apply −0.4 for loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—documenting hope's commodification in a cloud library—offers a fresh angle on technology's emotional cost. The river stone as anchor is specific and non-obvious. However, the core emotional arc (disillusioned archivist performing futile work) is familiar, and Maren's passive stance limits transformation. The piece commits fully to its conceit but does not take structural or perspectival risk; the two-recording comparison is efficient but conventional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maren's profession as "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" frames her observational stance and is mentioned early. She performs her work (comparing recordings, typing the report) but makes no choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The trait enables description but not decision; her observation of Lyssa drives theme but not plot turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The river stone appears in three beats: pocket (early), recalled mid-piece ("Down below, rivers still carved canyons"), and pressed to glass (ending). It carries thematic weight (gravity, consequence, authenticity) and charges the final image. However, its use is passive—handled but not used to constrain a choice or enable a tactic. The closure reprise reweights prior material but does not demonstrate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"A shadow unbound" appears once as figurative language ("something luminous inhabited her body, a shadow unbound from despair") in Maren's analysis of young Lyssa. It describes past wonder but does not shape present stakes or tactics. The concept is ornamental, serving theme without altering options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" is assigned early ("Today's task was softly deliberate") and echoed at the end ("continue her softly deliberate work"). It describes Maren's manner but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The trait remains label-level; no choice turns on this quality, and no tradeoff between softness and decisiveness is dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" appears three times: Lyssa's face "metamorphosed" in the first recording; hope requires being "metamorphosed by experience"; and the final line describes "the metamorphosis of human longing." The word frames the thematic concern and bridges the recordings to Maren's reflection. However, the action is descriptive rather than plot-driving; removing it would weaken coherence but not break structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The comparison method is signaled early, occupies the central beat (Lyssa at 23 vs. 63, paused at connection), and supplies the evidence for Maren's report. The mechanics matter: "holographic projections," "electrodes," timestamp. The method enables her professional task and shapes the middle section. Closure does not depend on the footage itself but on Maren's response to it (stone to glass).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The cloud library is introduced early and revisited (Preservation Wing, library edge, transparent walls). It provides thematic pressure (removed from earth, "pretend the work mattered") and charges the final image (stone against glass with clouds below). However, the setting does not constrain a present choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it functions as symbolic backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after dreams become shareable" is established early (timestamp 2087, "the age after dreams became shareable") and frames the world logic. It enables the premise and Lyssa's arc. However, the era does not tighten Maren's present decision or impose a temporal constraint; it sets context but does not shape tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation "to preserve the shape of hope" is stated explicitly and revisited ("preserve but ultimately impotent"). The desire is present and conflicted (she understands the futility) but not dramatized through a high-cost choice. The friction between wanting to document and recognizing impotence charges her interiority but does not force a present-tense decision that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone of "luminous regret" is coherent and modulates with pressure: "luminous regret" in the report-typing beat, "softly deliberate," the stone's return. The final image—smudge fading, "most honest thing"—crystallizes the tone with quiet resignation. Diction sustains the register throughout (no flatlining or incongruent shifts), and the ending deepens rather than merely repeats the mood.</comment>
