<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her micro-choices (adjusting the fragment, tuning differently, recording) drive the narrative forward. Her internal journey from "conventional wisdom" to discarding assumptions shows agency. However, the character lacks embodied contradiction or struggle—her discovery unfolds smoothly without genuine cost or resistance, and the epiphany arrives without dramatized obstacles that test commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the fragment's resonance until the "shard of hush" blooms as a conceptual repricing that reweights silence as fundamental signal. Orientation anchors clearly (Mira, tower, lunar perigee) by the opening paragraphs. The closure—her understanding that endings are transformations—lands on the page with conceptual cost (all prior transmissions were "just interference"). One meaningful deepening occurs when she tunes for valleys instead of peaks, narrowing her interpretive frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city suspended over a gorge provides vivid spatial grounding with purposeful detail (cables, broken windows, skeletal frame). The hollywood star fragment functions as micro-setting, its warmth and pulse charging the final discovery. The gorge's "depths lost in shadow" and the swaying city create atmosphere that mirrors Mira's search for hidden frequencies. The lunar perigee constrains the timing and intensifies the signal, directly enabling the climactic moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the true signal beneath the noise—is clear and sustained. Mira's choice to tune differently ("not seeking peaks...but valleys") provides one meaningful tightening that narrows her interpretive method. However, escalation is gentle; no genuine obstacle threatens failure, and the discovery arrives without visible cost or tradeoff. The "shard of hush" blooms without resistance, and her final understanding feels assured rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the fragment's pulse, the abandoned city's transformation, and the reweighted silence. "Endings were never final. They were transformations" arises from concrete particulars—the city's abandonment creating listening conditions, the fragment's shift from landmark to translator. The final image of frequencies "tuned to different moments of the same eternal song" offers resonant closure without overt moralizing. Minor deduction for the slightly on-the-nose "she didn't need to choose between the beginning and the ending" articulation in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "serenely electric," "cascade of stellar noise," "inverse symphony." Diction stays consistent and purposeful, matching Mira's technical yet lyrical frame. No dialogue to evaluate. The narrative distance modulates appropriately, tightening during the discovery beat. Psychic distance is controlled; Mira's knowledge and inference remain character-bound throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean with varied rhythm and strong imagery ("static whispers," "inverse symphony," "cradle suspended between earth and sky"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or understanding. Minor template cadence appears in the discovery sequence: "It wasn't silence...it was the sound" echoed by "They were the same frequency, just tuned..." The final paragraph's "Tomorrow, during the next perigee, she would listen deeper still" adds a forward gesture that slightly dilutes closure's charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—finding meaning in silence rather than signal—offers a fresh angle on the "listening for cosmic truth" trope. The hollywood star fragment as celestial iron translator and the suspended tower city provide specific, non-generic world-building. However, the emotional arc follows a familiar discovery template without significant transformation or risk. The "endings are beginnings" insight, while earned through particulars, arrives at a well-worn philosophical destination. The piece commits fully to its premise but plays safely within its conceptual boundaries.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's role as signal interpreter shapes the entire narrative. Her choices—adjusting the fragment, tuning for valleys instead of peaks, recording the discovery—drive all major beats. Her professional skill and interpretive lens enable the climactic realization. Present from the opening and causally active through closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hollywood star fragment appears in the opening beat (adjustment in copper housing), activates the equipment through resonance, grows warm during tuning, pulses twice before the shard blooms, and its properties (celestial iron, cosmic resonance) enable the discovery. Its transformation from landmark to translator echoes the story's thematic core. Handled across multiple beats and essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "shard of hush" is seeded in paragraph four, drives Mira's search through months of conventional mapping, and blooms at the climax as the story's central revelation. The concept reframes silence as signal rather than absence, directly altering her interpretive options. It constrains her method (seeking valleys not peaks) and delivers the ending's conceptual repricing. Present in setup, middle search, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" describes the fragment's surface in the opening and reappears when Mira feels "the architecture of spacetime itself, serenely electric and absolutely patient" at the climax. The attribute characterizes the tone of discovery but doesn't constrain action or create visible tradeoffs. Mostly atmospheric; the parallel between fragment and cosmic architecture adds thematic resonance without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tuning drives the story's central turn. Mira begins by following conventional wisdom, then "began to tune the equipment differently, not seeking peaks...but valleys." This action directly enables the shard of hush to bloom and transforms her understanding. The mechanics matter—tuning for absence rather than presence—and the act is irreplaceable; no other action would deliver the same revelation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Discarding assumptions entirely" is signaled in paragraph five ("Tonight, she would find her answer by discarding assumptions entirely"), immediately followed by the question "What if the silence wasn't empty space...?" This method drives her tuning choice and enables the discovery. The mechanics are shown on the page through her shift from peaks to valleys. Present in setup and executed at the climax.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city suspended over a gorge provides the necessary isolation (abandonment enabled the quiet), houses the equipment, and offers visual resonance (swaying "cradle suspended between earth and sky"). The gorge's mystery and the tower's skeletal frame mirror the search for hidden frequencies. Setting enables rather than pressures; it creates conditions but doesn't constrain choices with cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lunar perigee is established in the opening ("Tonight, during lunar perigee...the signals would be strongest"), provides the necessary lens effect ("The lunar perigee intensified the signal, the moon acting as a lens"), and times the discovery. It tightens the window of opportunity and directly enables the climax through gravitational focusing. The timeframe constrains when the revelation can occur and is causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to find the beginning in every ending" is stated in the opening reflection ("endings were simply beginnings viewed from the wrong angle") and resolved in the final understanding. However, it's more narrated than dramatized through conflicted choices. The desire shapes her interpretive lens but doesn't generate friction or visible cost. Present at setup and closure but told more than shown.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality" coheres through the piece: stardust instead of circuits, using what remains rather than mourning what's lost, the fragment's natural cosmic resonance powering dead equipment. Tone modulates from patient setup through intensifying discovery to reflective closure. The practical use of fantastical elements (celestial iron as translator) charges the ending's reconciliation of ending and beginning.</comment>
