<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior contradiction—trained to filter uncertainty yet haunted by having done exactly that—drives every choice. The embodied guilt ("swallowed...like a stone," fever loosening it) reads concrete and particular. The final decision to recalibrate sensors is earned by on-page confession and shows visible cost: accepting more false positives, less certainty. Minor slip: Eva remains slightly abstract despite the illustration anchoring her; the relationship could bear more pressure if Eva's voice or a specific memory contested Mira's choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases from fever recovery → illustration encounter → confession memory → recalibration choice, with the final image (smudge as proof of alteration) reweighting certainty as the true danger. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira accepts perpetual uncertainty and the burden of Eva's death as "ballast," foreclosing the oracle-certainty path with felt cost. Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two (mountain station, Mira, post-fever, dawn). One meaningful deepening occurs when delirium surfaces the swallowed confession, narrowing her options to either continue filtering or honor margins.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The weather station supplies the snowpack sensors that become the instrument of change; the mountain air and altitude contextualize the avalanche and Eva's death. The botanical illustration functions as micro-setting, constraining the smudge action and charging the final image with Eva's method (edges inward). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (auroras, thin air, translucent paper in backlight). Does not quite reach 8+ because the station itself remains somewhat generic beyond the instruments; no unique spatial feature of this particular station alters a tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to carry guilt and prevent future loss—is signaled early and tightens through the confession and recalibration decision. One meaningful turn: realizing "certainty is what killed her" inverts her professional identity and narrows options to accepting ambiguity or repeating the error. The cost is legible: more false positives, less professional confidence, permanent emotional ballast. Agency is clear (her choice to recalibrate). Does not quite reach 8.5 because the decision, while earned, occurs in summary ("I need to recalibrate") rather than a dramatized beat showing her hands on the instruments or Chen's visible reaction creating friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of certainty versus margin-dwelling emerges organically from Mira's oracle role, Eva's edge-focused practice, and the final recalibration without a single thematic label. The illustration's construction (edges inward) and the smudge (proof things sway) function as non-literal answers to "what matters at the boundaries." The auroras' departure and the swallowed-then-spoken truth layer emotional and conceptual resonance. Subtext operates cleanly in Chen's "You should still be resting" (concern without confrontation) and Mira's "Yes" (accepting cost). The ending reweights prior material: margins are no longer noise but "where all the real weather happened."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third with clear psychic distance; Mira's perceptual signature (reading data, filtering certainty) is character-specific. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated throughout; "auroral sorrow" and "swaying edges" read purposeful, not ornamental. The single dialogue exchange with Chen is natural, carries subtext (his warning about false positives tests her resolve), and advances plot. Slight register elevation in a few phrases ("fault-tolerant," "ecotones") fits her technical mind but risks drifting academic in peak emotional beats; the prose mostly stays embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully, tightening during confession memory and breathing at the aurora description. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor issues: "the sorrow of it—how something so luminous could vanish" slightly over-explains what the image already conveys, and "proof that everything swayed, nothing stayed fixed" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary. The smudge beat is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The oracle-in-grief premise avoids cliché by rooting the failure in professional filtering (margins dismissed as noise) rather than a simple missed warning. The illustration as method-artifact (edges inward) and the smudge as accidental proof of sway offer fresh synthesis. Eva's "Truth lives in the edges" risks aphorism but is tied to her botanical practice and Mira's sensor thresholds, earning specificity. The ending's recalibration choice feels inevitable in hindsight. Does not quite reach 8.5 because the mountain-station-and-scientist frame, while executed well, remains a moderately familiar container for grief-and-responsibility arcs.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira as fault-tolerant oracle drives the entire arc: her professional identity (filtering error margins) created the failure that killed Eva, and her final choice (recalibrating sensors to honor margins) is the story's decisive change. Present in setup (oracle role named), development (confession that she filtered anomalies), and payoff (recalibration decision). The oracle method shapes both the mistake and the resolution with visible cost (more false positives, less certainty). Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; irreplaceability is high (swap "oracle" for "forecaster" and the thematic weight of certainty collapses).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The botanical illustration appears in three distinct beats: initial encounter (paragraph four), smudge action (paragraph five), and backlit final image (paragraphs eleven and fourteen). It carries Eva's method (occupying margins, edges inward) and becomes the vehicle for the smudge—proof of alteration. The illustration's construction mirrors Mira's needed shift and charges the closure image when held translucent, making Eva's truth visible. Strong setup, development (smudge constrains her to accept imperfection), and payoff (backlit flowers glow, reweighting the stake). Cost tied directly: the smudge is permanent, like Mira's guilt.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Swaying certainties" is the story's engine: Mira's professional certainty (filtering margins) killed Eva, and accepting sway (recalibrating to honor uncertainty) is the resolution. The concept shapes tactics (she will forecast from margins, accept false positives) and stakes (certainty versus honesty). Present in setup (fault-tolerant method named), development (margins called "noise she'd been trained to filter"), and payoff ("everything swayed, nothing stayed fixed" as the new stance). The final image (smudge as proof things sway) makes the concept undeniable. Irreplaceability is absolute; the story's logic collapses without this exact oscillation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Peripherally aware" (Mira saw anomalies but filtered them as margin noise; Eva occupied peripheral zones) drives the failure and the resolution. The trait is named explicitly ("peripherally aware") in paragraph six, shapes the inciting error (she saw data shifts but dismissed them), and the ending stance (she will now give weight to margins). Two-gate presence: setup (Eva's preference for boundaries) and payoff (Mira's new margin-focused method). Development is thinner—no middle beat where peripheral awareness constrains a present choice. The cost is clear (the anomalies she ignored). Swappability is low; change "peripheral" to "incomplete" and the edges-versus-center logic weakens.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The smudge is the story's hinge: Mira's accidental mark on the illustration proves that even precise renderings alter with a touch, making the sway-versus-fixity question concrete. It occurs in paragraph five (early development), drives her realization that certainty is myth, and the mark's permanence charges the ending ("the smudge remained...proof"). The smudge enables her acceptance of imperfection and recalibration choice. Irreplaceability is extreme—no other action (tearing, folding, dropping) carries the same accidental-proof-of-contact meaning. Three gates met; causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost all strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Occupying margins" is Eva's method (building illustrations from edges inward, preferring boundary ecotones) and becomes Mira's new forecasting stance (giving weight to swaying edges, honoring margin data). The method is seeded in paragraph seven (Eva's illustration technique), returns in paragraph eight (Eva's philosophy: "truth lives in the edges"), and shapes the ending (Mira will "forecast from the margins"). Two-gate presence: setup and payoff. Middle development is weaker—Mira does not attempt margin-occupation in a present beat before deciding to adopt it. The mechanics matter (edges-inward versus center-outward) and the method is irreplaceable, but it resolves a problem (how to honor uncertainty) it did not actively create friction for earlier.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mountain weather station provides the profession (oracle/forecaster), the instruments (snowpack sensors to be recalibrated), and the context (altitude where weather creates its own rules, thin air as stakes metaphor). The station pressures the inciting choice (data anomalies before the avalanche) and supplies the means of resolution (sensor recalibration). Three gates: setup (station named early), development (Mira's oracle role depends on this setting), payoff (instruments are the vehicle for change). Does not quite reach 8+ because the station's particulars (observation deck, narrow cot, instruments) remain functional but not irreplaceable—swap for a seismic monitoring post and the frame holds with minor edits. Spatial micro-detail (deck, window, desk positions) is legible but generic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the fever broke" frames the story's present and provides the catalyst (delirium loosened the swallowed truth, enabling confession). Timeframe is signaled in the title and opening line, and the six-day fever is noted in paragraph two. The fever's role is causal (it forced the confession that drives the resolution), but the post-fever window itself does not tighten decisions—Mira's recalibration choice is not racing a clock. Two gates: setup and development (fever's effect enabled present stance). Payoff is thinner—"after fever" does not charge the final image beyond establishing that Mira is now physically capable of acting. The timeframe matters but is partly swappable (e.g., "after the isolation ended" could serve similar loosening without fever).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The desire to find and carry the weight of swallowed truth is the story's spine: Mira has buried her complicity for two years, fever surfaces it, and the ending shows her holding it as ballast rather than burden. Motivation is dramatized in the confession memory (paragraph eight: "she'd spoken to Eva's ghost"), tested in the decision to recalibrate (paragraphs twelve and thirteen: accepting uncertainty's cost), and resolved in the final image (truth "no longer swallowed but held up to the light"). Three gates met with strong causal pressure. Friction between want (professional certainty) and cost (accepting she was wrong) drives every beat. Irreplaceability is high; change the motivation and the oracle-certainty theme collapses.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow"—beauty departing, luminous loss—is coherent throughout: the opening auroras fading, the stone-in-throat guilt, the translucent illustration glowing then pressed to chest, and the final sun "burning off the sorrow but never quite erasing it." Tone modulates with pressure (tightening during confession, breathing at the backlit flower moment) and charges the closure image (ballast, not burden; weight carried forward). The tone is distinct, purposeful, and inseparable from the thematic resonance. Vocabulary and rhythm (e.g., "like everything that mattered," "auroras paint the sky," "some weights...became part of you forever") sustain the elegiac register without slipping sentimental. Fully indispensable.</comment>
