<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action (fitting goggles, reading entries). Internal experience is specific—"throat tightened" at memory, "affectionately detached from her own grief"—though the final phrase edges toward label-speak. The captain exists only in diary entries but applies pressure through Maren's discovery; her devotion and the choice to preserve what remains are earned. Minor: the phrase "affectionately detached" in the penultimate paragraph borders on diagnostic labeling but is redeemed by the concrete action of carrying diary and goggles.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 3 (Maren, elevator, icebound spire). The diary unfolds across the climb, accumulating entries that shift from joy to sickness, and the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren holds "proof that someone had noticed her," reweighting her grief into something "more permanent than sorrow." Cost is conceptual and felt—she carries fragments of a hollowed captain—and the final image of clouds "like patient ghosts" reconfigures the opening's frozen ascent. One meaningful deepening through the goggles' revelation tightens the dominant stake (seeking joy beneath anguish). No causality breaks; the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The elevator's ten-floor climb creates a live ticking constraint; the spire's "frost-etched window" and "thick ice walls" filter scattered light that enables the goggles' function, directly enabling the discovery. The brass cage, amber lenses, and refracting ice are tactile and purposeful. The captain's quarters on the tenth floor anchor the destination. Micro-setting (goggles as tool, diary as object) charges the final image when Maren tucks both into her apron. Spatial choreography is clear. The clouds at the end—"patient ghosts"—return the spire's isolation to the reader with new weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to recover the captain's essence and understand what the sickness stole. The goggles' revelation is a meaningful tightening—symbols resolve into words, joy surfaces beneath anguish—that narrows Maren's understanding and deepens her mission. The entries escalate from patient teaching to pressure-sickness dissolution, and Maren's choice to read the rest and preserve the fragments forecloses simple grief with visible cost: she must carry the weight of love against forgetting. No antagonist required; the altitude's theft and Maren's devotion interweave. Agency is endurance and attention with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—attention as antidote to forgetting, love encrypted against loss—emerges from the diary's method (scattered light) and the captain's motivation (preserving joy before the altitude steals it). No moralizing; the final image of clouds with "personalities after all" offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the opening's coldness. The goggles and diary recur with shifting meaning: first eccentricity, then key, then "proof." Subtext operates in the captain's careful illustrations and Maren's choice to seek "every moment of joy...beneath anguish." The piece earns its quiet ending through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited, stable distance anchored in Maren's perception. Diction fits her—"ridiculous oversized things," "good girl"—and the prose modulates under pressure (throat tightening, holding goggles "like they held the captain's soul"). The captain's voice in diary entries is distinct: patient, observant, darkening under sickness. No head-hopping. The phrase "affectionately detached from her own grief" in the penultimate paragraph is the sole register slip—slightly elevated—but the surrounding concreteness (tucking objects, feeling grief) anchors it. Psychic distance tightens naturally at closure. Perceptual signature: Maren notices cumulus, folk tunes, unschooled poetry through the captain's eyes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across the climb; floor markers ("Fifth floor. Sixth.") create propulsion. Information density is high: each diary entry advances both plot and emotional charge. Minor scaffold: "She had served Captain Thessaly for twelve years aboard the Nimbus Cloud, cleaning quarters and mending sails, until the airship had made its final mooring at this frozen tower above the world" compresses necessary backstory but reads slightly expository. "Affectionately detached" borders on abstract label-speak. Opening and closing images (frost-etched window, patient ghosts) are strong. No loops or metaphor muddle. Overall clean, with one or two lines that could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The encrypted diary revealed through amber-lensed goggles and scattered light is a fresh synthesis; the captain's hidden joy juxtaposed against pressure sickness avoids stock airship-adventure tropes. The ten-floor climb as countdown and the diary's transformation from symbols to illustrations feel earned. Risk: a quiet, reflective ending in a fantastical setting. Weakness: the "icebound spire above the world" and "airship" frame edges close to steampunk templates without full transformation; the emotional core (servant discovering captain's hidden love) is universal but not yet inevitable. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows through, landing in the strong mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren (ascending servant) drives all major choices: retrieving the diary, donning the goggles, reading entries floor by floor, choosing to preserve and read the rest. Her decision to pack the captain's quarters and carry the fragments is the closure action. She appears in setup, middle, and ending with causal agency. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage. Not quite indispensable—another devoted character could theoretically perform the role—but her specific history (twelve years, teaching moments) is woven throughout and her choices narrow options with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The goggles appear in setup ("pulled...from her apron pocket"), enable the middle turn (fitting them reveals the diary's true content), and charge the ending ("holding them like they held the captain's soul," tucked into apron). They constrain the method (only amber lenses reveal scattered light) and their prior reputation ("ridiculous oversized things") is reweighted into sacred object. Three distinct beats; causal pressure (without them, no discovery); closure linkage strong. Irreplaceable: the amber lenses and the captain's insistence they "helped her see currents" seed the payoff. Near-indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The encrypted diary is the object of the quest, signaled in the opening third ("pages covered in symbols that shifted and changed"), and its revelation drives the middle escalation (entries unfold, joy surfaces). The diary's hidden method (scattered light encryption) shapes Maren's tactics (must use goggles) and the final choice (to read the rest, to preserve). Closure participation: Maren tucks it into her apron, and it becomes "proof that someone had noticed her." Causal pressure throughout; irreplaceable specificity (not navigation logs but joy). Three beats, strong closure linkage, visible cost (she must carry the weight of love and loss).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Warmly inquisitive" is signaled early ("always wondering what truth might hide in seeming madness") and shown in Maren's patient reading and her memory of asking "whether I had ever met an angry cloud." It enables her choice to don the goggles rather than dismiss them and primes her openness to the captain's hidden world. Payoff: she accepts that clouds "did have personalities after all." Two beats (memory, final acceptance) with light causal work. Not indispensable—a simpler "curious" could suffice—but the warmth colors her grief and the final image. Mid-band: shapes one key turn, present at closure, but swappable with a near-synonym.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Unfold" is the action that unlocks the diary: "the first entry began to unfold before her" when she dons the goggles. It recurs across the climb ("watching them unfold through the goggles' amber light") and is implicit in the ending choice (to unfold the rest later). The word's literal meaning (pages opening) and metaphoric charge (revelation, blossoming meaning) are both active. Causal: without the unfolding, no discovery; the method (scattered light) depends on it. Three beats, closure linkage (she will "read the rest"), irreplaceable verb choice. The story's central action; removing it breaks the mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Through scattered light" is signaled early (symbols "shifted and changed depending on how you looked") and its mechanics are demonstrated mid-climb: amber lenses filter "scattered light refracting through the spire's thick ice walls," revealing illustrations. The method constrains attempts (Maren must wear the goggles, must read during the ascent when light conditions are right). Payoff: the captain "encrypted her joy...in light and lens and paper." Three beats (setup, demonstration, thematic closure). Causal pressure strong; irreplaceable specificity (not ink, not code, but light). Near-indispensable: the physics of the method shape every tactic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The icebound spire supplies the scattered light (thick ice walls refract it) that enables the goggles' revelation—without it, the diary remains opaque. The ten floors create a live countdown. The spire's isolation (hospice on ground floor, abandoned quarters on tenth) frames Maren's solitary ascent and the captain's final mooring. Closure: Maren descends "back down through the frozen spire," and clouds drift "like patient ghosts" outside. Three beats; causal (light physics depend on ice walls) and closure linkage. Not fully indispensable—another vertical, isolated structure could work—but the frozen, above-the-clouds altitude mirrors the pressure sickness's theft. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ten-floor climb is tracked explicitly ("first floor, then the second...Fifth floor. Sixth. Seventh floor. Eighth floor. Ninth. The elevator shuddered to a halt at the tenth floor") and creates propulsion: each floor marker punctuates a diary entry, tightening the window for discovery. The ascent mirrors Maren's emotional climb from grief to understanding. Constraint: she must read during the climb, and the elevator's arrival ends the unfolding. Closure: "The elevator descended, carrying Maren back down." Three beats, causal pressure (live clock), closure participation. Not indispensable—another ticking device could work—but the vertical metaphor (ascending to memory, descending with grief transformed) charges the structure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"To seek out the joy beneath anguish" is dramatized on-page: Maren expects "navigation logs," but the diary reveals "tiny moments of joy carefully preserved." Her choice to don the goggles is motivated by this desire, and the later entries' darkening ("Can't remember if I've eaten") forces her to hold both joy and loss. Closure: "She would read the rest later, seeking out every moment of joy the captain had recorded beneath her anguish." The motivation drives the middle turn and the final choice with felt cost (she must carry the weight of knowing both). Three beats, causal, closure linkage. Irreplaceable: the dual valence (joy/anguish) structures the entire discovery.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" modulates across the climb: Maren is "warmly inquisitive" early, her throat tightens at memory (affection), yet by the end she feels "affectionately detached from her own grief"—a coherent arc from engagement to measured distance. The tone charges the final image: clouds as "patient ghosts" (detached observation) that "perhaps...did have personalities after all" (affectionate acceptance). The phrase "affectionately detached" in the penultimate paragraph borders on label-speak but is anchored by concrete action. Tone present in setup, modulates under pressure, and shapes closure. Strong but not indispensable—a simpler "tender distance" could achieve similar effect.</comment>
