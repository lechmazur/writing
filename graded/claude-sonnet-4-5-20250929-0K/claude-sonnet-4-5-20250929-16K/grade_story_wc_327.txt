<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maerith's motivation is clear and consistent—preserving Keshrin through texture-to-sound translation. Her copper veins and observer role are embodied traits, and her obsession drives the arc. The interiority is specific ("quietly articulate by nature"), though her emotional progression remains steady rather than contradictory; the final smile feels earned by prior causality but lacks a visible internal struggle or competing impulse in the peak moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through repeated encoding beats (bone pillar, multiple surfaces, final press) and shifts cadence at closure when she smiles, knowing the language will persist in encoded form. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): she accepts that no one may decode her work, yet the language survives transformed—cost is visible (sleep, sanity, solitude) and the final image reweights the opening stake. Orientation anchors early (tower, canyon, forty-three years). One tightening occurs when the diamond hums and returns a harmonic, narrowing her method.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bone towers, canyon acoustics, and the diamond itself function as micro-setting that constrains her encoding method and charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful (copper veins catching light, microscopic ridges, diamond hum) and filtered through Maerith's technical focus. The towers become her library, a concrete spatial anchor that evolves causally as she inscribes them, and the final press against bone completes the setting's role in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: preserve Keshrin before it dies with her. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers the diamond's scattering pattern via bird observation, enabling her encoding technique—a protagonist-driven turn that narrows method and raises the stakes from theoretical study to active inscription. The final smile crystallizes her acceptance of the cost (isolation, possible madness) with undeniable on-page pressure; the language's survival in encoded form reweights the opening fear of total loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—language as encoded presence beyond sound—emerges from particulars (grain, ridges, diamond harmonics) without thesis statement. The bird-flock pattern discovery and the tower-as-library motif constrain her method and charge the closure when she presses the stone "once more," reweighting survival from speech to texture. The final image offers a non-literal answer: meaning persists in "the subtle geometries of the world's surface," speaking to "anyone patient enough to listen." No moralizing; the cost (sanity, solitude) is felt and conceptual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable and aptly close; Maerith's perceptual signature is technical and jeweler-precise ("cutting facets," "encode," "harness"). Diction remains within her lexicon throughout; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The phrase "quietly articulate by nature" is slightly tell-heavy but voice-motivated. Rhythm modulates with pressure: the breakthrough paragraph accelerates, the final paragraph breathes. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (each beat advances encoding progress or thematic weight). No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful ("swallowed the old ways like a flood," "crack like a thread"). Minor density slip: "She had studied the problem for years, but the breakthrough came from watching birds" could tighten by embedding the contrast in action rather than summary transition. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of flawed-diamond acoustics, bird-flock pattern recognition, and texture-encoding is specific and non-obvious. The transformation test passes: swapping names or setting would collapse the canyon's acoustic role and the bone-tower library conceit. Risk-taking in the premise (language encoded in physical texture via a cursed gem) is bold and follows its implications without retreat. The final image—pressing stone to bone while watching birds pattern the sunset—feels inevitable in hindsight and reweights the opening fear with quiet originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maerith is signaled early and her choices drive all key turns: observing birds leads to the encoding breakthrough, refining technique across months, and the final act of pressing the diamond against bone while accepting the cost. Her decisions alter tactics (which surfaces, how to angle the diamond) and her acceptance at closure forecloses the path of waiting for a living audience. Visible cost: isolation, sanity, sleep. She shapes setup, middle development, and payoff with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The flawed diamond is introduced early (second paragraph), handled in multiple beats (held to lips for "nethara," pressed to bone pillar, angled for harmonics, used across months, final press), and its crack-as-tunnel property is irreplaceable—no generic gem could scatter/regroup sound this way. It drives the encoding method and appears in the closure image. Visible cost tied to it: "cursed," "driven previous owners to madness," cost her "sleep and...sanity." Causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity all high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The "tunnel of echoes" concept is embodied in the diamond's fractured structure ("within that crack, echoes gathered and nested," "sound...did not simply echo—it scattered and regrouped") and the canyon itself ("every sound eventually faded to silence" vs. her encoded permanence). It shapes her method (passing sound through the diamond's tunnel) and stakes (creating a language that waits in echoes rather than dying). Setup, development (breakthrough via scattering patterns), and payoff (final encoding) all hinge on this tunnel property. Cost: the tunnel demands patient decoding that may never occur.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Quietly articulate" is shown in her jeweler-like precision ("choosing each word with the precision of a jeweler cutting facets") and later in her careful, methodical refinement across months. It enables her encoding technique—precision matters for angling the diamond and selecting textures—but the trait does not constrain a choice or impose a visible tradeoff on the page. It appears early and colors her approach but remains more characterization than causal lever. Mid-band: functional, purposeful, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Harness" is signaled early ("harness the diamond's strange properties") and executed on-page in multiple beats: learning to predict scattering, angling the diamond precisely, combining surfaces for complex words, refining technique over months, final press. The action redefines her options from passive observation to active encoding and drives the closure—without harnessing, the language dies; with it, the language persists transformed. Visible cost: the effort to harness costs sleep and sanity. Setup, development, payoff, and irreplaceability all strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Bird-flock observation is introduced in the middle third, drives the breakthrough ("She began to observe them obsessively...noting how density shifted through the group like meaning moving through a sentence"), and teaches her the diamond's scattering/regrouping mechanics. The method matters: without the bird pattern, she cannot control the diamond. It returns at closure ("watching another flock of birds pattern themselves against the sunset") to charge the final image. Setup delay lowers the score slightly (−0.3), but development and payoff are strong, and the method is irreplaceable to her encoding technique.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon are introduced early and pressure every choice: the canyon's acoustics motivate the problem (sounds dissolve to reverberation), the towers provide the encoding surface ("towers of bone became her library, each surface inscribed"), and their microscopic ridges enable the technique. The setting returns in the closure beat ("pressed the stone once more against the bone") and the final image ("her copper veins catching the fading light"). Cost: isolation in this remote canyon for forty-three years. Setup, development (towers as library), payoff, causal pressure, and irreplaceability all high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The timeframe—language death—is signaled early ("watching her language die one word at a time," "Her brother had died last winter," "Her daughter spoke only the common tongue") and tightens decisions: she must encode before she dies. The months of refinement and the final realization ("When Keshrin finally died...the language would not disappear") tie the arc to this deadline. However, the timeline does not press tactics beat-to-beat; it frames urgency rather than live-clock pressure. Setup, thematic development, and payoff present; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The motivation to translate texture into sound is stated early ("to translate texture into sound"), dramatized across beats (speaking "nethara" and pressing the diamond, learning texture–frequency mappings, encoding complex words by combining surfaces), and fulfilled at closure when she encodes the towers knowing "the language would only change form, becoming something you could touch." Friction with cost: she sacrifices human connection, sleep, and sanity to achieve it. Setup, multiple beat involvement, payoff, causal pressure, and cost all strong.</comment>
