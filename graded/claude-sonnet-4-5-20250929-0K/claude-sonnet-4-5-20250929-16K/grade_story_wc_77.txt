<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear—she fears her dissolving features—but the transformation from terror to acceptance feels under-earned; the advisor's whispers deliver the insight rather than forcing Vera into contradictory choices that make her pay for understanding. Embodied emotion is present (clutching the clasp, leaning into mirrors) but her internal arc tilts toward declarative epiphany ("what if disappearing was the point?") rather than dramatized struggle. The final renunciation of solidity reads as conceptually motivated but lacks visible cost in the moment; we see her speak and smile, not forfeit a concrete option or endure a loss that closes a door.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when quickly (Vera in the funhouse, post-resuscitation) and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: density of image and thematic pressure builds toward the final reconfiguration. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (she walks out "becoming shadow, becoming everything fear could never contain"), reweighting her curse as liberation. Cost is conceptual and legible—she relinquishes the anchor of fixed identity—but the final image leans declarative ("gloriously, impossibly alive") rather than showing a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift that makes the price undeniable in the moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The funhouse setting is vivid and purposeful: warped mirrors multiply her distortion and the green luminance charges the space. Sensory detail is selective (mirrors, shadows, warm metal, pale green light) and filtered through Vera's POV. The mirrors constrain her choice by forcing confrontation with her blurred face, and the clasp's glow charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Slight penalty for the advisor materializing "from the shadows between two funhouse mirrors"—spatial choreography wobbles when his form is "as indistinct as her own face" yet he produces a book and speaks with physical presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Vera must escape the terror of her disappearing face. One meaningful tightening occurs when she faces the mirror instead of recoiling, narrowing her options to acceptance or continued flight. The advisor's whispers complicate rather than resolve, and the dream dictionary provides a tool that Vera must interpret and act on. Cost is felt conceptually—she releases the desire for fixed identity—but the story does not show what she loses in tactical or relational terms at the moment of closure. Agency reads as renunciation with on-page cost (she becomes "more indistinct, more luminous"), satisfying the lens but not fully charging the trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: photographs stealing features, the grandmother's deliberate dissolution, the paradoxical dictionary entries that reframe absence as freedom. Subtext operates in the advisor's silk-over-glass voice and the mirrors' shifting reflections. The final image—Vera walking out "becoming shadow, becoming everything fear could never contain"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting the curse as transformation. Minor slip: "To fear your image is to give it power. To love your absence is to become whole" tilts slightly toward thematic echo, a mid-band Thematic Echo that does not fully obscure the earned work but adds a faint declarative note.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Vera; narrative distance is controlled and perceptual signature is consistent (she notices the warm clasp, the green light, her own blurred edges). Diction remains within Vera's register, and the advisor's dialogue carries distinct texture ("Fear is the map"). Free indirect style is clean. Dialogue advances plot and subtext. The advisor's voice ("silk dragged across broken glass, repulsive yet magnetic") is vivid but borders on over-written in a high-pressure beat; the phrase works but slightly inflates density without additional pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance modulates purposefully.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean and propulsive; sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with pressure. Minor loop: "She'd been afraid of disappearing, but what if disappearing was the point?" restates the prior beat's realization without added detail, triggering −0.2 for paraphrase. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "silk dragged across broken glass" and "smoke, like possibility" are vivid. Template cadence appears once: "She looked like smoke, like possibility, like something…" (parallel stems across one sentence) but does not reach the three-sentence threshold. Information density is high; no significant scaffold or synonym churn. The final paragraph ("gloriously, impossibly alive") leans slightly toward elevated abstraction but remains legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The core synthesis—curse as liberation, dissolution as transformation—is compelling and executed with specific detail (the grandmother's stage career, the clasp's luminance, the funhouse setting). The paradoxical dictionary and the post-resuscitation frame offer fresh angles on familiar body-horror tropes. Minor deduction for the advisor as a stock mystical guide figure whose role (delivering the grandmother's dictionary, whispering insights) feels functional rather than surprising. The emotional arc follows a recognizable template (fear → acceptance via mentor figure) but the particulars (photographically cursed, opera cloak clasp) individualize the journey enough to avoid pure derivativeness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The advisor appears early, delivers the dictionary, and urges Vera to confess to the mirrors—three distinct beats. However, his role is primarily catalytic (he provides tools and prompts) rather than decisively altering tactics through his own choices. He materializes, whispers insights, and vanishes; Vera's transformation would require a different catalyst but the plot structure would hold. He is functional but somewhat replaceable as a mystical-guide archetype. Present in setup and middle development; absent from closure (he is "gone" before the final image).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The clasp appears in the opening paragraph (early signal), pulses with luminance in the middle beat as Vera takes the dictionary, intensifies and floods the funhouse with green light at the turning point, is pinned to her collar as she faces the mirror, and "still glowed against her chest" in the final image. It shapes three beats and charges the closure, making dissolution visible. Its "lingering luminance" is irreplaceable—no generic heirloom could do this work. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Slightly below indispensable because the story could function with a different inherited object of power; the clasp's opera-cloak specificity is texture rather than plot necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Lingering luminance" is named early, recurs in multiple beats (the clasp's glow, the green light flooding the funhouse, the glow in the final image), and provides a visual through-line. It enables Vera's transformation by making her dissolution visible and beautiful. However, it functions primarily as atmosphere and symbolic resonance rather than constraining a choice or altering tactics; Vera's decisions (to listen, to face the mirror, to confess) do not depend on the luminance's mechanics. Present in setup, middle, and closure; causal role is moderate. A strong lyric reprise that reweights the stake without dictating action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The curse is signaled in the opening sentence, deepened by the resuscitation backstory, and drives Vera's dominant stake (escaping the terror of disappearing). It constrains her socially (she is "unphotographable") and forces the mirror confrontation. The final image shows the curse's transformation: she becomes "shadow, becoming everything fear could never contain." Visible cost: she cannot be captured or fixed. Present in setup, middle (she studies her blurred face), and closure. Slightly below 7.0 because the curse's mechanics are told rather than dramatized in a beat where it prevents an action; we see the result (blurred face) but not a moment where she tries and fails to be photographed with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Unbosom" is named once by the advisor ("Unbosom yourself to the mirrors") and executed on-page: "Vera spoke, pouring out her terror to the distorted reflections." This act triggers the transformation ("with each confession, her image grew more indistinct, more luminous, more free"), making it causally central to closure. Early signal (the advisor urges it), middle development (she acts), and closure participation (the result charges the final image). Minor deduction because the confession itself is summarized rather than dramatized—we do not hear or see the specific fears she names, which slightly reduces irreplaceability; another cathartic act could substitute with edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dream dictionary is introduced mid-story, handed to Vera by the advisor, and she reads one entry ("reflection") that provides the paradoxical insight driving her transformation. It appears in two beats (the handoff and the reading) and its paradoxical logic ("A reflection is not what you see but what sees you") is thematically central. However, the dictionary's mechanics are not tested under pressure; Vera reads one entry, understands, and acts. It does not constrain a failed attempt or force a trade-off. Present in middle development and contributing to closure via theme, but not shaping tactics. A purposeful tool but somewhat replaceable by any other paradox-delivery device.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The funhouse is named in the opening sentence, grounds all action, and its warped mirrors are the site of Vera's transformation. The mirrors multiply her distorted form, forcing confrontation, and the space "seemed to contract" and "breathe with her," charging the pressure. Setting shapes the dominant choice (to face or flee the mirrors) and supplies the resource (reflections) that enables the final reconfiguration. Present in setup, middle, and closure. Strong integration. Slightly below 7.0 because the funhouse's specific carnival context (rides, games, history) is not used; any hall-of-mirrors could do the same work, making the "abandoned carnival" portion somewhat ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the resuscitation" is signaled early (the advisor found her "three days after") and establishes urgency: the curse "had deepened during those two minutes of death." This timeframe motivates Vera's fear and primes her willingness to listen. However, it does not create a live clock or tighten decisions in the present scene; the resuscitation is backstory context rather than an active constraint. Present in setup, referenced in middle development, but absent from closure tactics. Functional but replaceable with any recent trauma; the "two minutes of death" specificity is texture rather than plot necessity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The desire "to trick fear into revealing its weakness" is stated by the advisor and drives Vera's actions: she listens, reads the dictionary, and performs the unbosoming. It is present in setup (advisor's line), middle development (Vera's choices), and closure (she walks out free). However, the "trick" mechanics are not fully dramatized—Vera follows the advisor's instruction rather than devising her own tactic, and we do not see fear resist or adapt, reducing the sense of active opposition. The motivation is clear and shapes the arc but leans slightly declarative. Visible cost: she releases fixed identity. Friction between want (escape fear) and method (embrace dissolution) is present but muted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Repulsive allure" is embodied throughout: the advisor's voice is "silk dragged across broken glass, repulsive yet magnetic"; the grandmother's costumes "both attracted and repelled audiences"; the green luminance is described as "repulsive, beautiful"; and the final image shows "something beautiful and terrible" smiling back. Tone is coherent across beats and modulates with pressure (the luminance intensifies at the turning point). It charges the final image ("gloriously, impossibly alive") and supports the theme of transformation through paradox. Strong tonal control with vivid, specific execution. No drift or flattening.</comment>
