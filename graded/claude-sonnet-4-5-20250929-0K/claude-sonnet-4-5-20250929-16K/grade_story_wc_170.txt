<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aina's motivation is consistently rooted in grief and the borrowed heartbeat concept, with concrete embodiment ("birds sometimes landed on her shoulders"). The secondary pulse provides a physical anchor for her vigil. However, the final transition from grief to hope feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle—her understanding arrives as epiphany ("she understood") without a dramatized cost or conflicting impulse in the moment. The choice to continue tomorrow lacks visible friction or sacrifice that would elevate the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens with the mirror vigil as recurring ritual; orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting to renewed purpose): the vision in the mirror reweights Aina's nightly practice from desperate retrieval to acceptance of possibility. Cost is legible in her exhaustion and the shift from "entirely alone" to "no longer entirely alone," though the conceptual price could be sharper. One meaningful deepening occurs when the smallest mirror answers, crystallizing the stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The echoing terrace, prism parapet, and wet flagstones create a vivid, purposeful stage where light physics (prismatic splitting) directly enable the mirror work. Sensory detail is selective and tied to the ritual: "beveled stone edge splitting the emerging twilight into ribbons of color." The mirrors function as micro-setting that constrains her method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the spring evening timing tightens the window for her attempt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show possibilities—is signaled early and drives the extended middle beat of singing coded lullabies. The escalation is primarily Accumulative: density increases as questions deepen from "what color would your room be" to "who would you love," culminating in the smallest mirror's answer. Agency manifests in her choice to return tomorrow with "new questions," though this resolution feels more like continuation than a tightening that forecloses a path. One micro-turn (the vision dissolving) adds pressure but the final stance lacks a visible trade-off or renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the borrowed heartbeat and mirror ritual: grief as creative act, possibility as antidote to erasure. The final image—wrapping mirrors in cloth printed with children's songs—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the coded lullabies and the vision of Maya's descendant "who resembled no one yet everyone." The piece resists tidy resolution, positioning hope as ongoing labor rather than cure. The epiphany about the borrowed heartbeat's purpose is earned by the vision's appearance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled distance; Aina's perceptual signature (stillness, the borrowed heartbeat as physical anchor) is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("ferocity of her longing," "dusky harmony") in ways that feel more authorial than character-filtered, especially given her seven-year silence from painting. Psychic distance shifts purposefully at the vision moment. No dialogue present; internal voice reads coherent but the register sometimes inflates beyond what the focalizer's grief-state would produce.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop conceptually: "borrowed heartbeat" appears five times, "mirrors" dominates without varied proxies, and "possibilities rather than mere reflections" / "what might have been" / "the possible" cycle through near-synonyms. The metaphor "mirage painter" seeds early but doesn't constrain later choices. Two paraphrase moments: "elusive" recurs in the frame without added pressure; "sustained by the heartbeat that reminded her" restates prior interiority. Figurative language is controlled but "ribbons of color" and "landscapes of the possible" edge toward stock poeticism. Clarity remains high; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief ritual, coded lullabies, and prismatic optics is specific and purposeful, avoiding generic "talks to the dead" templates. The borrowed heartbeat as physical phenomenon distinguishes the premise. However, the emotional arc—parent seeking alternate-reality contact with dead child—follows a well-worn path, and the resolution (acceptance through vision) feels familiar despite the fresh detail work. The coded-lullaby method is inventive but underutilized; its mechanics appear without constraining her attempts or failing meaningfully. Transformation is present but modest.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aina is present throughout and her painter identity frames the opening and close, but "elusive mirage painter" functions more as label than causal force—she has not painted in seven springs and does not paint on the page. Her choice to return tomorrow is stated but does not alter present tactics or create a visible turn. The character drives the ritual but her decisions feel continuous rather than transformative.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prism parapet appears early, is used actively in two beats (splitting twilight into ribbons, throwing indigo and amber across mirrors), and charges the closure section where the smallest mirror shimmers. Its beveled edge enables the ritual's optics, making it mechanically indispensable. The "after rain" state matters (gleaming, wet flagstones) and constrains the timing. Removing this exact element would collapse the mirror method.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The borrowed heartbeat is introduced early, recurs as physical anchor ("fainter but insistent," "one borrowed, two her own"), and explicitly shapes her motivation and the final understanding. It constrains her purpose and inflects the closure realization. However, it does not alter on-page tactics during the ritual itself—the mirrors and singing could proceed without the heartbeat's presence in those beats. It functions more as thematic carrier than tactical pressure, though the ending ties it directly to closure meaning.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" is described early ("stillness so complete that birds sometimes landed") but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. It remains atmospheric label; no moment shows the trait limiting her options or being tested under pressure. The vigil could proceed identically if she were restless or volatile.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Grace" appears once in "The grace with which she transitioned between melodies" during the peak singing beat, modifying her method but not creating a turn. It describes quality of execution rather than driving a decision. The trait recurs thematically in "its own form of grace" at closure, reweighting the mirrors' answer, which gives it purposeful reprise. However, it could be swapped for "ease" or "fluidity" with minimal structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Coded lullabies are introduced early with clear mechanics (interval alterations, letter substitutions, key changes) and drive two extended middle beats where Aina encodes questions into "Lavender's Blue" and "Hush, Little Baby." The method shapes her attempts and reappears in the closure image (mirrors wrapped in cloth printed with children's songs). Removing this exact method would require significant rewrite. However, the codes never fail or constrain her tactically—they succeed on first deployment without friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The echoing terrace is named early and used in three beats: opening description, the singing vigil, and the final wrapping sequence. Its acoustic property (sound "folded back on itself") colors the atmosphere but does not constrain a choice or alter her method—she could sing elsewhere with similar effect. The spring timing matters more than the terrace's unique features. It functions as purposeful stage but not indispensable tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Over the hush before bells ring" is introduced as the window when "barriers between what was and what might have been grew thin," creating urgency. The bells chime during the peak vision beat ("bells began their first tentative chime, and the moment started to collapse"), directly truncating her success and forcing the vision's dissolution. The timeframe shapes the ritual's constraint and charges the closure image. However, the exact duration is not tracked; we don't feel the ticking clock tightening her decisions beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The desire to persuade mirrors to show possibilities is stated early, dramatized through two singing beats with escalating questions, and directly answered when the smallest mirror shimmers. It drives every major choice on the page and inflects the closure understanding ("the mirrors had answered"). The motivation encounters friction (her voice cracks, exhaustion) and the partial success redefines her purpose going forward. Cost is legible in her physical collapse and the ongoing commitment required.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" is named explicitly in the final paragraph ("In the dusky harmony of spring evening") and colors the overall atmosphere throughout—twilight, emerging dark, prismatic light. Tone remains elegiac and measured, modulating slightly as the vision appears and dissolves. However, the tone does not shift dramatically under pressure; it sustains one register rather than charging the final image through contrast. The phrase itself arrives late, summarizing rather than shaping prior beats.</comment>
