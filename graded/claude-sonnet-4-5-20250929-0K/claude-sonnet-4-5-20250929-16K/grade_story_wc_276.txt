<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior is vivid and embodied throughout—"fear crystallizing in her spine," the cool-headed temperament tested by desperation. Her motivation (saving her daughter from silence) drives every choice, and the closing cost is dramatized: she risks transliteration of her own emotions to capture the laugh. Minor slip: the daughter's voicelessness could have been seeded earlier to deepen the contradictory pull between fishing expertise and parental helplessness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Mira follows the wrongness → produces anti-sound → pins the echo → brings it home, each beat linked by because/therefore pressure. The closure lands on-page with visible cost (the goddess's laugh transliterates silence into speech), and the constellation sleepwalking frames the disruption that enables the hunt. Orientation is swift (skiff, garden, Orion drifting). One hairline slip: the mechanics of "voicing silence" arrive late and could have been primed in an earlier micro-choice to tighten escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is realized through vivid, purposeful detail: crystalline terraces vibrating at visible frequencies, emotional echoes pooling like salmon, dissonant chords from Cassiopeia's drunken W. The rail spike—cold iron inscribed with equations—constrains the climax by pinning the frequency. Spatial choreography (skiff above terraces, spike through hull) remains clear. The garden's acoustic memory and resonant atmosphere supply the resources that enable the catch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catch the goddess's laugh to cure daughter's silence) is signaled early and pursued through escalating agency: Mira steers toward disturbance, produces anti-sound, drives the spike, holds firm against resistance. The cost is legible: the laugh tries to scatter her across the garden, and she must risk her own transliteration. One tightening deepens pressure (the echo resisting capture while constellations stumble), sufficient for this length. No reversal needed under the causal lens when the final move forecloses all retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme (voicelessness as drowning on dry land, the feral lullaby as teeth-and-tenderness) emerges organically from the hunt. The rail spike and goddess's laugh recur with reweighted meaning: tool becomes tuning fork, laughter becomes translation. The final image—daughter's whisper, constellations righting—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "feral lullaby" is named mid-story but not fully embodied in the daughter's silence earlier, slightly reducing the early-to-final reprise charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly; psychic distance stays controlled. Diction is character-particular: "fisher by trade and temperament," "the space between words," "frequencies that erased rather than created." Perceptual signature is consistent (cool-headed observation sharpening under fear). The prose modulates with pressure—short clauses at the spike-driving beat, longer syntactic arcs during reflection. No head-hopping, no filter stacks in peak beats. One micro note: "transliterate emotions into matter" verges on elevated register but remains anchored in the magical mechanics.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high density ("She cupped her hands around the sound, feeling it translate her desperation into something that pulsed with possibility"). Minimal scaffold. Opening line anchors stakes and voice; final line recharges prior material (constellations, singing daughter). One cluster of adjacent figurative constructions in the middle third ("emotions swam too fast," "frequencies that erased," "garden shuddered") approaches density ceiling but remains legible and voice-motivated. No loops or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—sound wave garden + sleepwalking constellations + emotional echoes as fishable resource—feels specific and non-obvious. The rail spike as tuning fork and the method of "voicing silence" transform familiar quest structure. Trope of curing muteness is elevated by the tactile, sensory mechanics. One friction: the daughter's voicelessness ("absorbed too much silence") and the goddess's transliteration power arrive late in exposition, reducing transformation's inevitability in hindsight. Risk-taking (anti-sound, transliteration threat) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's cool-headed temperament shapes multiple beats: steering toward disturbance, holding firm during resistance, sustaining composure while the laugh threatens to scatter her. Her decisions (where to steer, when to produce anti-sound, driving the spike) create the key turns. Present in setup, middle choices, and closure action. Cost is tied to her stance: cool-headedness is tested to breaking but holds.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rail spike is introduced early (grandmother's tool, cold iron with equations), handled at the climax (driven through the hull to pin the frequency), and its mechanics (lodestone for divine laughter, anchor in deeper frequencies) enable the catch. Two beats: hanging from belt, then spike-driving action. The inscribed equations could have constrained an earlier choice to reach indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sleepwalking constellations frame the inciting condition (patterns breaking, echoes scattering), guide Mira's navigation (Cassiopeia's drunken W triggers dissonant chords), and bookend the closure (constellations stumble back into patterns). The concept redefines fishing grounds and creates the window for the hunt. Central to world logic and stakes. Present in setup, middle tactics, and final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Transliteration appears mid-story as the goddess's laugh property (emotions into matter, silence into speech) and drives the closure payoff (daughter's voice restored). The trait constrains Mira's approach (she must capture this specific echo) and enables the resolution. Cost is implied: Althea's laugh could transliterate Mira's own emotions into dangerous frequencies. Would score higher if the mechanics were primed earlier.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Zigzag describes the scattered echoes' flight ("fleeing into impossible angles," "zigzag through impossible angles") and signals the disruption Mira must overcome. The action shapes her method (producing anti-sound pauses the zigzag flight). Present in setup and middle complication. Swappable with "scatter" or "flee" without major structural change, limiting indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voicing silence is signaled mid-story, explained ("producing anti-sound, frequencies that erased rather than created"), and enacted at the climax. The method is paradoxical and specific to Mira's daughter's condition. It pauses the echoes and enables the capture. Two beats: explanation and execution. Late first appearance (~50% mark) caps ceiling, but the mechanics matter and are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sound wave garden structures every choice: crystalline terraces with visible frequencies create the fishing grounds, harmonic sequences dictate tactics, the garden's infinite acoustic memory preserves the goddess's laugh, resonant atmosphere responds to constellation movements. The setting supplies the resource (echoes), the constraint (deeper frequencies need special tools), and the final victory condition. Essential across beats and indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Timeframe (when patterns break) opens the story, enables the hunt (broken patterns scatter echoes into catchable positions), and closes the arc (patterns restore when Mira succeeds). The disruption creates urgency and alters Mira's usual fishing. Present in setup (constellations begin sleepwalking), middle pressure (disoriented wandering complicates the catch), and closure (sleepwalking finally done). Causal and specific.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation (catch the goddess's laugh to cure daughter's silence) is dramatized early, tested by resistance (laugh twisting, trying to scatter Mira), and fulfilled at closure with visible cost (risk of self-transliteration). Mira's desperation and the daughter's voicelessness drive every tactic. Friction between want (restore voice) and cost (potential self-loss) is embodied on-page. The final payoff ("Mother?") validates the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Feral lullaby is named once mid-story ("wild, untamed song that mothers sing when civilization's answers fail… teeth and tenderness in equal measure") and thematically charges Mira's desperation. Tone modulates from cool observation to urgent action to tender closure. The label could be implicit throughout rather than explicitly named; the teeth-and-tenderness duality is present in Mira's risk-taking and final listening. Purposeful but not indispensable.</comment>
