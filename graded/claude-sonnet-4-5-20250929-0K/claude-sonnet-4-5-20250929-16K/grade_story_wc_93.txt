<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaela's interior states are vivid—"never staying in one place long enough for anyone to find her"—and her contradictory curse (seeing futures that hinder her) embodies internal conflict. Her transformation from fulfilling a promise as burden to blueprint is earned through the rock-placing sequence. However, the sister's death and Kaela's relationship to her remain told rather than embodied in present micro-choices; the emotional weight of the promise never faces a dramatized on-page test that would force a visible trade-off. The ending shift feels thematic rather than rooted in a prior contradiction acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly: tidal bluff, aurora, Kaela alone. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: dust flares, eels shift, visions narrow, culminating in a conceptual repricing where "the pattern wasn't about understanding… it was about harnessing." The closure reweights the premise with cost (the promise transforms from burden to blueprint, and Kaela accepts the role of teacher in a frictionless world). One deduction: the cost is conceptual and felt but not materially visible—no forfeited option or renounced path is shown on the page, only a recalibrated stance. The lens holds and the closure lands; cost legibility keeps it from higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bluff "where the stone held memory of friction" anchors the placement ritual, and the frictionless bay pressures Kaela's twice-wrong tide predictions. The aurora pulses "matching her heartbeat," charging the final sequence. Micro-setting (rocks, dust) participates in the closure when threads of light connect them. However, the tidal mechanics and eel movements remain ornamental description rather than tangible constraints that alter her tactics during the ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: fulfill the sister's promise by decoding patterns. The visions tighten ("came faster now, more insistent"), and the rock sequence triggers a convergence ("futures… narrowing to single points"). Agency appears in the placement and the final realization. Deduction: the escalation is atmospheric (visions accelerate, dust flares) without a mid-story reversal that narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The final insight transforms her stance but does not show what she renounced to reach it; the cost remains conceptual rather than a forfeited path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: "borrowed dawn" as temporary world, elusiveness as survival, the eels' sacred geometry teaching humanity to swim rather than fall. The closure offers a non-literal answer (transformation, not ending) without stating a moral. The collapsed star dust and mathematical sequences accumulate meaning without forced recurrence. One slip: "Her promise to her sister transformed from burden to blueprint" edges toward thematic summary, though it remains grounded in the action of completing the pattern.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and controlled: "undulating through space," "light pretending at beginning," "elusive to those who might find her." POV remains stable in close third; perceptual signature (visions, pattern recognition) is character-specific. Filter verbs ("she wondered," "she saw") appear but stay voice-motivated. One deduction for register drift: "sacred geometries that predated human mathematics" and "harnessing what came next" elevate diction during peak beats in ways that feel slightly external to Kaela's established idiom of motion and elusiveness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in the rock-placing sequence. Minor loops: "The aurora pulsed above, its rhythm matching her heartbeat" closely echoes "The aurora sang overhead" in tone without added pressure. "Being elusive had become survival" and later "Kaela remained elusive" restate the same anchor. Figurative language in most sentences of the closure beat (threads of light, eels shifting, aurora singing, futures narrowing) clusters metaphor without full clarity on physical vs. visionary events, creating mild overwriting (−0.4 in Q7). No causality break, so penalty remains here.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The frictionless-world premise and eel-herder protagonist offer a fresh synthesis, and the "borrowed dawn" frame feels specific. The emotional arc (promise as burden → blueprint) and the shift from understanding-the-past to harnessing-the-future avoid stock templates. Deduction: the sacred geometry/mathematical sequence and collapsed star dust feel like prompt-response elements layered onto the premise rather than arising inevitably from Kaela's character or the world's internal logic. The transformation is thematically sound but the mechanics (dust responding to "mathematical truth") remain asserted rather than integrated with visible cost or prior struggle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kaela decides to place the rocks and interprets the vision at closure, altering her understanding of the promise. She is present throughout and her elusiveness pressures the frame. However, most narrative beats describe her state or the world rather than showing her making choices under opposing pressure; the closure turn is conceptual realization rather than a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Collapsed star dust is harvested, carried, placed in rocks, flares connecting rock to rock, and "responded to mathematical truth." It appears in three beats (harvest mention, placement, flare) and participates in the closure. Cap at 7.1: it does not constrain her choices or carry visible cost—its properties are asserted ("glowed faintly purple," "substance from before the change") but their mechanics do not narrow options or force trade-offs on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The promise to her sister frames the entire arc and transforms at closure ("from burden to blueprint"). It shapes Kaela's dominant stake and is present early, middle, and end. Deduction to 5.8: the promise is told and reflected upon but never tested by an on-page opposing force or dilemma that would require Kaela to choose between fulfilling it and another live cost. It motivates but does not constrain.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The curse (seeing futures) appears early, complicates twice (tides predicted wrong), and accelerates ("came faster now"). At closure visions converge, guiding the realization. Cap at 4.3: the curse is a flavor rather than a constraint with visible cost—misreading tides is mentioned as past near-loss, and the visions at the end clarify rather than forcing a trade-off. No on-page choice shows Kaela paying a price for the curse's operation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Harness" appears late (final third) as the realization: "the pattern wasn't about understanding… it was about harnessing what came next." It redefines the mission and charges the closure image. Deduction: introduced conceptually at the end rather than dramatized through attempts earlier; the shift from "understand" to "harness" is thematic rather than a tactical turn that alters her method on the page. The term itself is swappable ("direct," "use").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Painting rocks in sequences (primes, Fibonacci, constellation mirror) is signaled early, executed mid-story, and triggers the closure flare. The method is specific (collapsed star dust in symbols, mathematical truth), and its completion drives the eels' response and vision convergence. Deduction to 7.8: the mechanics (why these sequences, how dust "responds") remain asserted rather than tested through failure or adjustment; the method succeeds on first attempt without visible cost or constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tidal bluff is named, located (up-coast from crater), and used as the ritual site. It provides "stone [that] held memory of friction" and overlooks the bay where eels move. The aurora overhead participates in the closure. Deduction: the bluff supplies atmosphere and a stable platform but does not constrain Kaela's choices—she could place rocks elsewhere. The tides threaten her collection (mentioned twice) but never materialize as on-page pressure during the ritual.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After friction disappears" is the premise and frames all world details (frictionless waters, eel advantage, undulating movement). It appears early and recurs. Cap at 5.1: it is setting context rather than a timeframe that tightens decisions. The narrative unfolds in "borrowed dawn" with no live clock or countdown; Kaela works "as if the universe itself demanded she work quicker," but no on-page consequence tests that urgency. The visions show "three tides from now," offering looser future stakes rather than immediate time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Understanding sacred patterns is Kaela's stated goal, repeated across beats ("decode the patterns," "studied for years," "months of trial"). At closure the desire shifts to harnessing and teaching. Deduction: the motivation is told and reflected but not dramatized through a choice where understanding conflicts with another want or cost. The shift from understanding to harnessing feels thematic rather than a friction resolved by sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Borrowed dawn" is coined mid-story, glossed ("Everything since the friction disappeared felt borrowed… light pretending at beginning"), and reprised at closure ("no longer borrowed but earned"). The tone modulates from elusive/provisional to committed/earned, charging the final image. It integrates with the frictionless premise and Kaela's transformation. Deduction to 7.0: the phrase is meta-commentary on tone rather than an object or image with physical presence; its shift is conceptual, and removing it would not break the story's logic, only its lyric resonance.</comment>
