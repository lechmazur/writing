<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior contradiction between diaspora rootlessness and desire for continuity is embodied through her "purposeful wandering" underground—a specific behavioral signature that shapes her choices. The priest's arc from declarative dismissal to "cautious enchantment" feels clean, though his reversal could have been tested by a micro-choice that costs him something on the page. Mira's grandmother remains an orienting anchor rather than a lived presence, which is appropriate at this length. The final choice to return is earned by the accumulated sensory and conceptual work, though the cost (leaving again, but differently) is more implied than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira's realization that "interruptions were not endings but transformations" reweights her prior wandering and the village's broken faith, and the sundial's shadowless operation crystallizes the new continuity. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density increases through root/bone imagery, and the cadence shift from excavation-as-duty to sundial-as-communal-reset reconfigures the dominant stake (restoring rootedness). Cost is conceptual and relational: she will leave again, but the departure now forecloses her prior diaspora drift. Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two (village, orchard, catacombs, reburial task). One meaningful deepening: the priest's visit and communal reburial together elevate private rite to shared renewal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains Mira's choices: roots breaking through ceiling guide her wandering, the pear-root chamber houses the sundial discovery, and the final placement among wild trees charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy is consistent—cool darkness, white blossoms as childhood flash, bone-rich earth—and filtered through Mira's "warmly curious" rather than repelled perception. The sundial base's inverted state (timekeeper below ground, gnomon lost) supplies both a concrete constraint (she must carry it up, piece by piece) and charges the thematic inversion motif. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across descent, lateral wandering, and ascent without floating-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore lost internal rootedness) is signaled in paragraph five and tightens through the priest's visit, which transforms private rite into communal renewal and reweights the dormant faith. Mira's agency is decision and endurance: she chooses purposeful wandering over direct excavation, commits to rebuilding the sundial without certainty of function, and the final placement among wild trees with the village forecloses her prior diaspora pattern. One meaningful deepening: discovering the sundial script in her grandmother's language narrows her task from fulfilling rites to reconstructing continuity itself. The priest's shift from "superstitions best forgotten" to participating embodies external pressure that Mira's work has made newly legible, though his arc could have been tested by a visible cost to deepen the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (interrupted continuity as transformation rather than rupture) emerges from concrete particulars: roots and bones "became indistinguishable," the sundial measures time through branch-shadows rather than a gnomon, and the priest's recovery that "our faith was never just about heaven" reframes the old ceremonies without stating a moral. The final image—"roots and bones remembered each other's names"—offers a non-literal answer to Mira's question (can diaspora hollow-out be reversed?) by demonstrating that continuity survives through metabolic rather than memorial logic. The piece resists binary faith-versus-modernity in favor of showing faith "grow like these trees, nourished by what came before." One caveat: "Some interruptions…were not endings but transformations" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary, though the image work immediately following (light on stone, Mira's departure-with-return certainty) earns the insight rather than asserting it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable distance and filters perception through Mira's specific lens: "warmly curious rather than repelled," "purposeful wandering" as named practice, and her quickening pulse at recognizing her grandmother's script. The priest's single line of dialogue ("I had forgotten…") carries subtext (his prior dismissal, now recanted) and advances plot by authorizing communal participation. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices root-carved passages, burial-niche names, and the sundial's seasonal rather than hourly script—details that reflect her search for continuity rather than spectacle. One slip: "the village elder handed her the rusted key" in paragraph three front-loads a fact (catacombs beneath orchard) that Mira learns only upon descent, creating brief retroactive omniscience, though the effect is minor and does not obscure present action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences do double work (e.g., "roots had broken through the catacomb ceiling, snaking between skulls and ribcages, drawing sustenance from the bone-rich earth" grounds setting, advances the grotesque-sacred logic, and primes the inversion theme). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and paragraph lengths create visual cadence that breathes during reflection and tightens during discovery beats. One minor loop: "She would leave again, she knew. But this time, she would return" in the final paragraph echoes the opening's "This time, she told herself, would be different" without adding new pressure, though the shift from self-assertion to grounded certainty justifies the reprise. No filter-verb stacks, no template cadence, no metaphor muddle. The "wooden lightning" image for roots is fresh and legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of diaspora return, reburial rites, and a sundial that measures time through living-branch shadows rather than a fixed gnomon offers a non-obvious angle on faith-renewal narratives. The inversion motif (above/below, life/death, interruption/transformation) is specific to this catacomb-orchard rather than a generic metaphor. Emotional truth—Mira's hollowed-out rootlessness and her discovery that continuity survives metabolically—avoids both sentimentality and cynicism. The priest's arc from dismissal to participation and Mira's "purposeful wandering" as method add credible friction. One proximity note: the roots-and-bones marriage has echoes in eco-Gothic traditions, but the piece earns its use through sustained sensory particulars and the sundial's fresh twist. Risk-taking in structure (extended reflection interleaved with present action) heightens thematic density without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira (diaspora returnee) drives all key turns: choosing purposeful wandering over direct excavation, discovering the sundial and recognizing the script, deciding to rebuild it without certainty, and placing it communally. Her choices alter tactics (from private rite to shared renewal) and foreclose her prior diaspora drift. Present by paragraph one, active across excavation and priest-visit beats, and decisive at closure. Cost is visible: she will leave again, but the departure now carries different weight. Strong causal work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sundial base appears in multiple beats: discovery in pear-root chamber, excavation and script recognition, carrying it piece by piece to surface, and final placement among wild trees where branch-shadows replace the lost gnomon. It reweights the interruption theme (timekeeper displaced from sun, now functional through improvisation) and charges the closure image. Setup mid-story, development through Mira's repeated return, payoff at communal reburial. Specific properties (circular platform, seasonal script, missing gnomon) matter and cannot be swapped. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interrupted journeys shape on-page stakes: Mira's prior three visits "cut short," her family's reburial rites "interrupted by war and exile," the priest's lost faith, and the village's broken continuity. The concept alters options—Mira's task becomes completing what was left unfinished, and the resolution redefines interruption as transformation rather than rupture. It pressures the ending choice (she will leave but return) and the sundial's function (branch-shadows, not a gnomon). Present throughout, causal at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" filters Mira's perception of the grotesque root-and-bone marriage ("curious rather than repelled, sensing some sacred logic") and licenses her purposeful wandering rather than direct task-focus. It enables one key choice: repeated returns to the sundial chamber instead of linear excavation. The trait appears early, constrains method, and coheres with the final communal placement. One small friction: it remains perceptual more than action-tested—no on-page moment where warm curiosity costs her something concrete (time, social friction, physical risk). Mid-high integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rebuild (the sundial) drives Mira's repeated returns to the pear-root chamber, her physical labor carrying it piece by piece to surface, and the communal placement that redefines the reburial rites as shared renewal. Without this action, the story would reduce to private excavation without the transformation-of-interruption payoff. Setup after discovery, development across "following weeks," payoff at closure. The action redefines options (from fulfilling rites to reconstructing continuity) and charges the final image. Strong causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Purposeful wandering" is named explicitly, practiced on-page ("following root-carved passages, discovering chambers she hadn't known existed"), and its mechanics matter: it leads to the sundial discovery rather than direct excavation. The method signals Mira's approach to rootedness (metabolic rather than memorial) and coheres with the final insight that faith "needed to grow like these trees." Setup early, development through discovery beats, implicit at closure (the communal act as purposeful rather than prescribed). Method shapes attempts and outcome.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard constrains choices throughout: roots guide Mira's wandering, the pear-root chamber houses the sundial, the bone-rich earth provides the sustenance metaphor, and the wild trees supply the branch-shadows that restore the sundial's function at closure. Spatial particulars (cool darkness, root-broken ceiling, burial niches) alter tactics and mood. Setup in paragraphs two-three, active across excavation and discovery, indispensable at communal placement. Removing this exact setting would collapse the story's logic and image system. Exemplary integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The excavation timeframe ("weeks," "each morning," "following weeks") provides pacing and Mira's iterative labor, but the clock does not tighten decisions or impose visible trade-offs. The reburial day arrives without on-page deadline pressure or a moment where time scarcity forces a choice. The duration earns the priest's visit and Mira's certainty of return, but it remains scaffolding more than active constraint. Setup early, implicit across beats, present at closure. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Restoring lost faith is Mira's stated motive ("hoped that by completing what her family had left unfinished, she might rebuild that internal architecture") and is dramatized through her choice to persist despite the priest's dismissal, her discovery that the sundial measures "festivals of remembrance," and the communal reburial that reweights dormant faith as living practice. The motivation creates friction (her years abroad "had hollowed something in her") and the resolution shows faith restored not as retrieval but as metabolic growth. Setup paragraph five, tested by priest's skepticism, resolved at closure. Strong causal work.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Cautious enchantment" is embodied in Mira's response to the root-and-bone grotesque ("warmly curious…sensing some sacred logic"), modulates through the priest's "reluctant" descent and his whispered recovery of forgotten faith, and charges the final image where branch-shadows measure time "well enough" despite the missing gnomon. The tone coheres through discovery beats and intensifies at closure without flipping to triumph or sentimentality. It supports the transformation-of-interruption theme and pressures the ending's poise. Consistent, purposeful modulation.</comment>
