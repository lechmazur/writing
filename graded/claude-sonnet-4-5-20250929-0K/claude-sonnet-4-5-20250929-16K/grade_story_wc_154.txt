<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is concrete and her translator's instinct drives key choices. The relationship with the girl builds purposefully toward the final decision to help, though the morphine's effect on her perception could be more consistently embodied throughout. The "lotus-hearted ache" phrase in the pivotal moment edges toward metaphoric over-articulation but the micro-choice to share the coral and commit to translation work carries visible cost. Minor embodiment gaps in the middle section prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (recovery center, post-surgery, twilight). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered translation work (smudged cast notes, multiple languages, coral fragment) and the final offer to "unknot every story" reweights Maya's prior collecting of wounds into active preservation with felt cost (time, energy, reopening trauma). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where Maya moves from passive cataloging to committed co-translation, forecloses solitary drift, and the cost is legible in her recognition of wounds she "didn't know how to heal." One meaningful deepening present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium provides sensory grounding (purple-gray twilight, fountain mist) and the cast functions as micro-setting—its dense script constrains Maya's approach and charges the ending commitment. Spatial choreography is clear (bench, fountain, glass ceiling). The brain coral as handled object (twice: shown, traced by the girl) reweights meaning at closure. Minor: the recovery center's broader layout remains vague, but at this length the localized atrium and tactile objects do the necessary work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Maya's need to process displacement trauma through translation; secondary accent is the girl's fear of forgetting. The encounter tightens when Maya recognizes "khlong" and her own wound-collection, then deepens when she commits to co-translation, forecloses her drift, and accepts shared labor. Agency is clear: Maya's decision to help is neither luck nor coincidence. The cost is on the page—reopening her own unhealed wounds and binding herself to long collaborative work. One meaningful pressure point with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus forgetting emerges through concrete particulars (canal, coral, smudged notes) without overt statement. The brain coral as "memory made solid" and the cast as "map back to her" are purposeful, though the final line's "unknotting the past one careful word at a time" edges toward summary. The lotus-hearted ache phrase is borderline stock-poetic. The piece resists tidy resolution—Maya's wounds remain unhealed—but the ending risks gentle summary over a sharper image. Non-literal resonance is present but could be tighter.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Maya; psychic distance modulates appropriately (morphine haze early, sharpening focus on the cast). Perceptual signature is strong: translator's cataloging instinct, recognition of conflict-zone stillness, decryption mode. Dialogue is spare, natural, and goal-driven ("Khlong... I can't remember what it means"). Minor: "shrewdly innocent" as narrator observation rather than dramatized behavior, and "lotus-hearted ache" as elevated diction in a peak beat slightly jars against the otherwise grounded register. No head-hopping or tense slips.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies well and information density is high. Minor issues: "shared anxieties bloomed between them like night-flowering jasmine" stacks metaphor in a high-pressure beat; "understanding flooding through her" is stock; "the work of translation—not just of words, but of grief into remembrance, of loss into preservation, of silence into testimony" is a structured list that risks scaffold rhythm. The final paragraph's "two translators... unknotting the past one careful word at a time" borders on summary rather than image. No loops or major clarity problems, but figurative density in key beats and one thematic summary prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pairing of translator and displaced child offers specificity; the cast as multilingual notebook is fresh. However, the core arc—traumatized helper finds healing through helping another—is a widely used template, and the morphine frame is underused after the opening. The brain coral and "unknotting" motifs are purposeful but not surprising. Emotional authenticity is strong, yet the synthesis feels more competent than inevitable. Risk-taking is modest; the piece chooses a safe, affirming resolution over sharper ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maya's identity as Pacific conflict-zone translator is signaled early, drives her recognition of "khlong" and conflict-zone stillness, and motivates her final commitment to help. Present in two beats (recognition, decision) and shapes closure. Slightly swappable with another aid-worker role, but the translation frame is causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Brain coral introduced early, handled twice (Maya holds it, girl traces it), and returned at closure as "reminder that some things endure." The "memory made solid" metaphor charges the preservation theme. Not indispensable—another object could serve—but the whorls-as-brain specificity and reprise earn mid-band credit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Shared anxieties (fear of forgetting, pain of remembering) are named and dramatized through both characters' actions. The stake is shaped by this concept: Maya's unhealed wounds and the girl's compulsive note-writing. It constrains the final choice—both commit to preservation work together. Present across beats and integral to closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is observed by Maya in the child's stillness but not causally enacted by the girl in a choice that alters tactics. The trait is described, not used. It colors atmosphere but remains label-only without visible cost or enabling action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unknot" appears in recognition ("You're writing a map... unknotting") and the closing commitment ("unknotting the past one careful word at a time"). The verb frames the central action and is irreplaceable to the translation/decryption logic. Present in at least two beats and charges the ending, though the final use edges toward metaphoric summary.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Decrypting smudged notes is signaled early (dense script in multiple languages), dramatized in the middle beat where Maya reads and recognizes patterns, and directly enables the final offer to "unknot every story on your cast." The mechanics matter: overlapping languages and crossed-out words create the puzzle that Maya solves. Essential to escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium at twilight provides sensory anchoring (purple-gray light, fountain mist) and the bench as meeting site. The setting enables the encounter but does not constrain choices—the conversation could occur elsewhere. The twilight mood supports tone but lacks tactical pressure. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Anesthetic kicking in is mentioned at the opening ("morphine made the air taste sweet") but does not tighten decisions or create a time constraint. The frame is ornamental; no clock pressures the ending. Maya drifts but the morphine's effect on her cognition is not tracked or used to complicate the scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Graft new meaning onto old wounds" is spoken by Maya at the climax and frames her commitment. The desire is dramatized through her prior wound-collection and the final choice to help, with visible cost (reopening trauma, binding herself to long work). Friction between helping and self-protection is present. Integral to closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Lotus-hearted ache" appears once in the pivotal beat and matches the story's tender, melancholic tone. The phrase is slightly elevated but coherent. Tone modulates from hazy (anesthetic) to focused (decryption) to committed (ending), supporting pressure without static repetition. The final image sustains the ache without resolving it. Solid integration but not indispensable.</comment>
