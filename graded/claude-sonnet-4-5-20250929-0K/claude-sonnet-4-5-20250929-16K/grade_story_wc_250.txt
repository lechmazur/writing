<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's guilt is embodied through concrete detail ("weight of words she couldn't release, a half-spoken secret lodged in her throat like a stone") and her confession is earned through the guardian's patient demonstration. The guardian remains symbolic rather than psychologically grounded—his silence is thematic but limits interior contradiction. The brother exists only as stake-object rather than relationship under pressure. Minor label-speak in peak beats ("stillwater tension" in the guardian's eyes) nudges the score down but does not break the closure choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words (cobalt dock, canal, twilight, Mara + guardian). The piece follows a causal lens: Mara's witnessing the light patterns → understanding her own darkness → confession → brother's rescue. One meaningful tightening occurs when the guardian points downstream, narrowing her options to speak or let silence drown them both. Closure lands on-page with visible cost (she must confess and guide the searchers), and the final image of her learning the patterns reconfigures her role from secret-keeper to future guardian. The ending leans slightly didactic ("some guardians teach not through words...") but the action sequence preceding it earns the shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, rain-slicked surface, coiled ropes, and canal shutters are vivid and purposeful. The dental mirror functions as micro-setting/tool that constrains the guardian's method and charges the final image when Mara places her own mirror on the dock. Sensory selection is strong (silvered light, fragments of twilight, stillwater tension) and filtered through Mara's urgency. The piece does not over-index on occupation or world-building at this length; setting details integrate smoothly into action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Mara's unspoken guilt and her brother's disappearance. One meaningful tightening occurs when the guardian gestures downstream—forcing her to choose between continued silence and saving her brother. The decision is hers (protagonist agency), and the cost is visible: public confession and the end of her safe secrecy. The guardian's light patterns serve as complication and pressure rather than resolution; Mara's voice becomes the active instrument. No coincidence resolves the problem; her knowledge of the tangled currents is causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (truth as navigational light, darkness given meaning by disclosure) emerges through the light-and-shutter patterns and Mara's final choice. The piece avoids overt moralizing until the penultimate paragraph, where "some guardians teach not through words but through the patient architecture of light" edges toward summary. The final image—Mara placing her own mirror and learning the patterns—offers a resonant answer without stating a thesis, but the near-thesis sentence in the prior paragraph lowers the score. Subtext operates well in the guardian's gestures and the shutters' responsive choreography.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (Mara's mix of confusion, guilt, and dawning understanding). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("spiralingly calm precision," "stillwater tension") that feels authorial rather than Mara's lived idiom under stress, especially when she's in crisis. The dialogue line ("I untied my brother's boat...") carries naturalism and advances plot. Psychic distance is stable; filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Brief compression at peak stress (when she runs to the harbor master) maintains clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse; paragraph lengths create visual flow. However, several repeated stems and near-paraphrases appear: "He didn't greet her" → "Instead, he reached"; "Then his hands began to move" adjacent to "He began to weave patterns"; "stars—or the idea of stars—pinpricks of light" → "creating constellations with their windows." The phrase "spiralingly calm" recurs in both the opening and close without evolving. Figurative density is high in non-peak beats (fragments of twilight like scattered coins, stillwater tension, architecture of light) but remains mostly coherent. Proofreading is clean; no loops severe enough to obscure causality, but synonym churn and template cadence in the middle third apply −0.6 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The silent guardian teaching through light patterns offers a fresh angle on confession and redemption. The dental mirror as tool is specific and non-obvious. However, the canal-guardian archetype and the light-as-truth metaphor are familiar; the piece does not fully transform them through unique world logic or moral calculus. Emotional truth is strong (Mara's guilt, her mother's desperate eyes), and the ending's synthesis (silent teaching → vocal courage) feels earned. The piece commits to its premise but does not take bold structural risks or offer a counterintuitive moral stance. Specificity and particularity elevate but do not reach the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Silent canal guardian: present by paragraph one (setup); demonstrates light patterns to Mara in middle beats (development); gestures downstream to force her confession and appears in closure reflection (payoff). His choice to continue weaving patterns after she leaves participates in the ending's charge. Causal pressure: his demonstration narrows Mara's options by externalizing her internal conflict. Two gates plus closure participation; specificity moderate (unnamed, symbolic). Score: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dental mirror: introduced early (paragraph two, setup); used to create light patterns across shutters (middle beats, development); Mara places her own mirror on the dock in the final paragraph (closure participation, reweighted meaning). Causal pressure: the mirror enables the guardian's teaching method, which drives Mara's confession. Three gates, closure linkage strong, irreplaceable (a generic mirror would dilute the oddness and specificity). Score: 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Silent empathy: framed early ("silent canal guardian," patterns "seemed random until Mara's eyes adjusted"); shapes middle beats when "silent empathy moved through the geometry of light"; closure reflection states "some guardians teach not through words." However, the concept is mostly thematic label rather than on-page constraint—Mara's choice to confess is driven by guilt and the guardian's demonstration, not by a dramatic test of silent versus spoken modes. Lyric reprise without strong causal grip. Score: 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Spiralingly calm: appears twice as descriptor ("spiralingly calm precision" for the guardian's hands; "spiralingly calm beneath the stars" in the final line). Does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost; functions as atmospheric label. Present in setup and closure (lyric reprise) but no middle development or causal pressure. Two gates (setup, closure mention) but ornamental use. Score: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Weave: signaled early ("began to weave patterns"); the guardian's weaving of light-and-shadow creates the teaching moment that drives Mara's confession (middle causal pressure); after her brother's rescue, "the guardian resumed his patterns, weaving light across water" and Mara "began to learn the patterns" (closure participation). Three gates, causal linkage to confession, but the action is somewhat swappable (flash, signal, or draw could substitute with minor edits). Score: 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Creating patterns with shutters: introduced paragraph three ("adjusting the mirror's tilt, sending light dancing across the wooden slats"); middle beats show "other shutters began responding, opening in rhythm" and "patterns that made the darkness meaningful" (development); closure image includes "shutters remained open, casting reflections" (payoff). Three gates; the method is the mechanism of silent empathy and drives Mara's understanding. Specificity high; irreplaceable. Score: 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cobalt dock after rain: anchors opening image ("glistened after rain, its surface reflecting fragments of twilight"); Mara finds the guardian there (setup); in closure, "She placed her own mirror on the dock's edge" (payoff). The rain-slicked surface mirrors the light patterns thematically but does not constrain a choice. Three gates; moderate causal pressure (location enables the encounter). Score: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Within the edge of a half-spoken secret: mentioned in paragraph one ("weight of words she couldn't release, a half-spoken secret lodged in her throat"); the secret drives her confession in the climax. However, no live clock tightens decisions—three nights have passed since the boat drifted, and the timeframe is retrospective rather than urgent. The "edge" metaphor is not revisited or tightened. Two gates (setup, thematic link to confession) but no middle pressure or closure mention. Score: 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>To teach darkness the value of stars: stated directly in paragraph six ("He was teaching darkness the value of stars"); the guardian's demonstration enacts this motivation (middle beats); closure reflection echoes it ("patient architecture of light, showing us that our darkest truths, once spoken, become the very stars that guide us home"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice—the guardian's interior is opaque. Three gates but minimal friction or cost tied to the desire itself. Score: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stillwater tension: introduced early ("His eyes held stillwater tension: surface calm concealing profound depth"); modulates through the light-pattern sequence (calm demonstration building to Mara's break); final line returns to calm ("The canal moved spiralingly calm beneath the stars"). Tone coheres through turns and charges the ending image. Three gates; no significant slips. Score: 6.1.</comment>
