<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to uncover the truth about his grandmother's displacement is rooted in concrete stakes and drives his methodical investigation. His interior experience—"understanding shifting through him like light through deep water"—shows embodied thought, though some moments veer toward summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to photograph documents and pocket the stamp reads as earned by prior causality, but the ease of his escape and the lack of visible internal conflict at the closure beat prevent higher scoring. Minor slips: "tranquilly perceptive" and "dappled resolve" feel like imposed descriptor phrases rather than organic character texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a causal lens: blackout grants access, Marcus finds evidence, he photographs it before security arrives, and he preserves proof for future revelation. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Charged Poise—Marcus sits calm at his station with proof in hand, options reconfigured and cost implied (risk of discovery, the weight of his grandmother's silenced struggle now his to bear). One meaningful tightening occurs when footsteps approach and he must accelerate his documentation. The cost is more implied than viscerally felt on the page, preventing entry into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sunken city library is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail: "pressure-groan of the sea," "water damage darkened the lower drawers," reinforced glass holding back "crushing dark." The blackout functions as a concrete constraint that unlocks the magnetic archive door and shapes Marcus's tactics (headlamp navigation, memory-based escape). The setting pressures every choice and charges the final image of ocean pressing against glass while Marcus holds salvaged truth. The bronze stamp's weight and the portfolio's leather texture ground the discovery in tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the conspiracy behind his grandmother's displacement—is signaled early and tightens when the blackout grants access to the sealed archive. One meaningful reversal: Marcus finds not just corporate documents but his grandmother's Preservation Society stamp, reweighting the discovery from abstract history to personal inheritance. The approaching footsteps force tactical adjustment (faster photography, selective prioritization). However, the escape itself carries no visible cost or complication; Marcus simply slips away "like a ghost through history," and security never catches up. The final cost is more conceptual (burden of truth) than felt in immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: salvaged archives, deliberate flooding, silence versus erasure. The closing image—"stillness wasn't silence, and forgetting wasn't the same as erasing"—resonates with prior material without stating a moral. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("Some truths waited, preserved in unexpected places") rather than letting the image do all the work. The grandmother's stamp and the concept of "reclaimed stillness" function more as thematic echoes than as elements that constrain choice, preventing the theme from fully charging the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited; Marcus's perceptual signature favors archival precision and methodical observation. Diction generally fits a logical indexer's interior voice. Two register slips lower the score: "tranquilly perceptive focus" and "dappled resolve" read as externally imposed descriptors rather than voice-motivated phrasing, and the phrase "honest origins" appears three times as a thematic placeholder. Under peak pressure (security approaching), syntax compresses appropriately. No dialogue present; all evaluation rests on narrative voice, which remains controlled but occasionally drifts into prompt-language rather than character-particular thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are generally strong; sentences vary in structure and the prose advances efficiently. However, several text artifacts accumulate: "reclaimed stillness" appears as a repeated phrase in abstract context without dramatized pressure (opening and closing); "tranquilly perceptive" and "dappled resolve" are descriptor insertions that feel templated; "honest origins" recurs three times as a thematic label. The phrase "understanding shifting through him like light through deep water" is poetic but slightly mixed (light and water don't quite cohere as metaphor vehicles). These patterns don't obscure causality but do create minor friction across multiple beats, triggering cumulative deduction in the −0.8 to −1.0 range per the non-closure accumulation cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sunken-city library premise is vivid and the blackout-as-access-opportunity mechanic is solid genre execution. However, the core arc—lone archivist discovers conspiracy documents during a power outage and escapes with evidence—follows a recognizable template without a sharp transformation. The grandmother's stamp adds personal weight but doesn't fundamentally alter the emotional or moral calculus. The conspiracy itself (deliberate flooding for real-estate profit) reads plausible but not surprising. Specificity in setting and Marcus's occupation elevate the piece, but the resolution (he will share the truth tomorrow) is straightforward and lacks a non-obvious turn or synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's role as logical page indexer enables his access to the archive and informs his methodical approach (systematic drawer checks, prioritized photography). His professional skills shape two key beats: the initial discovery of the portfolio and the tactical adjustment when footsteps approach. However, the trait itself could be replaced with "historian" or "researcher" without major structural change; the specific indexing profession does not constrain a unique choice at closure. Present in setup, development (methodical search), and payoff (calm return to indexing station), meeting all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The antique ink stamp appears in one extended beat: Marcus finds it in the portfolio, recognizes his grandmother's organization symbol, and pockets it as "a tangible connection." It charges the moment of discovery by making the conspiracy personal, but it does not return or evolve after that beat. The stamp is present in the closure paragraph only by implication ("his pocket held proof"). It meets setup (discovered mid-story) and development (recognition reweights the evidence) but lacks payoff involvement; it does not constrain the final choice or reappear with reweighted meaning. Two-gate presence caps eligibility near 6.0; swappability (any grandmother keepsake could serve) and single-beat use prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" is named twice—opening sentence ("reclaimed stillness felt oddly appropriate") and near the end ("moving through reclaimed stillness like a ghost"). It functions as atmospheric description and thematic label rather than shaping stakes or altering tactics. The blackout creates stillness, but Marcus's choices (systematic search, prioritization under time pressure) are driven by the opportunity (unlocked door) and threat (approaching footsteps), not by stillness itself. The concept does not constrain an on-page action or participate causally in closure. Present as theme echo but not as stake-shaping force; ornamental use and late restatement without pressure limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" appears as a descriptor in the second paragraph ("tranquilly perceptive focus") and echoes in the final line ("someone tranquilly perceptive enough to find them"). It labels Marcus's manner but does not constrain or enable a specific choice with visible cost. His methodical search and calm under pressure could be shown without the label; the trait is asserted rather than dramatized through tradeoff. No visible cost tied to being tranquil (e.g., missing an urgent cue) or perceptive (e.g., noticing a detail that creates a dilemma). Ornamental framing without action pressure; swappable with "careful" or "patient."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Readjust" appears once when Marcus hears footsteps: "Marcus readjusted his approach quickly, photographing faster, prioritizing the most damning documents." This moment drives a tactical shift under time pressure and links to the closure (he finishes in time, escapes unseen). However, "readjust" could be replaced with "changed," "shifted," or "adapted" without altering story logic. The action is functional and shapes one key turn but is not irreplaceable. Present in development and indirectly in payoff (the successful escape depends on the speed adjustment), meeting two gates and eligible for mid-6s; specificity and causal role lift it within that band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Alternative hypothesis" appears once: "His alternative hypothesis—that the truth had been physically isolated rather than destroyed—had led him here." This frames Marcus's reasoning and motivates his search of the physical archive, shaping the middle beat (where to look). However, it is stated rather than shown through trial and error, and it does not return or evolve at closure. The method is signaled in setup, enables one development beat (finding the archive), but does not participate in payoff. Two-gate presence and summary-only treatment cap the score; if the hypothesis had been tested and refined on the page with visible cost, it could score higher.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside a sunken city supplies vivid constraints across all three gates: setup anchors the perpetual twilight and ocean pressure; development provides the unlocked archive door (blackout defeats magnetic lock) and the physical portfolio Marcus must handle; payoff returns to the image of ocean pressing against glass while Marcus holds proof. The setting drives multiple tactical choices (headlamp navigation, memory-based escape in darkness) and charges the final image with environmental specificity. Micro-setting elements (filing cabinets, water-damaged drawers, reinforced glass) constrain action and enrich atmosphere. Strong causal role and closure linkage; irreplaceability is high (generic library would not provide the same pressure or thematic weight).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The blackout unlocks the archive door, silences the hum of systems to create eerie stillness, and provides a time window ("lights flickered back on two hours later") that pressures Marcus's search. It shapes setup (emergency gloom, headlamp work), development (unlocked door grants access, approaching footsteps force speed), and payoff (Marcus finishes before power returns and security fully mobilizes). However, the two-hour window is mentioned only in summary after the fact; the clock is not tracked beat-by-beat during the search, reducing live tension. The blackout is essential but the timeframe could be tighter; present in all three gates with moderate causal pressure and closure contribution.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To trace honest origins" is Marcus's stated motivation, named three times and driving the search from the inciting discovery (letters three weeks ago) through tonight's archive raid. The desire is dramatized through goal-directed action (systematic drawer checks, photographing documents, pocketing the stamp) and conflicted by risk (security approaching, need for speed versus thoroughness). The phrase "honest origins" itself is repeated as a thematic label, creating minor template friction, but the underlying want—understand why his grandmother's generation was displaced—remains clear and shapes closure (he will ensure the truth reaches those who deserve it). Setup, development, and payoff are present; cost is implied (risk of discovery, burden of inherited struggle) rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears once in a descriptive phrase ("He worked with dappled resolve, anger and determination flickering through his careful movements"). The tone of methodical focus mixed with suppressed anger is coherent with Marcus's character, but "dappled" as a tonal descriptor is ornamental—it labels the flickering quality rather than modulating with pressure or charging the final image. The story maintains calm determination throughout; the approach of footsteps tightens tactics but does not shift tone. Closure returns to calm focus ("calm and focused, cataloging botanical texts") without invoking "dappled resolve" or its texture. Single mention, no reprise, ornamental phrasing; static mood rather than dynamic modulation.</comment>
