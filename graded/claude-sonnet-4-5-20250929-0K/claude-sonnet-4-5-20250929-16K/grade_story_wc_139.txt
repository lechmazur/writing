<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal contradiction between her father's legacy and her own ethical stance is embodied well through the ink pot and her documented choice at 4 AM. The decision to help Pavel shows consistent character logic—she refuses forgery but finds a truthful path that honors both her father's letters about "spaces between right and wrong" and her own integrity. Pavel's desperation reads authentic, though his arc is thinner. Minor: Mira's embodied emotion could deepen in peak beats; her professional stance occasionally distances us from contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira finds a third path between her father's forgery and rigid honesty, with visible cost in the form of professional risk and emotional labor documented on-page. Orientation is swift (funeral home, Mira, tools, tonight). The causal chain from Pavel's request → Mira's night of waiting → microSD recovery → documented return is clean and motivated. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira discovers the capsule and must decide how to frame the return; her choice to document truthfully forecloses the easier (forged) path her father would have taken.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prep room is used actively: Mira arranges tools, performs routine examination, the drainage system becomes the discovery point, and the space's nocturnal isolation enables the vigil. The formaldehyde opener and "high windows" at dawn bracket the night and charge the closure. The ink pot on her workstation functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—its presence reminds her of inherited sin and primes her refusal to forge. Spatial choreography is clear (Pavel in corner, Elena on table, Mira at workstation). Minor: occupational detail (medical examiner oversight, logbook protocols) is sketched rather than lived-in, but at this length the prep room does constrain and enable the central action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Mira's ethical inheritance versus survival necessity, braided with Pavel's asylum case. Pressure tightens when Pavel explains the microSD card and cultural prohibition—Mira must choose between passivity (sending him away), complicity (active search that might cross lines), or the third path (professional witness). The 4 AM discovery forces a micro-choice about framing the return; her decision to document truthfully and require Pavel's signature narrows options and forecloses the forgery route with professional and legal risk. Agency is decision with on-page cost: she stays through the night, performs the examination, and stakes her integrity on proper procedure. One clear tightening is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of honesty-versus-necessity and "fair trade" mathematics emerges through concrete action (the documented return, the night vigil, Pavel's stories) rather than assertion. The ink pot shifts meaning from "instrument of deception" to "talisman against inherited sin" to silent witness of Mira's third path. The final exchange—"Just tell her stories... that's the only mathematics that matters"—offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. Minor penalty: "impossible equation" and "spaces between right and wrong" veer toward thematic echo; the asylum-in-many-forms closing line feels slightly over-articulated. Still, the core question is answered through particulars (the capsule, the logbook, the night's labor) rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly to Mira's perceptual signature: professional details (formaldehyde, drainage, prep routine), memory of her father's arrest and letters, the metaphor of truth "like clay" and prison's "harsh chemistry" reflect her background. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Pavel's desperation and Mira's quiet refusals carry goal and subtext. Distance is consistent, with purposeful compression in backstory that anchors present stakes. Minor: "deathly vitality" and "liquefied under prison's harsh chemistry" show slight register elevation in peak beats, and the phrase "marks and operators, fools and wolves" feels slightly over-polished for mid-crisis interiority. Psychic distance shifts (close during choice beats, wider during Pavel's stories) are purposeful and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the opening paragraph (formaldehyde, tools, Marcus Chen's roles, the arrest, the ink pot's dual meaning). The 4 AM discovery beat is clean and propulsive. Deductions: "liquefied under prison's harsh chemistry," "deathly vitality," and "mathematics of a fair trade" repeated thrice show slight overwriting and template phrasing. "Asylum in a thousand different forms" in the final line is abstracting and slightly generic. A paraphrase loop appears: "mathematics of a fair trade" (paragraph 3) and "impossible mathematics" (paragraph 8) without added pressure. Apply −0.6 for patterned metaphor density and loop; the artifacts do not touch closure directly but dull two supporting beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—con artist's honest daughter working in a funeral home, helping asylum seeker by truthful means—offers a specific synthesis that resists template plotting. The microSD-in-body detail is fresh and the choice to frame the return as "standard preparation procedures" rather than heroic rescue avoids cliché. The ink pot as talisman is particular to Mira's voice. Minor: the "mathematics of a fair trade" motif and the father's prison-letter wisdom about "spaces between right and wrong" lean toward stock moral-complexity language. The asylum frame is urgent and specific, but the thematic equation (one sister's evidence = one brother's freedom) is stated rather than discovered. Still, the story commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira (con artist's honest child) drives the key turn at 4 AM when she finds the capsule and chooses to document the return truthfully rather than forge or obscure. Her choices throughout—refusing forgery, agreeing to wait, performing the examination, requiring Pavel's signature—are all shaped by the inherited tension between Marcus Chen's methods and her own integrity. The attribute is present from the opener ("raised her to value honesty above all else") and payoff occurs in the closure beat ("just wrote the truth"). Two distinct beats: refusal to forge (early) and documented return (climax). Cost is visible: professional risk, emotional labor, and foreclosure of easier paths.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The vintage ink pot appears in the opener (pressed into her hands, staining her fingers, "instrument of deception" now "talisman against inherited sin"), is mentioned at her workstation when Pavel makes his request, reappears when she considers her father's philosophy mid-vigil, and is returned to its shelf in the closing paragraph. It functions as a mnemonic anchor for Mira's internal conflict and primes her refusal to forge. However, it does not constrain a tactical choice directly—Mira's decision is shaped by her father's example and her own integrity, with the ink pot as symbolic reminder rather than active tool. Present across four beats but role is reflective rather than causal. Lyric reprise (opener → shelf at end) reweights meaning but without cost tied to the object itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Political asylum is the dominant external stake: Elena died hours before her hearing, Pavel's own case depends on her testimony, and the microSD card contains documentation of governmental corruption and seventeen testimonies. The concept shapes tactics—Pavel cannot stay alone with Elena (cultural/religious prohibition), the medical examiner's carelessness enabled the oversight, and Mira's documented return of "family property" navigates asylum bureaucracy truthfully. The asylum frame is signaled early, drives the night vigil, and is present in closure ("carrying his sister's words toward whatever tribunal would judge them"). Cost is conceptual and relational: without the documents, Pavel has no case; with them, survival hinges on tribunal judgment. Three beats: setup, vigil pressure, closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Liquefies rigid thinking" is illustrated through Marcus Chen's prison transformation (letters that "spoke differently now—about the spaces between right and wrong") and Mira's application of that lesson when she finds the third path between forgery and refusal. The attribute is signaled mid-story, shapes Mira's willingness to "wait actively" rather than apply her father's binary ("marks and operators, fools and wolves"), and enables the documented-return solution. However, the trait is more told than shown in action—Mira's flexibility is demonstrated in the final choice, but the "liquefies" metaphor itself appears once and the mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized across distinct pressure points. One beat (4 AM decision) clearly traces to the attribute; cost is implied but not itemized on-page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Breach" appears once as verb ("had finally breached the fortress of bureaucracy") describing Elena's past success in reaching her asylum hearing. It frames the tragic irony (she breached bureaucracy only to die before testimony) and primes the stakes for Pavel's own case. However, the action does not drive an on-page turn—Elena's breach is backstory; the present action is Mira's vigil and recovery of the microSD. The breach is swappable with "navigated," "overcome," or similar without structural loss. Present in setup, relevant to stakes, but not causally active in the escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Waiting actively" is signaled when Pavel explains his need ("I need you to wait with me") and specified in the method: Mira stays through the night, prepares other bodies, maintains equipment, performs the routine examination, and documents the capsule's discovery. The method shapes the middle section (the vigil, Pavel's stories, Mira's parallel work) and is reprised in reflection: "waiting actively was itself a kind of action." It differentiates Mira's approach from passivity or interference. Two beats: the decision to stay and the 4 AM examination. Cost is temporal and emotional (night's labor, professional risk). The phrase "waiting actively" is articulated twice, and the mechanics matter—without the wait and routine examination, no recovery occurs.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room anchors the story: formaldehyde smell, tools, workstation with ink pot, drainage system where the capsule is found, and "high windows" that admit dawn light at closure. The setting enables the vigil (nocturnal privacy, cultural space for death rituals, professional authority for examination) and supplies the resource (drainage check during "routine examination") that makes the recovery plausible. Spatial choreography is clear (Pavel in corner, Elena on table, Mira at workspace). The room's function as liminal space between death and testimony charges the final image. Three beats: opener, 4 AM discovery, closing paragraph. Micro-setting (the drainage point) is decisive; the prep room itself constrains and enables the central action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To find the mathematics of a fair trade" is articulated in paragraph 3 ("one dead sister's evidence equals one living brother's freedom... except nothing about death dealt in fairness"), revisited when Pavel asks "How do I repay this?" (seeking the equation), and resolved in Mira's answer: "Just tell her stories... that's the only mathematics that matters." The motivation shapes Mira's choice to help and her framing of the return as equitable rather than heroic. However, the "mathematics" metaphor is told in three nearly identical phrasings rather than dramatized through contradictory wants or tactical friction. The desire is present and guides closure, but the conflict between fairness and necessity is summarized more than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. Two beats with direct linkage; cost is conceptual.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Deathly vitality" is specified in paragraph 3 ("Elena's peaceful face, the deathly vitality that bodies sometimes held in preparation, as if mortality had simply paused") and echoed in the closing reflection on Elena's body "still radiating that strange vitality." The tone is coherent—somber yet forward-moving, with professional detachment modulating into ethical urgency during the 4 AM choice. The phrase charges the paradox of Elena's death enabling Pavel's survival. However, "deathly vitality" appears twice as a label without perceptual embodiment across other beats; the tone's mechanics (how vitality registers in Mira's perception or Pavel's prayers) are under-described. Lyric reprise with thematic weight, but static mood rather than evolving pressure. Present in setup and closure; moderate charge to final image.</comment>
