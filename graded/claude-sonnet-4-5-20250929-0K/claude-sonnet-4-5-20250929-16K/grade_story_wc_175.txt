<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sera's character is anchored through her profession ("esoteric realist") and embodied detail—handling moth wings, tying knots—with micro-choices (working in silence, packing slowly) that reveal her methodical temperament. Internal conflict is present but underdeveloped: her drive to witness overlapping endings is stated more than tested by competing impulses. The final descent forecloses nothing with visible cost; she simply moves on, limiting the earned-change effect. Embodied emotion is strong ("fingers stiff from tying countless knots"), but diagnostic phrasing like "someone needed to pause" edges toward label-speak without full dramatization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (density increase and pattern break reweight the dominant stake). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (grotto, Sera, three thousand feet, monarchs). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Sera completes her temporary structure and descends, forecloses permanence with visible renunciation ("already transiently rooted to her next forgotten place"). Cost is implied rather than sharply dramatized—her work will vanish in three weeks, and she leaves it behind—but the final image recharges "transiently rooted" and moth wings with conceptual weight. One meaningful deepening occurs (monarchs arrive, she builds, they depart), satisfying the lens. Escalation is steady but not tightened by a sharp turn, keeping the score in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The grotto is vivid and purposeful: "moss-thick walls cradling clouds," aerial garden with moths, spatial details (spiral twenty feet across) remain coherent. Setting constrains Sera's choices—she must descend by nightfall, the moss allows dowel planting—and the final image is charged by the grotto's improbable elevation and verdant enclosure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("paper made from whispers"). Micro-setting (the spiral structure itself) functions as a spatial anchor that holds the monarchs and the reader's attention, meeting the 9+ gate test. Minor: the forest canopy below is mentioned once but never revisits to pressure the descent, a small missed opportunity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to honor the last monarch migration through witness and temporary structure. Pressure is coherent and accumulates under the Accumulative lens: monarchs arrive, Sera builds, they depart. One meaningful tightening occurs when the monarchs cluster around the structure, recognizing "an acknowledgment that endings deserved witness." Cost is conceptual—impermanence is chosen, the work will dissolve—but visible on the page ("three weeks before weather claimed it"). Agency is present in Sera's methodical building and final packing, though the monarchs' departure feels more observed than forced by her action. No sharp reversal or second turn; escalation is steady rather than compressed, placing the score in the solid band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: witness, impermanence, overlooked histories. The moth wings (other extinctions) braid with the monarchs' final migration to avoid a single-note message. The ending offers a non-literal answer—Sera's temporary structure marks the day, and she moves on—reweighting "transiently rooted" and "signal no one would see" with quiet resonance. Subtext operates in image and gesture: the spiral "looked like a labyrinth, like a sundial, like a clock measuring time that no longer mattered." One brief authorial intrusion ("The world moved too fast, forgetting its own story") edges toward explicit statement but is anchored in Sera's interiority and does not flatten the final image. No false complexity or moralizing at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Sera's perception ("Each wing felt like paper made from whispers"). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices knots, moth wings, the mathematics of spacing. Diction is purposeful and elevated ("blushing stillness," "verdant hollow") but remains consistent; no unmotivated register shifts. No dialogue, so no test there. Distance control is clean, with no head-hopping. Minor: one line ("She understood what drew her to this work") is slightly expository, summarizing rather than showing through choice. Rhythmic control is strong under pressure (short clauses during building, longer reflection at sunset).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; paragraph structure modulates with scene pressure. Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, action, or character. Minor paraphrase loop: "the monarchs began lifting away, continuing their interrupted journey north" restates the opening premise without fresh pressure. Stock metaphor: "paper made from whispers" is evocative but leans generic. One filter-verb cluster ("She understood what drew her to this work") dulls immediacy. Opening and closing lines are strong ("bloomed green against impossible sky" / "already transiently rooted to her next forgotten place"). Grammar and sequence clarity are clean throughout. The artifacts touch mid-story beats, not closure, limiting deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination of aerial grotto, last monarch migration, and temporary witness-structure is specific and non-obvious. The esoteric-realist frame avoids generic environmentalism by filtering through a particular vocation. Emotional truth (the need to mark endings no one will see) reads authentic rather than sentimental. Minor: the structure's spiral shape and the "knot" motif feel lightly symbolic without full transformation; the story commits to them but does not press their implications into sharp conflict. The ending's quiet inevitability is earned, though the lack of a surprising turn or second-layer complication keeps freshness in the solid rather than exceptional band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Esoteric realist: Sera's profession frames her perception (noticing fungal networks, extinct-bird songs) and motivates her journey to the grotto. The trait constrains her method—she documents strange truths and builds temporary structures—driving her choice to create the spiral. Present in all three gates: setup (opening paragraph), development (her work method shapes the building), payoff (the final image of her packing and descending). One friction: the trait is more lens than lever; it colors but does not visibly alter tactics under pressure. Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is present but could be tighter.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Moth wings: gathered early, threaded into the spiral structure, and described with tactile specificity ("paper made from whispers"). Present in all three gates: setup (she gathers them first), development (knots them into strings, threads them between dowels), payoff (she adds final wings to the outermost ring). Beat involvement spans at least three distinct moments. Causal pressure: the wings serve as "mementos of other endings," braiding extinctions and charging the structure's meaning. Minor: they do not narrow options or impose cost; their function is symbolic accumulation rather than constraint, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interrupted cadence: introduced in the opening ("Climate's interrupted cadence—seasons arriving wrong, departing wronger") and embodied in the monarchs' final migration. Present in all three gates: setup (broken rhythm explained), development (Sera's work marks the interruption), payoff (the monarchs depart carrying "their ended future"). Shapes stakes directly: the migration's finality creates the need for witness. Causal pressure is strong; the concept drives both Sera's presence and the story's temporal frame. Closure linkage is tight: the final image reweights "interrupted" with "transiently rooted," making impermanence legible as cost. Irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Transiently rooted: appears twice, framing and closing the story ("In the grotto, she was transiently rooted" / "already transiently rooted to her next forgotten place"). Present in setup and payoff; missing middle development. The trait describes her stance—belonging wholly to the moment while planning to leave—but does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost on the page. Lyric-resonance allowance applies: the reprise reweights her impermanence as method rather than flaw, lifting the score into the mid-6s. Swappability is moderate; "itinerant" or "ephemeral" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Knot: central action verb and recurring image. Sera ties knots to connect moth wings, build the spiral structure, and mark time. Present in all three gates: setup (she plans to "knot them carefully"), development (multiple beats of tying), payoff (she adds final wings). Beat involvement is high; at least four distinct moments. Causal pressure: the knots construct the witness-structure and embody her method. Minor: the action is methodical rather than conflicted; no single knot changes options or imposes visible cost. Closure linkage is present but soft—the knots are complete, and she packs them away—limiting the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Building temporary structures as signals: method introduced early ("She had always built temporary structures as signals"), demonstrated across the middle (spiral construction), and completed at closure (the structure remains as she descends). Present in all three gates. Beat involvement spans the entire middle section. Causal pressure: the method drives her actions in the grotto and defines her response to the migration. Cost connection: she chooses impermanence ("three weeks before weather claimed it. That felt right. Permanence would be dishonest"), forecloses durability with conceptual cost. Minor: the method is enacted without friction or adaptation; no obstacles test it, keeping the score in the 7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Verdant grotto above the clouds: setting introduced in the opening line and sustained throughout. Present in all three gates: setup (vivid description, spatial anchors), development (moss allows dowel planting, space holds monarchs), payoff (sunset paints clouds amber, Sera descends). Constrains choices: she must climb to reach it, descend by nightfall, work within its enclosure. Causal pressure: the grotto's aerial isolation creates the "forgotten place" status that motivates her visit. Closure linkage: the final image charges the grotto's improbability and elevation. Specificity is high; no generic meadow could replace it. Minor: the descent is stated, not dramatized, softening the pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>During the last monarch migration: timeframe anchored early ("The last migration had begun three days ago") and sustained through the story. Present in all three gates: setup (migration's finality explained), development (monarchs arrive and rest), payoff (they lift away at sunset). Tightens decisions: Sera must witness now, not later; the monarchs' arrival and departure frame her work window. Causal pressure is strong; the migration's finality creates the dominant stake. Cost connection: the "ended future" is conceptual but legible. Minor: the story does not track hour-by-hour urgency; the noon-to-sunset window is felt but not compressed, keeping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>To honor overlooked histories: motivation stated early ("someone needed to pause, to knot together the overlooked moments") and dramatized through Sera's actions. Present in all three gates: setup (her vocation and past installations), development (she builds the spiral to mark the migration), payoff (the structure remains as witness). Friction is present but mild: the world ignores her work ("signal no one would see"), and she accepts impermanence as cost. Causal pressure: the desire drives her journey and method. Closure linkage: the final image recharges "overlooked" with "forgotten place," making the motivation legible as stance. Minor: no competing want tests her commitment; the motivation is consistent but uncontested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Blushing stillness: tone phrase introduced mid-story ("the grotto filled with their blushing stillness") and sustained through the ending. Present in development and payoff; late setup (~40% mark) triggers −0.3. Tone is coherent: quiet, elegiac, accumulative rather than urgent. Modulates with pressure: brief acceleration during the monarchs' arrival, then slower cadence at sunset. Charges the final image: "orange wings against orange sky" reprises "blushing" with visual specificity. Swappability is moderate; "suspended tranquility" could substitute, though "blushing" carries a warmer, more animate connotation. Closure linkage is strong, lifting the score despite the late introduction.</comment>
