<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ellis demonstrates clear character-particular perception through her trade and relationship to uncertainty, embodied in her choice to bring her full toolkit. The interiority around "uncertainly certain" is vivid and action-guiding. Motivation to preserve rather than solve the mystery emerges organically from her expertise. Minor deduction: Admiral Thornby remains somewhat abstract despite driving the plot; his presence lacks visceral contradiction or micro-choices that would elevate the characterization into the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization): Ellis shifts from fixing clocks to witnessing temporal mystery, with visible cost (she leaves the shrine intact, altering her relationship to her trade). The lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid—the pattern of 3:47 clocks provides accumulative texture while Ellis's choices (going to the conservatory, excavating, reading the journal, leaving everything) form a because/therefore chain. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (workshop, conservatory, cavern). One meaningful tightening occurs when she finds the compass rose and descends. Minor deduction: the coincidence of forty-seven clocks stopping at 3:47 strains credulity at the outset and risks reader buy-in, though the piece commits fully to the premise thereafter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The conservatory's neglect and the subterranean cavern constrain Ellis's choices (she must use her crowbar, follow darkness with phone light) and charge the final image (waterfall mist, stone pedestal, niches of clocks). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "ochre, copper, rust" leaves, "cold air rushed up," rainbow fractals in spray. Spatial choreography remains coherent across three locations. The compass rose and toolkit function as micro-setting elements that enable action. Minor gap: the naval chronometer and its letter feel slightly under-anchored in the opening; we learn of the estate sale in summary rather than through tactile discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the pattern of broken clocks—is signaled in the opening line and drives every beat. Escalation proceeds through tightening choices: recognizing the pattern, following the clue, excavating the fountain, descending into the cavern. The final decision to leave everything intact forecloses the path of "fixing" and reweights her trade with visible cost (she takes only memory and the compass rose). Under the Causal-Accumulative lens, pressure coheres and deepens. No antagonist is needed; the mystery itself supplies resistance. The piece delivers one meaningful turn (the shift from solver to witness) with legible cost, meeting the 600–800 word escalation standard cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the clocks, the compass rose, the waterfall cavern, and Ellis's trade all cohere around the question of whether to solve or preserve mystery. The final image—Ellis smiling at the next 3:47 clock, "uncertainly certain" and "comfortable with the beautiful recursion"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in her choice to leave the shrine intact and her realization that "some mysteries demanded preservation, not solution." The compass rose recurs with reweighted meaning (from lost artifact to reminder of better questions). No thematic echo or moralizing mars the ending. Exceptionally strong integration of the core concept "beneath the ashes" (literal and metaphorical) into the thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Ellis throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices clocks, mechanisms, and uncertainty as a tinkerer would. Distance modulates purposefully (tight during excavation, slightly wider during reflection on the admiral's journal). Diction fits her trade ("intuition as much as technique," "machinery of cause and effect stuttered"). Micro-flaw: "uncertainly certain" is philosophically apt but risks over-articulation at the end; the final paragraph's "beautiful recursion of mysteries that chose their witnesses carefully" edges toward elevated diction that slightly exceeds Ellis's established idiom under pressure. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Overall voice is consistent and effective with strong rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and informationally dense. Strong opening line anchors voice and stakes. Minimal scaffolding; no paraphrase loops. Figurative language ("compass needles toward some invisible magnetic truth," "time bent around itself like light around gravity") is vivid and legible. Deductions: slight overwriting in the conservatory entrance ("loomed gray," "jungle of neglect," "vines had reclaimed") where two of three images would suffice; "uncertainly certain" and "beautiful recursion" repeat across paragraphs without additional pressure, risking decorative recurrence rather than earned motif. The phrase "watching through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse as her boots disturbed patterns" contains a minor sequence ambiguity (she is inside the conservatory, not watching "through" from outside). Overall strong clarity and propulsion with minor density slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise (pattern of broken clocks leading to a temporal anomaly shrine) is fresh and the synthesis of tinkerer-as-witness is non-obvious. The choice to preserve rather than solve avoids the expected "fix the mystery" arc and feels earned in hindsight. Emotional specificity in Ellis's relationship to uncertainty elevates the material. Minor limitation: the admiral's temporal anomaly and his choice to hide it read as backstory assertion rather than fully dramatized stakes; the cavern shrine, while vivid, arrives as discovered exposition rather than contested ground. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids template safety, but the final synthesis leans slightly toward concept-delivery rather than lived struggle at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ellis (broken-clock tinkerer) drives every key turn: she recognizes the pattern, decides to investigate, excavates the fountain, descends into the cavern, reads the journal, and makes the final choice to leave the shrine intact and reframe her trade. Her expertise constrains her perception (she notices mechanisms and uncertainty) and enables her tactics (toolkit, crowbar, methodical cleaning). Present in setup, development, and closure with visible cost (she foregoes solving the mystery). Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability; removing her trade would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The admiral's lost compass rose appears in beat two (discovered beneath ashes), drives beat three (its needle points to the fountain base, prompting excavation), and returns at closure (placed among her tools as a reminder). It is handled on the page (cleaned, examined, carried home) and its unique property (calibrated to find temporal anomalies, not north) is causally essential. Visible cost: Ellis takes only this object and memory, forgoing the larger shrine. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability; swapping it for a generic artifact would break the maritime backstory and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Beneath the ashes" operates literally (the compass rose hidden under fire remnants in the fountain) and thematically (truth buried beneath surface coincidence, mystery beneath certainty). It shapes Ellis's search tactics (sifting through ashes) and recurs in the fountain's inscription "VERITAS SUBTER" (truth beneath), which prompts excavation and the climactic descent. The concept charges the closure: Ellis honors what lies beneath by leaving it intact. Present in setup (implied in the pattern), development (literal discovery and inscription), and closure (reweighted as preservation ethos). Indispensable to the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Uncertainly certain" appears early as Ellis's planning philosophy ("confident enough to go, doubtful enough to bring her entire tool kit") and returns at closure ("uncertainly certain now, comfortable with the beautiful recursion"). It constrains her choice to bring full preparation and enables her final stance (embracing mystery rather than resolution). However, it trends toward label-speak and is told more than dramatized; the trait is philosophically apt but does not generate visible friction or tradeoff in a specific beat. Lyric reprise elevates it into mid-band, but it lacks the embodied cost or tactical consequence needed for higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Improvise" drives the excavation beat: "Ellis began to improvise. She had no archaeology training, no excavation permits, just curiosity and a pattern that demanded completion." It enables the major turn (discovering the stairway and cavern) and reflects her philosophy of befriending uncertainty. The action contrasts with her usual methodical tinkering and creates risk (unauthorized digging, physical effort with a crowbar). Present in development and causally linked to closure. Strong integration, though the term "improvise" itself is stated once rather than recursively embodied across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse" appears mid-story as atmospheric description during Ellis's walk to the fountain. It does not shape her tactics or constrain choices; she walks through the leaves, but the specific sensory detail (swirling, neglected) is ornamental rather than causally active. No setup in the first third; no closure linkage. Functional as setting texture but easily replaceable with another conservatory image. Mid-low band: present and logically consistent but does not drive beats or reweight meaning.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall is the setting of the climactic discovery (the admiral's journal, the shrine of clocks). It supplies resources (phone light, stone pedestal, carved niches) and atmospheric pressure (cold air, water-music, mist). Ellis reads the journal "beside the waterfall" with "water-music echoed off stone," making the setting integral to the closure beat's tone and image. However, it arrives late (final third) and does not constrain earlier choices or tactics. Strong closure participation but lacks early signal and mid-story development, capping it below 7.5 under the gate model.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"When coincidence becomes pattern" frames the inciting incident (forty-seven clocks, thirty-nine at 3:47) and drives Ellis's decision to investigate. The timeframe (three months of accumulated clocks) tightens her recognition and compels action. The specific time 3:47 recurs across all key beats (clocks, cavern shrine, final smile) and charges the closure image (the next 3:47 clock signals her acceptance). The concept of pattern-recognition shapes her entire arc from solver to witness. Strong causal pressure, irreplaceability, and closure linkage. Present in setup, development, and ending with visible cost (she honors the pattern by preserving it).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To befriend uncertainty in planning" is dramatized in Ellis's choice to bring her full toolkit (paragraph three) and recurs in her final stance ("comfortable with the beautiful recursion of mysteries"). It shapes her tactics (prepared but open) and drives the closure decision (preserve rather than solve). The motivation is told in summary ("She had spent years befriending uncertainty in planning") rather than fully embodied in contradictory impulses, preventing entry into the 8-band. Strong thematic linkage and closure presence, but the friction between wanting certainty and embracing uncertainty is asserted more than shown in a specific micro-choice under pressure.</comment>
