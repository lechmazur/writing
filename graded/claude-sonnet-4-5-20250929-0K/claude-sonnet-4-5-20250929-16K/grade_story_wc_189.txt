<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mei's interiority is concrete and character-particular through her observation of the hermit crab and her tangential approach to understanding. The embodied emotion ("arms wrapped around her knees") and the internal contradiction between Mei's professional patience and interpersonal failure create authentic tension. The final choice—accepting Lin's departure as transition rather than abandonment—is earned through the scene's progression, though the epiphany arrives slightly too articulated ("I forgot that humans live in transitions too"). Minor deduction for the warmly observant trait functioning more as authorial label than constraining force in a specific beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the pause between aunt and niece accumulates meaning through pool observations, the jade cicada, and shifting emotional cadence until the final reconfiguration transforms silence into presence. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the pause reweighted from "uncomfortable" to "learning its particular texture") with felt cost—Mei's acknowledgment that she "wanted to hold you here" and Lin's pending departure. The orientation is clean (grotto, low tide, two characters established immediately) and the single scene window holds coherently. One meaningful deepening occurs when the jade cicada shifts the conversation's texture, narrowing toward mutual understanding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto, tidal pools, and hermit crab function as micro-setting that charges the final image and constrains Mei's understanding throughout. Spatial choreography is clear (Mei at water's edge, Lin on boulder, then kneeling beside). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("indifferent scatter of stars," "interior weather" of jade). The tidal cycle provides both concrete constraint (six-hour window) and thematic mirror without becoming overt symbolism. Deduction for occupational detail (chronicler work) that remains atmospheric rather than pressuring a specific choice in this conversation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mei's resistance to Lin leaving versus understanding her niece's need for transition—is signaled early and tightens through the jade cicada exchange. The hermit crab observation provides one meaningful deepening that shifts Mei's stance from wanting to "hold you here" to recognizing "we're all creatures of the threshold." Agency manifests as Mei's renunciation of control with visible cost (accepting her niece's departure). The escalation operates through accumulative pressure (silence → conversation → shared understanding) rather than confrontation, consistent with the textural lens. Lin's agency is present but secondary; her role is to catalyze Mei's shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The transition theme emerges organically through tidal pools, cicada metamorphosis, and the hermit crab's shell choice without stated thesis. The final image—"they remained in the pause, learning its particular texture"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how humans navigate change. Subtext operates strongly in the initial silence and Lin's careful approach ("Grandmother said you would understand, if I was patient"). Minor penalty for one moment of thematic echo when Mei articulates "humans live in transitions too," though it's mitigated by being earned through prior concrete observation rather than abstract philosophizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited through Mei with consistent perceptual signature (noticing "small dramas," circling understanding "tangentially"). The prose texture is distinct and character-specific ("approaching it tangentially rather than directly, the way she might circle a skittish octopus"). Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext, especially Lin's opening with the cicada rather than directly addressing the conflict. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close observation to brief omniscient framing ("the pause between them...vast and uncomfortable") that reads as intentional narrative stance rather than head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs (the hermit crab both advances plot understanding and mirrors theme). Rhythm varies appropriately, slowing for observation and quickening in dialogue. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected; sentence openings vary naturally. One minor issue: "warmly observant" appears twice as authorial commentary rather than dramatized through action, creating slight register drift. The final paragraph's repetition of "pause" and "transition" vocabulary edges toward template cadence but remains purposeful rather than artifactual. Figurative language (cicada's "interior weather," ocean's "whisper") is coherent and earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of tidal-pool observation with family conflict over departure offers a fresh angle, and the tangential approach to understanding (through hermit crab, cicada) feels specific rather than generic. The transformation test partially passes—the emotional arc requires these exact naturalist particulars to work. However, the mentor-figure-learns-to-let-go frame follows a recognizable template, and the cicada as symbol of transformation, while well-integrated, arrives through exposition ("She told me cicadas understand transformation") rather than discovery. The grotto setting and chronicler profession provide authentic texture that elevates the familiar arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mei's role as tidal-pool chronicler shapes her perceptual lens throughout (approaching understanding "tangentially," waiting "for meaning to emerge") and enables the key turn when she applies her professional patience to human relationships. Her observation of the hermit crab directly precipitates her insight about Lin's transition. The trait constrains her initial response (professional distance applied inappropriately to family) and enables the resolution. Present in opening context, drives middle realization, and charges the ending promise ("I'll chronicle your transformations").</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The jade cicada appears in two distinct beats: Lin's introduction of it and Mei's tactile examination. It carries grandmother's wisdom forward and provides the catalyst for Mei's shift in understanding ("cicadas understand transformation"). The object is handled physically ("held it carefully, feeling the smoothness of its wings") and returns with reweighted meaning in Mei's final promise to chronicle Lin's transformations. However, it arrives mid-scene rather than being seeded early, and while it enables the turn, the story could function with a different inherited object (jade butterfly, carved shell) with minor adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transition periods shape the entire story's stakes and structure. The concept operates at multiple layers: tidal pools existing "only in transition," the pause in conversation, Lin's departure, the hermit crab's shell change, and the cicada's metamorphosis. It constrains Mei's initial resistance ("wanted to hold you here, in this moment") and redefines her final understanding ("we're all creatures of the threshold"). The dominant stake—how to navigate Lin's life transition—is inseparable from this concept. The timeframe (pause between tides) embodies it structurally. Cost is visible: Mei must relinquish her desire to preserve the present.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "warmly observant" attribute appears twice as authorial label and once as demonstrated skill (watching the hermit crab's hesitation, waiting for Lin's meaning to emerge). It enables Mei's tangential approach and her professional success, but the key trade-off—that this quality makes her "useless in human conversations"—is told rather than dramatized through a specific failed attempt in this scene. The attribute shapes the resolution (she applies observational patience to Lin) but doesn't visibly constrain a prior choice with cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Foresee" appears once in Mei's reflection ("you couldn't foresee the shape of understanding") as philosophical stance rather than attempted action. No character tries to predict or anticipate a specific outcome that then succeeds or fails. The word functions thematically (anti-forecasting as method) but doesn't drive plot turns. Mei's approach is explicitly anti-predictive, making "foresee" more conceptual frame than action. The story could remove this single mention without structural impact; the tangential method would remain intact through the hermit crab observation and circling approach.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tangential approach is signaled early ("approaching it tangentially rather than directly, the way she might circle a skittish octopus") and demonstrated through Mei's method: she doesn't answer Lin directly but asks to see the cicada, then circles toward understanding through observation rather than confrontation. This method shapes the middle beat (the cicada exchange) and pays off in Mei's realization. However, it's somewhat told ("she had learned long ago") rather than purely dramatized, and the mechanics could be clearer—we see one instance of circling rather than multiple attempts that narrow toward resolution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ancient grotto provides concrete setting (water's edge, boulder, pools) and the tidal constraint creates temporal pressure (six-hour window, "tide would turn soon"). The exposed pools supply the hermit crab that catalyzes Mei's insight. Stars and darkness frame the emotional intimacy. However, the grotto's "ancient" quality remains atmospheric; the setting enables rather than constrains—the conversation could occur at any tidal location with similar effect. The pools function more as observational resource than obstacle. Setting participates in closure ("remained in the pause") but doesn't actively pressure the choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The pause in conversation provides the entire story's temporal frame and dominant pressure. The silence "stretched between them like the exposed sand, vast and uncomfortable" creates immediate tension. Time is tracked through the conversation's stages (initial silence, Lin's explanation, the cicada exchange, mutual understanding) and the approaching tide ("They could already sense it"). The timeframe constrains decisions—both must reach understanding before the tide returns and the moment passes. The transformation of pause from "absence" to "presence" at closure directly fulfills this element. Cost is felt: the finite window forces reckoning rather than avoidance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mei's desire "to discover the texture of time" is stated explicitly and dramatized through her life's work documenting threshold creatures and her focus on the hermit crab's timing. The motivation creates friction: her professional drive to chronicle and preserve conflicts with accepting Lin's departure into unknown transformation. This friction generates the central tension and her final insight ("I wanted to hold you here...as if time were a pool I could chronicle and preserve"). The cost—releasing control—is visible. Minor deduction for the motivation being more told ("I'm trying to discover") than shown through a specific failed preservation attempt in this scene.</comment>
