<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation to understand time's texture is clear and drives her into the maze, but her interior life leans heavily on abstract contemplation rather than embodied contradiction. The retrocognitive visions are described rather than dramatized as immediate sensory pressure that forces micro-choices. The final dissolution reads as passive acceptance without visible struggle or trade-off between competing impulses. No secondary characters present to test relationship dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Miriam, maze designer) and where (living bridge garden) early; the temporal fluidity is purposeful. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered visions and geometric principles until the final dissolution reweights the opening stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (dispersal into garden memory) with conceptual cost legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening as she reaches the maze center and the fragment flares; causality holds under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is vividly anchored with root-woven spans, hedges, and pools that reflect memory rather than sky. The hyperbolic maze's impossible curves constrain Miriam's journey and charge the final dissolution. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her designer's perspective. The halo fragment embedded in roots and the fading photographs function as micro-setting objects that participate in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering time's texture—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Miriam enters the maze center with the fragment, and the visions intensify to a crescendo. The final dissolution forecloses the path of continued physical existence with conceptual cost visible in the closing image. Agency reads as attention and endurance under accumulative pressure rather than a decisive reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of retrocognition, hyperbolic geometry, and the garden's memory. The final image—time as infinite recursive mirrors—reweights the opening question without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the photographs' disintegration and the fragment's warmth. The maze itself functions as both literal path and thematic lens. No overt thematic echo in the final paragraph; the dissolution image carries resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance. Voice is distinct with elevated diction ("quaking reverie," "unbecoming") that fits a maze designer steeped in abstract mathematics. Perceptual signature is consistent: she sees geometry and memory everywhere. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she felt") appear frequently but feel voice-motivated given the reflective mode. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and vocabulary is controlled, but several phrases edge toward overwriting: "like watercolor on wet paper," "like fading photographs left too long in sunlight," "like standing in a doorway between two mirrors" stack similes densely in a reflective mode without clear pattern payoff. Sentence openings vary. Minor paraphrase loop: "not dying but dispersing, becoming part of the garden's memory" restates the dissolution concept already vivid in prior lines. Clarity remains high; no major scaffold or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of retrocognition, hyperbolic geometry, and a living garden maze feels purposeful and specific. The halo fragment and fading photographs add texture without feeling like checklist items. However, the "dissolving into light/memory" ending is a familiar trope in speculative literary fiction. The transformation feels earned in hindsight, but the final image's metaphorical architecture (infinite mirrors, recursive patterns) leans toward abstraction that could apply to many dissolution narratives.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miriam's role as maze designer is established early and drives her understanding of hyperbolic geometry, which shapes her final approach. Her design work frames the entire narrative and the maze itself becomes the instrument of closure. She makes the choice to carry the fragment into the maze center. Present across setup, middle choices, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears in beat two (discovery in roots), intensifies visions in beat three (carried into maze), and transforms in the closure beat (flares and dissolves). Its curved, luminous form and the repeated shattering vision constrain her perception and enable the final dissolution. Irreplaceable: no generic artifact could substitute its specific properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fading photographs are introduced early, pulse with heat in the maze, and disintegrate in her pocket during the climax. They participate in the closure sequence by "unbecoming" as the fragment flares. However, their mechanics (losing dimensionality, retreating into flatness) are described but never visibly alter Miriam's tactics. Present in setup and payoff; development use is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Retrocognition is named and described in the opening third, intensifies when she lifts the fragment, and reaches crescendo at the maze center. It shapes her perception throughout but does not visibly constrain a specific choice with on-page cost—she moves forward despite it rather than because of it. Label-heavy in places ("being retrocognitively trapped"); the visions enrich texture but feel more like setting than a trait that forces trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Disintegration structures the entire arc: photographs disintegrate, the fragment dissolves, Miriam herself disperses. The action is foreshadowed early (photos losing dimensionality) and executed at closure with visible cost (Miriam's dispersal into memory). The final turn—"not dying but dispersing"—depends on this exact verb. Irreplaceable and causally central to the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is introduced in beat two as Miriam's devotion, explicitly tied to her maze design ("pathways that seemed to double back but spiraled through dimensions"), and named again at the climax as describing reality's structure. It constrains her design choices and provides the conceptual lens for the final revelation. Mechanics are signaled but remain abstract; the geometry enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The living bridge garden frames the entire story, its root-woven spans and memory-reflecting pools anchor orientation, and its maze provides the spatial crucible for closure. The garden's ancient roots yield the fragment; the maze center is where geometry folds most intensely. Final image explicitly restructures the garden according to Miriam's mapped principles. Essential across setup, middle choices, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Miriam's desire to discover time's texture is named explicitly in the opening third ("her deepest motivation") and dramatized through her maze design and journey into its center. Conflict between reverence and self-preservation is present but understated; she accepts dispersal without visible struggle. The motivation drives all major beats and the closure image answers it directly. Cost is conceptual (loss of selfhood) rather than a friction between competing wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" is established early as the condition haunting her and reaches crescendo at the maze center where past and present vibrate together. Tone remains dreamlike and elevated throughout, modulating slightly as pressure builds. The final dissolution image ("doorway between two mirrors") crystallizes the tone. Coherent and purposeful, though the single register risks static mood; the intensification at closure lifts it.</comment>
