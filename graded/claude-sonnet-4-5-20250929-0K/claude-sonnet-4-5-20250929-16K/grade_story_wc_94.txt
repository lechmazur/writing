<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The poet's interiority is vivid and character-particular ("furiously tranquil," obsessive focus on scars as language), and her motivation deepens through the envelope reveal. However, the change from documenting her own poetic scars to carrying state-violence evidence feels more like plot mechanics than an earned contradiction forcing a visible cost. The final descent with photographs reads as resolve rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt price on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (poet, observatory, storm-night vigil) arrive cleanly. The piece accumulates density through darkroom labor, the sealed envelope, and storm imagery, building to a Charged Poise closure where she decides to descend with dangerous negatives—options crystallize and pressure is undeniable. The cost (risk of state retaliation) is implied rather than felt on the page, and the final paragraph shifts into summary assertion ("the cartography of scars was also a map toward healing") rather than image, slightly softening closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory dome, darkroom, storm-lit setting, and the darkroom timer all constrain and charge the work. The timer's mechanical tick and seven-minute cycles structure her labor, and lightning strobing through the door illuminates her face in the climactic beat. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (red-lit space, thunder rolling, chemical smell implied). The micro-setting (darkroom) functions as crucible and the storm as both atmosphere and thematic amplifier.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding and preserving the cartography of scars against state censorship. The envelope's arrival tightens pressure by revealing mass graves and torture evidence, raising the ante. However, the tightening is delivered rather than earned by the poet's own tactical escalation, and the final choice (develop and descend) feels predetermined rather than a trade-off that narrows live options. No visible price is paid on the page; the ending asserts future risk without present cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—truth as rarefied essence that passes through censorship, scars as language and atlas—emerges from darkroom work and photograph details. The final paragraph, however, shifts into overt thematic declaration ("the cartography of scars was also a map toward healing") and prompt-echo language ("furiously tranquil," "rarefy," "vigil in pause") rather than letting the images resonate. The ending offers a thesis statement instead of a non-literal answer, reducing subtext to assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and closely aligned with the poet's perceptual signature (scars as braille, storm as performance). Diction is elevated and consistent ("rarefy," "cartography," "cathedral of storm"), matching the poet's intellectual stance. Psychic distance tightens effectively during the envelope reveal and darkroom strobing. The final paragraph's summary tone ("understanding at last") slightly loosens the close-third voice by claiming epiphany rather than showing it through perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often evocative ("braille of survival," "ghosts finding form"), but stacks to near-saturation in key beats without always clarifying pressure. Template cadence appears in the opener ("climbed," "carried," "became") and paraphrase loops emerge in reflection blocks ("furiously tranquil, a state she had cultivated" then "Fury at the erasure, tranquility in her method"). The final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image, dulling momentum at closure. Information density is high but clarity occasionally blurs under metaphor weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The core synthesis—censored artist preserving forbidden evidence via darkroom vigil—offers a fresh frame, and the storm-above-clouds observatory setting is visually distinctive. However, the artist-vs-authoritarian-state and truth-as-light metaphors are familiar, and the piece does not transform them through non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail. The envelope-from-dying-documentarian device is a stock handoff trope. Emotional specificity (the poet's contradictory calm fury) partially elevates, but the ending's declarative summary retreats from bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The censored poet is present throughout and her choice to open the envelope and develop the dangerous negatives drives the final third. However, observation dominates the first half (describing photos, reflecting on censorship), and the decision to descend with evidence feels like an inevitable next step rather than a turn that forecloses a safer path with visible cost. Early signal, two-beat involvement (opening envelope, developing), closure participation present, but causal pressure and felt tradeoff are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The darkroom timer appears in three beats: initial mention in the satchel, set for seven minutes mid-story, rings to signal print completion. Its mechanical tick-tick-tick is noted as "a heartbeat" but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—she waits passively. The timer's function is procedural rather than pressurizing; it could be replaced with any time-tracking device. Present across beats but swappable, no closure linkage or visible cost tied to its mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The phrase "vigil in pause" appears once in paragraph two as a label for her waiting; the story depicts a vigil (darkroom work, envelope decision) but "in pause" remains abstract theme claim rather than a stake-shaping constraint. The vigil itself is active (developing prints, opening envelope), undercutting the "pause" component. The concept is echoed thematically in the final line ("vigil continued") but does not shape on-page options or tactics. Ornamental, late reprise, no middle beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" is named twice: as a cultivated state in paragraph five and again in the final darkroom strobing image. It is described (fury at erasure, tranquility in method) but never constrains or enables a specific action with cost—she does not choose calm over rage in a moment of pressure. The attribute remains label-only interiority without visible behavioral tradeoff. Early signal, closure reprise present, but no middle choice altered by this trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Rarefy" appears as her method: distilling work to "such purity that even redacted, it would shine through." The action frames her approach and is tied to the choice to develop the documentarian's negatives (rarefying truth to pass through censorship bars). It shapes two beats (her ongoing photo work, the new negatives decision) and charges the ending claim. However, the mechanics of rarefaction remain abstract metaphor; any synonym for "purify" or "concentrate" could substitute with minor edits. Strong thematic presence, moderate causal irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The sealed envelope in the bus timetable is introduced early (paragraph one), carried through as mystery, and opened mid-story to deliver the mass-grave negatives that tighten stakes. Its specific mechanics (wedged between September and October, sealed for two years, given by dying documentarian) frame suspense and the poet's readiness. The envelope enables the final escalation and participates in closure (she will descend with its contents). Setup, development choice, closure participation all present; causal pressure moderate; specific enough to resist easy swap.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds provides isolation, safety from state surveillance, and the storm's performative light that illuminates her face in intervals. The dome's copper surface stages shadows, the darkroom is a converted storage room, and being "above the cloudbank" allows the storm to become "something else entirely," charging the vigil with symbolic and practical insulation. The setting shapes her choice to work in secret and charges the final image (cathedral of storm and light). Early signal, middle constraint (safe workspace), closure participation, meaningful causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"When masks slip" is defined as the storm's apex when lightning bleaches faces white and people forget to perform. It appears as thematic explanation in paragraph four but does not constrain the poet's on-page choices or create a deadline. The storm progresses from horizon lightning to strobing through the darkroom door, but no time pressure tightens her decision to open the envelope or develop prints. The timeframe is atmosphere rather than tactical constraint. Thematic echo, no middle or closure beat involvement in choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation to "understand the cartography of scars so completely that no authority could erase it" is named early (paragraph two) and drives her darkroom work and the decision to develop forbidden negatives. The desire is dramatized through photograph descriptions and her reaction to the envelope contents ("storm-kissed wonder at the trust placed in her"). However, the motivation is not conflicted—she never hesitates or weighs a safer choice—so tension between want and cost is asserted ("they will kill to keep hidden") rather than felt. Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage, but friction is low.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Storm-kissed wonder" appears once late (paragraph nine) to describe her reaction to the negatives; the broader tone blends storm imagery, vigilant calm, and aesthetic wonder throughout. The tone modulates subtly from reflective opening to tense envelope-opening to final declarative resolve, and the storm's visual intensity charges the darkroom strobing beat. However, "wonder" competes with "fury" and "tranquility" as dominant affect, creating tonal diffusion rather than a single coherent modulation. The final paragraph's summary assertion flattens tone rather than sustaining storm-charged intensity.</comment>
