<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus displays consistent motivation through three years of failure, and his determination to understand passenger patterns drives choices. However, interiority remains somewhat generic—"resiliently positive" functions more as label than embodied contradiction. The hourglass observation ritual and radio work show character-specific behavior, but peak moments lack the messy ambivalence or internal friction that would elevate to high bands. Captain Reeves and the passengers exist primarily as objects of Marcus's mission rather than sources of interpersonal pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—radio frequencies, timeline fragments, and the grotto build pressure through pattern and density rather than strict causality. Closure lands on-page: passengers materialize, hourglass refills, ferry completes its route. The cost is conceptual (timelines collapse) and felt (three years of Marcus's devotion), but the final image doesn't fully reweight what came before—it delivers resolution rather than repricing. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly in paragraph one (Marcus, Meridian Ferry, three years post-vanishing).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The grotto's bioluminescent constellations and the radio as navigation tool constrain Marcus's approach and charge the middle section. Sensory details—salt spray, limestone glow, water reflecting stars at noon—are vivid and purposeful. However, spatial choreography inside the grotto remains vague; we don't see Marcus manipulate controls or move through space in a way that shapes the final beat. The hourglass as micro-setting object does recur with shifting meaning (empty → filling), meeting the 9+ threshold partially, but environment doesn't constrain the climactic choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue the forty-seven passengers) is signaled early and sustained. The grotto discovery at midnight and the broadcasting sequence provide one meaningful tightening: Marcus weaves names in boarding-order pattern, passengers materialize. However, escalation feels more like puzzle-solution than pressure under fire—Marcus's tactic succeeds on first try without visible cost or tactical adjustment. The three-year timeframe implies prior failures, but we don't witness a failed attempt or see a live trade-off that forecloses an option on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the hourglass metaphor (time unmade/remade), "nothing truly disappears, it only disperses," and Marcus's ritual persistence. The final image—turning the full hourglass, knowing patterns can be rewoven—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the translucent captain and the passengers' loop. However, the closing paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("waiting for someone stubborn enough to call it home"), slightly diluting the resonance that the hourglass image alone would provide.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with close access to Marcus's perception. Perceptual signature—salt spray, radio crackle, memorizing faces—is character-specific. Diction stays consistent ("resiliently positive," "permanently transient") and voice modulates appropriately under pressure (the grotto sequence tightens). Dialogue is minimal and functional. However, some phrasing leans toward elevated register not fully earned by a deckhand's idiom: "cacophony that would have driven most people mad," "spectral grotto." Filter verbs ("noticed," "realized") appear but don't dull immediacy excessively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are generally strong; sentences advance situation and atmosphere. However, several paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "The ferry shuddered. Mrs. Chen materialized... Mr. Okafor appeared... then Sarah Michaels... then the businessman" uses identical syntactic stems across four beats. Stock metaphors recur: "translucent around the edges, her outline shimmering like heat waves." The phrase "resiliently positive" appears twice identically. Figurative density in the grotto passage (limestone constellations, bioluminescence, parallel timelines) risks overwriting but remains mostly legible. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops per patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—deckhand uses radio to reassemble scattered timeline passengers via ritual pattern—offers a fresh angle on "lost commuters" material. The hourglass-as-dispersed-passengers conceit and the grotto navigation are specific to this story. However, the emotional arc (lone rescuer persists through failure to ultimate success) follows a familiar template without transformation. The turn feels more like puzzle-click than earned surprise; Marcus's method works immediately without prior mis-steps shown on the page. Risk-taking in structure and imagery elevates above mid-band but doesn't reach the high bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus (ardent ferry deckhand) is present throughout, makes the key choice to broadcast names in pattern, and that decision drives the climactic materialization. His daily ritual (turning the hourglass, checking tickets, learning stories) sets up the pattern knowledge that enables the ending. Setup, development (listening to radio patterns), and payoff (broadcasting sequence) all present. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; the character is indispensable to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The empty hourglass appears in beat one (Marcus turns it out of habit), reappears in the grotto beside him ("a reminder that time could be unmade"), and refills grain by grain as passengers materialize—a charged reprise that reweights the opening image. Three distinct beats with escalating meaning. The object's emptiness functions as both constraint (time has fractured) and thematic anchor. Strong causal and closure linkage; the final turn of the full hourglass closes the loop. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Vanishing commuter ferry shapes the premise and stakes throughout: the Meridian exists "between vessel and phantom," forty-seven souls trapped in a loop. The concept constrains Marcus's goal and informs tactics (following currents only he senses, navigating the grotto). However, the "vanishing" aspect functions more as backstory trigger than live on-page pressure—passengers are already gone when the story opens, and their return is the climax rather than an ongoing process that alters tactics mid-scene. Setup and payoff present; middle development less distinct.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Resiliently positive" is stated twice ("resiliently positive despite three years of failure," "resiliently positive that any pattern... could be rewoven") but functions more as label than embodied trait with visible cost. Marcus's cheer and patience are shown (checking tickets "with unfailing cheer," listening patiently), yet we don't see a moment where optimism forecloses a darker, potentially easier option—no on-page trade-off where positivity costs him tactically or emotionally. Present and thematically consistent, but swappable with "determined" or "persistent" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Radio is introduced early (paragraph two: "wiped salt spray from the radio"), used throughout the grotto sequence to hear timeline patterns, and drives the climactic turn: Marcus broadcasts on multiple frequencies simultaneously, speaking passengers' names in sequence. The action is irreplaceable—remove radio and the resolution mechanism vanishes. Three beats (monitoring, pattern recognition, broadcasting) with strong causal and closure linkage. High specificity; the method is radio-dependent.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interconnected patterns appear as method: Marcus learns passengers' stories, boarding order, seat numbers, coffee orders; he broadcasts names "in sequence... following the pattern of their boarding." The grotto's limestone constellations pulse in response, and passengers converge "pulled from parallel streams by the interconnected patterns of their shared routine." The method is signaled mid-story, shapes the climactic tactic, and is indispensable to resolution. However, it arrives somewhat late (grotto at midnight, method explained in final third), and the mechanics feel slightly told rather than demonstrated through failed prior attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Spectral grotto appears at the midpoint (midnight), provides the radio amplification Marcus needs (signals from all timelines simultaneously), and hosts the climactic broadcasting sequence. The bioluminescent constellations create a visual map and pulse in response to Marcus's transmission—micro-setting that enables the ending. However, the grotto functions more as stage than constraint; Marcus navigates it easily, and it doesn't force a tactical trade-off. Setup missing (introduced at 50% mark), but development and payoff present. Lyric reprise (starlight) ties to the water reflecting stars in paragraph two.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"When clocks run sideways" is signaled early (paragraph one: clocks running sideways, hands tracing vertical paths) and establishes the fractured-time premise. "Time had lost its conventional meaning" and the grotto appears "at midnight, though time had lost its conventional meaning" remind us the timeframe is live. However, the sideways-clock detail doesn't tighten decisions on the page—Marcus operates without visible time pressure or a live countdown that forces tactical choices. The concept frames the world but doesn't constrain the climactic beat; somewhat ornamental after setup.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation (merge parallel timelines / bring passengers home) is stated early ("trapped in a loop Marcus was determined to close") and drives all on-page choices: memorizing faces, listening to radio patterns, broadcasting names in sequence. The goal shapes the grotto sequence and the climactic action. However, the motivation is more explained than dramatized through conflicted choices—we don't see Marcus tempted to give up or weigh an easier path against the harder reunion. Present across all three gates but with limited friction or visible cost tied to the desire itself.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Permanent transient" is stated explicitly ("permanently docked yet perpetually in transit," "permanently transient on waters") and woven throughout: the ferry exists between states, Marcus turns the hourglass daily, passengers loop. Tone modulates appropriately—elegiac in the opening, tense in the grotto, quietly triumphant at closure. The final image (turning the full hourglass, "same route, same schedule") charges the tone with bittersweet resonance: success doesn't end Marcus's transience. Strong coherence and payoff; the tone is indispensable to the story's effect.</comment>
