<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus demonstrates consistent interiority around inherited shame and the choice to speak despite his father's legacy. His embodied relationship to silence (forehead pressed to lattice, breathing the quiet) shows concrete emotional processing. However, the inciting event—watching the prisoners depart—remains oddly passive; his non-intervention feels explained rather than dramatized as a lived contradiction. The final shift toward trusting someone might listen reads as self-narrated insight rather than a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established early: lighthouse prison, Marcus imprisoned for inherited debt, three bodies will surface. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—copper light pooling, dust hovering, layers of reflection building toward "hush wasn't something you found, but something you became." However, no decisive action or renunciation occurs on the page; Marcus neither speaks nor refuses to speak in the present frame. The closure relies on interior realization ("trusted that when he spoke, someone might listen") without on-page cost or a crystallized stance that forecloses a path. The tideline creates situational pressure, but the ending hovers in anticipation rather than delivering a change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison is vividly particular: copper-stained walls, confessional lattice casting amber light, spiral staircase scuffs worn smooth. Sensory detail is purposeful—copper light blesses each word, rocks emerge like dark teeth—and the setting creates genuine constraint (the reef, the tides, the warden's rounds). The lattice window functions as micro-setting that frames Marcus's daily ritual and charges the final image. Strong execution with clear pressure from environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escaping his father's shadow and finding his own voice—is signaled early and sustained. The approaching low tide creates situational pressure: bodies will surface, questions will come. However, Marcus makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses an option. His resolve to speak "anyway" is declared but not tested; the story ends before the warden arrives. One tightening (tide dropping, rocks emerging) but no visible price paid or path closed in the present frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between silence (mere absence) and hush (sacred quiet when truth settles). The confessional lattice and copper light create a non-literal pattern that reweights inherited shame versus chosen truth. However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit moralizing ("this was how you threaded a labyrinth") and the ending offers a stated rather than dramatized answer. The copper light motif is richly developed but the thematic question—can Marcus separate from his father's echo—resolves through assertion rather than scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Marcus notices dust in amber columns, tracks patterns through scuffs, perceives hush as something to become. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("chasing hush," "the weight of silence believed," "copper light blessed each word with repose"). The prose modulates well under pressure—calm, almost liturgical pacing fits the contemplative stakes. Minor filter-verb clusters in reflective beats ("watching," "understanding") but they serve the meditative texture rather than dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery: "The lighthouse prison clung to its reef like a barnacle to dying stone," "dust hover in those amber columns like suspended secrets." Information density is high with minimal scaffolding. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the concept of "hush" is explained three times in slightly different language; "copper light" appears in five separate paragraphs doing similar descriptive work. Template cadence in the backstory section ("His father had shattered hush... had weaponized alarm... had been seven"). These reduce propulsion in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse-as-confessional frame and the distinction between silence and hush offer fresh angles on the cry-wolf legacy. The inversion—son imprisoned for father's lies, voice worthless before he speaks—is conceptually strong. However, the core situation (prisoner awaiting interrogation, reflecting on inherited shame) follows a familiar template. The copper-light-through-lattice motif is beautifully executed but the emotional arc of "I will finally be heard" resolves predictably. Specific execution elevates familiar material without fully transforming it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marcus is the son referenced throughout; his father's legacy drives the central conflict and his present imprisonment. He makes no key choice on the page—watching prisoners depart is recalled, not enacted; his decision to speak is anticipated but not executed. Present in setup and development, but passive at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lattice appears in four distinct beats: framing the window (paragraph 3), filtering morning light (paragraphs 4 and throughout), serving as his confessional audience (paragraph 11), and in the final image where he presses his forehead against it. It constrains his perception (wooden diamonds frame the view), enables his ritual (tells his story through it), and charges the closure. Strong causal work and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Chasing hush" is introduced early, defined against silence, and shapes his daily practice of speaking truth to the copper light. It informs his tactics (confession through the lattice) and the ending realization ("hush wasn't something you found, but something you became"). However, it operates primarily as theme rather than constraining a specific choice; the concept is explained more than dramatized. Present across beats with closure linkage but mid-range causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Sustains impossibilities" is declared in paragraph 8 and illustrated with examples (keeps men alive who deserve drowning, makes monsters of mercy). It frames the lighthouse's paradoxical function but does not enable or constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The trait colors setting atmosphere without altering Marcus's tactics. Setup and thematic echo only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Hover" appears three times: dust hovering in amber columns (paragraph 4), Marcus "hovering in the space between inherited lies and chosen truth" (final section), and the father's shadow hovering over every syllable (paragraph 12). The verb creates a consistent image of suspension and in-betweenness that aligns with the pre-decision frame. However, it does not drive a turn; Marcus remains in suspension throughout. Lyric resonance across beats but limited causal role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrow door with scuffed edges appears once in paragraph 9: Marcus discovered he could press his eye to the scuffs and watch the warden's rounds. This is told in summary; the method is not used on the page or signaled earlier. It does not shape his present tactics or the ending. Late, summary-only, replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison on the jagged reef creates immediate pressure: isolation, the tides revealing bodies, the warden's predictable rounds. The reef dictates the prisoners' failed escape and the approaching discovery. The vertical structure (spiral staircase, keeper's quarters) and the single window with lattice constrain Marcus's movements and frame his ritual. Setting is causally active in setup, middle choices (tracking warden through scuffs), and the tidal clock that drives closure urgency.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Before they find the bodies" frames the entire narrative and creates urgency: spring tide dropping, rocks emerging "tomorrow or the day after," warden will come with questions. Time tightens Marcus's window for his chosen confession and charges his present repose with imminent consequence. However, the clock does not alter his on-page tactics; he continues his ritual without adjustment. Strong setup and closure linkage but passive development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To thread a labyrinth with your own story" is introduced in paragraph 11, explained as placing one truth after another to build a path away from inherited shame. It drives his daily confessions through the lattice and his resolve to speak when questioned. The motivation is embodied in his ritual and friction exists (his words may not matter, father's shadow persists). However, the labyrinth metaphor is stated more than dramatized; no on-page moment tests this desire against a competing want. Strong thematic presence with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Copperlight repose" is established early through the amber light pooling across the floor and sustained throughout: light blesses words, shifts with the tide, frames the final moment of peace. Tone is consistently meditative and liturgical, modulating slightly as the tide drops and urgency nears but never breaking into alarm. The copper hue charges the final image where Marcus allows himself this moment "before they found the bodies." Coherent across beats and purposefully intensifies quiet before consequence.</comment>
