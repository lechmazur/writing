<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marina's internal journey from vivid muralism to quiet work is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses. Her trait of being "quietly driven" remains label-only; we never see her work "through problems with her hands" in a way that creates genuine friction. The grandmother's postcards and Marina's motivation arrive as backstory conveniences rather than lived pressure. The final epiphany—"night-bloomers didn't reject light but required the specific, silvered quality"—reads as thesis statement rather than earned wisdom forged through struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (Accumulative texture building toward a Conceptual Repricing) but the closure arrives as explanation rather than image. Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph. The discovery of the etched glass functions as a reveal that Marina simply hadn't noticed before rather than a choice that forecloses options. The final painted pavilion offers a visual restatement of the grandmother's question but the cost—what Marina gave up or risked to achieve this understanding—remains invisible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The amber pavilion is rendered with strong sensory specificity ("honeyed pools," "frost-jeweled refuge") and tracks seasonally across the residency. The cathedral's rose window and its hidden etchings constrain Marina's discovery in a purposeful way. Spatial choreography between pavilion and cathedral is clean. The setting charges the final image when Marina paints on the pavilion's glass panels, creating a micro-setting that serves the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early but remains cerebral throughout. Marina's months of failed attempts are summarized rather than dramatized; we never witness her struggle through a single unsuccessful mural in real time. The discovery of the etched glass tightens her understanding but arrives as observation rather than choice under pressure. No visible cost or trade-off accompanies the breakthrough; Marina simply paints through one night and succeeds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of hidden beauty and shadow as necessary witness emerges organically from the night-blooming flower motif. The grandmother's recurring question creates a pattern that the ending addresses. However, the final paragraph spells out the wisdom explicitly: "some beauty needs shadow to be fully seen, some questions are answered not with words but with light"—this is meta-commentary replacing scene pressure. The conceptual repricing is present but lacks the oblique delivery that would make it resonate beyond assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single POV with stable third-person limited distance. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled vocabulary ("umbral tenderness," "reckon the complexity"). Perceptual signature remains consistent—Marina notices light quality and visual transformation throughout. Filter verbs ("she could see," "understanding flooding through her") appear at key moments but don't dull immediacy significantly. The POV elision around Marina's actual painting process in the final scene withholds the tactile experience that earlier passages promise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully with longer contemplative sentences and shorter observational beats. Some template cadence appears: "She was a vivid mural artist" / "She was quietly driven" / "She left the pavilion" / "She returned to the amber pavilion"—four sentences opening with "She [verb]" create mild monotony. The phrase "dawning hush of twilight" contains a logical contradiction (dawning=morning, twilight=evening). Information density is generally high with dual-function lines, though the final paragraph overexplains rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The mural-artist-seeking-inspiration frame is a familiar template. The hidden-image-in-stained-glass discovery offers a moderately fresh inflection on the premise. The synthesis of painting on glass panels to create time-dependent visibility shows ingenuity, but the emotional arc—artist struggling with creative block discovers hidden layer of meaning and completes work—follows a well-worn path. The grandmother's postcards with identical recurring question trends toward symbolic convenience rather than lived particularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marina's role as mural artist frames the problem (translating night-bloomers to cathedral wall) and the solution (painting on glass). Her artistic medium directly enables the closure method. However, her specific choice to shift from wall to glass panel arrives suddenly rather than through constrained attempts. Present in setup and payoff but mid-development involvement is thin; her artist identity shapes logistics more than it creates pressure or trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The postcards appear in setup, carry the grandmother's recurring question throughout, and return in the final paragraph as "a border of inherited wisdom." However, they function primarily as backstory catalyst rather than objects Marina handles or uses across beats. She spreads them on her worktable early, but they remain static until the ending cameo. The postcards charge the thematic question but don't constrain Marina's tactics or enable specific choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Dawning hush of twilight" appears once as a descriptor for the moment Marina notices the rose window's light. The phrase itself contains a logical tension (dawn vs. twilight) that may be intentional but reads as muddle. As a concept, the liminal quality of twilight matters to the discovery beat, but "dawning hush" doesn't recur or shape multiple tactics. It remains atmosphere rather than a constraint that alters options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is labeled in exposition ("Marina was quietly driven, the kind of person who worked through problems with her hands") but never demonstrated through contradictory on-page action. We're told she's this way rather than shown her quiet persistence creating friction or enabling a choice. The trait doesn't constrain a decision or carry visible cost; it's a summary of character rather than an active force in the narrative.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reckon" appears at the pivotal discovery: "Up close, she could reckon the complexity: beneath the colored glass lay delicate engravings." The word carries appropriate specificity for Marina's visual assessment and signals the turn where she grasps the hidden layers. It's present in one key beat and contributes to the conceptual shift, but it's not irreplaceable—"discern," "gauge," or "grasp" would serve similarly. Solid integration in the middle turn but swappable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cathedral window's hidden etchings are set up early (the pavilion is "in the cathedral gardens"), discovered at the structural midpoint when Marina climbs to the interior platform, and directly inform the closure method (painting on glass with layered translucency). The mechanics matter: "beneath the colored glass lay delicate engravings, invisible except when light passed through at specific angles." This discovery enables Marina's final solution and the etched-glass method shapes her attempt. Present across all three gates with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The amber pavilion is introduced in the opening line, functions as Marina's workspace throughout, and becomes the canvas for her final mural. Its glass panels are the medium that enables the light-dependent solution. The seasonal transformation (frost-jeweled to amber autumn glow) tracks the timeframe. The pavilion pressures Marina's choice by offering a medium she hadn't considered—the glass itself rather than the cathedral wall. Present in setup, middle (workspace), and payoff (painting surface); drives the final turn.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the melting of winter's last snow" to October is established and the seasonal cycle (winter → spring → summer → autumn) is mentioned. However, the time passage functions as background summary rather than a tightening constraint. Marina's three-month residency and the months of failed attempts are told rather than tracked through beats that escalate with a deadline. Time exists in the story but doesn't create urgency or alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand why flowers bloom at night" is established through the grandmother's postcards and stated explicitly: "Her motivation to understand why flowers bloom at night had consumed her since inheriting the postcards." It drives Marina's mural attempts and the closure delivers an answer. However, the desire remains cerebral and is narrated rather than dramatized through on-page friction. We don't see Marina wrestle with competing explanations or pay a price for her pursuit—she simply observes until understanding arrives.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Umbral tenderness" appears near the end as Marina's realization: night-bloomers choose "umbral tenderness over daylight's harsh scrutiny." The phrase captures the piece's gentle, contemplative register and charges the final understanding. The tone itself—soft, lyric, meditative—remains coherent through discovery beats and modulates appropriately during the climb and painting sequence. However, "umbral tenderness" as a specific phrase arrives late and functions more as thematic summary than a recurring tonal texture woven throughout.</comment>
