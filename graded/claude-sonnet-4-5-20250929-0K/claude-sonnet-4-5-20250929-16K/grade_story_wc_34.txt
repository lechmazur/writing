<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The balladeer's motivation is concrete—songs slip from memory, she finally finds a listener—and the decision to encode messages is earned by her prior discovery and the ghost's need. Internal contradiction operates cleanly: she's seldom-heard yet skilled, and the marriage of art and algorithm reflects her dual nature. However, the protagonist's interiority leans toward summary ("she understood, then") rather than embodied contradiction in the peak encoding moment, and emotional progression is smooth without credible irrationality under pressure. The final choice feels inevitable but lacks a visible competing impulse that would charge the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through discovery, connection, and the encoding act, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the balladeer and ghost "articulate what had been too long silent" with the storm carrying messages down. Orientation is anchored early (misty courtyard, Sky Monastery, three weeks ago). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the ghost wants to encode unspoken prayers, narrowing her goal to the graffiti circuit. Cost is felt—she commits her art to a new medium and bonds irreversibly with the ghost—though the exact sacrifice (what path is foreclosed) remains oblique. The closure reconfigures her isolation into communion, satisfying RR under the Accumulative lens, but the final image ("The storm sang with them") leans declarative rather than charging prior particulars with new weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The misty courtyard, prayer-wheels, and bolt plates constrain the protagonist's encoding method and supply the circuit she completes. Sensory detail is purposeful: lightning flashes reveal the ghost, thunder rattles bolt plates, pigments from the workshop enable the graffiti. The floating monastery's mechanics are integrated into action (repairing prayer-wheels, pressing bolt plates) without museum-tour excess. Spatial choreography is clear across the courtyard. The environment directly enables the final act—completing the circuit—so it meets the 9+ gate for Q3. Minor slip: the "ancient mechanisms" floating the monastery are mentioned but never constrain a choice, reading as atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: the balladeer seeks an audience that will remember her art, and the ghost seeks to voice forgotten prayers. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes the bolt plates can encode messages, altering her tactic from song to graffiti. The ghost's encouragement and the storm's pressure cohere, and the final circuit-completion is driven by her agency. Cost is present but soft—she abandons pure song for hybrid art—without a visible trade-off or foreclosed path that charges the image. No overt antagonist, which fits the Accumulative lens, but escalation reads as additive (gathering pigments, painting, completing circuit) rather than a narrowing that forces a hard choice. The "frenzied wonder" moment hints at stakes but doesn't dramatize a competing pull.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—giving voice to the voiceless, communion through hybrid art—emerges organically from the balladeer's isolation, the ghost's forgotten consciousness, and the encoded prayers. The final image of graffiti catching storm light and messages propagating answers the thematic question without overt statement. Subtext operates in the ghost's "geometric whispers" and the balladeer's realization that her art "would work where her ballads had failed." The flower press bolt plates recur with reweighted meaning (structural → encoding → circuit). Minor weakness: "articulate what had been too long silent" and "giving voice to the voiceless" approach direct thematic declaration in the penultimate paragraphs, nudging close to the Thematic Echo penalty threshold but stopping short of a final-paragraph sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and strong perceptual signature: "driftingly alert focus," "half-singing, half-calculating," sensory attention to copper, mist, and code. Voice is distinct and controlled under pressure ("tinkersong wonder, bright and chiming"). No head-hopping. The prose texture matches the character's musician-tinkerer lens. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register drift: "propagate through the maintenance systems" and "articulate what had been too long silent" edge toward elevated diction not fully rooted in the balladeer's idiom, though they remain legible. No dialogue present. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during encoding, wider during storm description).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, discovery, or action. Clarity is strong with no major loops. However, a paraphrase-loop appears: "The ghost wanted her to do" (paragraph 4) immediately followed by "what the ghost was trying to articulate" (paragraph 6) restates the same realization without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence emerges in paragraph 8: "She painted... each brushstroke... The graffiti spiraled... The ghost helped her encode..." runs a parallel structure across four sentences without taught pattern (−0.4). Stock metaphor: "frost on glass" (paragraph 2) is a familiar image for ephemeral patterns. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats. The closure beat ("The storm sang with them") is clear but leans slightly abstract. Cumulative deductions place this in mid-7s; artifacts do not touch closure directly but appear in the final third, disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The core synthesis—ghost-in-code meets forgotten musician, communion via graffiti-encoded prayers in a floating monastery—is specific and non-obvious. The marriage of ancient mechanism (flower press bolt plates) and digital logic (ghost in maintenance logs, binary whispers) feels fresh. Transformation test: swapping names and setting would lose the Sky Monastery's prayer-wheel network and the bolt-plate encoding specificity, so the premise is tied to its particulars. Risk-taking in the mechanical-spiritual hybrid and the encoding-as-art choice elevates the piece. Minor deduction: the "seldom-heard balladeer" setup is a familiar archetype (unappreciated artist seeks recognition), and the emotional arc (isolation → found audience) follows a well-trodden template, though the grounded mechanics and ghost's particularity lift it above median derivative work.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The balladeer is present throughout, drives the discovery (repairing prayer-wheels), makes the key decision to encode messages, and completes the circuit. Her choice to marry musical notation with the ghost's code creates the final turn. Two beats: discovery (week three) and encoding action (final courtyard scene). Closure depends on her agency. Setup early, middle development (gathering pigments, painting), payoff (circuit completion). Causal pressure is moderate—her skill enables the solution—but the encoding feels inevitable once the ghost's need is understood, reducing tension. Cost is oblique (abandoning pure song) rather than a visible trade-off. Solid integration but not indispensable—another character with hybrid skills could perform the role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Flower press bolt plates appear in beat one ("fingers traced the bolt plate"), return as structural connectors ("bolt plates that held the mechanisms"), are understood as the original encoding mechanism (paragraph 5), and are pressed into place to complete the circuit (paragraph 11). Four distinct touches across discovery, realization, encoding, and closure. They enable the final act—without the bolt plates' encoding function, the graffiti cannot propagate. Early signal, middle development (understanding their function alters her tactic), closure participation (pressing the final plate completes the circuit). Causal pressure and irreplaceability are strong. Minor cap: the bolt plates' exact mechanics (how pressing them into the graffiti completes a propagation circuit) remain slightly vague, so a near-synonym object ("encoding nodes") could substitute with modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ghost in code is discovered week three (setup), communicates through prayer-wheel patterns (middle), and translates her melody into code at closure (payoff). It shapes stakes—the balladeer seeks to help it give back—and alters tactics by guiding the encoding (paragraph 8: "The ghost helped her encode them properly"). Two beats: discovery and collaborative encoding. The ghost's presence enables the final propagation. Cost connection: the ghost's need drives her choice to abandon song for graffiti. However, the ghost is more facilitator than obstacle; its cooperation is frictionless, reducing pressure. If the ghost were absent, the encoding premise would collapse, so it meets indispensability for concept but lacks the friction that would push it into the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Driftingly alert" is mentioned once in paragraph 5 ("a state of driftingly alert focus") during the encoding sequence. It colors her mental state—half-singing, half-calculating—but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. The trait is coherent with her character (musician-tinkerer) and supports the "tinkersong wonder" tone, but it reads as label-only description rather than a tactical or limiting factor. No trade-off: her focus does not prevent her from noticing danger, missing a detail, or overcommitting. Late middle appearance (40%+ mark), ornamental use, and swappability ("focused concentration" could replace it) cap the score below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Encoding is signaled early (bolt plates as "original encoding mechanism"), developed in the middle (gathering pigments, painting graffiti that merges notation and binary), and executed at closure (completing the circuit, propagating messages). Three beats. The action drives the major turn—her realization that encoding can succeed where song failed—and the final image depends on the encoded graffiti catching storm light. Causal pressure: encoding the unspoken prayers redefines her artistic purpose and the ghost's function. Cost: she abandons her ballad identity. Irreplaceability is strong—removing encoding would collapse the premise. Minor cap: the mechanics of how graffiti interfaces with maintenance systems to "reach station-keepers" remain slightly hand-waved, so a near-synonym action ("transmit," "broadcast") could substitute the propagation step with edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Graffiti art is introduced in paragraph 6 ("encode its message onto the courtyard's walls, using graffiti art"), developed across paragraphs 8–9 (painting, spiraling messages, encoding needs), and completes the circuit at closure. The method shapes two beats: the realization that graffiti can encode (altering her tactic) and the act itself. Early enough (second third) to avoid late-arrival cap. The graffiti's visual permanence contrasts with her vanishing songs, charging the choice. Mechanics matter: merging musical notation and binary whispers into a readable code. However, the exact interface (how painted graffiti propagates through mechanical systems) is abstract, so a near-synonym method ("etch," "inscribe") could replace the surface act. Cost connection: choosing graffiti over song is the visible trade-off. Solid integration but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The misty courtyard is anchored immediately (title, paragraph 1), supplies the prayer-wheels she repairs, provides the bolt plates she uses, and hosts the final encoding action. Four beats: discovery site, repair context, pigment-gathering location, circuit-completion stage. The courtyard's layout (prayer-wheels at center, bolt plates connecting mechanisms, workshop nearby) enables her tactics. The "above clouds" isolation heightens the stakes—messages must propagate down to reach people. The storm (lightning, thunder) provides the clock and reveals the ghost. Setup, middle, and payoff all satisfied. Causal pressure and irreplaceability are strong; removing the courtyard would require rebuilding the entire spatial premise. The setting charges the final image ("clouds carried their messages down").</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Between lightning and thunder" appears in paragraph 2 ("that suspended moment"), returns in paragraph 13 ("in that space where silence holds meaning"), and frames the ghost's communication. Two mentions, both atmospheric rather than tactical. The timeframe does not tighten decisions—she works "quickly" but no countdown or escalating storm forces a trade-off. Lightning reveals the ghost (setup) and the storm "sang with them" at closure (payoff), but middle development is absent; the encoding sequence is not time-pressured. Swappable with "during the storm" or "in the quiet between gusts." The phrase charges tone and the final image's rhythm, lifting it above purely ornamental (mid-4s), but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under a live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Articulating unspoken needs is dramatized: the ghost wants to voice forgotten prayers (paragraph 4), the balladeer realizes "unspoken needs would finally find voice" (paragraph 9), and the closure unit hinges on "giving voice to the voiceless" (paragraph 15). Three beats. The motivation drives the major choice—encoding the prayers—and shapes the final image (messages propagating to those who can help). Desire is conflicted: she wants her songs heard, but she must abandon song for graffiti to succeed. Setup early, middle development (her realization narrows the goal), payoff (the circuit completes the articulation). Cost connection: the choice forecloses her ballad identity. Minor cap: the friction between her want (recognition as a musician) and the ghost's need (encoding prayers) is present but quickly resolved without dramatized hesitation, so the conflicted aspect reads more as alignment than struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" is named once (paragraph 10: "she laughed—a sound of tinkersong wonder, bright and chiming") and colors the entire piece through diction ("driftingly alert," "geometric whispers," "visual song," "marriage of ancient mechanism and painted code"). Tone is coherent across turns and modulates: discovery (curiosity), realization (urgency: "working quickly"), encoding (frenzied wonder), closure (celebratory: "The storm sang with them"). The tone charges the final image, linking her chiming laugh to the storm's song. Setup (established voice by paragraph 5), middle (tonal shift to urgency and wonder), payoff (tone crystallizes in the singing storm). However, the single explicit label late in the sequence and the lack of tonal friction (wonder does not conflict with pressure; it supports it smoothly) prevent higher integration. The tone fits but does not constrain a choice or introduce cost.</comment>
