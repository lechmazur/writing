<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sarah's interiority is concrete and embodied through tactile engagement with documents and dust. Her grief is particularized through "letters still folded in her pocket, growing soft with handling" and drives her methodical archival work as displacement activity. The choice to document the soldier's list is motivated and closes a path—she commits to this specific memorial labor rather than her own mourning. Minor deduction: the final paragraph's "her heart remained broken, but her hands were steady" edges toward label-speak, though the surrounding particulars anchor it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story deepens through discovery beats—button, first file, second file, rolled list—culminating in Sarah's decision to create a permanent record. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she begins documentation work that reconfigures her relationship to grief and unknown histories, with visible cost (displacement of personal mourning into institutional labor). Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One escalation deepening (the rolled list revealing court-martial) narrows options and charges the final commitment. Cost is legible in the decision to light another lamp and begin thorough documentation instead of processing her own loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The file room's dust patterns function as Sarah's investigative text—a micro-setting that constrains knowledge and shapes choice. The button held to lamplight, the basement's windowless quality, and evening settling outside create atmospheric pressure. Sensory detail is purposeful: dust thickness, tarnished brass, water-stained ink, lamplight catching the pinned button. The setting charges the final image when Sarah lights another lamp in the basement, embedding her commitment in spatial terms. Minor gap: the Philadelphia Foster Care Bureau location doesn't actively constrain tactics beyond providing the archive itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: honoring unknown histories versus remaining isolated in grief. The discovery sequence tightens pressure—each file deepens the soldier's sacrifice until the rolled list reveals court-martial and his plea "someone should know they existed." Sarah's agency is decision and endurance: she chooses documentation labor as her response, foreclosing direct grief processing. The final act of lighting another lamp and beginning to write closes a path with visible cost (ongoing displacement, commitment to institutional memory over personal healing). One meaningful deepening via the rolled list is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: unknown sacrifice, institutional memory as moral act, grief channeled into precision. The button pressed "like a flower, like a prayer" between folders recharges at the end pinned to her desk "where the light caught it, a small declaration of presence." Sarah's choice to "magnify small mercies" dramatizes the thematic question without stating it. The final image—dust motes drifting "like benedictions on the gathering pages"—offers non-literal answer: meticulous documentation becomes sacred witness. No moralizing; the ending reweights prior material through her sustained commitment to making invisible children visible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with close psychic distance. Sarah's perceptual signature is tactile and archival: she reads dust patterns, notes water-stained handwriting, unfurls rolled documents. Diction remains controlled—"delicate layer," "small declaration of presence," "tactful, patient, and thoroughly documented"—matching an archivist's precision without clinical coldness. Rhythm modulates appropriately: longer sentences for discovery, shorter for commitment ("She dipped her pen and began to write"). Minor deduction: "broken heart" and "unknown to examine" edge toward abstraction in a few beats, though surrounding texture keeps voice grounded.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean with strong information density—most sentences advance discovery or characterization. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully: "Inside, a matron's notes described..." flows into shorter beats at key turns. The dust-as-text opening and the benediction ending frame the arc effectively. Figurative language is controlled: button "like a flower, like a prayer," dust motes "like benedictions." Deductions: "She had arrived...six months after her husband died at Andersonville" front-loads backstory in a somewhat scaffold-like construction; "small mysteries...small mercies" leans on repetitive "small" modifiers; final paragraph risks slight overwriting with "dust motes drifting golden through the lamplight" stacking visual detail. No paraphrase loops or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—archivist discovering a court-martialed soldier's hidden memorial list—offers a fresh angle on Civil War aftermath and institutional memory. The dust-reading skill is specific and grounded in archival practice. Sarah's grief displacement into documentation work synthesizes familiar grief-and-purpose material through the particular lens of foster care records post-emancipation. Transformation test partially passes: the setting and historical specifics matter to the emotional logic. Deduction: the "broken-hearted archivist finds meaning in work" frame is recognizable; execution is strong but the core emotional arc (displacement grief into meticulous cataloging) follows expected contours without a sharp final inflection that redefines prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sarah appears throughout and drives the closure choice to document the soldier's list. Her broken-hearted state motivates her archive work and the final commitment. She handles files in multiple beats and makes the key turn to create "Record of Unknown Benefactor." Setup early, develops through discovery, and her decision to light another lamp and begin writing shapes the ending. Strong integration but shy of indispensable—another grieving researcher could execute similar logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The button is discovered wedged between folders, examined under lamplight, reveals the soldier's story through matron's notes about Ruth receiving it as a promise, and is pinned to Sarah's desk at closure "where the light caught it, a small declaration of presence." Appears in four beats with evolving significance: clue, promise artifact, memorial object, ongoing witness symbol. Drives discovery and charges the final image. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; cost connection is conceptual (soldier's sacrifice).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Unknown histories structure the entire piece: Sarah reads file room dust to learn which cases were forgotten, discovers the soldier's hidden list, and commits to documenting the twelve children so "anyone who came after...would know these children had mattered." The concept shapes her stake (making the invisible legible) and her final action (thorough documentation). Setup early via dust-reading, develops through each file discovery, and the closure decision directly enacts the concept. The soldier's note "someone should know they existed" crystallizes it with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Tactfully hopeful" is demonstrated through Sarah's patient, methodical approach and her commitment to documentation as a path forward. The trait enables the final choice—she begins work "tactful, patient, and thoroughly documented" rather than confronting grief directly. However, "tactful" itself doesn't constrain a specific on-page action with visible tradeoff; the hopeful aspect is more prominent. Present across beats but the precise attribute as phrased is more asserted than dramatized through a moment where tact versus directness creates friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Unfurling the rolled document in the second folder's back pocket reveals the soldier's list and court-martial fate—the key turn that reweights all prior information and triggers Sarah's closure decision. The action is specific (unfurled versus merely "opened") and the text emphasizes it: "nearly missed, rolled tight and slipped." Drives the major reversal from curiosity to commitment. Setup in earlier file handling, development through this discovery, and it directly causes the ending choice. Strong but not fully indispensable—another discovery method could deliver similar information.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulated dust patterns are Sarah's reading method, signaled in the opening: "she had learned to read the file room like a text—which documents had been pulled frequently...which cases had been forgotten entirely." This skill leads her to the button and informs her understanding of neglected records. The method shapes her investigative approach and motivates her to create permanent documentation. Present early, enables discovery beats, and implicitly underlies her final commitment to thorough record-keeping. Mechanics matter to her characterization and the story's investigative texture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The foster care file room is the sole location and provides the archive Sarah navigates. Its "windowless basement" quality, dust-laden folders, and lamp-lit workspace constrain her work environment and create atmospheric pressure. The room's chaos "left after the emancipation, when suddenly hundreds of newly freed children needed documentation" frames historical stakes. Sarah's choice to light another lamp and remain in the basement at evening charges the ending. Setup immediate, develops through spatial details (desk, lamplight), and the decision to stay and work shapes closure. Setting is essential to both discovery and commitment.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the emancipation" is signaled early and contextualizes the foster care chaos, the soldier's mission, and the freedmen's children needing placement. The timeframe motivates the institutional disarray Sarah is sorting and explains the soldier's access to displaced children near battlefields. However, it functions primarily as backdrop—no ticking clock or temporal pressure tightens Sarah's present-day decision. The historical moment is necessary context but doesn't actively constrain her tactics or pace in the file room scene itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sarah's desire "to magnify small kindnesses" is dramatized through her response to the soldier's list: she commits to tracking down each name and documenting their fates so thoroughly that future readers will know "these children had mattered to someone." The motivation is embodied in her actions—lighting another lamp, beginning careful script, pinning the button as witness. Friction exists between this impulse and her unprocessed grief (letters in pocket, broken heart). Setup via her methodical archival work as displacement, develops through discovery of the soldier's sacrifice, and drives the closure choice with visible cost (ongoing displacement, institutional labor over personal healing).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The tone is contemplative, precise, and reverent—examining archival traces with sustained attention. "Examined unknown" coheres through Sarah's investigative lens: she studies dust patterns, deciphers water-stained names, unfurls hidden documents. The tone modulates subtly from clinical observation ("dust settled thicker on some edges") to quiet emotional charge ("like benedictions on the gathering pages") without breaking coherence. It supports the accumulative drive and charges the final image when documentation becomes sacred act. Consistent through discovery beats and the commitment ending; atmospheric pressure builds without melodrama.</comment>
