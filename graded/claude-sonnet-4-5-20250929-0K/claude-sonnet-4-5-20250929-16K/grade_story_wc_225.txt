<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's interior contradictions are embodied through her "fierce repose" physicality—pride that led to exile versus the capacity for self-forgiveness—and her fingers "fidgeting productively" signal both nervous energy and problem-solving focus. The final choice to forgive herself is earned through the tapestry's concrete progression and her voiced acknowledgment: "I was brilliant and cruel, and I have learned the difference." Minor weakness: the villagers' frozen regret functions more as atmospheric metaphor than individuated pressure on Elena's arc. Cost is visible—she remains exiled but achieves internal freedom—though the emotional journey leans slightly toward therapeutic self-awareness at the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative/Textural texture: Elena decodes the tapestry's frayed threads, each decoded strand narrows the labyrinth path ("turn left at pride, right at shame"), and her voiced self-forgiveness triggers the village's temporal release. Closure is Decisive Change with visible cost: she frees the village and herself, yet "still exiled, still disgraced." Orientation anchors quickly (village, chapel, tapestry, Elena's exile backstory by ~15% mark). One meaningful tightening occurs when she discovers the final sequence requires complete self-forgiveness, forcing the peak choice. The causal chain holds cleanly through closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The time-frozen village—ivy mid-growth, dust motes suspended—creates atmospheric constraint and the tapestry as micro-setting drives Elena's tactical engagement: she sits, plucks threads, decodes the border. The platinum labyrinth's metallic threads "catching what little illumination" recur and charge the final image when they "shimmer" and "warm beneath her hand" at closure. Spatial choreography is clear (chapel, altar, tapestry, village streets). Minor drift: "distant thunder" and "cleansing rain" function more as symbolic mood markers than concrete environmental pressures that shape her decoding choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Elena's need to forgive herself, signaled early through exile backstory and the curse's thematic mirror. Pressure tightens when she decodes the tapestry's final instruction—self-forgiveness without conditions—and must vocalize her failure and growth. The palm-to-labyrinth moment is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost: she speaks her mistake aloud and releases regret, freeing both village and self while remaining in exile. One meaningful escalation under the Causal lens suffices at this length. The ending reweights options clearly: internal freedom versus continued social disgrace.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the platinum labyrinth mirrors Elena's emotional navigation, frayed threads encode the path through pride and shame, and the "woven hush of forgiveness" operates as image and action rather than stated moral. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer—she walks free yet still exiled, "mistakes made honestly could be forgiven, even by oneself"—without tidy resolution or sermonizing. The tapestry's "woven hush" concept threads through as both tactile method and thematic resonance. Slight abstraction in "the language that exists between heartbeats" skews poetic but remains grounded in the villagers' literal resumed speech.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and closely filtered through Elena's chess-tutor analytical mind: "winnowing away distraction," "ruthless clarity," "mapping strategies." Diction remains character-consistent—strategic, precise—and her perceptual signature (fidgeting hands, decoding patterns) anchors voice. Dialogue is minimal (her self-forgiveness speech) but serves closure directly. Minor register drift: phrases like "the woven hush transforming into a sound like wind through wheat" and "the language of woven hush" tilt slightly elevated for peak-pressure moments, though they remain legible and voice-motivated within the lyrical frame established early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high: "Once, she had tutored...her exile had been immediate, absolute" compresses backstory economically. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is selective and purposeful ("amber silence," "platinum labyrinth," "woven hush"). Minor overwriting in the final third: "the woven hush of forgiveness that makes all other conversations possible" and "the language that exists between heartbeats" add slight metaphorical density without advancing action at peak closure. Clarity remains intact and propulsion holds through the decoding sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The fusion of chess strategy, tactile decoding, and self-forgiveness as temporal curse-breaking offers a non-obvious synthesis. The "woven hush" concept—silent language read through fingertips—is specific and memorable. Elena's exile for "winning against the king" and her chess-tutor lens ("winnow," strategic thinking) integrate organically rather than as checklist ornament. Transformation test passes: swap the platinum tapestry for any generic puzzle and the chess-tutor particularity collapses. Minor proximity concern: time-frozen villages and self-forgiveness quests echo familiar fantasy templates, though the tactile decoding method and the "fierce repose" emotional register elevate execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's chess-tutor identity shapes every key turn: she applies "ruthless clarity" and "winnowing" strategy to decode the tapestry, her pride-driven exile fuels the self-forgiveness stake, and her final vocalized acknowledgment ("brilliant and cruel") completes the arc. Setup early, drives middle decoding, and anchors closure speech. Her choices—sitting, decoding, speaking—are all protagonist-initiated and causally linked to outcome.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth appears early (chapel tapestry), drives the middle beats (Elena decodes its border threads to reveal emotional navigation paths), and charges closure (she places her palm on its heart, it warms, shimmers, transforms). Handled physically across multiple beats, its metallic threads and frayed border are tactile and functional, not static description. The labyrinth's emotional map ("turn left at pride, right at shame") narrows her options and the final image of it washing from memory with lesson intact reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Woven hush" is signaled early as "the language of woven hush—that silent speech known only to those who had learned to listen through their fingertips." It shapes Elena's decoding method (reading letters through texture) and recurs in the ending as "the woven hush of forgiveness that makes all other conversations possible." The concept constrains her approach—she must decode tactilely, not visually—and the tapestry's transformation "from woven hush into a sound like wind" provides sensory closure. Slightly more thematic echo than on-page tactical constraint in peak beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Fidgets productively" appears twice: opening line "her fingers tracing the stone walls" and "her hands already beginning their familiar dance—fidgeting productively as she always did when confronting complex problems." It enables the decoding action (plucking, sorting threads) and recurs at closure when she walks away "her fingers already fidgeting productively, already planning her next move." The trait is embodied and functional but operates more as character texture than a constraint with visible cost—her fidgeting never fails or complicates a beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Winnow" is introduced as chess pedagogy ("winnow away distraction, to see through false options until only the true path remained") and directly applied to the tapestry border: "pulling gently at a silver thread" to separate and decode. The action recurs at closure—"winnowed through her own failures to find the essential truth beneath"—and the final image shows her "already planning her next move in the greater game of reconstruction." The verb is irreplaceable (swap for "sort" or "filter" and the chess-strategy link weakens) and drives two beats plus thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Decoding frayed threads is signaled early (tapestry border "threads fraying into loose wisps"), shapes the entire middle sequence ("plucked at loose threads, separating colors, finding patterns," "Each decoded thread revealed part of the labyrinth's solution"), and enables closure (the decoded instruction to forgive oneself unlocks the curse). The mechanics matter: Elena sorts by texture and tension, letters appear where her fingers touch, the method is tactile and sequential. The method is indispensable—remove thread-decoding and the story's logic collapses.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The time-frozen village frames the entire story, supplies the curse that mirrors Elena's internal paralysis, and its temporal release at closure validates her self-forgiveness. The frozen state constrains movement (she moves "through its frozen streets," "people who had been frozen in their private hells") and the environment's thaw ("the village exhaled. Time resumed its flow") is the external proof of internal change. The chapel as micro-setting provides the tapestry. The village is causally essential: remove the frozen curse and Elena's act loses its collective stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"During the lull of distant thunder" appears in the opening line and recurs at closure: "The thunder that had been distant finally broke overhead in cleansing rain." The timeframe is atmospheric but does not tighten decisions—Elena's decoding unfolds without a ticking clock or urgency beyond her own drive. The thunder functions more as tonal bookend than a pressure that alters tactics. Setup and closure reprise present, but middle development as temporal constraint is absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elena's need to forgive herself is established early (exile from pride-driven bet, the curse as self-regret metaphor), tested in the middle (decoding reveals "the center of the labyrinth could only be reached by forgiving oneself completely"), and dramatized at closure through her voiced confession: "I was wrong to gamble with a student's future...I forgive myself for being less than I thought I was." The motivation is conflicted—she must speak her failure aloud and release pride's grip—and the cost is visible: freedom achieved, exile and disgrace remain. The desire drives every beat and the resolution earns its catharsis.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Fierce repose" is embodied early ("She worked with fierce repose, her movements both urgent and perfectly controlled") and modulates through beats: urgency during decoding, steadiness in her voiced forgiveness, quiet determination in the final walk. The tone charges the closure image—she is "free" yet "still exiled, still disgraced"—balancing release with ongoing consequence. The oxymoron is purposeful and consistent, though it operates more as atmospheric descriptor than a pressure that shifts with stakes. Coherent modulation present; closure linkage solid.</comment>
