<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is consistent—sensory mapping evolving into translator-interpreter—but her interior contradictions remain thin. The piece tells us she's "becoming something else" rather than dramatizing the friction between her scientific role and mystical function through on-page micro-choices under pressure. Embodied emotion is sparse; we get floating and speaking but few contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to continue broadcasting lacks visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory data, reflection on transformation, building toward a stance crystallization. Closure attempts Charged Poise—Mira suspended between worlds, mapping the unknown—but cost remains abstract ("witness," "give it voice") rather than a tangible forfeiture or reweighted constraint on the page. Orientation is clean (cave, Mira, post-hibernation) by the first paragraphs. The piece deepens through layered imagery but the final moment doesn't reconfigure prior material with undeniable pressure; it restates the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is vivid and specific: bioluminescent algae, flooded passages, air pockets, tidal breathing. Sensory detail is well-distributed (green-black water, salt, darkness, glowing walls) and filtered through Mira's scientific-mystic lens. The cave constrains movement (she dives, surfaces, unpacks equipment on a shelf) and the tide turn provides a rhythm, but the environment doesn't force a pivotal choice or dramatically alter tactics at closure. Micro-setting (the rocky shelf, the fossil placement) charges the final tableau without making it indispensable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: documenting the sleeping world's transformation, becoming its voice. Pressure is atmospheric rather than escalating; Mira's actions (floating, diving, speaking) don't narrow options or face a live test. No reversal or tightening choice appears; the narrative moves through deepening description toward a stance already established. The ending restates her purpose ("she would map it all") without a decision or renunciation that forecloses a path with on-page cost. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—witness and translator during planetary transformation—emerges through concrete particulars: the elm leaf fossil, emotional heat-maps, bioluminescent algae, the Great Dormancy. The transitional-object concept integrates organically via the fossil as tether between epochs. Subtext operates in the "factually mystical" phrase and Mira's role shift from scientist to voice. The final image attempts resonance (suspended between past/future, mapping the unknown) but leans toward restating the premise rather than reweighting it through a non-literal answer. No diagnostic moralizing, though "she would witness…name it…give it voice" edges close to thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable and apt; psychic distance controlled. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register consistent with Mira's reflective sensibility ("factually mystical," "emotional geography"). Perceptual signature is selective—thermal sensors, heat-mapped emotions, tidal rhythms—grounding abstract stakes in sensory apparatus. No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("had been mapping," "had come to understand") appear but fit the reflective mode. The prose modulates between concrete action (floating, diving, unpacking) and abstract claim ("becoming something necessary") without jarring shifts, though the elevated diction in peak beats ("mystery into meaning") risks slight register inflation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths shift with Mira's movements. Information density is high in the opening third (cave, mapping, Dormancy, technology) but the middle and closing thirds loop thematically: "speak for them," "translate mystery into meaning," "map it all" recycle the same concept across multiple paragraphs without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in "The unknown would not remain voiceless. She would witness…she would map it all"—three stacked declaratives with identical subject-verb stems at closure. Figurative language is controlled (tidal breathing, green-black water) but "factually mystical" as a repeated phrase feels like scaffold. No major clarity breaks, but the loops and stems dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Core premise—sensory cartographer in post-hibernation Earth—offers a fresh angle on witness narratives and planetary transformation. The "factually mystical" technology and emotional heat-mapping are conceptually intriguing, grounded in specific devices (thermal sensors, wavelengths). The elm leaf fossil as transitional object from deep time is a strong particular. However, the transformation test reveals thinness: swap Mira's name and the cave setting, and the arc (solitary observer accepting a liminal role) reads as a familiar template. The ending crystallizes her stance but doesn't transform prior material through a non-obvious synthesis; it restates the witnessing mission established in paragraph two.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her mapping function drives the narrative frame. She makes two on-page choices: diving deeper to investigate strange patterns, then setting up equipment and broadcasting. These moves advance her interpretive role but don't face meaningful opposition or narrow options with cost. Observation dominates over decision; her final stance ("she would map it all") is a crystallization of intent rather than a turn that alters tactics. Setup strong, development functional, payoff present but passive. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (broadcasting) +0.5, minus swappability −0.6 (another witness-observer could perform the same actions) and passive agency −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The elm leaf fossil appears in three beats: paragraph three (introduction, carried through every system), paragraph nine (placed as witness), paragraph twelve (in her hand during final reflection). Its function as "transitional object" and "tether between epochs" is told rather than dramatized—it doesn't constrain or enable a choice, and its meaning doesn't shift on the page. The object is handled but static; removing it would not break the story's logic or closure. Setup +0.6, three mentions across beats +0.6, specificity (forty million years, epoch of transformation) +0.3, minus ornamental use −1.0, told function without action pressure −0.5, swappability −0.6 (any deep-time artifact could serve the same symbolic role).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Transitional objects as concept is named explicitly in paragraph three and echoed thematically (Mira as bridge between worlds, the fossil, her role shift). It frames the story's intellectual stakes but doesn't constrain on-page choices or tactics. The concept remains abstract—"tether between the world that was and the world becoming"—without dramatized friction or cost. Setup (named early) +0.6, thematic presence +0.2, minus label-only treatment −0.8, no causal pressure −0.7, swappability (any bridging metaphor could replace it) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" is introduced in paragraph two to describe the technology and recurs as a phrase in paragraph ten. The attribute characterizes the world-building (science and desperation blurred) but doesn't enable or constrain a specific action with visible cost. It's a setting descriptor rather than a trait that alters tactics. Setup +0.6, two beats (intro, echo) +0.4, specificity (thermal sensors, wavelengths, heat-mapped emotions) +0.4, minus ornamental use −0.6, no action pressure −0.7, told rather than shown −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Floating appears in the opening line, frames Mira's sensory state throughout (paragraphs one, six, eleven, twelve), and bookends the closure ("let herself float again"). The action is embodied and specific—suspended in saltwater, diving under, surfacing in air pockets—and reflects her liminal role. It shapes the story's rhythm and charges the final image of suspension between past and future. Removing "float" and substituting "swim" or "drift" would weaken the thematic resonance but not break causality. Setup +0.8, four beats +1.4, closure linkage (final image) +1.2, specificity (saltwater suspension, tidal rhythm) +0.6, minus partial swappability (other water actions could substitute) −0.5, no causal constraint (it doesn't narrow options) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions is introduced in paragraph two (thermal sensors, measurable wavelengths), demonstrated in paragraph four (fear in cool blue, hope in amber streaks), and drives Mira's investigation in paragraph seven (strange patterns detected on heat-maps). The method is signaled early and used across beats, but the mechanics remain abstract—she catalogues and speaks but the heat-maps don't alter tactics or constrain the closure choice. Setup +0.7, three beats (intro, demonstration, investigation) +1.4, causal involvement (detecting patterns prompts the dive) +0.8, specificity (thermal sensors, emotional residue) +0.5, minus no closure linkage −0.8, summary-only use in key beats −0.5, swappability (any sensory mapping method could substitute) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is present throughout: opening line establishes tidal breathing, paragraph four details bioluminescent algae and emotional residue, paragraphs six-nine navigate flooded passages and air pockets, and the tidal turn in paragraph eleven prompts the final floating tableau. The setting supplies spatial constraints (diving depth, rocky shelf, air pocket) and resources (the hidden chamber for broadcasting) that shape Mira's movements. The cave's "consciousness" mentioned in paragraph seven adds conceptual charge. Setup +0.8, four beats (intro, cataloguing, exploration, closure) +1.4, causal pressure (physical navigation) +1.0, closure linkage (tidal turn, floating in darkness) +1.2, specificity (flooded passages, bioluminescent algae, tidal rhythm) +0.7, minus the setting doesn't force a pivotal choice −0.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The post-hibernation timeframe is established in paragraph two (Great Dormancy, ninety percent in pods) and drives the story's premise: Mira documents what changes in humanity's absence. The timeframe creates the solitary conditions and the need for a translator-voice. It appears in paragraph four (families sheltered before transports), paragraph eight (what grew in their absence), and the closure (speaking for those who will wake). The frame tightens isolation but doesn't impose a live deadline or escalating pressure. Setup +0.7, four beats (intro, residue, reflection, closure) +1.4, causal pressure (enables the solitary mission) +0.9, closure linkage (for "those who would eventually wake") +0.9, minus no tactical constraint or ticking clock −0.8, swappability (any post-collapse timeframe could work) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to become the voice of the unknown is stated explicitly in paragraphs five ("her real purpose"), eight ("becoming their voice"), ten (speaking for the planet), and twelve (give the unknown voice). The desire frames her actions—mapping, diving, speaking, broadcasting—but remains told rather than dramatized through friction or cost. No competing want or fear tests her commitment. Setup +0.7, four beats (realization, articulation, enactment, closure) +1.4, causal involvement (prompts the broadcasting) +0.6, closure linkage (final tableau) +0.8, minus told-only with no internal conflict −0.9, no visible cost or forfeited alternative −0.7, swappability (any witness-mission could substitute) −0.6.</comment>
