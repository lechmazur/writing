<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is specific and embodied—"Grief, she wrote in her notebook, followed by the cloud's coordinates"—showing emotional state enacted through professional habit. The obsession with proving Victor's hypothesis drives concrete micro-choices (adjusting the telescope, cataloguing absences). Internal contradiction surfaces in her awareness that colleagues think she's mad while she remains convinced of her data, though this tension could deepen further with visible self-doubt affecting a tactical choice. The transformation from partner-supported researcher to solitary obsessive is earned across three months of off-page work, but the final satisfaction feels too tidy given the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: gondola at altitude, meteorologist, three months post-accident. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through Victor's ghost-touch fingerprints, the sky-sadness system, storm-memory observations, converging in the final notation "homecoming" that reweights the archive as memorial. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara closes her notebook "satisfied," her endurance of grief and solitary research forecloses the path of abandoning Victor's work, with cost visible in supervisor's suggestion of grief leave and colleagues' clinical watching. The cost could be sharper—her satisfaction dilutes the price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The gondola's altitude, severed tether, and brass telescope constrain Mara's choices: she must study from this isolated vantage, use Victor's instrument to track his hypothesis. Sensory detail is purposeful—"cold observation glass," "dewpoint, wind shear" instruments humming—and filtered through professional lens. The telescope's "patina of a thousand flights, fingerprints oxidized into permanent ghost-touch" charges the final touch where Mara's fingerprints layer over Victor's, making the object a micro-setting that drives the memorial theme and enables the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—is signaled early and tightens through accumulation: yesterday's storm leaving "remembering violence," the spectrum measurements building an archive. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara realizes "the air holds their shape forever," transforming grief into testable hypothesis. Agency appears in her decision to present findings despite supervisor and colleagues' doubt, forecloses the grief-leave path. Cost is visible in her isolation and colleagues' clinical watching, though the ending's satisfaction softens the price. Escalation operates through density increase (Accumulative lens) rather than reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—memory written in absence, presence spooled through gaps—emerges organically from Mara's telescope work and avoids direct statement until earned. "Wholeness wasn't solid—it was spooled through absence" integrates the core concept without sermon. The brass telescope's oxidized fingerprints and returning clouds "gathered in a formation she catalogued simply as homecoming" offer a resonant non-literal answer: grief transforms into data, memorial into method. Victor's "clouds are singing" and the final "emptiness surrounding her hummed with proof" layer contradictory registers (scientific rigor meeting mysticism) that complicate rather than resolve cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with tight focalization through Mara's professional-grief filter. Perceptual signature is distinct: "remembering violence" annotated beneath barometric data, emotional categories married to atmospheric coordinates. Diction stays consistent—"thermal, vapor trail, frequencies just beyond human hearing"—blending meteorological precision with memorial observation. The phrase "Wholeness spooled through air like thread through needles of light" risks slight elevation but remains voice-motivated by Mara's synthesis of data and loss. Distance modulates purposefully from clinical notation to the final "hummed with proof," though "The emptiness surrounding her hummed with proof" edges toward explanatory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively: short declarative "Grief, she wrote" against longer accumulative sentences building atmospheric detail. Information density is high—most lines advance memorial hypothesis through concrete observation. Minor template stems appear: "She thought of Victor's last transmission" and "She touched the telescope's worn surface" follow identical subject-verb-object patterns in the final third. "Memory written in absence. Wholeness spooled through air" delivers fragment variation purposefully. The phrase "clouds gathered in a formation she catalogued simply as homecoming" lands the closure image cleanly, though "satisfied" in the penultimate sentence tells rather than showing closure through image alone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—categorizing clouds by emotion, sky as memorial—offers a fresh angle on grief and meteorology, avoiding stock widow-scientist tropes through the specific "sky-sadness" system and atmospheric memory hypothesis. The brass telescope as inheritance and the oxidized fingerprints create particular rather than generic memorial. The "string breaks" euphemism and Victor's falling "through clouds singing" avoid platitude. Risk-taking in the mystical-empirical synthesis (sky holding "frequencies just beyond human hearing") heightens stakes without obscuring the scientific frame. The piece commits fully to its premise's implications, though the satisfying closure retreats slightly from the boldest emotional cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's professional role shapes every beat: adjusting the telescope's angle, logging coordinates, measuring spectrums, preparing Council presentation. Her meteorologist training enables the emotional-cloud taxonomy that reframes grief as researchable phenomenon. The decision to continue solo flights despite supervisor's grief-leave suggestion and to present findings drives the arc's escalation. Occupation is indispensable—remove it and the memorial-through-data closure collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The brass telescope appears in four distinct beats: opening description with Victor's fingerprints, Mara adjusting it toward cumulus, tracking afternoon light through departed wisps, and the final touch where her fingerprints layer over his oxidized ones. It enables her observation method, carries Victor's presence materially, and charges the closure image where physical contact literalizes "spooled wholeness." Removing it would eliminate the tactile continuity anchoring the memorial theme.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Wholeness spooled through air like thread through needles of light" and "Wholeness wasn't solid—it was spooled through absence" frame the hypothesis that empty sky retains what passed through it. The concept shapes Mara's research tactics—studying gaps rather than clouds themselves, tracking "remembering violence" in cleared air. It appears early in Victor's collaborative notation and returns to anchor the final proof. The metaphor recurs purposefully but operates more as thematic frame than tactical constraint; swapping "spooled wholeness" for "threaded continuity" would require minimal structural change.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" describes their sky-sadness findings that "overturned decades of purely mechanical weather prediction"—work that pilots swore by but remained professionally marginal. The attribute contextualizes why Mara faces supervisor skepticism and colleagues' clinical watching, indirectly pressuring her choice to present despite doubt. However, it functions as retrospective summary rather than constraining present action; the story would hold if their work were described as groundbreaking or controversial instead.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Memorialize" drives every major beat: Mara studying gaps where clouds dissipated, logging "remembering violence," building an archive proving "the sky itself was memorial," and the closing "The sky gondola rocked gently in winds that remembered every soul." The action transforms grief into method, reconfigures loss as atmospheric persistence, and defines the research question ("empty spaces remember") that structures all pressure. The ending's resonance depends entirely on memorial having accrued scientific and emotional weight across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emotional taxonomy appears early as the breakthrough system Mara and Victor developed—"categorizing clouds by emotion rather than mere altitude," "sky-sadness, formations that induced melancholy." It enables her private notation ("Grief," "remembering violence," "homecoming") that layers feeling onto data throughout. The method shapes her observational tactics and frames the Council presentation. Mechanics remain light but sufficient: emotions annotated beneath atmospheric coordinates. Removing it would collapse the premise that atmospheric patterns hold "something beyond physics."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gondola's seventeen-thousand-foot isolation with severed tether forces Mara's solo observation, supplies the brass telescope and observation glass as tools, and creates the spatial remove necessary for studying sky-memory without ground interference. "Sky gondola hung motionless" anchors opening and "rocked gently in winds that remembered" charges closure. The altitude enables and constrains: she accesses cloud-level phenomena but remains isolated from colleagues' scrutiny. Dropping it to ground observatory would eliminate the tactile proximity to atmospheric memory and the physical separation mirroring her grief isolation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Three months after the string breaks" anchors the temporal frame early and defines the mourning duration shaping Mara's obsession. The elapsed time credibly allows solo flights to build an archive yet keeps grief acute enough to drive the memorial hypothesis. "Today's sky offered her a gift" and "Tomorrow she would present her findings" create immediacy around Council presentation as pressure point. The timeframe enables accumulation but doesn't tighten tactics beat-to-beat; it functions more as context than active clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The drive to prove empty spaces remember structures every choice: Mara studying gaps rather than clouds, measuring departed ice crystals' spectral signature, building the three-month archive despite colleagues' concern, deciding to present findings with Victor's telescope as evidence. Motivation creates visible friction—"her supervisor had suggested grief leave," "other meteorologists watched her with careful, clinical eyes"—yet she persists, foreclosing the easier path. The desire transforms personal loss into testable claim, and the final satisfaction delivers on the proof she sought, making the motivation indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Dusty starlight" appears in "dusty starlight began filtering through the gondola's dome" as the day's observation ends, contributing to the elegiac atmosphere. Tone throughout balances clinical precision (coordinates, barometric pressure) with memorial lyricism (clouds as "visible feeling," "oxidized ghost-touch"), modulating appropriately as Mara shifts from data logging to reflection. The specific phrase recurs only once and doesn't charge the closure image; replacing it with "fading light" or "evening glow" would preserve tonal coherence. Tone is consistent and purposeful but this exact phrase is not structural.</comment>
