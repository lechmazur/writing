<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kenji's emotional numbness is consistently portrayed, but his arc from distance to feeling relies heavily on therapy-speak ("ego death," "dissolution therapy") that labels rather than embodies. The courtroom decision feels somewhat abrupt—the crack in his chest is noted but not fully dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The clone remains underdeveloped as a presence, more concept than character, which limits the relational crucible. Internal voice is coherent but occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("both real, both necessary") that flattens urgency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story establishes clear anchors (dojo, jar, custody hearing) and delivers on-page closure when Kenji withdraws opposition and reframes the relationship as brotherly. The Resonant Reconfiguration is legible: he moves from defending his singular identity to accepting complementarity, with visible emotional cost (tears, voice shaking). However, the causal chain from Master Yoon's lesson to Kenji's courtroom epiphany compresses quickly; the "brothers" insight arrives more as realization than as a choice forged under escalating pressure. The lens reads as Causal-Hybrid, holding through the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating dojo and reality-rewriting landscape establish vivid SFF atmosphere and anchor the world's instability as thematic backdrop. Spatial choreography is clean (wooden platform, jar placement, courtroom aisle). The jar—amber fluid, electric light, handwritten label—is specific and purposeful, constraining Kenji's confrontation with his past self. However, the reality engines and shifting geography function mostly as symbolic color rather than material constraint on choice; they decorate rather than pressure tactics. The dojo's physical qualities (cables, wooden platform) are mentioned but don't enable or block action at key beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Kenji's emotional reconnection versus his clone's legal claim—is signaled early and remains coherent. Master Yoon's confrontation applies pressure, and the courtroom scene tightens the choice. However, escalation is thin: Yoon's lesson flows directly to Kenji's epiphany without a middle reversal or forced trade-off that narrows options. The withdrawal of opposition is a meaningful act, but it arrives through insight rather than a decision under fire that forecloses a live path with visible tactical cost. The clone's minimal on-page presence reduces the felt weight of choosing "brothers" over rivalry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The complementary-opposites theme emerges organically from Kenji's journey and Yoon's martial-arts teaching, avoiding overt thesis statements. The jar as literal "duplicate" and its obsolescence at the end provide a clean conceptual bracket. The courtroom resolution—"both original"—resonates without moralizing, reweighting the custody frame into a question of identity and kinship. Minor slip: "vivify each other's humanity" in the penultimate paragraph tilts toward abstraction, though the final paradox ("what it meant to feel alive") lands with earned specificity. The piece invites reflection on selfhood and emotional recovery without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Kenji's perceptions and interiority. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Yoon's lines carry subtext and the courtroom speech pursues a goal. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("vivifying its opposite," "reconstituted") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Kenji's voice is consistent but somewhat generic—his way of noticing lacks a perceptual signature that would distinguish this focalizer from another introspective protagonist. The clone's single moment of visible emotion (tears) is effective but brief, limiting voice contrast. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean and propulsive, with strong imagery (brain pulsing with electric light, forests stuttering into prairies). Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high. Minor loop detected: "The therapy had worked too well" and the subsequent explanation could compress. The phrase "vivify each other's humanity" and "vivifying its opposite" lean toward elevated abstraction in peak beats, slightly blurring immediacy. One filter-verb cluster in the dojo scene ("watching," "stared at," "looked at") dulls a high-pressure exchange. No major grammatical errors; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Overall momentum is strong with minor textural friction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The SFF frame (floating sanctuaries, reality engines, brain-duplication tech) is vividly imagined, and the clone-custody premise offers a fresh legal-ethical angle. The integration of Eastern philosophy (Master Yoon's complementary opposites) with SF identity questions is ambitious. However, the emotional-numbness-after-therapy plot and the courtroom-epiphany turn follow familiar beats: the teacher's wisdom unlocks the student's breakthrough. The "brothers not rivals" resolution, while thoughtful, arrives without a bold structural or perspectival risk that would elevate originality. Specific details (amber fluid, "DUPLICATE" label, stuttering landscape) add texture but don't fully transform the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kenji (ego-death survivor) is the protagonist; his numbness frames the dominant stake and his courtroom decision creates the closure turn. He is present in both major scenes (dojo, courtroom) and his withdrawal of opposition is a causal choice that alters the story's outcome. However, the decision is primarily reactive—an epiphany triggered by Yoon's lesson—rather than a high-agency choice under escalating pressure. The trait is well-integrated but not indispensable; a similar arc could be achieved with a protagonist who underwent different trauma.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The brain in the jar appears early (dojo scene), is handled and discussed (Yoon lifts it, Kenji stares at it), and its label ("DUPLICATE") is reweighted at the end ("obsolete"). It enables Kenji's confrontation with his past self and primes the complementary-opposites realization. The jar is present in two beats (dojo instruction, evidence storage coda) and shapes the thematic closure. Strong integration, though it functions more as symbolic anchor than tactical constraint; removing it would require significant rewrite of the dojo scene and thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The clone custody battle is the story's central premise, signaled early ("custody hearing is tomorrow") and driving both scenes. It forces Kenji's courtroom decision and supplies the legal-ethical stakes that the ending reconfigures. The concept is inseparable from the plot: without the custody battle, there is no courtroom scene, no choice to withdraw opposition, and no "brothers" resolution. The battle shapes tactics (Kenji's preparation, his realization that rivalry is futile) and the final image (two men beginning to "vivify each other's humanity"). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Slices through pretense" is embodied in Master Yoon's confrontation: she names Kenji's new walls, challenges his emotional distance, and forces him to see the jar (and clone) differently. Her directness enables the story's turning point. However, the trait is not unique to Yoon; a similarly perceptive instructor could deliver the same lesson. The trait is signaled (her "cutting" voice), developed (the form demonstration and hard questions), and pays off (Kenji's epiphany), but it is more a teaching-role function than a character-specific constraint with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Vivify" appears explicitly in Yoon's martial-arts teaching ("each position vivifying its opposite") and again in the final image ("vivify each other's humanity"). It frames the complementary-opposites method and charges the ending's emotional reconnection. The action is signaled early, developed through Yoon's demonstration, and returns with reweighted meaning at closure. However, the word itself is somewhat interchangeable with "animate," "enliven," or "bring to life"; the concept matters more than this exact verb. Strong thematic integration, mid-high causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method (complementary opposites) is taught explicitly by Yoon in the dojo scene, demonstrated through martial-arts forms, and applied by Kenji at closure when he reframes himself and his clone as complements rather than competitors. It shapes the story's thematic and causal arc: Kenji's epiphany ("He's not my copy, he's my complement") is the method in action. The method is signaled early (~one-third mark), develops the middle beat (Yoon's lesson), and lands at the ending. Removing it would collapse the story's conceptual scaffold. Essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is present early, anchoring the story's SFF setting and providing spatial grounding (wooden platform, jar placement). It signals the world's instability (tethered by "borrowed physics") and contrasts with the reality-rewriting landscape below. However, the dojo functions primarily as backdrop; its physical properties do not constrain Kenji's choices or supply tactical resources. The setting is atmospheric and thematically consonant (a stable refuge for memory) but not indispensable—the lesson could occur in a ground-level temple with minor edits. Mid-band integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>History rewriting itself is mentioned early (forests become prairies, reality engines) and recurs in the courtroom scene ("the landscape below couldn't decide"). It reinforces the theme of unstable identity and provides atmospheric texture. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a clock; Kenji's choices unfold at the pace of his introspection, not under temporal pressure from the rewriting world. The element is present and thematically relevant but functionally ornamental; it does not shape tactics or escalate stakes. Replaceable with another SFF backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kenji's desire to defeat emotional numbness is the story's dominant stake, signaled early ("came here to feel again") and dramatized through his flatness in the dojo, his inability to muster anger, and his final breakthrough (tears, voice shaking). The motivation drives both major scenes: the dojo lesson and the courtroom choice. It is tested under pressure (Yoon's confrontation) and resolved with visible cost (accepting vulnerability, relinquishing rivalry). The motivation is specific, conflicted (he uses meditation to maintain distance), and inseparable from the plot. Strong integration.</comment>
