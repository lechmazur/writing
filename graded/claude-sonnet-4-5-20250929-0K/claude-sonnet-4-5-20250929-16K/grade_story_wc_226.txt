<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and character-specific—brush and paints abandoned, the decision to speak poetry as preparation—but the motivation feels more asserted than embodied. The internal shift at dawn ("understood") arrives as epiphany rather than dramatized contradiction under pressure. Her renunciation of color and acceptance of judgment carries visible cost, though the choice to walk toward the spire lacks the micro-hesitation or contradictory impulse that would push this higher. The Minister's daughter remains off-page, limiting relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lens is Accumulative/Textural: Mira layers poetry through the night to scatter truth, and the canyon's amplification becomes the turn. Orientation anchors quickly (bone towers, canyon, artist, tomorrow's ritual). The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she gathers her paints knowing she won't use them, walks toward the spire accepting singular truth—visible cost, coherent under the lens. One meaningful deepening (amplification replaces scattering) tightens options with felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bone towers constrain her tactic (using echoes as instruments) and charge the final image (pale spire patient as bone). Sensory detail is vivid and selective: smooth as polished ivory, fog that breathes, echoes fragmenting and multiplying. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (among towers, toward the heart, walking toward the spire). The canyon functions as micro-setting, shaping choice and accumulating pressure across the night.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: evade singular judgment by refracting truth. One meaningful tightening occurs when the canyon amplifies rather than scatters, forcing acceptance. The cost is legible on the page: she gathers paints she'll never use, walks toward inevitable judgment. Agency is renunciation with visible forfeit. No antagonist is present, but the ritual looms and the canyon's acoustic properties provide pressure. The turn is protagonist-driven (her all-night effort proves the opposite of her intent).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the bone towers, the poetry refracting, the core truth unchanging beneath. "A girl was dead, and Mira's art had illuminated the path" distills without moralizing. The final image (pale spire patient as bone, Mira walking toward it) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: forgiveness requires accepting truth whole, not multiplying it. Complexity persists (intention versus consequence, art's duty versus damage) without false balance. The forged hush—silence hammered into shape—charges the ending without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and controlled; Mira's perceptual signature (color, light, refraction) is character-specific. Diction modulates purposefully: poetic cadence in her verses, sharper declarative prose at the revelation. No head-hopping; filter use is minimal and voice-motivated. "Forged hush...hammered into shape by will and exhaustion" shows rhythmic control under pressure. One brief register slip: "the price of forgiveness didn't work that way" edges toward explanatory summary, slightly dulling immediacy at a key beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift with emotional intensity. High information density: "towers of bone rose like broken fingers" anchors setting, tone, and metaphor in one image. Minor scaffold: "She had come here not to hide, but to prepare" could be cut without loss. The phrase "innocently mischievous act, she'd told herself" reads as mild filter cushioning that slightly blunts the self-deception beat. "Forged hush...hammered into shape" is strong figurative work at closure. No loops orTemplate cadence runs; clarity holds throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis (artist refracting truth through canyon acoustics before judgment ritual) feels specific and earned. The reversal—amplification instead of scattering—grows inevitably from the established acoustic logic. The "innocently mischievous" framing and the High Minister / daughter arc echo familiar accountability templates without full transformation through lived detail; Mira's internal calculus remains somewhat abstract. Risk is present (the poetic verses dramatized on the page, the quiet acceptance) but does not radically heighten stakes. Closure coheres without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's defiance drives the all-night poetry sessions and the final acceptance. Her choice to speak poetry shapes the middle beats; her decision to walk toward the spire anchors closure. Present across setup, development, and payoff with visible cost (gathers paints she won't use). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, though the trait "defiant" is more asserted than enacted in micro-choices that trade safety for artistic stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The pale spire appears in the opening (at the canyon's heart, where they'll take her), is referenced during the night (destination looming), and anchors the final image (emerges from fog, patient as bone, she walks toward it). Present in three beats with reweighted meaning: from backdrop to inevitable terminus. Charges the closure. Specificity (perpetually wreathed in fog, taller than all others) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The price of forgiveness shapes stakes throughout: ritual extracts it from flesh/memory/soul; Mira seeks mercy; the ending clarifies price requires acceptance, not multiplication. Constrains tactics (the poetry is an attempt to negotiate price) and reweights at closure (she gathers paints, walks toward payment). Felt cost is visible. The concept is dramatized in the ending's renunciation, not merely thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Innocently mischievous" is told (she'd told herself) rather than shown through on-page micro-choices. The painting that spilled secrets is backstory; no present action enacts the trait under pressure. The attribute colors motivation but does not constrain or enable a visible choice with cost on the page. Mentioned once, swappable with "reckless" or "naïve" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Refract" is the conceptual spine: Mira refracts truth through poetry, the canyon refracts echoes, the ending reveals refraction failed to scatter the core. Shapes the middle attempt (verses designed to bend light through prism) and the closure realization (every refraction contained the core). Present across two beats with causal linkage. Could be replaced with "scatter" or "multiply" with moderate edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Impromptu poetry is signaled early (she begins to speak verse), its mechanics matter (each poem designed to refract, towers catch and splinter words), and it occupies the middle development. Shapes her tactic across the night. Not present in the final image itself, but the failure of the method drives the closure realization. Swappable with "improvised speeches" or "layered confessions" without breaking logic, capping score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The towers of bone and canyon of endless echoes enable the poetry tactic (using towers as instruments, echoes multiplying meanings), appear across three beats (opening anchor, night-long work, dawn realization), and charge the final image (pale spire patient as bone). The acoustic property is irreplaceable: only this setting allows the amplification reversal. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity. Essential to both tactic and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Tomorrow, the ritual would begin" anchors the deadline in paragraph two. "Through the night" and "by dawn" track elapsed time and intensify urgency. The timeframe tightens tactics (she has one night to prepare) and the approach of morning forces the realization. Present across setup, middle, and closure with felt pressure. Could be "the day before" with minor rewording, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's desire to refract singular truth into many is dramatized through the all-night poetry effort, tested when the canyon amplifies instead of scatters, and renounced at closure (acceptance of truth "whole, sharp, undivided"). Friction between want (mercy through complexity) and cost (the core remains unchanged) drives the arc. Present across three beats with visible consequence. The motivation is specific and charges the ending's forfeit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Forged hush...hammered into shape by will and exhaustion" appears at the closure beat, charging the final image with purposeful silence after the night's layered echoes. Tone is coherent (solemn, weighted) and modulates with pressure (poetic cadence during verses, declarative clarity at realization). The hush is earned by the prior noise, reweighting the dominant stake. Not signaled early; first explicit mention is late. Meaningful but arrives too late for highest integration.</comment>
