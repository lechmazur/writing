<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's seasonal muteness is mentioned but never constrains a choice on the page; her interiority consists largely of abstract reflection about truth and wonder rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The piece tells us she "knew" things were being lost and that bells were her "truest language," but we never see her wrestle with competing impulses or make a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. The final paragraph asserts transformation in the audience's faces without dramatizing resistance or cost in Mara's own stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ice melts, bells respond, the sculpture shifts. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights wonder and impermanence—but the cost remains asserted rather than legible on the page. Orientation anchors who and where early; the single continuous scene fits scope. The ending reconfigures meaning through the marriage of motion and music, yet "faces transformed" and "the color of wonder preserved" are told outcomes without visible friction or forfeiture that the reader can point to.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Whispering Bluff, kinetic sculpture, and iceberg fragment are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail—rainbows refracted across palms, bells swaying in counterweight cradles. The ice's diminishing and the sculpture's gradual transformation are tracked cleanly and charge the final image. The bluff "whispers its approval" at closure, completing a lyric frame that grounds the conceptual repricing in setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder through bell-song—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page obstacle or live choice forces Mara to trade one path for another. The ice melts at its own pace, bells respond autonomously, and the audience gathers without resistance. One tightening occurs as the fragment shrinks and rhythm quickens, but this is environmental rather than protagonist-driven. The piece accumulates texture without a moment where agency forecloses a live option with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—impermanence, truth without words, wonder preserved—emerges organically from the ice's dissolution and the bells' autonomous song. The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "bell-song and melting ice, in the marriage of motion and music that needed no words." However, the conceptual price is asserted ("something was being lost") rather than dramatized through specific omission or sacrifice on the page, and the crowd's transformation is told rather than embodied in a single concrete detail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; the prose carries a distinct meditative texture with controlled rhythm—"Drop by drop, water would fall... Each strike rang clear." Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("she knew it") to wider observation of the gathering crowd. No dialogue appears. The narrative certainty fits an omniscient-leaning register, though some filter verbs ("watched," "wanted them to hear") slightly dull immediacy at peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and sensory specificity is high—"crystalline structure centuries of frozen time," "thumb-sized piece remained." Minor scaffold appears: "Each bell hung... mechanisms of counterweight and wind-catch that kept the bells in constant, subtle motion" could compress. The phrase "muted vigor" in the penultimate paragraph echoes the prompt tone label without organic integration. Information density is solid; no loops or template cadence runs mar clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The marriage of kinetic sculpture, seasonal muteness, and a post-verbal society offers a fresh synthesis, and the iceberg-as-timekeeper is a concrete, non-obvious mechanism. Yet the emotional arc—artist performs, crowd is transformed, artist rests satisfied—follows a template path without surprise or friction. The Great Quieting worldbuilding and "seasonally mute" attribute remain ornamental rather than driving a non-obvious moral calculus or turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her role as bell tuner frames the piece, but her choices are procedural (suspend the ice, watch it melt) rather than decisive. She does not alter tactics or face a trade-off; the sculpture performs autonomously. Setup and payoff gates are met, but middle development shows observation without agency-driven pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The iceberg fragment is handled early (retrieved by traders, suspended in wire cradle), its melting drives the middle sequence (drops fall, bells respond), and it appears in the final image ("thumb-sized piece remained... last drops fell"). Three beats; causal pressure is environmental rather than protagonist-chosen, but the object is irreplaceable and charges closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" is named and described ("complex harmonies that couldn't lie") but functions as thematic assertion rather than on-page constraint. The bells speak "what they spoke" autonomously; Mara does not face a choice between truth and comfort or pay a cost for honesty. Setup and payoff present; middle use is conceptual rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Seasonal muteness is mentioned twice—"seasonally mute since childhood" and "seasonally mute but never voiceless" at closure—but never constrains an action or enables a tactic with visible cost. It adds biographical color without altering what Mara can or cannot do on the page. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Glisten" recurs: the ice "glistened in the early light," and later "In its diminishing, it glistened ever brighter, concentrating light even as substance fled." This charged reprise reweights the stake (beauty in dissolution) and anchors the closure image. Two distinct beats; the action is visual rather than agent-driven, limiting causal pressure, but the specificity is high and the payoff undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Kinetic sculpture is introduced early with mechanical detail (counterweight, wind-catch), its shifting in response to melting ice drives the middle sequence, and the final paragraph confirms "the marriage of motion and music." Three beats with causal linkage; the mechanics matter and shape the accumulative pressure. Removing the kinetic element would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Whispering Bluff is established immediately and frames the entire piece; atmospheric whispers set bells in motion, and the bluff "whispered its approval into the gathering dark" at closure. The setting enables the method and charges the ending image. Two clear beats; it does not constrain a protagonist choice mid-scene, capping upper range, but it is essential to tone and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The Great Quieting ("when humanity discovered that words had become unnecessary") is mentioned in the opening and informs the thematic backdrop—"people communicated through gesture, through music." It shapes world logic but does not tighten a decision or tactic on the page. Setup and conceptual payoff present; middle urgency absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"To preserve the color of wonder" is stated as Mara's aim and repeated in the final paragraph ("the color of wonder, preserved in bell-song"). The motivation frames the piece but is never tested by competing desire or cost; no friction between want and obstacle appears. Setup and thematic payoff met; on-page conflict with this motive is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Muted vigor" is named once ("listened with the muted vigor of those who had learned to receive fully") and the tone—meditative intensity, restrained lyricism—holds across the piece and modulates with the quickening rhythm as the ice shrinks. The tone charges the final quiet image. One explicit mention plus consistent texture; no mid-scene pressure shift, but coherence and closure participation are strong.</comment>
