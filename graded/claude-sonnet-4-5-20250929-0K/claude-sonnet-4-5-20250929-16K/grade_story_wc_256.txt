<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Karim's shift from mourning the project's failure to recognizing "loss creates its own geography" shows clear internal contradiction dramatized through her interaction with the bell ringer. The embodied moment "Karim felt something shift inside her chest" is somewhat generic but recovers with the following introspection about isolation. The bell ringer's backstory about the removed bells earns their motivation, though "powerfully gentle" reads as label-only without visible tradeoff in action. The final choice to "rebuild this...as testimony" closes a clear arc from isolation to connection with visible cost (abandoning restoration for honoring corruption).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the corrupted-fragment layering builds pressure toward a conceptual repricing where "loss creates its own geography" reweights the artificial pilgrimage premise. One meaningful deepening occurs when the bell ringer's demonstration forces Karim to see the data as discovery rather than failure, narrowing her options from restore-or-abandon to honor-the-corruption. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of the laboratory "finally alive with purpose" crystallizes the new stance with felt cost (the original therapeutic vision abandoned). Minor slip: the phrase "connection wasn't something lost to be found, but something continuously created" edges toward theme statement but remains anchored in the collaborative act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The laboratory and its sound-capture equipment constrain the bell ringer's demonstration and enable the layering action that drives the turn. The miner's lamp lens functions as micro-setting: it pulses "in rhythm with the emerging soundscape" and casts golden shadows that charge the final image, linking tool/body/environment in one coherent system. Sensory detail is selective (carbide lamp fractured light, church bell echo, wind through broken windows) and filtered through Karim's professional attention. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single-location scene. The "golden shadows" recur purposefully at closure, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Karim believes the corrupted data is "worthless" and the project "defunct." The bell ringer's question "What if it was a discovery?" applies immediate pressure, and the demonstration narrows Karim's options from mourning-restoration to accepting-transformation. One clear tightening: Karim's realization that "the real pilgrimage was learning to navigate what remained" forecloses the original therapeutic goal with visible cost (the perfection model abandoned for testimony model). The final choice to rebuild carries felt weight because it commits to a new definition of authenticity. Agency rests with Karim's decision, not luck. Minor gap: the bell ringer's expertise at Karim's equipment ("as though they'd designed it themselves") strains credibility slightly but does not break causality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the corrupted-data particulars rather than statement: "loss creates its own geography" and "honest relationship with absence" grow from the concrete act of layering extinct sounds. The lamp lens and golden shadows accumulate meaning without becoming allegorical tokens. Karim's insight that "connection had texture—rough and smooth, hollow and full" arises from the embodied demonstration rather than abstract philosophizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the laboratory hums "finally alive with purpose" without moralizing. One slip: "connection wasn't something lost to be found, but something continuously created" edges toward direct thematic articulation, though it remains anchored in the on-page collaborative gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; no head-hopping. Karim's perceptual signature is職業-filtered: she looks up from her "acoustic reconstruction table" and sees the fragments as "worthless" data before the bell ringer reframes them. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the shift ("Karim felt something shift inside her chest" moves closer at the emotional pivot). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: the bell ringer's "You're assuming the corruption was a loss" and "Listening for texture" carry subtext about grief and purpose. Minor filter-verb cluster in the final paragraph ("seemed to dance," "felt more real") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure voice. The phrase "powerfully gentle, like water reshaping stone" reads as external description; showing this quality through gesture would strengthen.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify. Information density is high in the demonstration beat: "layering the corrupted fragments...church bell's echo, children's voices in an empty school, wind through a factory's broken windows" does multiple jobs (action, sensory detail, thematic texture). Two minor slips: "They worked through the night" summarizes the pivotal reconstruction rather than dramatizing key choices within it (−0.3). The phrase "Each fragment they restored wasn't cleaned of its corruption but honored for what the silence had made of it" edges toward authorial summary rather than showing the honor in action (−0.2). No loops or template cadence. Figurative language remains controlled and purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes "artificial pilgrimage" with "corrupted sound archives" in a non-obvious way: therapeutic journeys fail but become testimony through honoring loss. The bell ringer's occupation (removed memorial bells) and the carbide lamp lens feel particular to this world rather than generic quirk-drops. The turn from "worthless data" to "discovery" avoids template reversal by grounding it in the specific act of layering extinct sounds with "texture." Transformation test: plot and arc would lose coherence with different setting/objects (sound lab, bells, lamp lens all integral). One proximity note: "water reshaping stone" is a familiar image for patience/gentleness, though it remains functional here.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bell ringer's choice to activate the synthesis chamber and layer corrupted fragments creates the story's key turn. Their decision to demonstrate "listening for texture" rather than explain drives Karim's shift from mourning to discovery. Present in opening (arrival), middle (demonstration), and closure (collaborative rebuilding). The character's prior role (ringing removed bells) earns their search for connection texture. Cost visible: they've been "searching for the texture of connection ever since" the bells were removed.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lamp lens appears in three beats: placed on table (fractured light casting golden shadows), pulsing in rhythm during the soundscape, and catching monitor light at closure. Its light properties enable the "golden shadows" tone and link tool/body/environment. However, the lens itself is not handled or used—it sits and refracts. The closure beat mentions it passively ("catching light") rather than showing active use. Reaches mid-6s on reprise and tone linkage but lacks the causal constraint or active handling for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Artificial pilgrimage shapes the dominant stake: Karim mourns its failure in the opening, the bell ringer reframes it as discovery in the demonstration, and the closure commits to rebuilding it "not as therapy, but as testimony." The concept constrains tactics throughout: the corrupted data must be honored rather than cleaned. Present in all three gates (setup, middle choice, ending). The final line "the first true artificial pilgrimage" directly articulates the concept's transformation. Cost visible: the original therapeutic model is abandoned for testimonial model.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Powerfully gentle" appears as external description ("movements were powerfully gentle, like water reshaping stone") and in the closing touch ("powerfully gentle"). The trait is labeled twice but does not constrain or enable a dramatized action with visible tradeoff. The bell ringer's precision with equipment and their quiet teaching method could exemplify the trait, but the text does not tie those actions explicitly to "powerfully gentle." Functional presence but replaceable; does not reach causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Propel" appears in Karim's protest: "Those sounds can't propel anyone toward healing." The bell ringer's reframe implicitly argues that the corrupted sounds *can* propel through honoring loss rather than restoring perfection. The concept recurs in the closure: the artificial pilgrimage now propels by acknowledging absence. However, the verb itself is not repeatedly used or dramatized as a physical/emotional action; it remains more thematic echo than causal driver. Shapes one key turn (Karim's realization) but could be swapped for "guide" or "carry" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Questioning assumptions" is signaled explicitly ("You're assuming the corruption was a loss") and drives the demonstration beat. The bell ringer's method (activating synthesis, layering fragments, adjusting frequencies) dramatizes the questioning by showing rather than restoring. Karim's shift from "data's worthless" to "learning to navigate what remains" traces directly to this method. Present in setup (the question), middle (the layering demonstration), and ending (rebuilding based on the new assumption). The method's mechanics matter: without the layering, no textural discovery occurs. High integration; removal would collapse the story's causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The laboratory enables the demonstration (synthesis chamber, playback controls, acoustic reconstruction table) and supplies the corrupted archive that becomes the material for transformation. Karim's isolation "here" grounds her emotional state. The setting constrains the bell ringer's search: they came because "all these archived sounds waiting to mean something again." Present in all three gates and essential to the closure: without the lab's equipment and archive, no pilgrimage reconstruction occurs. The "laboratory hummed softly, finally alive with purpose" charges the final image. Micro-setting (equipment as tools) alters tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Timeframe is anchored in the opening: "three days after the power grid stabilized...When the grid finally stabilized last week." The stability enables the discovery (before: blackout corrupted data; after: bell ringer arrives, Karim can access archive). However, the timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions or create a live clock. The single night's work is summarized ("worked through the night, by dawn") rather than tracked with pressure. Setup present, some middle relevance (the blackout's effect on data), but no closure pressure. Functional but not essential; could be "three months" or "a week" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bell ringer's stated desire—"I've been searching for the texture of connection ever since"—is dramatized through their arrival, their hands-on demonstration, and the final collaborative rebuilding. The motivation drives all three gates: they come to the lab (setup), they teach Karim by layering sounds (middle), and they co-create the new pilgrimage model (closure). Friction visible: they lost the bells and have been searching; the cost of that search is felt. Karim's parallel desire (to restore the project) shifts to align with the bell ringer's (to discover texture through testimony). The motivation is irreplaceable: without this specific want, the story becomes generic collaboration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" recur three times with purposeful progression: opening (lamp lens casts them on walls), middle (implicit during demonstration), closure (dancing with resurrected sounds). The tone modulates from initial melancholy (Karim mourning failure) to wonder during the demonstration to collaborative warmth at the ending. The golden light links lamp/setting/tone in one coherent system and charges the final image: "golden shadows that seemed to dance." However, tone is not tested under peak pressure or conflict; the piece remains contemplative throughout. Strong reprise and coherence but does not shift dramatically under stress, capping high-band entry.</comment>
