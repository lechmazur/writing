<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to preserve wonder is established early and the titan-gear provides embodied physicality. However, her internal arc remains largely abstract—she "understands" and "feels" rather than makes difficult choices with visible trade-offs. The grandmother's voice and the scroll's wisdom arrive as given insights rather than being earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The ending gesture (descending with the scroll) reads as acceptance rather than a choice that forecloses a competing path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear conceptual premise (tomorrow's disappearance, migrating book identities). The smelting sequence provides a meaningful tightening where contradictions fuse, and the scroll's emergence offers Conceptual Repricing—living without tomorrow by accepting flux. Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words. The cost, however, remains conceptual rather than visceral: Maren's acceptance that "nothing needed to stay the same" doesn't foreclose a visible path or exact a felt price in the final image, keeping this from the high band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is vividly rendered with glass walls, rising water, migrating shelves, and the copper basin—all filtered through a librarian's working relationship with fluctuating space. The titan-gear exoskeleton constrains her reach and synchronizes with her heartbeat at closure, charging the final image. Sensory detail (bronze cogs whirring, salt-dark bamboo, glowing water) is selective and purposeful. The setting genuinely shapes Maren's method: the basin's tide-cycle becomes the mechanism for smelting meaning, fulfilling the micro-setting test for high-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder after tomorrow's disappearance—is signaled early and remains coherent. The discovery of the founder's pages and the smelting ritual provide one meaningful tightening that narrows Maren's approach. However, the escalation is more procedural than pressured: she finds what the dream suggested, reads instructions, follows them, and succeeds without visible friction or competing costs. The "wintersun serenity" undercuts urgency. Agency is present (she chooses to smelt the pages), but no live option is foreclosed with felt consequence, capping this in mid-7s under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: wonder requires change, identity is tidal, routines can be miraculous through fluctuation. The scroll's whisper—"accept that you are both constant and changing"—skirts explicit thesis but remains rooted in the smelting action and the founder's written insight. The final image (Maren as librarian-fisher harvesting meaning, "already forgetting and remembering") offers a resonant answer to living without tomorrow. However, the instruction-following structure and the scroll's direct wisdom dilute ambiguity; the piece tells more than it shows thematic complexity, and the ending borders on paraphrase of the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct textural voice ("wintersun serenity, cold and brilliant," "smelted pages," "titan-gear"). Diction elevates appropriately for a lyric-speculative register without breaking character knowledge. Free indirect access to Maren's perception is clean. However, perceptual signature could be sharper—her way of noticing feels more authorial-poetic than character-specific under pressure. Phrases like "electric shock of encountering something that shouldn't work but does" read as thematic commentary rather than immediate sensation, and the ending's "already planning...already forgetting" structure becomes template-like rather than voice-driven modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language (tidal atrium "breathed," knowledge "transforms through being known") charges key images. Information density is high in the smelting sequence. However, several beats loop conceptually: the idea that wonder requires change is stated in the founder's pages, then restated by the scroll, then paraphrased in Maren's realization and again in the closing paragraph—four iterations of the same insight without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the final lines ("already planning...already forgetting...already"). The phrase "wintersun serenity" recurs three times as a label without evolving meaning. Filter-verb density ("understood," "felt," "discovered") in reflective passages dulls immediacy. Subtracting −0.8 for loop and template issues under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of tidal library, migrating book identities, and disappeared-tomorrow premise is inventive and the titan-gear exoskeleton adds tactile specificity. The "smelting contradictions" frame offers a fresh angle on preservation. However, the emotional core—accepting flux to sustain wonder—follows a familiar wisdom-quest template: protagonist receives instructions from ancestor figure, performs ritual, gains insight, accepts new hybrid identity. The transformation test is marginal: swap "librarian" for another knowledge-keeper role and the arc holds with minimal change. The piece synthesizes existing ideas (library-as-metaphor, identity-as-flux, wonder-in-routine) but doesn't transform them through a non-obvious moral calculus or embodied cost, keeping this in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout, her titan-gear librarian role shapes her access to high shelves and synchronizes with contradictions at closure. She makes the key choice to feed pages into the basin and strap the scroll into her creel. However, her decisions feel procedural rather than conflicted—she follows dream-guidance and written instructions without visible hesitation or competing pull. Present in setup, middle discovery, and ending embodiment (two gates minimum), with some causal role in the smelting turn, but her agency doesn't narrow options with cost, capping this near mid-5s with slight uplift for closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The bamboo creel appears in three beats: discovery behind the radiator (contains stable pages), implied presence during the smelting (pages are "fed into the basin"), and final use ("strapped the scroll into her creel"). It serves as a container for stable meaning and marks Maren's fisher identity at closure. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle function is implied but not dramatized as a constraining choice. The creel enables the harvest metaphor and charges the final image (librarian-and-fisher both), earning mid-6 range for lyric reprise and closure linkage, but swappable with another "container" or "vessel" without deep structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Migrating identities is the story's engine: books shift contents with tides, the card catalog dissolves, and Maren's own identity becomes "librarian and fisher both" by the end. This concept shapes her central problem (how to preserve wonder when meaning won't stay fixed) and her solution (smelt contradictions, accept flux). Present in setup (paragraph 3), drives the middle discovery (finding stable pages amidst migration), and is paid off at closure when Maren herself becomes tidal. The concept constrains her method—she cannot rely on fixed categories—and reweights the ending image. Strong integration across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage, reaching low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Moon-phase fluctuation is embedded in the setting: the tidal atrium's water "rose and fell with celestial precision," rooms "expanded during spring tides, contracted during neaps," and the copper basin "filled and emptied with the tides." This attribute constrains Maren's work (she needs the titan-gear to reach migrating shelves) and the smelting ritual is timed to the basin's tide-cycle. Present in setup (paragraph 1), affects middle tactics (climbing, timing), and the final synchronization ("mechanisms now synchronized...with the moon's pull") charges closure. However, the cost is more logistical than dramatic—no visible trade-off where moon-phase timing forces a sacrifice. Mid-6 range for consistent constraint and closure linkage without sharp on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Smelting is the story's pivot: Maren feeds stable and migrating pages into the tide-filled basin, the titan-gear accelerates, water glows, and the scroll emerges—"no longer separate sheets but a single continuous scroll that folded through dimensions." This action defines the method for preserving wonder, creates the artifact that holds living-without-tomorrow instructions, and enables Maren's identity shift. Present in setup via the founder's instructions, executed as the story's central turn (middle-to-late), and directly shapes closure (scroll as harvest, Maren as smelter of meaning). Removing "smelt" would collapse the logic; swapping for "bind" or "merge" would dilute the metallurgical/transformation charge. Strong causal role, closure linkage, specificity, reaching high-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Accepting contradictions is both theme and method: the founder's instruction ("smelt contradictions together—let stability and change occupy the same space"), the titan-gear drawing "power from the contradiction itself," and Maren's final realization ("nothing needed to stay the same to remain precious"). The method is signaled early (founder's pages mid-story), enacted in the smelting (feeding both stable and migrating texts), and voiced at closure. It shapes Maren's approach—she doesn't choose fixed or fluid, she holds both—and charges the ending when she becomes "constant and changing." However, the mechanics remain abstract; we see glowing water but not the contradictory tension as embodied struggle. Mid-to-high 6s for thematic integration and closure presence without on-page friction or visible cost tied to the method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is essential: glass walls filter light through rising/falling water, shelves migrate with moon phases, the copper basin's tide-cycle enables the smelting ritual, and Maren's titan-gear synchronizes with the space's rhythm. Setting is present from the opening line, constrains her movement and timing throughout (she must climb during specific tidal windows, use the exoskeleton for access), and the basin becomes the altar for transformation. The atrium "breathed with the ocean's rhythm" recurs as a body-metaphor at closure when the gear matches her heartbeat. Swapping for a static library or non-tidal space would break the fluctuation logic and the smelting method. Strong setup, middle constraint, and closure charge, reaching mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The disappeared-tomorrow premise is introduced early ("three weeks since tomorrow disappeared") and establishes the world's altered state—people "unable to plan, unable to anticipate, living in an eternal now." This timeframe motivates Maren's search for preservation methods. However, after setup it recedes: the middle action (finding the creel, reading instructions, smelting) doesn't track urgency or show how the loss of futurity pressures her choices in real time. The ending gestures back ("the world continued its existence without tomorrow, and that was fine") but as thematic closure rather than tactical constraint. Setup gate met, weak middle development, conceptual payoff without cost. Mid-4s for premise-setting that doesn't tighten decisions on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation—"to preserve wonder in routine"—is stated explicitly in the founder's pages and embodied in her librarian role (tending collections that refuse to be tamed). She seeks the method, finds the instructions, and enacts the smelting to achieve this goal. The desire frames her opening action (reaching for a volume, using the exoskeleton) and the ending realization ("the method for preserving wonder: by accepting that nothing needed to stay the same"). However, the motivation is more mission than want-versus-fear friction; we don't see what personal cost or competing desire she sacrifices to preserve wonder. Setup and payoff gates met, with middle participation, but told more than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices. Low-6 range for coherent but under-pressured desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Wintersun serenity" is introduced as the world's post-tomorrow emotional state ("cold and brilliant, where each moment stood alone like ice crystals") and returns at closure ("the wintersun serenity bright and cold and perfect in her chest"). The tone matches the library's calm-amid-flux aesthetic and Maren's undisturbed problem-solving. It modulates subtly: early, it's a societal phenomenon; by the end, it's internalized as acceptance. However, the tone remains static through the smelting—no spike of urgency or warmth when water glows or the scroll emerges—limiting emotional range. Setup and payoff gates met with coherent mood, but single-register execution. Low-7 range for purposeful consistency and charged reprise without modulation under pressure.</comment>
