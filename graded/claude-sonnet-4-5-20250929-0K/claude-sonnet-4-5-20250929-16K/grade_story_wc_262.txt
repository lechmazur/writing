<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's quest is clearly motivated (seeking unused love), but her interior life remains largely abstract. The interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("phantom weight of every emotion") without contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The final choice to release the love feels thematically appropriate but lacks visible cost—she weeps and smiles, but what path is foreclosed? The piece prioritizes atmosphere over character complexity under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Marina catalogues film strips across forty-seven nights, building toward a density shift when she spreads them all and projects them. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the final image of love "speaking itself into the dark" reweights her vigil with purpose and delivers felt cost (her role as keeper/translator is now irrevocable). Orientation anchors promptly (who, where, why by paragraph two). One meaningful deepening occurs when she understands the love is incubating, not trapped, which shifts her from searcher to conductor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The projection booth is vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("hot metal and old celluloid") and the film strips function as micro-setting, constraining her method (touch, cataloguing) and charging the final image (threaded into projector, light splashing onto screen). Spatial choreography is coherent: booth floor becomes a "map of longing," booth to theater sightline tracks cleanly. The setting shapes the closure—without the projector and theater, the release mechanism fails—so environment acts as more than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (finding where unused love is stored) and deepens when Marina realizes it's incubating, shifting her goal to release. One meaningful tightening: the forty-seventh night decision to thread all strips and project them narrows options (she becomes the conductor, foreclosing her role as mere searcher). The escalation is driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens (density increase across weeks culminates in projecting). Cost is legible but oblique—she commits to the role of "keeper, translator" with no evident sacrifice of alternatives on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (unused love seeking expression, silence transformed into light) emerges organically from Marina's discoveries rather than assertion. The film strips as carriers of unexpressed devotion avoid overt symbolism; the goodbye letters exist in "gaps between frames," a concrete image that deepens the theme. The ending delivers a resonant answer without moralizing: love finds "anyone who might someday sit in those dusty seats," reweighting solitude into communion. The phrase "while forgotten lyrics search for tune" recurs with purpose, anchoring the liminal emotional state. No thematic echo or didactic intrusion mars the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Marina; psychic distance is controlled. Voice carries distinct texture ("perfume of dreams turned physical," "hushed thunder") that modulates with emotional intensity—calmer in cataloguing, heightened at projection. Filter verbs ("she'd discovered," "she understood") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated rather than distancing. The phrase "spatially imaginative farewells" and "while forgotten lyrics search for tune" edge toward elevated register that feels slightly authorial rather than Marina's idiom, creating minor distance inconsistency in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but overwriting appears in stacked metaphors: "incubate in the dark like seeds waiting for impossible spring" and "shaking her at frequencies below sound" in the same narrative window create figurative density without progressive revelation. The phrase "finally, finally" repeats across two paragraphs (once in paragraph six, again in the finale), a paraphrase loop that blunts urgency. "Hushed, holy, and finally, finally seen" in the last line stacks modifiers and echoes prior phrasing. Sentence openings vary and no major template cadence appears, but the figurative load in high-pressure beats (projection scene) reduces propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—psychometry applied to film strips storing projectionist emotions—offers a fresh synthesis of medium and metaphor. "Spatially imaginative farewells" living "in the gaps…between frames" is a non-obvious angle on ghostly messages. The emotional truth (unexpressed love needing witness) avoids sentimentality through concrete anchoring (film booth, sprocket holes, twenty-four frames per second). The piece commits fully to its logic and follows through to the projection as release. Risk: the lyric voice and patient accumulation could read as static, but the escalation holds and the ending reweights prior material without gimmick.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Marina is present throughout and her decision to project the films (final third) alters the outcome, but her choices are largely observational until that point. Early beats involve touching strips and cataloguing—receptive actions that don't narrow options. The projection decision emerges from understanding rather than conflicting pressures, so agency reads more as realization than dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Film strips appear in paragraph three (early setup), are handled across multiple beats (touching, cataloguing, spreading on floor), and are threaded into the projector at closure, enabling the release. Their specific properties (sprocket holes, frames, celluloid texture) matter—Marina's psychometry requires physical contact, and projection requires threading. Removing film strips would require a complete reconception of method and setting.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Goodbye letters are introduced in paragraph three, shape Marina's cataloguing work across the middle (sailor's thoughts, mother's ache), and are explicitly projected at closure ("decades of goodbye letters finally delivered"). The concept defines her dominant stake (releasing them) and the mechanics of closure (projection makes them visible). The letters are irreplaceable to the story's logic and emotional payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Spatially imaginative" appears once in paragraph four as a descriptor for farewells existing "in the gaps…between frames." It frames the concept but doesn't constrain an on-page action or create a visible trade-off—Marina doesn't choose between spatial and temporal methods, for instance. The attribute enriches theme more than it drives tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Incubate" is signaled in paragraph two ("incubate in the dark like seeds") and returns in paragraph six when Marina realizes "the unused love wasn't trapped—it was incubating." This realization shifts her goal from finding to releasing, altering her tactic (from cataloguing to projecting). The action is central to escalation and closure; swapping "incubate" for "hiding" or "waiting" would weaken the organic growth metaphor that justifies the release.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Psychometry is named and demonstrated in paragraph one ("touch an object and feel the phantom weight"), mechanics shown in paragraph three (pressing celluloid to palms, images flooding through), and executed in the climax (touching all strips at once, conducting love through her hands into projection). The method is signaled early, shapes her nightly attempts, and enables closure. Removing psychometry would eliminate the causal mechanism for both discovery and release.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The projection booth is established in paragraph one, provides the necessary tools (film strips, projector), and its spatial relationship to the theater below enables the closure (light splashing onto empty seats). The booth's contents constrain Marina's method (she can only read what's stored there) and the projector becomes the release mechanism. Micro-setting (booth floor as "map of longing") shapes the forty-seventh night's tactic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"While forgotten lyrics search for tune" appears in paragraph five as a descriptor of the emotional timeframe (suspended longing) and implicitly frames the entire vigil—Marina works in that liminal state. It's more a thematic anchor than a ticking clock; there's no urgency or deadline pressing her choices. The phrase recurs conceptually at closure (love "speaking itself") but doesn't tighten tactics the way a countdown would.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Marina's motivation ("to find where unused love is stored") is stated in paragraph two, dramatized through her nightly cataloguing (paragraphs three–six), and shifts in paragraph six when she realizes it needs releasing, not just finding. This shift drives the climax decision (projection). Friction exists between the contemplative search and the final active role (keeper/translator), creating a visible cost (she can't remain a passive observer).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" is named in paragraph seven ("like hushed thunder—not loud but absolute") and echoed in the final line ("everything was hushed, holy"). The tone is coherent throughout—quiet intensity, reverent accumulation—and modulates appropriately (calmer in early cataloguing, heightened at projection without becoming loud). The phrase charges the final image by framing the projection's emotional register: powerful but contained, matching the story's accumulative lens.</comment>
