<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's goal (stop the tricksters' manipulation) is clear and her preparation sequence shows agency, but her interior life reads more functional than contradictory. The "cautiously hopeful" label appears without embodied tension—we're told she's hopeful but never see competing impulses (fear of failure, doubt about the math) act simultaneously in scene. The climax choice to initiate the sequence feels inevitable rather than a charged fork with visible cost; no path is foreclosed because no alternative was dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (Mara, basement studio, "tonight"). Drive lens reads as Causal: her modifications → subsonic interference → tricksters retreat. Closure lands on-page with the signals stopping and factions regaining clarity, delivering a Decisive Change. Cost is present but muted—"won this round" tells us the victory is temporary, yet no specific tactical or relational price is shown in the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs when she initiates the sequence and the air thickens, narrowing options cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The basement studio supplies vivid anchors (dust, ozone, astronomical charts, transmission array) and the oscilloscope/subsonic generator constrain her tactical choice at closure. Spatial choreography is clean. The charts are handled twice (annotations, trembling on walls) and charge the final documentation beat, satisfying the micro-setting standard. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency appropriately when the lights flicker with impossible colors during peak pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stop the manipulation before the community fractures further) is signaled early and pressure tightens when chanting resumes outside. The sequence initiation is a clear reversal that narrows options—once she starts, she risks amplifying the tricksters' power. Cost is legible ("won this round" implies ongoing battle and equipment risk was mentioned), but the resolution feels clean rather than forcing a visible trade-off. One meaningful escalation is present and causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (manipulation bypassing conscious thought, the seduction of certainty) emerges from events rather than statement. The final image of "campus slowly remembering how to think for itself" gestures at resonance but leans slightly editorial—"remembering" is an abstraction rather than a concrete action. The tricksters-as-cosmic-disruptors concept integrates with plot, yet the piece stops short of a non-literal answer; the victory is literal, and moral complexity (Mara's unilateral action, the ethics of counter-manipulation) is acknowledged but not dramatized with conflicting pulls.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara; perceptual signature is consistent (scientific framing, cautious interpretation). Diction matches her expertise without register drift. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext tests are waived. The phrase "cosmic tricksters, she called them privately, entities that seemed to delight in humanity's confusion" reads slightly expository but remains voice-coherent. Psychic distance is controlled and purposeful throughout, tightening appropriately during the climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is steady. Minor template cadence appears in the opening (list of signal effects: "rhythms that felt almost conversational... vibrations that made her teeth ache and her vision blur") but does not obscure causality. Information density is high; most lines advance multiple jobs. One paraphrase loop: "The effect was immediate and strange: the air seemed to thicken, gaining texture" restates without added pressure, triggering −0.2. No figurative muddle in peak beats; the oscilloscope waveforms and constructive interference carry technical clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cosmic-signal-manipulation premise echoes well-worn "alien influence" templates, but the subsonic-interference countermeasure and the framing of tricksters (playful rather than hostile) offer a modest inflection. The university-radio-station setting and celestial-signal-interpreter role are specific enough to avoid placeholder generality. Emotional arc and plot would largely survive transposition to a different manipulation vector, indicating mid-band originality. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (celestial signal interpreter) is on-page throughout and her professional expertise shapes every beat: noticing the subsonic patterns, cross-referencing data, modifying the array, and initiating the sequence. Her role is irreplaceable—her unique position and knowledge drive all key turns. Present in setup (introduced line one), development (preparation and calculation), and payoff (initiates sequence, wins). Two distinct beats minimum (preparation, climax); causal pressure is strong. Closure linkage is direct. Scores in high 7s for essential multi-beat involvement with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Astronomical charts appear three times: initial description (walls lined), new annotations tracking correlations (workstation), and trembling during climax. They supply crucial data for her calculations ("Jupiter's position aligned with the broadcast tower's orientation") and she marks the victory on them in the final paragraph. Present in setup, development (enables her plan), and payoff (documentation gesture). Two distinct beats; causal pressure moderate (data source, not active constraint). Closure linkage present but lyric rather than decisive. Scores mid-6s for purposeful early-final reprise with cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Power plays (core concept) manifests on-page as the tricksters' manipulation and the factional rallies (Kowalski, Chen, armbands). Mara's counter-move is itself a power play fought in frequencies. The concept shapes stakes (community fracturing) and her tactic (interference to cancel influence). Present in setup (factions described), development (her plan targets the manipulation), payoff (victory). One major beat (climax) where it changes options; earlier presence is atmospheric. Scores mid-5s for shaping one key turn with modest cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" appears once as a label ("Mara was cautiously hopeful that her plan would work") without constraining an on-page choice. The caution is told, not shown through competing impulses or a visible trade-off. Setup present (midpoint mention), but no development beat where the trait alters tactics, and no payoff integration. One ornamental mention; no cost connection. Caps at 4.6 for missing middle development; scores low-4s for label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interfere (action) is the story's spine: her plan is to generate interference patterns, the climax dramatizes the subsonic generator creating constructive interference, and the resolution hinges on disruption succeeding. Present in setup (plan described), development (calculations and equipment prep), payoff (initiation and effect). Three beats; high causal pressure and irreplaceability. Removing this action breaks the plot. Scores low-8s for essential multi-beat involvement with closure linkage and cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies are signaled early (she noticed them three months ago), form her tactical method (modifying the array to generate interference), and drive the climax beat (generator hums, waveforms merge, disruption occurs). Present in setup (first mention of subsonic beneath transmissions), development (her modification plans), payoff (generator sequence). Two distinct beats; high specificity (the mechanics of frequency interference matter to causality). Scores mid-7s for essential method with closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>University radio station (setting) is anchored immediately and supplies key resources: the basement studio houses her work, the transmission array is modified for her plan, and broadcast range matters ("half-mile radius" vs. Jupiter-amplified reach). Present in setup (opening lines), development (array modification), payoff (transmission succeeds). Two beats; the setting enables her tactics and constrains scope. Scores high-6s for micro-setting that alters tactical choices with cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Community divides (timeframe) establishes urgency and backstory (three months of escalation, yesterday's telescope sabotage, tonight's rallies) but does not function as a live ticking clock that alters Mara's moves. The chanting outside bookends the sequence but she proceeds at her own pace. Present in setup (factions described), modest development (chanting creates atmosphere), payoff (chanting stops). One beat where it creates pressure; no visible cost tied to timeline. Scores mid-5s for shaping atmosphere and one turn.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Outwit cosmic tricksters (motivation) is dramatized on-page: Mara calls them tricksters privately, prepares her counter-move, and the climax shows her frequencies "disrupting their power plays" with the tricksters reacting ("anger, or perhaps surprise"). Present in setup (her theory), development (preparation), payoff (battle and victory). Two beats; desire is shown through tactical choice and risk. Friction between want (stop them) and cost (equipment damage, amplification risk) is mentioned but not deeply felt. Scores mid-6s for essential motivation with modest cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Ethereal grit (tone) is coherent: the scientific rigor (calculations, oscilloscope) grounds the cosmic strangeness (impossible colors, air texture, signals that writhe). Tone modulates appropriately—technical detail in preparation, sensory surrealism during climax, cautious clarity at resolution. Present throughout; supports pressure and charges the final image ("dawn broke over a campus slowly remembering"). No single static mood; the duality between empirical method and otherworldly threat holds. Scores low-6s for coherent tone that charges closure without forced effects.</comment>
