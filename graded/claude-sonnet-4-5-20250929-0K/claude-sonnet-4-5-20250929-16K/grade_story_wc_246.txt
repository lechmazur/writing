<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is concrete and her discovery of the pen's properties drives her to revise interpretations with visible consequence. The reflection-heavy middle section avoids label-speak and anchors in the pen and console work. However, her motivational arc lacks contradiction—she moves smoothly from guilt to "strange comfort" without dramatized internal friction. The settlers' polite gratitude is told rather than shown in a scene that would reveal her embodied reaction under immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure operates as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights her earlier "mistake" into contingent multiplicity, and the cost is conceptual—she relinquishes singular certainty. The piece teaches its pattern early (bent light, quantum superposition) and pays it off when she sends seven versions and the settlers adapt. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers relational interpretation. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The causal chain from pen discovery to signal revision to settler response reads cleanly under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly functions as micro-setting, constraining her work and enabling the pen's resonance effect. The bent starlight and warped space are filtered through Vera's professional lens. The console, pen, and viewport recur purposefully. However, the station's interior lacks tactile grounding—no mention of temperature, sound, or the physical effort of weeks alone—and the Meridian colony remains abstract. The exotic nib's "split crescent moon" shape charges the final image by echoing the double truths theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: redeeming her mistranslation and learning to interpret correctly. One meaningful tightening: when she discovers relational chains, her approach shifts from isolated readings to contingent webs, narrowing her method and raising interpretive cost. The settlers' response provides on-page consequence. Agency is decision and endurance—she chooses to send all seven versions rather than hedging. The cost is visible: she forfeits certainty and the comfort of singular truth. No antagonist is required; the anomaly and her own prior failure supply pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—truth as multiplicity, meaning as relational—emerges from the pen's double nib, quantum superposition imagery, and her shift from isolation to connection. The final paragraph offers a resonant answer without moralizing: she writes nothing yet revises everything. "Confidently uncertain" moves from opening label to earned stance. The seven Meridians and their contingent futures avoid neat resolution. Minor slip: "unbend reality's rigid spine" and "unbend her thinking" repeat the metaphor overtly, nudging toward stated theme rather than letting the image carry it fully.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, voice modulates with discovery. Diction is controlled: "thresh meaning," "divining rod through probability." The perceptual signature—scientific yet open to strangeness—remains consistent. Two minor slips: "confidently uncertain" appears three times as a label rather than being dramatized through contradictory impulses in a single beat, and "strange comfort" (opening and near-end) feels like a thematic placeholder rather than an embodied sensation. No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("she'd grown to find," "she understood now") are voice-motivated and fit reflective mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language serves purpose. Information density is high in the pen-discovery and signal-revision beats. Two clusters of artifacts lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loop in paragraph 8—"She began to unbend her thinking" immediately follows "unbend reality's rigid spine," restating the concept. (2) Template cadence in paragraphs 10–11: "In one... In another... In a third..." runs three identical stems without tension. The final paragraph stacks "strange comfort," "confidently uncertain," and "dried-up fountain pen wrote nothing, yet... revised everything" as thematic summaries rather than images under pressure. No filter-verb stacks or egregious opacity, so penalty remains moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The quantum-interpretation premise is familiar from recent genre work, but the pen as reality-editing tool and the seven contingent Meridians offer a fresh synthesis. The transformation of "wrong seeds" into "never wrong, simply singular" is non-obvious and earned through her relational discovery. Voice and concept cohere. Frictions: "confidently uncertain" and "strange comfort" repeat as thematic labels rather than being transformed through action, and the settlers' acceptance arrives off-page, soft-pedaling the interpersonal risk. The piece commits to its premise but retreats from dramatizing the human stakes directly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vera interprets signals, discovers the pen's effect, revises her readings, and sends contingent histories—choices that create all major turns. Present in setup (opening), development (pen use, relational discovery), and payoff (final paragraph stance). Her interpretation work is causal across three beats and shapes closure. Swappability is low; the role's specificity (signal interpreter at an anomaly) is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The pen appears in three beats: discovery in effects box, touching it to the console to shift signals, and resting on the console in the final image. Its double nib's exotic-metal resonance enables the editing action and its physical form (split crescent) charges the thematic doubling. Causal pressure is strong; closure participation is imagistic. Slight deduction: the pen is "dried-up" yet writes nothing—this property is ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Editing history" is dramatized when she touches nib to screen and characters rearrange, creating alternate readings. The concept shapes her tactics (sending seven versions) and the settlers' adaptation. Present in setup (quantum superposition framing), development (unbending reality), and payoff (revised everything). Mid-band because the editing is more interpretive revision than literal history change—swappable with "reinterpreting data" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" appears as a label in the opening and closing and is restated near the end ("that was exactly right"). It enables her to send multiple versions rather than hedging, a visible choice. However, it lacks on-page cost—no moment where her uncertainty causes a setback or forces a tradeoff. The trait is told more than embodied in contradictory action within a beat. Missing middle development weakens integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Unbend" recurs: unbending light (opening), unbending reality's spine (pen discovery), unbending her thinking (relational shift). It frames her method and appears in the final image metaphor. However, the action itself is abstract—she doesn't perform a physical unbending. The trait is more thematic resonance than a plot-driving verb. Early signal and closure participation earn mid-band; swappability (could be "reframe" or "refract") and lack of direct causal pressure prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Through contingent relationships" is signaled early (star brightness needs distance, age, medium) and governs her discovery in the middle: atmospheric readings relate to moon orbit, solar wind, galactic position. The method shapes her revised interpretations (seven Meridians weighted by conditional branches). Present in setup (incomplete readings), development (chains of connection), and payoff (settlers exploring simultaneous futures). Strong causal role; the method is irreplaceable and specific.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly at Point Lacuna bends light, warps signals, resonates with the pen's exotic metal, and holds quantum superposition—enabling the core plot. Present in setup (opening lines), development (pen interaction), and closure (humming around her station). It constrains her work and supplies the mechanism for editing. Mid-high band: the anomaly is essential but largely atmospheric; the story could function with "quantum data cloud" with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After planting the wrong seeds" anchors the inciting guilt and two-thousand-settler consequence. Present in setup (paragraph 2) and referenced at closure (reweighting the "mistake"). However, the timeframe itself does not tighten tactics—weeks pass vaguely ("spent weeks"), no clock pressures her choices, and the settlers' response arrives off-page. The element provides emotional context but does not drive escalation. Missing middle pressure and swappable with "after the error."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To thresh meaning from experience" is stated in paragraph 7 and enacted when she learns relational interpretation. The desire drives her to revise signals and send contingent histories. Present in development and implicit in closure. However, the motivation is more intellectual than conflicted—she never wrestles with a competing desire (e.g., career safety vs. truth). Told more than dramatized in a choice with visible friction. Lacks setup signal and strong cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Strange comfort" appears in the opening ("oddly soothing" distortion), mid-story ("strange comfort of uncertainty"), and closure ("gravitational anomaly's strange comfort"). Tone coheres: bent space, quantum ambiguity, and gentle reflection modulate consistently without static uniformity. The oxymoron charges the final stance. Slight deduction: the phrase is repeated as a label rather than modulating through embodied sensory shifts, and the tone remains uniformly contemplative without a pressure spike that tests the comfort.</comment>
