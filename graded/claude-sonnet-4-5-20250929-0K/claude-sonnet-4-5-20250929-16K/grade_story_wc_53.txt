<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kera's interiority shows embodied contradiction—she collects others' stories to avoid her own—and her ghost functions as externalized conscience. The final choice to extend her hand and begin modest gardens is earned by the camera wheel progression. However, the progression feels somewhat mechanical; the emotional shift from paralysis to action lacks sufficient intermediate micro-choices that would make the renunciation of grand ambitions viscerally costly rather than philosophically resolved.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds. The piece opens with disorientation ("three days ago, or perhaps three years") that's pattern-taught and charges the temporal confusion; by closure the camera wheel's clicks provide concrete temporal progression that reweights the opening's drift. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + nascent agency): Kera acknowledges loss, pockets the wheel, extends her hand toward modest achievable work. Cost is legible in "Small gardens, perhaps. Modest platforms" after the grand floating-garden ambition is explicitly named and mourned. One tightening deepening occurs when the ghost's invitation replaces accusation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon supplies the dominant image and its perpetual motion contrasts Kera's stillness, charging the final acceptance. The camera wheel (micro-object-as-setting) appears, is handled across beats, and the click mechanism becomes the vehicle for forward motion. Spatial grounding is present (lagoon edge, floating stones, twenty-foot distance to ghost) but the cloudline setting remains somewhat abstract; it pressures mood more than tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Kera can move past paralysis and reclaim agency—is signaled early and tightens when the camera wheel offers a concrete mechanism for progression. The ghost's gesture shifts from silent accusation to invitation, narrowing options toward reconciliation. Visible cost: abandoning the grand vision for "something achievable in the time she had left." The escalation is more contemplative than causal, fitting the accumulative lens, but the final trade-off (ambition for modest action) carries weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of eroded ambitions and the paralysis of perfectionism emerges through concrete particulars: the stopped carousel, collected story-shards, half-complete grant application. The camera wheel's progression offers a non-literal answer to "how does one begin again after stopping?" The final image—blueprints "eroded but still legible" reflected in spinning waters—reweights prior material without moralizing. One deduction: "I collected their stories because I couldn't bear my own" edges toward explicit theme statement, though it's character-voiced rather than authorial.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Kera notices through an architect's eye (blueprints, foundations, irrigation systems) and a scavenger's habit (fragments, shards, discarded whispers). Psychic distance is stable; the temporal confusion is POV-consistent rather than authorial confusion. The ghost dialogue is minimal but purposeful. Minor slip: "Regret tasted like copper and cloud-water" is vivid but the pairing feels slightly forced. Diction remains controlled and specific throughout, with rhythm modulating effectively at the camera-wheel discovery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "She'd been trying to negotiate, to explain, but how did one justify the slow abandonment of everything one had meant to become?" advances character, stake, and tone). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, tightening at key beats. One pattern artifact: "perhaps" recurs as a hedge across multiple paragraphs without clear escalation of its meaning. The opening's temporal slippage ("three days ago, or perhaps three years") is pattern-taught and pays off, so no penalty there. Minor filter-verb use ("saw," "felt") is voice-consistent and doesn't dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ghost-as-past-self and camera-wheel-as-progression are fresh inflections on the "confronting regret" template. The kinetic lagoon suspended above clouds offers a memorable frame. However, the core arc—paralyzed artist rediscovers modest ambition—is a familiar trajectory, and the resolution (hand extended, small gardens) feels slightly predictable once the ghost appears. The story's strength is in execution and voice rather than a transformed premise. Risk-taking is moderate; the temporal confusion and story-fragment method add texture but don't fundamentally alter the emotional arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kera's scavenger role frames her method (collecting story-fragments) and her avoidance, but her key turn—extending her hand, pocketing the wheel, choosing modest work—stems more from the ghost encounter and camera wheel than from scavenging choices. The attribute appears early and recurs but doesn't constrain a middle beat with visible cost. Present in closure (reflected blueprints), but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Camera wheel introduced at the second beat ("fourth morning, or the second evening"), handled physically (turned in palm, clicks counted), used as progression metaphor, and pocketed at closure. It enables the tactic of "clicking forward" and charges the final choice. Not indispensable—another small mechanism could serve—but its disposable-camera origin (frames advancing) is specific and its clicks are dramatized across beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eroded ambitions shape every beat: the stopped carousel, the architect-turned-scavenger identity, the half-complete grant application, the floating gardens detailed then abandoned, and the final acceptance of "small gardens, perhaps. Modest platforms." This concept drives stakes (can she begin again?) and the closure repricing (grand vision → achievable scope). Visible throughout; the entire conflict hinges on it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Chronological confusion appears early ("three days ago, or perhaps three years") and recurs ("fourth morning, or the second evening"). It externalizes Kera's paralysis and is pattern-taught. However, it doesn't constrain a specific middle choice with cost; it's more atmospheric trait than tactical limiter. At closure the camera wheel's clicks restore sequential time, so the trait is reweighted but not causally pivotal to a turn.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Regret is the dominant emotional driver: "Regret tasted like copper and cloud-water," the memory of the first "no instead of yes," the skipped meeting, abandoned application. It's embodied, recurs, and directly motivates the ghost negotiation and the final acceptance of loss. The closure turn traces to acknowledging regret ("I know what we lost") and choosing forward motion despite it. Not easily swappable; the entire arc is built on working through this emotion.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story-fragment collection is named early ("she collected what others discarded: whispers…fragments of conversations"), appears in the middle ("You were supposed to build the floating gardens," a fragment whispered), and is acknowledged at closure ("I collected their stories because I couldn't bear my own"). It explains her avoidance tactic but doesn't mechanically shape a turn; she doesn't collect a fragment that changes her choice. Present across beats but more thematic than causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon frames every beat, supplies the dominant image, and its perpetual motion contrasts Kera's stillness. At closure blueprints reflect in its waters, and "the lagoon still turns" becomes the warrant for starting again. It pressures mood and provides the recurring motif but doesn't supply a tactical constraint (e.g., weather shift forcing a choice). Indispensable to tone and final image, less so to action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The halted carousel is the inciting condition, signaled in the opening line and returned at closure ("The carousel stopped…but the lagoon still turns"). It establishes the before/after and frames the dominant question (how to move forward after stopping). However, it's more symbolic anchor than live ticking clock; no on-page decision is forced by temporal pressure. Present at setup and closure, light middle involvement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ghost negotiation is the overt goal: "She'd been trying to negotiate, to explain" and drives the final beat where Kera extends her hand and the ghost's fingers touch hers. The desire is dramatized (repeated attempts, the twenty-foot distance, the shift from accusation to invitation) and the friction is clear (justifying abandonment vs. accepting loss). The ghost is on the page across beats and the closure hinges on this contact. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fractured stillness coheres throughout: temporal slippage, the lagoon's motion vs. Kera's paralysis, the ghost's silent watching, the collected fragments. Tone modulates subtly (tightens when the camera wheel appears, softens at the final hand-extension) and charges the ending image ("The fractured stillness held them both"). It's consistent, purposeful, and integral to the atmosphere that makes the modest-gardens choice feel earned rather than triumphant.</comment>
