<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus is given clear motivation (restoring the household's voice after Emma's death) and his actions are embodied—yanking cords, conducting with sweeps, humming lullabies. Internal contradiction surfaces in "mournfully eager," which colors his resolve. The family members' responses (mother smiling, brother speaking) show change earned by Marcus's persistent effort. Minor slip: the brother's first words feel slightly on-the-nose thematically, nudging toward articulation rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: Marcus, tunnel, post-Emma's-death. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—mechanical sound layers into lullaby fragments, building toward a decisive deepening when the brother speaks and touches Emma's things. Closure lands on-page with visible cost (the household's calcified silence cracks) and Marcus plans tomorrow's performance, signaling ongoing price. One micro-ambiguity: the hourglass metaphor in the opening is poetic but slightly oblique as a time anchor; it resolves contextually but costs a beat of initial clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel is specified early with acoustic properties that constrain Marcus's method (limestone bends sound). Autumn leaves, ventilation grates, and the estate's honeycomb pathways all serve the plan. The pull cord, leaf blowers, and tunnel walls recur with functional pressure. Spatial choreography is clean across three locations (tunnel, kitchen, brother's bedroom). Minor cap: while the tunnel enables the action, its specific limestone texture doesn't visibly constrain a mid-scene choice or alter Marcus's tactics under stress—it facilitates rather than restricts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore household voice) is clear from the start. Marcus's action—conducting leaf blowers and lullabies—tightens when the sound reaches the family and the brother finally speaks, a meaningful deepening with visible cost (grief acknowledged, no longer frozen). The escalation is gentle but real: silence → strange sound → tears → first words. One hairline slip: no on-page obstacle or resistance tests Marcus's resolve mid-symphony; the pressure accumulates texturally rather than through antagonistic friction, which fits the lens but leaves stakes feeling slightly unopposed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (tending to the unspoken, grief finding voice through oblique beauty) emerges from concrete particulars: mechanical wind, macerated leaves, half-sung lullabies. The final image—Marcus gripping the pull cord "like a talisman" and planning tomorrow—offers a resonant answer without moralizing: healing is iterative, wild, and strange. The brother's line "sounded like her" bridges memory and present without stating a thesis. Slight over-articulation in the closing phrase "mournful hope" and "love letter written in wind"—these edge toward thematic summary but remain tied to prior images.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds steady on Marcus with controlled distance. Perceptual signature is present: "mournfully eager," "symphony of leaf blowers," "talisman." Voice modulates appropriately—reflective in setup, kinetic during the performance. Brief family POV shifts (mother, brother) are clean section breaks with no head-hopping. Two slips: "something otherworldly, something that could reach into the house above and curl around the hearts of those within" verges on over-metaphor for Marcus's practical mindset, and the phrase "via the strangest music ever conceived" in the final line reads slightly authorial rather than Marcus-filtered.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. No major loops or template cadence. Clarity holds across beats. Two distinct artifacts: "something else—an off-key wind" / "something else: a kind of wild joy" repeats the "something else" construction within close proximity, creating mild synonym churn. The closing sentence stacks three abstract nouns ("wind and leaves and impossible, mournful hope") where one concrete image would land harder. Figurative density ("curl around the hearts," "calcified into silence") is elevated but remains legible; no mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The leaf-blower symphony premise is fresh and specific, avoiding stock grief-recovery templates. Marcus's occupation (groundskeeper) and the tunnel's acoustics combine organically. The brother's first words and the mother's smile feel earned rather than generic closure beats. Risk-taking is present but modest: the method is unusual, yet the emotional arc (silent grief → small breakthrough) follows a familiar shape. The transformation test passes—swap tunnel for another setting and the mechanics fail—but the final reconfiguration ("beginning, a crack in the silence") leans slightly toward predictable hope-after-loss language.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus ("leaf blower symphony conductor") drives all key turns: yanking the cord, conducting the machines, humming lullabies, and planning tomorrow's performance. His agency shapes setup, middle escalation, and closure participation. High irreplaceability and causal pressure across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pull cord handle appears in the opening ("gripped… his fingers trembling"), recurs when Marcus starts each machine ("same ritual pull"), and returns charged in the final paragraph ("gripped… like a talisman"). Setup, middle ritual, and closure reprise hit all gates. However, the cord enables action rather than constraining a choice under pressure—its reweighting at the end is thematic (talisman = ongoing commitment) rather than plot-altering. Lyric-resonance allowance applies, but causal pressure remains modest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Tending to the unspoken" anchors the premise (household silence after Emma's death) and shapes Marcus's tactic (sound that "could reach into the house… and curl around the hearts"). The brother's line "I heard something" and the mother's inability to name her smile demonstrate unspoken-to-spoken movement. Setup and closure gates clear; middle development is implicit in the sound's travel. Cost is visible (grief acknowledged), but the concept functions more as framing stake than as a constraint that narrows tactical options mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Mournfully eager" appears once in the opening ("desperate to begin, yet weighted with the sorrow of why he must") and colors Marcus's entire performance—no pause or retreat despite grief. The trait enables the action (he proceeds) and constrains it (the sorrow charges his method). Setup clear; the attribute persists implicitly through the performance and closure. However, no single mid-scene beat dramatizes a choice where eagerness and mourning pull in opposite directions with visible tradeoff. Label is well-embodied but not tested under friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Macerate" (leaves broken against walls) is signaled early and provides percussion to the symphony ("crackle and whisper, fragment and dust"). Setup and middle gates clear. However, the macerating action is descriptive texture rather than a pivot—removing it would thin the sensory layer but wouldn't alter Marcus's tactic or the family's response. Swappable with "scatter" or "swirl" without major structural cost. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" is signaled early (tunnel acoustics, mechanical screams transformed) and executed in the middle beat: Marcus hums, sings "fragments of lullabies," merges them with mechanical wind. The method shapes the brother's reaction ("sounded like her") and charges the closure (Marcus plans "tomorrow's performance"). Setup, middle mechanics, and closure payoff all present. Cost is implicit (effort, ongoing need). The method is specific and irreplaceable—no other sound would evoke Emma's laughter.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "echo chamber tunnel" is introduced immediately with acoustic properties ("bent sound into something otherworldly") that enable Marcus's entire plan. It constrains his method (must work below, sound travels up through grates) and provides resources (limestone walls vibrate, ventilation pathways carry sound). Setup, middle (machines fill the tunnel), and closure (Marcus packs equipment, hears family through grates) all hinge on this exact setting. High irreplaceability and causal necessity across all three beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the final grain slips through the hourglass" (Emma's death three months prior) anchors the backstory and motivates Marcus's urgency, but the timeframe itself doesn't tighten present tactics. The one-hour performance duration is noted but not tracked as a constraint—no clock pressure alters Marcus's choices mid-scene. Setup gate (context) clear; middle and closure gates weak. The three-month gap and "first words in weeks" mark duration but don't impose cost or narrow options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To restore lost laughter to a household" is dramatized early (household "calcified into silence," Marcus remembers Emma's laughter echoing) and drives every beat: yanking the cord, conducting the symphony, hearing the family's voices at dinner. The mother's smile and brother's tears show progress toward the goal. Closure directly addresses the motivation ("Not laughter yet—that would take time… But it was a beginning"). Friction between want (restore joy) and cost (ongoing effort, grief acknowledged) is visible. Setup, middle pressure, and closure payoff all strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"True haunting" saturates the piece: Emma's death, the "haunted tunnel," silence as ghost presence, the family moving "like ghosts themselves," and Marcus's sound as spectral echo. Tone is consistent (somber, yearning, otherworldly) and modulates with the performance's intensity—mechanical roar to "moaned and sang" to the final quiet planning. The brother in Emma's room, touching her things with wet face, charges the ending image with haunting presence. Coherence across turns and strong closure participation; the tone shapes rather than decorates.</comment>
