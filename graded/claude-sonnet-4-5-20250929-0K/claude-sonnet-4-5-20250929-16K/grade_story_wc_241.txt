<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout, especially when parsing her father's notebooks ("messages carved by a prisoner who was simultaneously his own jailer"). The internal contradiction—theoretical rebellion versus avoidance of confrontation—acts simultaneously in scene and drives her syllabus choice. The final decision to work equations together is earned by prior causality with visible cost (accepting he won't change, but choosing connection anyway). Minor: the father remains somewhat abstract; his post-stroke state is told more than shown, limiting relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Mira, library reference desk, post-heart-attack weeks) land cleanly by the second paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira crystallizes her teaching stance and accepts working with her father through uncertainty, foreclosing the path of theoretical distance. The cost is felt—she steps into the contradiction she once avoided. One meaningful deepening occurs when she interprets the notebooks and realizes knowledge and behavior diverge; this reweights the dominant stake (understanding her father and herself). Lens holds; cadence shifts at the end with the syllabus and the visit decision.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rain-on-skylights, watercolor windows, and clover-with-raindrops motifs charge the final image and frame Mira's shifting stance. The candle lantern's mica pane and the library's unmowed lawn provide micro-setting that modulates emotional beats without heavy exposition. Spatial choreography (desk, windows, lawn, phone) remains coherent. The rainwashed clarity directly mirrors the thematic shift toward acceptance. Professional detail (reference desk, campus office clearance) is purposeful and proportionate. Gate satisfied: environment charges the final image ("world remade and temporary after rain").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding the father's lucid contradiction and finding a responsible way to teach probability. Pressure tightens once: interpreting the notebooks reveals "Expected Feeling of Aliveness: Incalculable," which narrows Mira's options from theoretical rebellion to accepting the gap between knowledge and behavior. Agency is decision and stance crystallization: drafting the syllabus and choosing to visit with the notebooks. The cost is visible—she foregoes her former theoretical distance and steps into the uncertainty she criticized. No requirement for multiple reversals at this length; the deepening is earned and coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (lucid contradictions, knowledge vs. behavior) emerges entirely through particulars: the notebooks' equations paired with emotion labels, the syllabus draft, the father's simultaneous brilliance and casino visits. The final image—working equations together as "calculating the odds of recovery, of redemption, of learning to live responsibly with uncertainty"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the candle lantern (inadequate for reading, perfect for thinking), the clover holding raindrops before evaporation, and the phrase "what needed saving." No thematic echo or prompt-language intrusion. The piece embraces complexity: mathematics won't save them, but might help them understand.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled. Mira's perceptual signature—probabilistic metaphors, attention to ephemeral beauty, wariness of her father's contradictions—is consistent and specific. Diction stays within her lexicon (graduate-student intellectual without jargon overload). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during notebook interpretation, slightly wider during the ending's forward motion. Rhythm and syntax reflect her thoughtful, cautious mind. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Minor: a few phrases approach stock lyricism ("watercolor abstraction," "world remade"), but voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Sentence openings vary naturally, and rhythm modulates with emotional beats (short, decisive at the syllabus; longer, contemplative at the ending). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful (mica pane, clover as prisms, "prisoner/jailer"). Minor: "living contradiction so lucid it hurt to contemplate" edges toward telling; "traversing the notebooks" and "traversing the same territories" repeat the verb within close proximity. Clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of probability theory, compulsive gambling, and filial reconciliation through a posthumous-style notebook reading is specific and non-obvious. The syllabus entries ("Week Four: When Knowing Doesn't Change Behavior") and the notebook annotations ("Expected Feeling of Aliveness: Incalculable") feel earned and particular to this story. The transformation test passes: plot and arc rely on these exact details. Risk-taking is moderate—conventional structure, elevated literary register—but the emotional and intellectual specificity elevate it above template memoir-of-contradiction. No close echoes of famous lines; the final image is fresh without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's status as the professor's daughter drives her discovery of the notebooks, frames her theoretical rebellion, and motivates the syllabus draft. Her choices—interpreting the scrawls, drafting the course, agreeing to visit with the notebooks—create key turns. The element is signaled early, causally active in the middle (notebook interpretation), and present at closure (visiting to work equations together). Strong causal pressure and beat involvement; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The candle lantern appears in three beats: initial description on the desk, lighting it during reflection, and closing it before leaving. It charges one moment ("inadequate for reading but perfect for thinking") but does not constrain a choice or decisively shape the ending. The mica pane is evocative but could be replaced with another relic without breaking story logic. Functional reprise with reweighted atmosphere, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Lucid contradictions" shapes the dominant stake (understanding the father's simultaneous knowledge and behavior) and drives Mira's tactics (parsing notebooks, drafting syllabus with contradictions as content). The concept is dramatized on the page—notebook entries pair equations with emotions, and Mira's own contradiction (theoretical rebellion, avoidance of confrontation) mirrors her father's. It directly enables the closure choice (accepting the contradiction, working through it together). Signaled early, causally active, and indispensable to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Theoretically rebellious" is established in the fourth paragraph and constrains one action with visible cost: Mira's realization that she "never been brave enough to confront the real contradiction." This recognition drives her syllabus approach (teaching contradictions responsibly). The trait appears early, informs her stance, and connects to closure, but its causal role is somewhat indirect—more background coloring than active pressure. Lyric seed-to-reprise model; modest causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Traverse" (used for both "traversing the notebooks" and the father "traversing the same territories") is the central action. Mira's week of interpreting the scrawls during lunch breaks is the key middle beat that narrows her understanding and reweights the stake. The father's request to "show her something about conditional probability" at the end mirrors the action and enables the closure decision. The verb is repeated purposefully and drives the structure; removing it would collapse the logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The notebooks contain "equations sprawled across pages like graffiti on subway seats," but the "cryptic scrawls on subway seats" is a simile, not a method Mira uses. She interprets scrawls *in notebooks*, cross-referencing with betting records. The subway-seat comparison is ornamental, mentioned once without shaping her tactics. The actual method (notebook + betting-record interpretation) is present and functional, but the required phrasing does not match the on-page mechanics. Scoring the simile as presented: decorative mention only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The library (reference desk, skylights, tall windows, unmowed lawn) anchors all action and supplies the rain motif that pressures Mira's mood and thinking. The setting's "clean-washed air" and clover-with-raindrops directly charge the final image. The candle on the desk enables the reflection beat. Early setup, middle atmospheric pressure, and closure participation. The "midsummer" and "rainwashed" specifics are irreplaceable; generic indoor setting would weaken thematic resonance. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The heart attack three weeks prior is the inciting event; clearing the office and discovering the notebooks stems from it. The father's current rehab state and his request for the notebooks at the end create the closure stakes ("odds of recovery, of redemption"). Time tightens decisions: Mira has spent "the past week" interpreting notebooks, and "tomorrow she would visit." The timeframe is signaled early, drives the middle action, and shapes the ending. Causal backbone; felt cost tied to the ongoing crisis.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The desire "to widen perspectives responsibly" is dramatized in the syllabus draft ("Week One: Calculating Odds and Admitting Uncertainty," "Week Four: When Knowing Doesn't Change Behavior") and tested against her own avoidance. The motivation generates friction: she wants to teach what her father couldn't, but must first accept the contradiction in herself. It drives the closure choice (visiting to work equations, accepting uncertainty). Early signal, middle action, and ending participation with visible cost. Strong causal role.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Clover melancholy" coheres across the piece: rain as "steady percussion," the "sad curve of recognition," the father's damaged neurons, and the final image of clover holding raindrops "before evaporation claimed it back." The tone modulates with pressure—contemplative at the desk, sharper during notebook parsing, gently resolved at the end—and charges the final image without tipping into sentimentality. The specific clover detail appears only at the end but reweights prior rain imagery. Consistent, purposeful, and integral to closure.</comment>
