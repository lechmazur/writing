<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Adelaide's internal conflict between protecting legacy and seeking truth is clearly motivated and embodied through concrete actions (hanging up, climbing stairs, studying photographs). The "proof by contradiction" method provides a distinctive intellectual texture to her decision-making. However, the epiphany moment ("I was protecting a dead man's reputation instead of seeking actual truth") arrives somewhat cleanly without the messy contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak beat. The final choice is earned but the path feels slightly too rational for the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the journalist's call triggers Adelaide's ascent and reflection, which leads to the decision to meet him, then the photo analysis, and finally the commitment to publish. The closure is a clear Decisive Change with visible cost (family credibility damaged, legacy mythology exposed). Orientation is clean early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Adelaide applies her contradiction method and realizes the premise is false, narrowing her options to either protect or correct. Cost is legible in "Legacy without truth is just mythology" and the decision to run the story, though the final star image dilutes slightly rather than sharpening the price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vivid and participatory: the dome amplifies her footfalls and voice, creating an "acoustic mirror of her inner chaos"; the height above clouds literalizes her retreat from consequence. The rosewood pen nib functions as both relic and evidence, handled twice with reweighted meaning. Spatial choreography is clean (spiral stairs, base meeting, desk). The observatory constrains her final choice by forcing her descent—"return to earth"—and the evening star in the final image charges the closure with the contrast between honest orbits and human lies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—correcting a historical injustice versus protecting family legacy—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Adelaide's contradiction method forces her to choose truth over mythology. The cost is made explicit: "That will damage your family's credibility." Agency is clear in her decision to publish. However, the escalation is primarily intellectual rather than situationally pressured; Marcus's evidence is persuasive but doesn't force a trade-off with visible on-page consequences beyond the stated reputational damage. The price is told more than felt in action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the orbit/truth/observation matrix without overt moralizing until the final lines. The "orbits of regret" concept recurs with purpose, reweighted from astronomical predictability to ethical imperative. Adelaide's proof-by-contradiction method transforms from academic exercise to moral tool, and the rosewood pen nib shifts from relic to evidence. The final star image—"following its ancient, honest orbit"—offers a resonant non-literal answer to the central question about truth versus mythology. Minor slip: "Legacy without truth is just mythology" edges toward explicit theme statement, though it's embedded in dialogue and fits Adelaide's philosophical training.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited throughout with a consistent intellectual register appropriate to Adelaide's background (philosophy, astronomy). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Marcus's warning and Adelaide's responses carry subtext about courage and institutional power. The perceptual signature is character-specific: Adelaide filters experience through celestial metaphors and logical structures. However, some diction in peak moments ("solemn meditation," "talisman," "acoustic mirror") elevates beyond the urgent present into a slightly literary remove. Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance character or plot. The opening anchors voice and stakes effectively. However, several prose patterns recur: "Adelaide + verb" sentence stems appear frequently, and some metaphoric density in the opening ("realm beyond consequence," "echoing dome," "orbits of regret") frontloads texture before pressure peaks. The phrase "devotedly observant" appears twice in similar constructions (lines about stars and photographs), creating minor synonym churn. "Solemn" appears three times in similar emotional contexts. No major loops, but the figurative load in reflective passages occasionally slows momentum before the confrontation with Marcus.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of astronomy, proof-by-contradiction, and journalistic ethics is specific and non-obvious, creating fresh connections between intellectual method and moral choice. The observatory setting as a place of retreat from consequence is well-realized. However, the core premise—heir must confront family legacy's dark truth—follows a recognizable template, and the transformation relies more on Adelaide's particular philosophical method than on lived emotional complexity. The "hidden above clouds, must descend to earth" structure is metaphorically tidy. The piece commits fully to its concept but doesn't take structural or perspectival risks beyond the intellectual-method frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Adelaide (newsprint heiress) is present from the opening, drives the central decision to publish the correction, and her specific inheritance (newsprint empire, grandfather's editorial legacy) creates the core conflict. Her choice to descend and meet Marcus, study the evidence, and commit to running the story are all key causal turns. The heiress status is not ornamental; it provides both the platform (control of the papers) and the cost (family credibility). She appears in setup, middle choice (applying contradiction method), and closure (committing to publish).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rosewood pen nib appears in three beats: discovery in the telescope case (backstory anchor), held "like a talisman" during the Marcus meeting, and pocketed "as evidence rather than relic" at the end. Its meaning shifts from inherited relic to proof of wrongdoing. However, it is handled passively—described and pocketed—rather than used in a way that alters tactics. It does not constrain a choice on the page; Adelaide's decision to publish is driven by the photographs and her logical method, not by the pen nib's presence. It participates in closure symbolically but is not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Orbits of regret" is explicitly named and surfaces in Adelaide's interior twice: once as "how guilt circles back endlessly unless interrupted by decisive action" and again when she recognizes her need to "break" the orbit by returning to earth. It shapes her understanding of her predicament and primes her decision to act. However, it functions primarily as a metaphoric frame rather than a concrete stake that alters tactics on the page. The concept is thematic rather than situational; removing it would weaken the texture but not break the plot logic (she could still choose truth over legacy without the orbit metaphor).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Devotedly observant" appears twice: Adelaide "devotedly observe[s] celestial bodies" in the opening and later studies the photographs "devotedly, observing details she'd never questioned before." The trait enables the key turn—her careful study of Chen's forensic analysis reveals "subtle inconsistencies" that convince her. It is shown in action (studying the photos) and constrains her choice by making her unable to ignore the evidence once she sees it. However, the trait is somewhat label-like in its repetition and could be replaced with "meticulous" or "careful" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Intervene" is explicitly named by Adelaide ("I need to intervene") at the pivotal turn when she commits to correcting the record rather than defending her grandfather. The action redefines her role from passive heir to active truth-teller and drives the final beats (calling Senator Marsh's daughter, committing the papers to the story). It is set up by her prior pattern of retreat (fleeing to the observatory) and paid off in the closure (descending, publishing). The intervention is specific to her institutional power (control of the papers) and not easily swappable; a different action would alter the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Proof by contradiction is named, explained, and applied on the page: "Start with the opposite of what you fear is true. If Grandfather was honorable, then..." Adelaide walks through the logical steps, recognizes the contradiction, and uses it again later with Marcus ("Assume that matters more than truth"). The method shapes her intellectual approach and is present in setup and middle. However, its mechanics do not meaningfully constrain her tactics; the photographs themselves provide the decisive evidence, and the contradiction method functions more as characterization (her philosophical training) than as a tool that changes outcomes. Removing it would weaken texture but not break causality.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "echoing observatory above clouds" is present from the title beat, creates the central spatial metaphor (retreat from consequence, literal height), and its acoustic properties amplify Adelaide's voice during her contradiction exercise. The dome's echo is used twice to embody her internal state. The setting drives a key choice: she must descend from the observatory to meet Marcus and confront the evidence, literalizing her return to earthly accountability. The clouds parting at the end ("revealing the city's lights") participates in closure. The setting is specific and irreplaceable; a different location would require significant rewriting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The journalist's call is the inciting incident and provides clear before/after structure (the call triggers her ascent and reflection). "That morning" anchors the timeline, and "sunset" marks Marcus's arrival, creating a single-day compression. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions in a pressure-clock sense; Adelaide could take days to decide without structural change. The "after the call" frame is functional but not causally load-bearing; the story could begin in medias res with Adelaide already troubled by the pen nib discovery without breaking the arc. Setup and payoff are present but middle pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To discover hidden truths" is Adelaide's explicit motivation, stated in the opening ("her motivation had always been simple: to discover hidden truths") and dramatized through her decision to study the evidence and publish the correction despite family cost. The desire is in direct conflict with protecting her grandfather's legacy, creating genuine friction. It drives her key choice (truth over mythology) and shapes the final image (returning to "thousands of tiny truths waiting to be discovered"). The motivation is present in setup, tested in the middle (will she protect or expose?), and resolved at closure. It is slightly tell-heavy in the opening but earns its keep through on-page choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Solemn playfulness" is attempted through phrases like "solemn meditation, yet there was something almost playful in her sudden clarity—like a child who'd figured out a magic trick's secret" and the observatory as both serious retreat and intellectual puzzle-space. The tone modulates: reflective solemnity in the opening, intellectual play in the contradiction exercise, and sober commitment at the end. However, the "playfulness" element is thin and somewhat asserted rather than woven through diction and rhythm; most of the piece reads straightforwardly solemn. The final image (honest star orbit) is solemn without the playful counterpoint. The tone is coherent but only partially achieves the dual register.</comment>
