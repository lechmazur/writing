<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is legible—she seeks to honor Castellan's memory and validate his love—but the characterization remains observational rather than internally conflicted. The decision to plant a Helena rose feels inevitable from the first paragraph, with no competing impulse or visible cost that might foreclose another path. Embodied emotion is thin; the moment she reads the final letter lacks contradictory feelings or a moment where she must choose between preserving privacy and honoring the request. The interiority leans toward summary ("finally understood") rather than showing her stakes shift under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure—Mira's decision to plant a rose and preserve the letters—lands on the page with a felt cost (making private love public) and constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration under an accumulative lens. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The story unfolds as a single continuous scene with causal linkage (sovereign case → tapestry fragment → cipher → letters → decision), and one meaningful tightening occurs when the decoded message narrows her search to the silo floor. However, the chess-clock frame (six months stipulated) is mentioned once and never constrains a choice or shapes urgency; the timeframe functions as backstory rather than live pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt silo is vividly anchored with "painted surface drinking in starlight, transforming it into something between midnight and sapphire" and houses the workbench, magnifying glass, and floorboards that enable the discovery. Sensory detail is selective and supports the setting's function. However, the silo does not constrain a choice at closure; Mira could plant the rose and preserve the letters regardless of where she found them. The cemetery itself remains generic, with "velveteen gloom" and "headstones" offering atmosphere but no spatial pressure or resources that alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding Castellan's cryptic bequest—is signaled early and drives the scene through cipher-work to discovery. One meaningful tightening occurs when the decoded threads send her to the floorboards. However, the escalation is investigative rather than pressured by competing options or visible cost; Mira faces no trade-off, time limit, or ethical calculus that might alter her tactics or foreclose a path. The resolution (planting a rose, preserving letters) is kind and inevitable, but lacks the friction of a choice between honoring privacy and making the love public with consequences on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—love as uncharted echo, memory as sacred work—emerges organically from Castellan's letters and Mira's vocation without overt moralizing. The final image of the Helena rose offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of witnessing lost love. "Uncharted echoes" recurs purposefully, seeding early and reweighting at closure. However, the final paragraph edges toward summary ("already organizing how she would preserve them, these uncharted echoes finally given voice") rather than letting the rose image carry the full thematic weight without a caption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyric, and textured ("velveteen gloom settling over the headstones like moth wings," "star-lanced darkness"). POV distance is stable; Mira's perceptual signature (tender, memorial-focused) is clear. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext are not tested. The prose modulates well under emotional pressure, though the final paragraph's syntax ("already organizing") shifts from scene into future summary, softening immediacy at closure. Psychic distance widens slightly when it should tighten.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: rhythm varies, information density is high, and figurative language ("moth wings," "star-lanced darkness," "velveteen gloom") is vivid without overwriting. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Sentence openings vary. However, two minor issues appear: "velveteen gloom" recurs three times without evolving meaning, trending toward ornamental repetition, and the final paragraph summarizes Mira's future intentions ("already organizing") rather than holding the present-tense image of the rose decision, which would sustain propulsion through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tapestry-as-cipher mechanic is fresh and well-integrated, and the framing (cemetery groundskeeper, cobalt silo, love letters hidden for decades) avoids stock beats. However, the emotional arc—discovering a tragic love story and choosing to memorialize it—follows a familiar template: hidden correspondence, forbidden romance, tender caretaker who honors the past. The transformation is modest; the premise could function similarly with different names and a different hiding place. The risk is mild; the story chooses safety (kindness, beauty, witnessing) over a bolder ethical calculus or a choice with visible social or relational cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's blithe nature is mentioned in the opening and her tenderness is demonstrated through her vocation and the rose-planting decision, but "blithe" itself does not constrain a choice or create a turn. She encounters no moment where her unshaken nature is tested by horror, ambiguity, or competing duty. The trait is present and consistent but does not drive escalation or alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sovereign case appears in three beats: left by the lawyer, opened on the workbench, and housing the tapestry fragment that triggers the cipher work. It is handled on the page, and its contents (the fabric square) enable the central discovery. Removing the case would require a different delivery mechanism, making it functionally essential. However, the case itself (gold-washed, prayer-book size) does not return with reweighted meaning at closure; the letters and rose take over.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Uncharted echoes" is seeded in Castellan's note, functions as the story's central question (what are the echoes?), and is answered thematically (the love that never mapped onto the world). The phrase recurs in the final paragraph, reweighting prior material. However, it operates primarily as metaphor rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics; Mira's goal is to decode the bequest, and "echoes" names the theme rather than constraining her choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" appears once to describe Mira's shelving and is invoked again when she gathers the letters "tenderly." The trait is visible in her care for Castellan's memory and the final rose-planting decision, but it does not constrain a choice or create a cost. It is characterization-consistent but ornamental; a less tender character could still decode the cipher and choose to memorialize or hide the letters with different reasoning.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Untangling the tapestry threads is the engine of discovery: Mira spends hours separating strands by color and length, decoding the cipher that leads her to the floorboards. The action is dramatized across multiple beats and is causally essential; without the untangling, the letters remain hidden and the closure does not occur. The specificity (blue left, gold right, red looped) matters. Removing this exact action would break the plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Decoding frayed threads is seeded when Mira wonders if Castellan "deliberately pulled these threads," then executed on the page (magnifying glass, hours of work, color-by-length separation), and the mechanics matter (blue/gold/red threads spell "Beneath silo"). The method shapes her attempt and is irreplaceable; a different cipher would require different skills and tools. It appears in the middle third and directly enables closure, satisfying setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The cobalt silo is vividly described ("painted surface drinking in starlight"), houses the workbench and tools, and the floorboards conceal the letters. It is present across beats and essential to the discovery. However, the silo does not constrain a choice at closure; Mira's decision to plant a rose and preserve the letters would function the same if she found them in a cottage attic or garden shed. The setting enables but does not pressure the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The chess-clock timeframe (six months since Castellan's death) is mentioned once to explain why the sovereign case arrives now, but it does not tighten decisions or shape tactics. Mira faces no deadline, urgency, or competing pressure tied to the passage of time. The element is functional exposition but swappable; "after the estate was settled" or "on the anniversary" would serve identically. It does not participate in closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To discover the shape of intentions" is seeded in Castellan's final letter and frames his life project (understanding his love's reality). Mira inherits this question and her choice to plant the rose and preserve the letters answers it thematically (the love was real, and witnessing matters). The motivation drives her interpretive work and charges the closure image. However, Mira's own intentions are not tested or conflicted on the page; she wants to understand and honor, and no competing desire complicates that goal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" is established in the opening, recurs twice, and colors the tone throughout (quiet, memorial, starlit). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly from curiosity (opening the case) to discovery (letters) to tender resolve (rose). However, "velveteen" is repeated without evolving meaning, and the tone remains static rather than shifting decisively under pressure. The final image charges the gloom with witnessing and beauty, but the tonal reconfiguration is mild.</comment>
