<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied: her involuntary truthfulness constrains choice when the neighbor visits, forcing a confession that fractures grace. The glass-eye decision at the climax emerges from cumulative loneliness rather than epiphany, and the final stance—descending to help others—forecasts cost without hedging. Minor slip: the "rational mind catalogues risks" phrase edges toward diagnostic label-speak, though it's brief and followed by embodied action. The vulnerability/fracture opposition drives choices consistently.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara stands on the bridge with private fear, then commits to searching for others who need "their doors returned"—a stance that reweights her isolation into mission with visible cost (continued storm-exposure, authority risk). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Lens: Accumulative/Textural; the piece deepens through layered reflection (virus history, textbook study, neighbor encounter) that tightens pressure on the present choice. One meaningful intensification: pressing the eye to her temple after the neighbor's tears. Cost is felt in "fractured kind of grace, this rebuilding" and the forecast of continued danger.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hanging orchard constrains movement (rope bridges, swaying trees) and recurs as the final image charging closure: "swayed in the wind, resilient and storm-scarred and surviving." Storm pressure is embodied (rain striking horizontally, battering the cabin) and the ravine's acoustic threat (broadcasting loneliness) shapes Mara's prior isolation choice. The glass eye and textbooks function as micro-setting objects that enable the final turn. Spatial choreography stays coherent across cabin, bridges, and cliffside.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (psychological privacy/coherence) is signaled early via involuntary truthfulness. One clear tightening: the neighbor's question forces Mara to broadcast pain she "couldn't bear everyone feeling," which directly motivates the glass-eye gambit. The eye-press moment narrows options—either fracture further or risk the relic—with legible trade-offs (authority pursuit, possible failure). Closure choice (descending to help others) is driven by protagonist agency and forecloses solitary endurance. The phrase "another fracture, another piece of grace broken off" makes cost visceral before the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (boundaries as condition for selfhood) emerges from particulars: the virus, occluders, banned textbooks, the neighbor's weeping, the door-closing sensation. The final image—"fractured kind of grace, this rebuilding"—offers a non-literal answer to whether empathy unites or shatters, reweighting "grace" from vulnerability to agency without moralizing. Subtext operates in "empathy was meant to unite humanity, the authorities said" (ironized by Mara's counter-evidence). The piece resists false balance: compulsory connection is torture; some need walls. No theme echo in the final beat; closure lands via image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited with tight perceptual signature: Mara notices smugglers' codes, reads textbooks by lamplight, catalogues risks with professional precision. Diction stays within her register (forager, methodical, occluder, prosthetics) without unmotivated elevation. The involuntary-truth attribute is shown through the neighbor scene rather than asserted. Minor slip: "rationality hadn't saved anyone from the virus" edges toward thesis-statement, though it follows concrete reflection. No head-hopping; psychic distance narrows cleanly at the eye-press moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening long sentences anchor, then tighten at the eye-press beat. Information density is high: "the virus had left her involuntarily truthful" does double work (backstory + motive). One template-cadence run: "She felt her fear... She felt her own heart" in the penultimate paragraph (−0.3). No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. The "fractured grace" motif recurs without redundancy, reweighted at closure. Clarity and propulsion hold; the piece reads aloud cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The empathy-virus premise echoes well-known dystopian templates (compulsory transparency, banned privacy tech), but the hanging-orchard setting and truffle-forager particularity ground it in lived detail. The glass-eye mechanics (pressed to temple, "door closing softly") avoid hand-wave convenience by anchoring in pre-seeded textbooks. The neighbor encounter transforms the trope via specific cost: shared pain fractures both parties. Risk-taking (reflection-heavy structure, quiet ending) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The closure's "search for others" pivot feels earned rather than imposed, lifting the piece above median execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's rationality shapes two key beats: cataloguing risks before using the eye (middle) and the final descent to search for relics and others (closure). Her forager precision (methodical work, smugglers' codes, textbook study) enables the discovery and interpretation. The attribute directly drives the eye-press decision and the missionary stance at the end.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glass eye appears in three functional beats: discovery (wrapped in oilcloth, recognized via codes), examination beside textbooks (mechanics explained), and the temple-press that closes the door in her mind. Its reweighted meaning at closure—proof that doors can be returned—charges the final descent to help others. Specificity (pale blue, gold flecks, emotional prosthetic) makes it irreplaceable; removing it breaks the logic of Mara's agency and the story's central image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The smuggled-relic concept frames the opening stake (banned occluders, authorities patrol) and enables the climactic choice (risk using contraband). It shapes tactics: Mara hides the eye, weighs authority risk, and later commits to continued smuggling by searching for "more relics." Present in closure image (searching for relics for others). Two beats (discovery, use) with causal pressure; middle development and closure participation both clear.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Involuntary truthfulness constrains the neighbor scene ("Are you happy here?" forces confession), which provides the immediate motive for the eye gambit. The trait is shown through dialogue consequence rather than label-only. It pressures the climax: without it, Mara would not need the occluder. Cost is visible (neighbor weeps, "another fracture"). Present in setup (second paragraph) and powers middle turn; absence at closure is appropriate (the door closes it).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Occlude" anchors the premise (occluders banned, emotional broadcasts torture) and the climactic action: pressing the eye closes the door, allowing Mara to "feel her fear without projecting it." The verb recurs at closure ("ability to occlude one's inner world") and defines the mission (help others occlude). Two beats (textbook explanation, eye-press moment) with irreplaceable mechanics; swapping it would require rewriting the virus logic and the entire closure image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The textbooks are signaled early (pulled from beneath cot, "discredited... banned neurological studies") and enable the middle beat: Mara reads the eye's mechanics, which informs her decision to press it to her temple. The method shapes one attempt (the eye-press) and provides warrant for the risk. Present in setup and middle; closure participation is indirect (the method worked, now she'll teach it). Two-gate presence with modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hanging orchard pressures every choice: rope bridges constrain movement, storms batter the cabin (forcing retreat and lamp-lit study), and the ravine's acoustic threat (broadcasting loneliness) motivated prior isolation. The final image—orchard "swayed in the wind, resilient and storm-scarred and surviving"—charges closure by mirroring Mara's stance. Present in all three beats (opening work, cabin retreat, final descent) with clear causal and thematic weight; irreplaceable for the survival metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The post-virus timeframe is signaled early ("three years prior") and establishes the world state (dampeners distributed, occluders banned, authorities patrol). It does not tighten on-page decisions; no live clock pressures the climax. The element frames context but remains static across beats. Setup is clear; middle and closure participation are thematic rather than tactical. Functional but not essential to moment-by-moment escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Psychological safety (the ability to keep one's heart "whole and private, hers alone to share or keep") drives the climactic choice and closure mission. The desire is dramatized through the neighbor confession ("couldn't bear everyone feeling it") and the relief after the eye-press. Friction is visible: safety requires contraband risk and continued storm-exposure. Present in setup (learned to work alone), middle (textbook search), and closure (descending to help others reclaim doors). Cost is felt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fractured-grace tone is established early ("grace came at the price of selves shattered beyond repair"), modulates through the neighbor's weeping ("another piece of grace broken off"), and charges the final image: "fractured kind of grace, this rebuilding." The phrase reweights vulnerability (beautiful fracture) into agency (rebuilding with cost). Tone stays coherent under pressure—quiet, elegiac, unsentimental—and the cadence shift at closure (short declaratives: "Like her") deepens the effect without explaining it.</comment>
