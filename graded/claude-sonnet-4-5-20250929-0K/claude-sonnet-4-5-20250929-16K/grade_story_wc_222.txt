<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Seren's motivation is clear and she makes micro-choices under pressure (which queen to swap, proceeding despite fear). However, her internal experience lacks embodied contradiction—she trembles from "understanding" rather than conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The mentor's absence and her apprentice status are told rather than dramatized through on-page struggle. The final transformation from apprentice to keeper feels asserted rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a specific path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph one (Seren, corrupted sky, sundial failure). The piece follows a causal lens: sundial stops → climb → swap pieces → sky fixes, with each move motivated. Closure is a Decisive Change (sky repaired, shadow returns, apprentice becomes keeper) with felt cost (she must now bury the lies, stand alone). One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes she might choose wrong. The cost is visible in the final image of solitary responsibility, though the ease of the fix slightly undercuts the weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (crystalline stairs, wind screaming, ice forming in eyelashes). The chess board carved into living ice and the pocket sundial's warming response provide micro-setting constraints that guide Seren's choices. Spatial choreography is clean (climb, summit, board, descent). The spire's humming and ice singing charge the swap sequence, and the setting pressures the character through cold and verticality, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: repair the corrupted sky by swapping the right pieces. One meaningful tightening occurs when Seren realizes she might choose wrong, narrowing options with visible risk. Each piece swap escalates through consequence (sky flickers, suns separate). Agency is clear—her decisions drive all major turns. The cost is legible in the final image (she must bury the lies, accept solitary keeper role). However, the swaps proceed too smoothly without tactical adaptation or visible loss, slightly flattening the pressure curve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus lies emerges through the chess-piece secrets and the corrupted sky metaphor. The final line attempts resonance ("the greatest theft was stealing back the truth") but states the theme rather than letting it emerge. The pocket sundial and chess pieces recur with shifting meaning, earning some credit. However, "Small things hold up the sky" reads as a planted profundity, and the apprentice-to-keeper arc resolves too neatly without ambiguity or counter-reading. The piece leans toward assertion over implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("sky had turned the color of old bruises," "cautious abandon," "sacredly playful") that modulates under pressure without breaking. The prose signature is character-particular, filtering the icebound spire through Seren's apprentice lens. Some phrases edge toward over-writing ("the wind screamed secrets she couldn't quite hear") but remain legible. Perceptual filtering is consistent and purposeful, meeting baseline control standards.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several passages slip into ornamental phrasing that stalls momentum. "The wind screamed secrets she couldn't quite hear" is generic mystery-speak. "Sacredly playful" appears three times as a label without sufficient dramatization. Minor paraphrase loops: "twelve pieces… each one hollow, each one containing" and later "piece by piece" recycles structure. The metaphor "old bruises" for sky color is apt, but "wrongness" is vague. Figurative density in the opening third risks over-writing without pattern-teaching. No major artifacts touch closure, capping deduction at −0.8 per the non-closure rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The chess-as-cosmic-maintenance premise is familiar from genre fiction, and the corrupted-sky-fixed-by-swapping-secrets plot follows a standard quest structure. The combination of "chivalrous thief" and "apprentice of wonder" feels like prompt assembly rather than organic synthesis. "Sacredly playful" is an interesting tonal inflection but mostly appears as a label. The hollow chess pieces with secrets inside is a vivid image, yet the execution (smooth swaps, immediate fixes) lacks surprising turns. No significant transformation of tropes; the emotional arc (apprentice becomes keeper) is predictable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Seren (chivalrous thief) makes key decisions: to climb, to swap pieces, to bury the lies. Present in setup, development, and closure. However, the "thief" aspect is mostly told (backstory about stealing forgotten needs) rather than demonstrated through on-page cunning or moral calculus. Her choices feel straightforward rather than driven by thief-specific tactics. Functional but the thief attribute could be swapped for "seeker" or "mage" with minimal structural change.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Pocket sundial lid appears in three beats: opening (shadow won't fall), summit (shows map of board), ending (shadow returns true). Setup and payoff present; middle use enables the swap choice by showing which pieces to target. The lid's warming and face-change provide causal pressure. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown in action, and "lid" versus "sundial" inconsistency creates mild confusion. Removing it would require a different guidance mechanism, but the map function feels convenient.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Apprentice of wonder" frames the setup (she's untrained, mentor gone) and the closure (she becomes a keeper). It shapes her self-doubt ("might choose wrong") and motivates the climb (duty to continue mentor's work). Appears in opening, informs the middle stakes, and resolves in the final paragraph. However, "wonder" as a discipline is abstract; we don't see her use wonder-specific skills. The concept guides theme more than tactics, landing mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Sacredly playful" appears three times as a label (mentor's approach, the game, Seren's final stance) but is rarely dramatized through on-page action. The chess metaphor gestures at playfulness, but the swaps are earnest and reverent without visible tension between sacredness and play. No moment where playfulness constrains or enables a choice with cost. Mostly ornamental, providing tonal color without structural necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Amend" is the story's central action: Seren must amend the corrupted pieces by swapping them for true ones. Signaled in the setup (sundial stopped, sky wrong), drives the entire middle sequence (piece-by-piece swaps), and delivers the closure (sky fixed). Each amendment is a distinct beat with consequence (sky flickers, suns separate). Removing "amend" collapses the plot. The specificity (amending secrets, not destroying or creating) is essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method (swapping hand-carved chess pieces with secrets inside) is signaled early (leather pouch, twelve pieces), detailed at the summit (hollow cores, light-written secrets), and executed across multiple beats. Each swap is dramatized with consequence. The mechanics (crush false secret, place true piece) shape Seren's tactics and the escalation. Removing this exact method would require a different plot structure. The hollow-core/secret mechanism is specific and causally active, though the ease of execution slightly reduces irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound spire is present from the opening, shapes the climb (crystalline stairs, wind, ice forming in eyelashes), houses the board at the summit, and provides the descent frame for closure. The spire's humming and singing ice respond to the swaps, charging the action. Its verticality ("above the clouds," "high place") enables the sundial's transformation and isolates Seren, raising stakes. Removing it would break the setting-as-pressure logic. Essential across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"When the sky is wrong" anchors the opening (two suns, stars at midday) and the closure (sky restored). The wrongness creates urgency and signals the dominant stake immediately. However, time pressure is vague—no ticking clock or consequence if she delays. The sky's wrongness is more a state than a timeframe. It functions as both motivation and resolution marker, present in setup and payoff, but does not constrain tactics during the middle. Mid-band for framing without temporal escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To embrace the unknown with open arms" is explicitly stated ("accepting that she might choose wrong") and motivates the climb despite risk. It appears in the setup (mentor's trust, her doubt) and at the decision point (trembling from understanding, might swap incorrect pieces). The final paragraph echoes it ("apprentice no longer"). However, the motivation is mostly told rather than shown through conflicted choices. Seren proceeds methodically without on-page friction between fear and embrace. Functional but underplayed in execution.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Cautious abandon" is explicitly named in the opening ("climbed with cautious abandon, each step calculated yet reckless") and modulates through the piece: careful examination of each piece, bold instinct in swapping. The oxymoron charges the tone and reflects Seren's dual nature (apprentice precision vs. thief daring). It returns implicitly in the ending (standing in the clouds, sacredly playful). Present in setup and closure, with middle beats enacting the duality. The tone is coherent and purposeful, though slightly over-labeled rather than fully embodied.</comment>
