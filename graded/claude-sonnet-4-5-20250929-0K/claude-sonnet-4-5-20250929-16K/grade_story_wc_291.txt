<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's prosopagnosia is established but her interior contradictions remain abstract—she "reads architecture of gesture" without showing us how this shapes an on-page choice under pressure. The motivation to "awaken dormant empathy" is told rather than embodied through concrete micro-choices. The final understanding ("The killer hadn't worn a mask") arrives as epiphany without prior contradictory impulses that would earn it. Embodied emotion is minimal; much is label-driven ("methodical gaze," "hands shook") without the bodily specificity that would anchor her state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening. The causal lens holds: ribbon fragment → workshop insight → killer's invisibility motive → decision to paint. One meaningful deepening occurs when Vera realizes the masks were the killer's creations. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she begins to draw a portrait of absence, crystallizing her stance with felt cost (taking on the killer's loneliness). Cost is legible but quieter than ideal—the final image charges but doesn't foreclose a concrete path with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The quarry is vivid (mist, stone walls, chisel marks) and the descent structures the investigation spatially. However, setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Vera's realization about the mask workshop could occur anywhere. The ribbon and sketch pad function as micro-setting objects but neither limits her options at closure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("topology of murder"), but the quarry remains atmospheric rather than functional.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled: understanding the killer to prevent future violence. Pressure tightens through the ribbon discovery → workshop connection → motive insight, narrowing Vera's interpretive options. The decision to paint is an act of agency but the cost is conceptual (taking on loneliness) rather than a visible forfeiture. One meaningful deepening occurs, but escalation remains cognitive rather than situational—no live antagonist or external constraint forces the final choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: sight/blindness, creator/destroyer, visibility/invisibility unified in the killer's psychology and Vera's prosopagnosia. The ending offers a resonant answer—painting absence to awaken empathy—without moralizing. Subtext operates in "the hollow ache of their hands" and "desperate architecture of their loneliness." However, the phrase "by unifying opposites" appears as meta-commentary rather than arising purely from scene work, and "perhaps someone who recognized that particular loneliness would come forward" edges toward explicit thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Vera notices "topology," "architecture of gesture," "syntax of shadow." Voice remains consistent through emotional intensification. However, some diction ("lanced through her," "furrowed hush") feels elevated beyond Vera's established register, and Morrison's single line of dialogue carries subtext but isn't tested against Vera's speech for voice distinction. Filter verbs ("seemed to pulse," "felt different") appear in key beats without clear voice motivation. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the workshop-realization beat. However, several ornamental constructions slow momentum: "a portrait artist cursed with prosopagnosia" and "stone walls rising like silent witnesses" front-load without advancing pressure. Paraphrase loop: "Vera descended" / "The quarry floor materialized" / "Here: where the first victim fell" restates arrival across three beats. Figurative density peaks without pattern-teaching: "lance," "lanced through her," "unified love with a lance" cycles the same vehicle. Template cadence in the masquerade paragraph: "Guests had descended... torches burning... masks transforming." No filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats; no causality break.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of prosopagnosia with cold-case consultation is non-obvious and specific to this character's dilemma. The realization that the killer made the masks (enabling transformation while remaining unseen) feels earned in hindsight and transforms the "unifying opposites" prompt into a lived paradox. Risk-taking is evident: painting a portrait of absence through negative space charges the concept without resolving it tidily. The premise could feel template-like (face-blind detective) but the inversion—using her condition to see what others miss—personalizes it. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vera appears throughout and her prosopagnosia frames the investigation. However, her key realization (killer made the masks) is cognitive rather than a choice that alters tactics. The decision to paint is the one on-page choice, but it arrives in the final paragraph without prior conflicted alternatives. Present in closure but her face-blindness doesn't constrain the path—any investigator could reach the same insight. Two gates (setup, payoff); missing middle choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ribbon fragment is handled in three beats: discovery, examination ("threading pattern matched a specific workshop"), and as catalyst for the realization. It enables the workshop connection and thus the motive insight. However, it doesn't constrain Vera's final choice to paint—once she understands, the ribbon's causal work is complete. Present in setup and development; absent from closure image. Two gates plus causal pressure in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Cold cases frame the premise (three unsolved murders, evidence vanished five years ago) but don't shape on-page tactics. The story's pressure is the interpretive puzzle, not procedural obstacles tied to the case being cold. Time elapsed is backstory; the investigation occurs in one descent. Present as setup context but doesn't constrain or enable the realization or the decision to paint. One gate (setup); largely thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Methodical" is applied as label ("methodical gaze," "methodical mind reconstructing") but doesn't visibly constrain or enable an on-page action. Vera's reconstruction is cognitive summary rather than a beat where her thoroughness costs time or forces a tradeoff. Present throughout but functions as character texture rather than causal lever. One gate (setup); mentioned in middle; absent from closure cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Lance" appears in backstory (victims "lanced through the heart") and returns in the final line ("unified love with a lance"), creating a charged reprise. However, the action itself is past; on-page pressure centers on interpretation, not the method of killing. The return reweights the image but doesn't drive a turn. Two gates (setup, payoff) via lyric resonance; missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Unifying opposites" is named early ("Opposites unified in violence") and returns explicitly in the final beats ("By unifying opposites—artist and destroyer..."). However, it functions as thematic label rather than a method that shapes Vera's tactics. The realization is about the killer's psychology, not a technique Vera employs. Present but largely ornamental meta-commentary; doesn't constrain choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Quarry provides spatial structure (descent, floor, chisel marks) and atmospheric charge (mist, shadow). Vera's descent is goal-directed and the location enables reconstruction of the masquerade. However, setting doesn't constrain her realization—the workshop insight could occur elsewhere. The quarry holds symbolic weight ("held its breath") and returns in the closure image ("quarry held its breath, and Vera painted mercy"), charging the ending. Three gates present; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong via reprise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After yesterday's rockslide" and "five years ago" establish temporal context but don't tighten on-page decisions. No live clock pressures Vera's descent or realization. Time functions as backstory setup rather than a constraint that alters tactics. One gate (setup); absent from middle escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Motivation to "awaken dormant empathy" is told early ("That was her true motivation") and underlies the decision to paint. However, it's abstract rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no friction between this goal and a competing want. The final act (painting to make others feel the killer's loneliness) enacts the motivation but without visible cost or tradeoff on the page. Two gates (setup, payoff); missing middle friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" is named twice (Morrison's voice, final beat) and the tone—quiet, shadowed, meditative—remains coherent across the piece. Diction supports it: "stone walls rising," "mist-wrapped," "hollow ache." However, tone is static rather than modulating with pressure; the contemplative register holds even during the realization beat. The reprise in the final line charges the image. Two gates (setup, payoff) with consistent texture; moderate closure linkage.</comment>
