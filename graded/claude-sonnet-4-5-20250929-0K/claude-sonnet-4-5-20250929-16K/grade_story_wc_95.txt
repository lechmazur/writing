<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theodora's mechanical arm functions as a trait-marker but her interiority remains mostly declarative. The philosophical stance ("questions aren't obstacles—they're destinations") is asserted through dialogue rather than tested by contradictory impulses in scene. Venn's pivot at the end feels slightly underearned; the magistrate's curiosity emerges abruptly without prior micro-choices that would forecast the shift. Theodora's endurance of waiting and her final choice to offer the card carry visible cost, but the emotional texture stays at one register throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal; the needle card + sundial cipher → invitation → Venn's decision to bring it to council forms a clear chain. Orientation anchors (glass atrium, Theodora, waiting) land early. Closure is a Charged Poise: Venn departs with the card and a promise, options are reconfigured, and the cost is visible in Venn's wrestled diplomacy and Theodora's perpetual waiting stance. One micro-turn (Venn's mask cracks) sets up the final shift without adding a second decisive change. The causal linkage holds, though the final beat leans on Venn's off-page council action rather than a fully on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glass atrium, sundial, and brook anchor space and atmosphere effectively. The half-painted sundial constrains the cipher and charges the final image when Theodora points to it, proving micro-setting function. Sensory detail (brass gears clicking, steel singing, amber light) is vivid and filtered through the scene's philosophical urgency. The spatial choreography of the duel remains clear throughout. Minor: the atrium's glass walls amplify sound but do not further constrain a tactic after that single mention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whether the scholarium's coded debate can emerge from shadows) is signaled early and tightens when Theodora disarms Venn's thrust and explains the sundial cipher. The duel provides physical escalation that interweaves with philosophical argument, and Theodora's mechanical arm move (catching the blade between two fingers) narrows Venn's options with visible surprise. The cost is legible: Venn must risk council negotiation, and Theodora remains "always waiting." One meaningful tightening (the disarm + explanation) drives the turn under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (inquiry as destination, incompleteness as code) emerges from the sundial cipher and Theodora's patience rather than assertion. The final image of the half-painted sundial "keeping its coded secrets" offers a resonant visual answer without moralizing. However, Theodora's line "Questions aren't obstacles—they're destinations" edges toward thematic echo by articulating the premise in prompt-like language. The needle card and sundial function as motifs that constrain choice rather than ornament. The piece resists tidy resolution but leans slightly didactic in dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization through Theodora is stable and controlled; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct idiom ("diplomatically fierce," "dignified chaos") that modulates under dueling pressure without breaking register. Dialogue pursues goals and carries subtext ("Still confusing patience with weakness?" / "Still decoding parlor tricks?") with naturalistic rhythm. Minor: a few lines lean ornamental ("ancient soliloquy," "amber possibility") without altering pressure, and the final paragraph's "steady as philosophy itself" edges toward abstract comparison. Psychic distance remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high (cipher, duel, philosophical debate compressed cleanly). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Clarity is strong through action sequences. Minor overwriting: "dignified chaos" and "amber possibility" elevate diction in non-peak beats; "endless commentary" (brook) and "ancient soliloquy" (brook again) repeat the same figurative vehicle for the same object without advancing pressure. The final paragraph's "steady as philosophy itself" mixes registers slightly. Propulsion remains intact, but figurative density in descriptive beats trends decorative.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise (dueling philosopher using a half-painted sundial as cipher) synthesizes familiar steampunk and coded-resistance tropes through specific detail (mechanical arm, Danish tin card, glass atrium). The fusion of philosophical debate with physical fencing is executed with fresh specificity rather than cliché. Theodora's persistent waiting and the sundial's intentional incompleteness transform stock rebellion imagery into a quieter, more patient stance. Minor: the "underground scholarium" and "diplomatic magistrate" roles remain archetypal without full personalization, and the mechanical arm's strategic use (catching the blade) feels slightly ornamental rather than indispensable to the thematic question.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theodora present throughout; her mechanical arm catches Venn's blade (middle beat) and she offers the needle card at closure. The disarm action alters Venn's stance and enables the philosophical argument. Setup clear, middle development present, closure participation via the card offer. Causal pressure moderate; the arm's inhuman speed matters but the choice to explain the sundial could occur without it. Swappability moderate: a natural hand could catch the blade with skill rather than mechanics. Cost tied loosely (Venn's surprise enables the explanation). Two beats plus closure linkage; early signal; moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Needle card introduced early (paragraph 3), Theodora retrieves and explains it in the middle argument, and offers it forward at closure. Setup, development, closure all present. The card's pastoral scene + shepherd shadow encodes the invitation when overlaid with the sundial, shaping Theodora's argument and Venn's final choice. Causal pressure solid: the card is the hidden overture, driving the stake. Two beats (retrieval + offer) plus closure; specificity high (Danish tin, painted pastoral). Minor swappability: another coded object could function similarly with edits. Cost connection clear (Venn must bring it to council). Early signal, beat involvement ×2, closure linkage, specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The hidden overture (scholarium's coded invitation via needle card + sundial) shapes the dominant stake and Theodora's tactic (explain the cipher to persuade Venn). Introduced early (paragraph 3 mentions the card; paragraph 8 names the overture explicitly). Development: the overture's existence drives Theodora's argument and Venn's curiosity. Closure: Venn agrees to bring the invitation to council, crystallizing the overture's success. Setup, development, closure present. Causal pressure high: the concept frames the entire negotiation. Specificity strong (coded debate vs. armed conflict). Cost visible (Venn's risk, Theodora's perpetual waiting). Early signal, causal linkage, closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Diplomatically fierce" applied to Theodora's courtesy in paragraph 5 and restated for Venn's "diplomatic smile" and "fierce diplomacy." The trait enables Theodora's dual-mode argument (duel + philosophy) but functions mostly as descriptor rather than constraining a choice with visible cost. Present early and at closure (Venn's mask cracks, revealing "fierce diplomacy"), but the attribute does not foreclose a path or alter tactics beyond tone. Setup present, closure mention present, middle development weak (the trait colors dialogue but does not force a tradeoff). Swappability high: "courteous intensity" or similar could replace with minor edits. Label-only use dominates; no visible price tied to being diplomatically fierce on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fencing anchors the physical layer (en garde, octave attack, parry in sixte, blade catch, disarm) and enables Theodora's multitasking argument. Present early (paragraph 6) through closure (Theodora raises rapier in salute, cleans blade in final paragraph). Setup, development, closure present. The disarm (mechanical arm catches blade) creates the key turn by halting Venn's attack and opening space for the sundial explanation. Two beats (duel sequence + final salute/cleaning). Causal pressure moderate: the fencing provides urgency but the philosophical negotiation could proceed without it via a different frame. Swappability moderate: another simultaneous physical contest (chess, walking negotiation) could serve with edits. Cost tied loosely (Venn breathes hard, steps back). Early signal, beat involvement ×2, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The sundial cipher (coded angles in half-painted sundial) is seeded early (paragraph 7 glimpse, paragraph 8 overlay with needle card mechanics explained), shapes the middle argument (paragraph 10 Theodora points to it and explains scholars' communication method), and charges closure (final paragraph: "half-painted sundial kept its coded secrets"). Setup, development, closure present. Causal pressure high: the cipher is the means of hidden overture, driving Theodora's argument and Venn's choice. Specificity very high (incomplete gnomon, hour-lines, noon shadow overlay). Cost visible (completing the sundial would destroy the code). Three beats (glimpse, explanation, final image); early signal; irreplaceable mechanics. The method is indispensable to the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Glass atrium introduced in opening paragraph; brook mentioned twice (paragraphs 1 and 13); atrium's glass walls amplify fencing sounds (paragraph 7). Setup present; atrium provides stage for duel and philosophical argument. The setting's transparency allows Theodora to see the sundial (paragraph 7), enabling the cipher reveal. Closure: "sunlight through the glass atrium painted everything in amber possibility" (paragraph 14), charging the final mood. Setup, development (sight-line to sundial), closure (light effect) present. The atrium's glass constrains sight and sound, shaping the argument's staging. Two beats (amplified duel + sundial view) plus closure light; early signal; moderate causal pressure (the duel and argument could occur elsewhere with edits). Swappability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Waiting" appears in title-like phrase (paragraph 2: "always waiting") and closure ("Waiting. Always waiting for questions to become destinations"). The timeframe of waiting colors Theodora's stance but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page; the duel and negotiation proceed without time pressure. Setup present (paragraph 2), closure reprise present, middle development absent (no clock narrows options). The waiting functions as thematic posture rather than constraint. Lyric reprise reweights the stake slightly but without felt urgency. Swappability high: "observing" or "preparing" could replace with minor tonal edits. No visible cost tied to duration of waiting within this scene; the trait is told and reprised but does not alter a move.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Questions into destinations" stated in Theodora's dialogue (paragraph 9: "Questions aren't obstacles—they're destinations") and reprised at closure (paragraph 14). Setup present (implicit in paragraph 2 "arrival was merely another question to be transformed into destination"), closure reprise present. The motivation drives Theodora's argument (explaining the cipher to transform the council's question) but is articulated rather than dramatized through contradictory wants. Development weak: the desire faces no internal friction or cost until Venn's departure. Swappability moderate: "to enable inquiry" could replace with edits. The motivation shapes the stake but remains label-level; Theodora never confronts a moment where turning questions into destinations costs her something on the page. Lyric reprise plus causal color, but told-dominant.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Dignified chaos" appears in paragraph 7 ("symphony of dignified chaos") and reprised at closure (paragraph 15: "some chaos, when dignified by purpose, could rebuild worlds"). The tone coheres through the duel (formal courtesy + physical clash) and modulates under pressure (Venn's mask cracks, Theodora's patience tested). Setup present, development present (tone guides dialogue register and action staging), closure charged (the final image of incomplete sundial + brook soliloquy sustains the oxymoron). The tone is not static; it tightens when Theodora catches the blade and relaxes when Venn departs. Swappability low: the specific pairing of dignity and chaos defines the story's register. Cost tied loosely (dignified restraint enables the negotiation). Early signal, beat involvement across duel and argument, closure reprise that reweights.</comment>
