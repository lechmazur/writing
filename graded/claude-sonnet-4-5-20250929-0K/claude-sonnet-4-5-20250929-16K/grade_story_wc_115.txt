<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and particular—her "drowsy alertness" and the way she "maps conversations like an archaeologist maps strata" feel specific to her investigative drive. The recklessness is embodied through her thirty-hour wakefulness and tunnel descent, though the final choice (photographing, contacting authorities) reads more as procedural follow-through than a decision under contradictory pressure. Internal conflict is present in her skepticism versus the hook of "frantic consistency," but the ending shifts to thematic summation rather than a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal: radio confession → revelation → decision to contact authorities. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost (Mara will expose the crime, ending the men's secret), and orientation anchors quickly (Mara, tunnel, 2 AM, ghost-shift story chase). The confession arrives via radio rather than through Mara's agency, making the peak turn coincidence-adjacent; her role shifts from investigator to witness, which slightly undercuts protagonist-driven escalation but does not break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tunnel is vividly rendered—"walls wept with condensation," rust, valve assembly, junction chamber—and the beaded valve wheel constrains her appraisal choices and charges the final image (it "clinked against her back... a rosary of evidence"). The setting shapes her investigative tactics and the closure decision. Spatial choreography is clear throughout descent and return.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: uncovering the truth behind the ghost-shift calls. The radio confession is the one meaningful tightening, though it arrives as a gift rather than through Mara's escalating pressure. Her decision to photograph and contact authorities forecloses the option of leaving the truth buried, with visible cost to the callers' secret. The confession itself is vivid and consequential, but Mara's agency in the peak beat is passive reception rather than active forcing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the valve wheel, the tunnel, thirty-two years of collective haunting. The final image—"the living haunted themselves far more effectively than any dead ever could"—reconfigures the ghost-shift premise into a study of guilt without moralizing. The "religiously skeptical faith" motif brackets the story effectively. Minor slip: "drowsy alertness of revelation" leans slightly toward label-speak in a peak beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "darkness thick as wool," "thoughts moved through honey," "mapping conversations like an archaeologist maps strata." POV remains stable in third-limited; no head-hopping. The radio-confession dialogue reads natural and urgent, and Mara's perceptual signature (investigative, attuned to "truth compressed between words") is consistent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interior to wider thematic reflection at the end.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmic with strong momentum. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor issues: "drowsy alertness" appears three times (opening, midpoint, ending)—the final instance ("drowsy alertness of revelation") risks paraphrase loop and adds a slight explanatory cushion. The line "Eddie Torres deserved more than radio confessions and phantom sightings" tells rather than showing the cost, though it does not obscure closure. Information density is high; no major scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise transforms the ghost-story trope through psychological realism: collective guilt rather than supernatural haunting. The framing device (radio confessions, abandoned-site exploration) is familiar but executed with specificity (the valve wheel, the chemical-waste motive, the thirty-two-year timeline). The ending reweights the ghost-shift concept through the particulars of Mara's investigation. Not wholly original in structure, but the synthesis of industrial archaeology and guilt-driven haunting feels purposeful and earned.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara (reckless explorer) is present throughout and her choices frame the investigation; her descent, appraisal of the valve wheel, and decision to photograph/contact authorities drive all major beats. She enables the story but her peak-beat role is passive (receiving the confession rather than forcing it), which caps her at the "essential across beats" tier rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel appears in three beats: Mara finds it and recognizes it from Doug's photo, it links Eddie's death to the valve assembly, and it reappears in the closing image as "a rosary of evidence." It constrains her appraisal and charges the final image with both physical and symbolic weight. Its specific craft detail (welded beads) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The factory ghost shift is the core concept that frames stakes and investigation. It is present from the opening (the caller mentions, the "night workers filing through"), developed through the confession (the men "never stopped seeing him"), and repriced at closure (psychological, not supernatural). It shapes Mara's goal and the story's thematic turn, though the mechanics of the haunting remain largely off-page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Religiously skeptical" is signaled early ("her religiously skeptical worldview had survived two decades") and returns in the closing paragraph ("a rosary of evidence for her religiously skeptical faith"). It constrains her interpretive lens—she seeks natural explanations—but does not force a visible on-page tradeoff or complicate a choice under pressure. The label does thematic work but minimal causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Appraise" is the method by which Mara works: she appraises "each frantic testimony for the truth compressed between words," handles and appraises the valve wheel, and photographs evidence. The action is signaled early, recurs in the middle beat (valve wheel), and directly enables the closure decision (contact authorities with appraised evidence). It is not easily swappable; investigative scrutiny is the engine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interpreting frantic calls to talk-radio psychics is introduced in the first paragraph, recurs when Mara's radio crackles with the confession, and directly delivers the peak revelation. The method is specific (WKRP overnight show, Doug's text, the caller's shaking voice) and the confession is the hinge moment. The mechanics matter: Mara tunes in, the confession arrives, she acts. Indispensable to escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel is the sole setting and constrains every choice: it holds the valve wheel, the junction chamber, the valve assembly where Eddie died, and the physical evidence Mara photographs. The tunnel's condensation, rust, and darkness shape her sensory experience and investigative path. The descent and return bracket the narrative. Removing the tunnel collapses the story's spatial and symbolic architecture.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The timeframe—"the hush that follows a sudden confession"—is the story's climactic beat. The radio silence after the caller's revelation is dramatized on the page ("The hush that followed stretched like a wire. Even the radio host had gone silent"), and Mara's responsive action (standing in "drowsy alertness of revelation," then deciding to photograph and contact authorities) occurs within that charged suspension. The hush tightens decision pressure and is indispensable to the closure moment.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—"to find the weight of a swallowed truth"—is signaled early (she's "been chasing the ghost shift story for three weeks") and dramatized through her descent, appraisal, and final decision. The phrase "weight of a swallowed truth settling around her like sediment" explicitly ties the metaphor to the closure moment. The motivation drives every beat and the final act (exposing the truth), though the phrasing leans slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Drowsy alertness" is introduced in the second paragraph ("drowsy alertness, where every sound registered with preternatural clarity but her thoughts moved through honey"), recurs at the confession beat ("drowsy alertness of revelation"), and modulates with pressure (alertness during descent, hush during confession, determination at closure). The tone is coherent, character-specific, and charges the final sensory image (tunnel "holding its secrets like water holds weight"). Minor repetition of the exact phrase risks formula, but it does thematic work.</comment>
