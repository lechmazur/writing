<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Finder's tracking skills and intuitive reading are embodied in her choices throughout, from decoding the cylinder to interpreting the preserved leaf. The reunion with Crow arrives with credible emotional weight, though the final turn toward hope feels slightly telescoped—the shift from "finding the dead" to "finding the living" lands as earned insight but compresses years of trauma into a single acknowledgment. Internal contradiction appears in Finder's simultaneous desire to forget and her inability to stop reading signs, which drives her journey west. Minor deduction for the autumn-leaf epiphany sequence, which edges toward convenient symbol-solving rather than dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens dominates: cylinder arrives → Finder decodes voice and grooves → coordinates lead west → reunion with Crow. The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): two retired trackers sit together, translating distance into closeness through riddles that are "bridges to build," with the conceptual cost visible in their shared need to relearn hope after horror. Orientation anchors early (bloodhound, scrapyard, phonograph). One meaningful tightening when the leaf's veins reveal coordinates. The final image of glowing leaves and "connection was still possible" carries felt cost—they spent years apart, and the riddle structure itself encodes the difficulty of bridging that gap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The scrapyard settlement, cracked wasteland, and fallen-dish-antenna shelter provide concrete spatial grounding and reinforce the post-war desolation. The preserved leaf in wax functions as micro-setting: its amber translucence constrains Finder's discovery (she must hold it to lamplight at the right angle), and the object charges the final image when paired with Crow's maple leaf. Sensory detail is selective—"wind whistling through gaps," "twisted metal bones"—and filtered through Finder's tracker perspective. The communications hub and satellite bones anchor the journey's endpoint with purpose-driven specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Finder can cross the distance (literal and emotional) to reconnect with Crow. One clear tightening when the leaf's coordinates point west, narrowing options from passive receipt of the cylinder to active three-day journey. The reunion beat pivots on Crow's test: "I needed to know if you still remembered how to read what others miss"—Finder's skill under pressure earns the closure. The cost is legible: fifteen years of war, scatter, silence, and the implicit vulnerability of hoping again. No antagonist required; the wasteland and emotional distance provide sufficient pressure under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: distance as "time, silence, all the things we couldn't say" is dramatized in the riddle structure, not merely stated. The preserved leaves function as non-literal answer to the central question—beauty and connection endure even after destruction—without moralizing. Crow's cylinders as "bridges to build" and "secret texts describing not what was lost, but what remained" offer thematic resonance earned by the prior scavenger-tracker imagery. The ending's "tinted revelation" (seeing through amber, reading hope instead of death) reweights the opening's attempt to forget, with the conceptual cost clear: they must choose to translate distance rather than retreat into isolation. Minor penalty for "some distances were meant to be crossed," which edges toward summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Finder's perceptual signature: "reading landscapes like text, intuitively descriptive in every gesture." Diction stays consistent—"wild hush," "twisted metal bones," "cracked earth"—with a slightly elevated post-apocalyptic register that fits the reflective tracker voice. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven: Crow's "Why the riddle?" and Finder's answer pursue the thematic stakes directly. Psychic distance compresses appropriately during the leaf-decoding beat. Minor deduction for occasional filter-verb stacking ("she'd carried," "she saw") and one phrase—"translate distance into closeness"—that repeats nearly verbatim from narration into dialogue, reducing naturalism slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively across beats; the leaf-decoding sequence tightens syntax while the reunion slows to accommodate reflection. Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or theme. Minor scaffold appears in the war-backstory paragraph ("tracked bodies through rubble and ash, her intuition reading landscapes like text, intuitively descriptive in every gesture")—the final clause feels like prompt-element insertion rather than organic voice. The phrase "wild hush" recurs three times, charged with meaning each time, so no loop penalty. Sentence openings vary. One clarity slip: "translate the distance between them into something closer" in the penultimate paragraph paraphrases the motivation already stated, adding −0.2 for near-redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic tracker premise is familiar, but the specific synthesis—phonograph-cylinder riddles, wax-preserved leaves as maps, bloodhound intuition applied to emotional reconnection—feels purposeful rather than templated. The grooves-as-secret-texts conceit and the amber-medium reveal (veins forming letters visible only at the right angle) offer fresh micro-inflections. The transformation test passes: swapping names or setting would lose the scavenger-logistics and the "reading what others miss" throughline. Risk is present in the quiet, lyric closure and the choice to center two older women reconnecting rather than a high-action plot. Deduction for the autumn-leaf object, which tilts slightly toward symbolic convenience (beauty preserved in amber is a stock post-war image), though its dual function as map mitigates this.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Finder's bloodhound-tracker identity is signaled early, drives the cylinder-decoding choice (she recognizes the grooves as deliberate), enables the leaf-interpretation beat (her skills return during the journey), and shapes the reunion's stakes (Crow tests whether she "still remembered how to read what others miss"). Present across setup, middle choice, and closure with causal pressure and visible cost (the journey, the emotional risk). The exact role—retired body-tracker—charges the thematic shift from finding the dead to finding the living.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The wax-preserved autumn leaf appears early (Finder's shelf), drives the key middle beat (she holds it to lamplight, decodes the vein-map, gains coordinates), and returns at closure (paired with Crow's maple leaf, glowing on the table, symbolizing connection). Three distinct beats with evolving function: keepsake, map, and thematic reprise. Causal pressure is high—the story's central turn depends on the leaf's hidden map. The exact properties (amber translucence, light-angle requirement, vein structure) matter and are irreplaceable. Cost connection is clear: the leaf's beauty and the risk of hoping again intertwine.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Tinted revelations" appears as the leaf-through-amber discovery (truths visible when light passes through at the right angle) and thematically in the final image (reweighted perception of hope). Setup is present early (the leaf), development occurs in the decoding beat, and payoff is woven into the ending's "tinted revelation that even after everything, connection was still possible." The concept shapes one key turn and charges the closure but remains somewhat ornamental—swapping "tinted" for "hidden" or "angled" would preserve the story's logic. It colors the method more than it constrains tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" is established early ("reading landscapes like text, intuitively descriptive in every gesture"), enables the cylinder and leaf decoding (Finder traces grooves "feeling more than seeing"), and underpins Crow's closure test. Present across setup, middle action, and payoff with causal pressure—her intuition is the skill being tested and affirmed. The trait is specific to her tracker background and irreplaceable in the riddle-solving structure. Slight deduction for the phrase appearing once as a direct label in the opening rather than being fully dramatized through action alone, but subsequent beats embody it well.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The riddle ("Where autumn sleeps in amber walls, the first truth waits") is the inciting incident, drives the central decoding sequence (Finder solves it via the wax leaf), and frames the closure (Crow has "more cylinders, more riddles—not puzzles to solve, but bridges to build"). Setup, development, and payoff are all present with strong causal linkage. The riddle's exact wording and the method of encoding (voice + grooved text) are indispensable—removing it would collapse the plot. Charges the thematic stakes (translation, distance, secret texts). The story is built around this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The method is signaled in the second paragraph (Finder plays the cylinder, hears the riddle), developed in the third beat (she discovers "secret texts encoded in the spiral, meant to be read by touch as much as sound"), and motivates the entire middle sequence. Mechanics matter: the dual encoding (voice + tactile grooves) provides coordinates. Present across setup and development; implicit at closure (Crow's other cylinders use the same method). Causal pressure is high and the method is irreplaceable—no other medium would allow the tactile-reading layered with audio. Cost is felt in the effort and skill required to decode.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The scrapyard settlement is anchored early, provides spatial grounding, and supplies the salvaged phonograph player as a resource. The cracked wasteland shapes the three-day journey (harsh terrain, isolation) and reinforces post-war desolation. The communications hub built from satellite bones at the endpoint offers a purposeful destination. Setup and middle involvement are clear; the setting pressures choices (the journey's difficulty, scarcity) and charges atmosphere. However, the exact scrapyard details (twisted metal bones, corrugated walls) are somewhat replaceable with other post-war imagery—"cracked wasteland" could be swapped for "ash plains" without major structural loss. The setting does meaningful work but isn't indispensable to the closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the last resource war ended" is established early and contextualizes the characters' trauma, the scrapyard setting, and the scarcity. The timeframe motivates Finder's retirement and shapes the stakes (years of silence, the need to reconnect). However, it functions primarily as backdrop—removing the war reference and replacing it with generic post-disaster setting would preserve the story's logic with minor edits. The timeframe enables rather than constrains; it's functional but somewhat replaceable. It does not tighten a live decision on the page or create a ticking clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Translate distance into closeness" is stated explicitly by Crow and implicitly drives Finder's journey and decoding work. Setup is present early (Finder's isolation, attempt to forget), development occurs in the riddle-solving and westward journey (physical translation of distance), and payoff is the reunion and Crow's explanation: "distance isn't just space...it's time, silence, all the things we couldn't say." The motivation is dramatized through conflicted choices—Finder's pulse quickens, she must cross the wasteland despite wanting to forget—and the cost is legible (vulnerability, risk of hoping again). The exact phrasing recurs at closure, reweighting the opening isolation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Wild hush" appears three times: Finder's shelter, the reunion settlement, and the closing image. The phrase creates a consistent atmospheric signature—quiet desolation layered with underlying presence—that modulates across the story (urgent in the decoding beat, contemplative at closure). Tone is coherent through turns and charges the final image: "two people who'd learned to read death were learning, slowly, intuitively, to read hope instead" within the "wild hush." The exact phrase is somewhat ornamental (replaceable with "eerie silence" or "vast quiet"), but its recurrence with shifting meaning elevates it to a lyric reprise that reweights the stake. Tone supports rather than constrains; it colors every beat without forcing a specific choice.</comment>
