<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kira's interiority is concrete and purposeful—"awkwardly confident in her purpose even when that purpose felt like smoke between her fingers" embodies contradiction. Her choice to return tomorrow and gather others is earned by the evening's revelation. Micro-choices (walking barefoot, raising the opera glasses, entering the circle) reveal hierarchy of values. The rebellion's failure reframed as pause shows internal shift with cost: she commits to an uncertain path, prophet or fool.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~100 words cleanly. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through stone-hum-starlight layering until the final paragraph reweights "paused rebellion" as cosmic patience, a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (she must convince others of an unprovable hum-frequency insight). The escalation is a single decisive deepening: her perception shifts from defeat to resonance, narrowing her next move to ritual gathering. Cost is legible in "unsure if she was prophet or fool" and the stakes of tomorrow's persuasion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Spaceport detail (warm concrete, oil stains, shattered dome) grounds early. The stone circle constrains her choice: she must stand barefoot to feel the hum, and the hum drives her revelation. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (barefoot grounding, chest-cavity vibration). The circle's alignment with stars supplies the pattern she translates into action. Micro-setting (stones, opera glasses, bare feet) charges the final image of resonance and home-path memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discover meaning to reignite rebellion, signaled early. One meaningful deepening: the hum and star-pattern shift her understanding from noise to frequency, narrowing her tactic to ritual assembly. Agency is renunciation of strategy for embodied alignment, with visible cost—she bets credibility on an untestable insight. No explicit antagonist needed; pressure coheres through her internal doubt and the rebellion's dormancy. The escalation fits Accumulative lens: density of sensation (hum, stars, stones) tightens to a crystallized stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—patience, cyclical time, resonance over force—emerges from stones, stars, and the hum without thesis statements. The final image (barefoot departure, feet remembering every step) offers a non-literal answer to "how to begin again": bodily alignment with ancient rhythms rather than declarative plan. Subtext operates in "awkwardly confident," "prophet or fool," and the opera glasses' delicate incongruity. Quiet ending earns resonance through stone-star-hum particulars that reweight prior fury into patient frequency. No moralizing intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV stable, third-limited on Kira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature: barefoot grounding, stargazer's pattern-seeking, and the opera glasses as lens for invisible markings. Diction ("smoke between her fingers," "monuments to commerce," "thunderous serenity") is voice-consistent and purposeful. No dialogue present. Psychic distance tightens during the hum sequences. Register occasionally elevates ("celestial mechanics," "tuning fork for human intention") but reads as Kira's educated idiom rather than drift. Compression under pressure (final paragraph) maintains texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. Information density high: most lines advance atmosphere, character insight, or thematic charge. Minor scaffold: "awkwardly confident" repeated verbatim in final paragraph; "hum" appears frequently but functionally distinct each time. "Thunderous serenity" and "margin of daylight" recur purposefully to charge closure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language (ribcages, smoke, tuning fork) stays coherent and serves the accumulative design. Propulsion steady through twilight to night transition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rebellion-lull + ancient stone circle + stargazing combines familiar elements into a specific synthesis: bodily resonance as political renewal strategy. The opera glasses twist the stargazer trope with mother-of-pearl incongruity. Transformation test: plot and arc depend on this exact setting (stones aligned to stars) and Kira's particular lens (barefoot + opera glasses + astronomical training). Final reconfiguration—fury into frequency—grows from prior particulars (hum, constellation mirror, Navigator myth). Risk: trust in sensory-mystical insight without concrete plan. Not radically novel but purposefully integrated.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Barefoot stargazer present throughout: barefoot grounds her physically to hum, stargazing drives pattern recognition, opera glasses enable spiral-vision. Her choice to gather others tomorrow is the key turn. Setup early, develops through hum-interaction, payoff in tomorrow's plan. Causal pressure: without barefoot contact and star-pattern reading, no revelation occurs. Cost tied to her uncertainty (prophet or fool). Two distinct beats (approach/hum, revelation/plan).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Opera glasses appear in paragraph two (early signal), used twice: first to see invisible spirals on stones, second to trace Navigator constellation. Lyric reprise in "mother-of-pearl inlay catching… amber light" charges delicacy theme. Functional but somewhat replaceable—any precision tool could serve. No direct closure participation; the plan to return does not hinge on the glasses. Two-beat involvement and specificity (vintage, mother-of-pearl) lift score, but swappability and no payoff at ending limit higher range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lull in rebellion frames the entire stake: "fallen silent… in exhaustion," "righteousness without direction was just noise." Core concept shapes her discovery that the pause is necessary, not failure. Development: her realization "rebellion hadn't failed. It had paused" reweights the lull from defeat to cosmic rhythm. Payoff: tomorrow's gathering plan is explicitly a reignition timed to the lull's natural end. Causal pressure: without the lull, no search for meaning; the lull generates the quest. Closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Awkwardly confident introduced early ("awkwardly confident in her purpose"), repeated verbatim in final paragraph ("awkwardly confident in her revelation"). Label-only: no on-page action where awkwardness constrains or confidence enables with visible cost. The trait colors her self-assessment but does not alter a tactical choice. Two mentions, both descriptive. No middle development or closure participation beyond theme echo. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Reignite is the ultimate goal: "reignite what had gone dormant," "strength to begin again," "transform scattered fury." Setup via "rebellion had fallen silent," development through hum-as-frequency insight, payoff in tomorrow's plan to gather and align. The action structures her revelation but is not dramatized on the page—she will reignite tomorrow, not tonight. One major beat (decision to teach alignment). Essential to motive but deferred execution lowers closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stone circle hum present from paragraph four, mechanics matter: "resonated in her chest cavity," "conducting up through her body," "tuning fork for human intention." Setup early, develops as she enters circle and feels intensification, payoff when hum becomes the method to align others. Causal pressure: without hum, no bodily frequency; without frequency, no plan. Specificity high (stones hum, alignment to stars). Three beats (approach, immersion, revelation). Closure linkage strong—hum is the reignition tool.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport repair bay anchors setting early: concrete, oil stains, skeletal ship frames, shattered dome. Supplies the stone circle discovery context (unearthed during fuel-line excavation). Micro-setting (barefoot on warm concrete/cracks) grounds her physically. Setting does not pressure a choice—she could walk the circle anywhere it existed. Postcard elements (ribcages, monuments) add atmosphere but don't alter tactics. One beat (arrival/grounding). Presence embodied but causal role weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Margin of daylight (twilight, dusk to full night) tracked beat-by-beat: "dusk gathered," "margin of daylight narrowing," "liminal time," "first stars punctured," "last light died," "night claimed completely." Timeframe tightens her window—stones "seemed most alive" at twilight, forcing this specific visit timing. Setup early, develops through light transitions, payoff in darkness when she departs with revelation complete. Causal pressure: the hum peaks at twilight; wrong time = weaker effect. Three beats, closure linkage clear.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Discover meaning in the mess stated early ("to discover meaning in the mess they'd all made"), dramatized through barefoot searching, opera-glass examination, hum immersion. Conflicted: "purpose felt like smoke between her fingers," "unsure if she was prophet or fool." Friction between want (clear direction) and cost (uncertain credibility). Development: each beat advances the search. Payoff: "she had found meaning… not an end, but a resonance." Three beats, visible cost (staking reputation on untestable hum-vision).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Thunderous serenity introduced paragraph five ("thunderous serenity of it"), repeated paragraph nine ("stones' thunderous serenity"), modulates with pressure: hum intensifies as she enters circle, then steadies into "eternal note." Tone coherent—paradox of overwhelming peace under violet twilight and ruin—charges final image of patient stars and remembered steps. Two explicit mentions, one implicit throughout hum sequences. Lyric reprise reweights the rebellion's noise into cosmic patience. Closure linkage moderate; tone supports but does not drive the turn.</comment>
