<comment>Marco's internal voice carries some specificity (the grafting metaphor coherently rooted in his profession), and Elena's conflict between Dimitri and Marco is on the page. However, the decisive choice to stay feels underearned: Elena's burn-the-letter backstory is told rather than dramatized in a prior beat that would show her wrestling with the cost. The final "relief" laugh and sitting together read as summary rather than embodied contradiction. Interiority leans toward articulate self-awareness ("intersubjective understanding") that flattens urgency at the peak.</comment>

<comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph. The lens reads Causal-Hybrid: Marco's persuasion via grafting metaphor motivates Elena's shift from declared practicality to staying, yielding a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Cost is implied—she misses the bus, risks family feud—but the final image ("we have all night to tend this particular graft") lacks visible forfeiture or a line showing what she just gave up. The closure lands but remains conceptual rather than felt on the page, preventing higher band entry.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The amber pavilion, autumn wind, and vineyard anchor the scene with vivid sensory detail filtered through Marco's professional lens (grafting, frost watch). The lantern and paper walls contribute atmosphere. However, the pavilion itself does not materially constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome; it remains a backdrop. The burned letter fragment and vineyard metaphor do more causal work than the physical setting, keeping this in the strong but not indispensable range.</comment>

<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—Elena's choice between the practical match and the forbidden one—is clear. Marco's persuasion via the grafting parallel provides one meaningful tightening that narrows her options. However, the escalation is delivered almost entirely through dialogue and metaphor rather than embodied trade-offs or visible prices paid in the moment. The final decision to stay reads as inevitable rather than a hard-won reversal with on-page cost, capping the score below 7.0 under Causal escalation standards.</comment>

<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>The "destined mismatches" theme emerges organically from the grafting metaphor and family feud particulars, avoiding overt thesis statements until the very end. The burned letter fragment gains symbolic weight as Elena lets it fall, a concrete image of renunciation. However, the final lines ("they sat together…rediscovering…what had always grown there, waiting for the right season to bear fruit") veer into summary and near-moralizing that replaces scene pressure with thematic assertion. The closing paragraph tells the reader the theme rather than letting the image do the work, triggering the −0.5 penalty for final-paragraph thematic echo.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Marco's perceptual signature (vineyard metaphors, professional detail) is consistent and distinct. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit, especially Marco's gently persuasive rhythm. However, both characters converge toward the same elevated, metaphor-rich register under emotional pressure ("intersubjective understanding," "tension waiting to become complexity"), reducing voice distinction at the peak. Free indirect style is clean, but the narration occasionally drifts into authorial summary ("Dimitri was the practical choice—everything Elena's parents wanted") that tells rather than showing through Elena's or Marco's lens.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high. However, the final two paragraphs contain paraphrase loops: "rediscovering in each other what had always grown there, waiting for the right season to bear fruit" restates the grafting metaphor without new pressure. The phrase "destined mismatches silently proving that the best unions are those everyone doubted" summarizes theme rather than advancing action. Stock metaphor reliance ("bud break in spring," "suspended in honey") and template cadence in the closing ("They sat together…as autumn deepened…waiting") dull the ending's propulsion. Apply −0.6 for loops and scaffold touching the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The grafting metaphor as a lens for romantic mismatch offers a fresh angle, and the family-feud backdrop plus vineyard setting ground the story in specific detail. However, the core arc—choosing the forbidden love over the practical match—follows a widely used template without significant transformation. The burned letter and "destined mismatches" concept echo familiar symbolic moves. The ending's reliance on extended metaphor rather than a concrete, irreversible choice or image reduces originality at the closure beat. Apply −0.5 for derivative premise structure within Q8 range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Marco ("lone vineyard sentinel") is present throughout and his persuasive choices (drawing the grafting parallel, interpreting the burned letter) drive the key turn. He is established early as the night-watcher of the vineyard, and his stance shapes Elena's decision. The metaphor he offers narrows her options and enables the closure. However, his role as literal sentinel (watching for frost or thieves) remains ornamental description; the causal work is done by his words, not his sentinel status per se. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but the sentinel attribute itself is not indispensable—he could persuade from any grounded vineyard role. Score reflects solid causal work with moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The burned letter edge appears in three distinct beats: Elena holds and examines it early, Marco studies it mid-scene, and Elena lets it fall at the closure. Each touch advances pressure: it signals her unresolved conflict, anchors Marco's grafting metaphor, and the final release dramatizes renunciation. The object's charred state (passion consuming reason) charges its symbolic weight. However, the final drop is more lyric resonance than causal necessity—the decision could land without it. Strong early signal, multiple beats, and closure participation earn this the 7–8 range, but swappability (another token of Dimitri could serve) and the fact that the object enables rather than constrains keep it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>"Destined mismatches" is seeded early through Marco's grafting metaphor ("some rootstocks and scions…reject each other…others that shouldn't work, do") and directly names the concept mid-scene. It shapes the stakes: Elena's choice between the match everyone expects and the one everyone doubts. The concept reappears in the final image ("each destined mismatch silently proving") to reweight prior material. However, the concept's causal work is somewhat diffuse—it informs theme and metaphor more than it constrains a single hard choice on the page. Strong thematic integration and closure linkage, but moderate irreplaceability (the story could pivot on "forbidden love" or "family feud" with similar effect).</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Gently persuasive" is demonstrated on the page: Marco's tone ("May I?"), his patient metaphor-building, and the callback to convincing Elena to climb the oak tree all show the trait in action. It enables the key turn—his persuasion narrows Elena's options and moves her toward staying. However, the trait does not visibly constrain or impose a cost; Marco's gentleness succeeds without friction or tradeoff. The attribute is present across beats and shapes the ending, but lacks the felt price or irreplaceability for higher bands. Strong functional integration, moderate causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"Rediscover" is named explicitly late ("help you rediscover what you already know but keep burying") and echoed in the final lines ("rediscovering in each other what had always grown there"). The action frames the closure as recognition rather than new decision. However, it is introduced past the midpoint without prior setup, and the mechanics remain abstract—Elena does not dramatize the rediscovery through a specific memory or sensory beat that changes her stance. The concept shapes the thematic resolution but does not drive a distinct causal beat with cost. Late signal and summary use cap this in the mid-range despite closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>"By drawing parallels" (the grafting metaphor as persuasive method) is seeded early, developed across multiple beats (Marco explains grafting, applies it to the letter, extends it to family feud), and directly enables the closure—Elena's shift hinges on Marco's metaphorical reframing. The method is shown in action, not merely asserted, and its mechanics (vineyard knowledge applied to relationship) are specific and consistent. However, the method could be replaced by another form of analogy or persuasion without breaking the plot. Strong causal pressure, early signal, and closure linkage, but moderate swappability keeps it shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>The "amber pavilion in autumn" is established early, anchors the entire scene spatially, and contributes vivid atmosphere (golden light, paper walls, wind rattling panels). Autumn appears in the opening and closing. However, the pavilion does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome—the conversation and decision could occur in any private space. The setting enhances tone and grounds the reader but remains backdrop. Early signal and consistent presence earn mid-range; lack of causal pressure or closure necessity prevents higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>"After the final bus departs a vacant station" is established in the opening line and creates a ticking-clock premise: Elena has missed the bus, implying she must wait until morning. The timeframe resurfaces near the end ("The next bus isn't until morning") to frame the all-night window for decision. However, the deadline does not materially tighten tactics or force a harder choice—Elena's decision to stay precedes the explicit acknowledgment of the time constraint. The element is present and logically consistent but does not drive escalation. Late explicit mention, weak causal pressure, and swappability (any isolated-evening scenario would serve) place this in the functional-but-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.6</grade>
<comment>"To nurture intersubjective understanding" is named explicitly mid-scene ("I know intersubjective understanding when I feel it—when two people don't just comprehend each other's thoughts but share the space between them"). Marco's goal is shown through his patient persuasion and metaphor-building. However, the motivation is introduced relatively late, articulated in abstract academic register that clashes with the vineyard setting, and lacks friction—Marco's desire to nurture does not face a visible cost or competing want on the page. The motivation informs his tactics but is not dramatized through conflicted choice. Functional presence, moderate thematic coherence, but low irreplaceability and weak cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>"Passionate subtlety" is maintained across the piece: Marco's fervent but careful words ("his words careful but fervent," "his passion leaking through his subtle approach"), the amber-glow atmosphere, and the quiet intensity of the final image all cohere. The tone modulates with pressure—rising slightly as Marco becomes more direct, then settling into the charged stillness of the ending. However, the final paragraphs drift toward overt summary and thematic assertion ("destined mismatches silently proving") that undercuts subtlety. Strong coherence through most beats and purposeful modulation, but the ending's explicitness prevents full payoff.</comment>
