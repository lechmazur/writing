<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marta's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("memories felt thin, like paint watered down too many times"), and her methodical-yet-playful approach influences her reactions. The nested awakening structure creates genuine uncertainty about her state, driving contradictory impulses. However, the final choice to "let herself fall backward into sleep, or forward into waking" lacks visible cost—she smiles and embraces ambiguity without foreclosing a path or paying a legible price for the shift from certainty-seeking restorer to uncertainty-embracing dreamer.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation quickly (restorer, garden, three years of work) and operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, layering nested awakenings that deepen the dominant stake (certainty vs. curiosity). The hobo nickel discovery triggers the first tightening, and repeated "waking" cycles intensify pressure. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marta chooses to embrace recursive dreaming rather than demand objective reality. However, the cost remains conceptual and felt rather than visible—no concrete forfeit or consequence appears on the page, only her smile and willingness to "begin again," which reads as liberation without trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vivid and particular: sculptured hedges that redirect sound, humming stone pathways, whispering fountains. The amphitheater's curved walls and the garden's acoustic properties constrain Marta's choices—her sung note transforms into "Are you certain?" and the wall's sonic opening charges the discovery beat. The hobo nickel functions as micro-setting, its carved face shifting across cycles to pressure her understanding. The environment directly participates in the final image, singing her "deeper" as she releases into another layer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (certainty vs. curiosity about nested awakenings) is signaled early and tightens through three discovery cycles. Marta's agency manifests as renunciation: she chooses to stop seeking objective truth and embrace recursive exploration. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens through repetition with variation—each awakening adds detail and urgency until the nickel's face becomes "urgent" and the garden "bewitches." The escalation is clear, but the final choice lacks a visible price on the page; her smile and the framing as "liberation" soften what should be a costly leap into permanent uncertainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the nested structure and Marta's professional identity: the impossibility of fixed truth, the value of curiosity over certainty. The hobo nickel's progressively wakening face and the shifting murals embody this without overt statement. The line "what if uncertainty was more honest?" risks direct articulation but is saved by being framed as Marta's question rather than authorial thesis. The final image—"another Marta picked up her brush and began again"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights restoration as an infinite recursive act. The piece avoids moralizing and sustains ambiguity without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly bound to Marta's perceptual signature—she notices sonic properties, paint layers, and brushstrokes with restorer-specific filtering. Diction remains controlled and voice-consistent ("methodically playful," "paint watered down too many times"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the nested awakenings. No head-hopping or POV leakage. The prose rhythm accelerates subtly through the cycling structure, and the final paragraph's syntax ("or forward into waking") mirrors the thematic ambiguity without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most sentences advance situation, perception, or theme. The opening anchors setting and character efficiently. Minor template-cadence issue: "Each time, the murals were different... Each time, she found herself... Each time, she remembered" runs three identical stems in succession, creating mild monotony (−0.4). The figurative language ("memories felt thin, like paint watered down") is specific and voice-motivated. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative pressure without stalling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination of mural restoration, acoustic garden, nested awakenings, and hobo nickel as threshold object feels fresh and purposefully integrated rather than checklist-driven. The "methodically playful" characterization transforms the nested-dream trope through occupational specificity. The concept of sound as both medium and bewitch agent is non-obvious. However, the nested-awakening frame echoes widely used metafictional templates; the story elevates it through the acoustic mechanics and the restorer's professional lens, but the core structure remains recognizable. Risk-taking in the recursive structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Present by paragraph one (setup). Marta's choice to pry the nickel loose triggers the sonic opening (development beat). Her final decision to "let herself fall backward into sleep" and embrace recursion shapes the ending (payoff). Her professional methodical-playful stance enables her to accept uncertainty rather than demand proof. Two beats plus closure participation; causal pressure moderate; cost unclear on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph two (setup). The nickel's carved face shifts across three cycles, each time more awake, creating pressure and marking progression (three beats: discovery, shifting eyes, urgent stare). It appears in the final image ("burned warm against her hip, its carved face now grinning") with reweighted meaning—artifact becomes mirror. Causal: its removal opens the wall sonically. Strong closure linkage and specificity; irreplaceable. Cost connection is conceptual (acceptance of recursive identity).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Signaled in paragraph three ("This was the third time today she'd 'woken up'"), establishing the pattern early (setup). Shapes Marta's central stake and choices across all middle beats: each cycle narrows her confidence in objective reality and forces her to choose between restoration-as-fact or exploration-as-infinite (development). The concept structures the ending, where she embraces "another layer" and "another Marta" (payoff). It redefines options rather than merely providing atmosphere. Causal pressure high; closure linkage strong; visible cost moderate (she smiles, so the price feels muted).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mentioned in paragraph one as description of her restoration approach and in paragraph five as "methodically playful expression she recognized from her own reflection." The trait informs her willingness to imagine conversations with dead painters and later to embrace uncertainty (middle friction), but it does not visibly constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. Primarily label-level; payoff in the mirror moment is lyric rather than causal. Two gates (setup, payoff); one beat with moderate integration; swappable with "curious" or "flexible" without major loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The garden "bewitches" her in paragraph six ("felt like bewitchment—not coercion, but invitation"), and the murals' pulsing light intensifies the effect. The action drives her final choice to release into another layer. However, "bewitch" as labeled phenomenon appears late (second half) and is described rather than enacted—she is told the effect is bewitchment, and she agrees. Setup marginal; development present; payoff moderate. Causal pressure moderate; one clear beat; cost unclear. If "bewitch" were replaced with "persuade" or "call," minimal edits needed.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph one ("every surface sang back," "sculptured hedges shaped to catch and redirect sound") and used in paragraph two (wall opens "sonically" when nickel is removed). Marta sings a note in paragraph three, and the garden transforms it into "Are you certain?"—a key beat that reframes her stance. The method shapes the discovery mechanism and the ending ("The garden sang her deeper"). Three beats; early signal; causal pressure; closure linkage strong. Mechanics matter and are shown. Moderate irreplaceability (could be visual shimmer, but sound fits the restorer's perceptual bias well).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Established in paragraph one with concrete detail (amphitheater, sculptured hedges, stone pathways, fountains). The acoustic properties enable the sonic opening of the wall and transform Marta's sung note into a question (two development beats). The setting's recursive echo structure mirrors the nested awakenings thematically and provides the mechanism for bewitch. Appears in the final image ("The garden sang her deeper"). Early setup; two middle beats; strong payoff; causal and thematic integration; irreplaceable given the acoustic logic. Minor deduction: could function as "magic mirror room" with edits, but the specificity elevates it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Mentioned in paragraph one ("She worked in the pause between question and reply, that suspended moment when the garden held its breath before answering") and reprised in the final paragraph ("in the pause between question and reply, it no longer mattered which direction was which"). Functions as lyric frame and metaphor for liminality, but does not constrain Marta's choices or create urgency—she has no deadline, no time pressure. Setup and payoff present; no middle development. Two gates; lyric reprise reweights meaning moderately; no causal pressure. Swappable with "threshold" or "in-between."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Desire is articulated in paragraph five ("what if curiosity was more valuable than conclusion?") and dramatized in her final choice to embrace uncertainty over restoration-as-fact. The motivation drives the ending beat and is earned by the prior cycles that erode her confidence. However, the want is declared late (second half) rather than shown in early choices, and the friction between wanting certainty (her career) and wanting curiosity is more told than enacted in micro-choices. Setup marginal; development moderate; payoff strong. Causal linkage moderate; cost felt but not visible.</comment>
