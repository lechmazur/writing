<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Keeper's characterization operates through reflection on millennia of experience, with clear emotional contradiction ("otherworldly sentimentalist," "troubling serenity," "peculiar grief their kind called 'hope'"). Internal conflict appears in the tension between enduring duty and inevitable disappointment, though the protagonist remains observational throughout—no on-page micro-choices alter present tactics or force a trade-off with visible cost. The final act of releasing seeds is continuation, not a choice that forecloses a path, limiting the score under the agency requirement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly (who: the Keeper; where: nebula garden; when: "today's work"). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers reflection on past cycles, present calculation via the gear, and seed-release ritual to deepen the thematic weight of hope despite pattern-proven futility. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—the Keeper resumes transit "already listening for the next civilization's call" after the calculating machine gear confirms the inevitable arc, accepting endless repetition with visible emotional cost ("peculiar grief," "inevitable sorrow"). The cost is felt but oblique; the choice to continue is portrayed as compulsion rather than a decision that narrows options on the page, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nebula garden is vividly rendered through purposeful sensory detail (phosphorescent blooms, rose and amber convergence, sonar-mapped clouds) and the calculating machine gear functions as micro-setting, constraining the Keeper's verification ritual. The environment charges the final image: the luminous clouds frame the protagonist's solitary transit and the seed-release action. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the sequence; the garden's "approximates infinity" quality subtly mirrors the Keeper's unending task, though the constraint on choice is light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: can the Keeper sustain hope in the face of pattern-proven futility? The calculating machine gear provides one tightening beat (confirms the generational arc), and the seed-release decision follows, but both beats extend rather than narrow options—no trade-off or path foreclosure with on-page cost. The protagonist's agency reads as endurance under pressure rather than a choice that alters tactics. Escalation is present as accumulative deepening (reflection on past failures → gear calculation → hopeful release → resumption of transit) under the Accumulative lens, but the final act feels like ritual continuation rather than a decision with legible price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the central question—can light shared without fire endure across generations?—is answered through the Keeper's ritual and the calculating machine gear's verdict, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image ("wonder and inevitable sorrow in equal measure") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a thesis. Subtext operates in the tension between the protagonist's hope and the gear's mechanical truth, and the seed-release becomes a recurring act of faith despite evidence. The piece resists false balance and embraces complexity; the only limitation is that the thematic resolution feels slightly tidy given the accumulative weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and apt; the narrative voice carries distinct texture ("otherworldly sentimentalist," "sonar pinging," "breathing junction") with controlled diction that reflects the Keeper's millennia-long perspective. Perceptual signature is consistent: sensory detail filtered through ancient duty and cosmic scale. No dialogue present. Free indirect style is clean, and the internal voice modulates appropriately under pressure (serenity → grief → hope). Minor register drift in a few lines ("cascading chain reaction," "quantum arrangements") edges toward technical abstraction without strong POV coloring, but voice remains coherent overall.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and high information density; sentences often do multiple jobs (e.g., "They harvested seeds from the most stable blooms, each one pulsing with patient luminescence" advances action, image, and theme). Figurative language is purposeful without overwriting. Minor loop observed: "sonar pinging" appears three times with near-identical phrasing ("pulse-nodes singing their sonar pinging," "sending sonar pinging ahead," "The sonar pinging echoed back"), creating template cadence in a recurring action beat (−0.4 in Q7 per the Paraphrase-loop and Template-cadence checks). Propulsion is steady; no clarity issues touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic gardener, bioluminescent seeds, and generational futility offers a specific angle on cycle-of-hope narratives. The calculating machine gear as physical computation artifact and "sonar pinging" as navigation method provide concrete, non-obvious details that ground the speculative frame. The emotional truth—enduring duty despite pattern-proven failure—resonates without sentimentality. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat, though the arc (hope → calculation → hope renewed) follows a familiar emotional template. Transformation test: the core would survive with different names, limiting freshness slightly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character "otherworldly sentimentalist" is setup in paragraph one, developed through reflection on past cycles and present ritual (calculating machine gear, seed selection), and present in the closure beat ("already listening for the next civilization's call"). The trait shapes tone and motivation but does not drive a key turn—observation and continuation dominate; no pivotal decision alters tactics. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is reflective rather than choice-driven. Lyric resonance is present but agency cost is low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Object "calculating machine gear" is setup early (paragraph four), used on-page in a distinct beat (engages with "sound like distant bells," produces readings), and its verdict ("time for a new seeding") drives the seed-selection action. Appears in or shapes the closure beat indirectly (the gear's truth frames the Keeper's resumption of transit). Three gates met; causal pressure is moderate (enables verification but does not narrow options with high cost); specificity is strong ("brass and impossibly intricate, teeth worn smooth"). Score reflects two-beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Core concept "generational patterns" is setup early (paragraph one: "memories of six thousand species"), developed through the calculating machine gear's calculation ("mathematics of five hundred gift-cycles"), dramatized in the middle beats (Architects, Choir Collective examples), and shapes the final image (Keeper resumes transit despite pattern-proven futility). The concept constrains the protagonist's emotional stance and drives the story's dominant stake (can hope persist?). Three gates met; causal pressure is high; closure participation is direct. Irreplaceability is strong—remove generational patterns and the story's logic collapses.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Attribute "approximates infinity" is setup in paragraph two ("stretches farther than any probe had measured, regenerating faster than decay could claim it") and reprised in the final third ("serene and infinite"). The trait colors setting and tone but does not constrain an on-page action with cost—it remains descriptive rather than tactical. Two gates met (setup, payoff as lyric reprise); middle development is absent. Swappability is moderate; "endless" or "boundless" would function similarly. Score reflects lyric resonance without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Action "transit" is setup early ("solitary transit"), recurs in the middle (harvesting, preparing seeds), and frames closure ("resumed their transit"). The action is continuous and ritual-like rather than a discrete turn that redefines options. Three gates met; beat involvement is high (present across the arc); causal pressure is moderate (transit is the ongoing condition, not a pivot). The final resumption of transit charges the ending but does not alter stakes or tactics—it confirms endurance. Score reflects presence across beats and closure linkage but limited decisiveness.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Method "sonar pinging" is setup in paragraph one ("pulse-nodes singing their sonar pinging"), used on-page in two distinct beats (mapping the garden, mapping delivery routes in paragraph ten), and present in closure ("The sonar pinging echoed back"). Three gates met; the method enables navigation and verification but does not shape a key turn or choice—it is consistent tool use without escalation or cost. Specificity is moderate; another mapping method would function similarly with minor edits. Score reflects three-gate presence and closure participation but low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting "nebula garden" is setup in paragraph two, developed through vivid sensory detail (rose and amber convergence, phosphorescent blooms), supplies the seeds that the Keeper harvests, and frames the closure image ("pulsed around them, serene and infinite"). Three gates met; the garden provides resources (seeds) and charges the final image but does not pressure a choice or alter tactics—it is stage rather than constraint. Beat involvement is high; causal pressure is light. Score reflects strong atmospheric integration and closure linkage but limited tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Timeframe "across the quiet sigh of falling petals" appears once in paragraph two as metaphorical description of the garden's regeneration cycle. It does not anchor the story's narrative clock, tighten decisions, or shape tactics on the page—time remains vague and untracked throughout. One gate met (setup as image); middle development and closure participation are absent. The phrase is lyrical but ornamental; remove it and the story's temporal logic is unchanged. Score reflects poetic presence without functional constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation "to share light without using fire" is setup in paragraph two (bioluminescent seeds, teaching method), developed through reflection on past failures (species return to fire), dramatized in the middle beats (Architects, Choir examples), and shapes the seed-release choice and closure (Keeper resumes sharing despite futility). Three gates met; the motivation drives the dominant stake and is tested with visible emotional cost ("peculiar grief," "inevitable disappointment"). Friction between the want (civilizations to sustain the gift) and the cost (pattern-proven failure) is clear on the page. Score reflects strong causal pressure and closure linkage with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone "troubling serenity" is setup early ("old, troubling serenity settling into their core"), modulates through the arc (grief, hope, calculation), and charges the final image ("serene and infinite, a living monument...never quite enough"). The tone is coherent across beats and deepens under pressure; the oxymoron (troubling + serenity) mirrors the protagonist's internal contradiction. Three gates met; the tone shapes perception and reweights the closure without obscuring clarity. Score reflects strong tonal control and closure participation with emotional cost made legible.</comment>
