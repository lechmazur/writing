<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is present but operates at a distance from genuine pressure. Her "accidentally prophetic" trait is mentioned twice (fish/squid, salvage captain) but never constrains an on-page choice or creates visible cost. The interiority relies heavily on stock lighthouse-keeper competence without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final logbook entry ("someone will understand what we're really doing here") gestures toward insight without dramatizing struggle or foreclosing a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph (pass orientation test). Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: the final image of "ancient light shaping everything new" reweights the premise, but the cost remains abstract—no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift tied to Mara's prophetic utterances or the wick's function. The storm sequence provides a continuous thread but no meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options; ships "alter course in perfect synchronization" without Mara's agency driving that change. The escalation is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse, glass wick, and stellar alignment charts supply vivid, purpose-driven detail that constrains ritual sequence. The wick's "total internal reflection" channels constrain the light-steering action at closure. Sensory hierarchy (rainwater, copper bowls, green beam slicing rain) is filtered through Mara's occupational lens. The micro-setting of the lamp room and the glass wick's internal galaxies charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment or object constrain choice or charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early: steering ships to safety. The storm peaks and ships respond, but Mara's agency is passive observation—she adjusts the wick, then watches the beam "somehow pulling, guiding." No on-page tightening forces a trade-off or narrows options; the prophetic asides (salvage captain, fish flying) never escalate into tested choices. The resolution (dawn breaking green) lands without visible cost or renunciation. Coincidence (the storm, the ships) drives outcome more than protagonist decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of "ancient shadows shaping new beginnings" emerges through the glass wick, archaic maps, and Mara's ritual, avoiding overt statement until the final logbook line. The recurring green light and the wick's internal reflections create modest subtext around preservation and obsolescence (newspapers crumbled, logs unread). However, the prophetic utterances (fish, captain, "someone will understand") remain ornamental rather than thematically tested—no counter-pressure or ambiguity complicates Mara's stance. The ending image is resonant but lacks a non-literal answer to a dramatized question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV throughout with stable third-limited distance. Perceptual signature is present: Mara notices maritime memories in glass walls, stellar positions on charts, and photon paths. Diction remains mostly consistent, though "shadowed elation" and "peculiar joy found only in darkness" veer toward explanatory summary. Dialogue to the empty tower ("Another beauty rolling in") carries voice but no subtext or goal pursuit. The rhythmic control during the storm sequence ("hammered," "slice," "pulsed") supports pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the piece maintains forward momentum through the ritual sequence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "laughing as dark clouds gathered" / "still chuckling" / "found herself laughing again" recycles the same character note without added pressure. The phrase "otherworldly routine" is both a concept label and a thematic echo that abstracts rather than dramatizes. Filter-verb stacks in the lamp-room sequence ("felt the familiar surge," "saw three ships alter course") dull immediacy. No proximity to famous lines; clarity remains high despite moderate density loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The glass wick using total internal reflection offers a fresh technological angle on lighthouse fiction, and the "accidentally prophetic" trait provides a non-obvious character hook. However, the prophetic utterances remain ornamental set-dressing rather than driving turns or escalation. The storm-herald role and ritual structure follow familiar beats without transformation: competent keeper performs sequence, storm passes, ships saved. The "otherworldly routine" concept is declared more than dramatized through specific, grounded choices. Emotional specificity is present in Mara's isolation but the arc itself (ritual → success → reflection) trends template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara appears throughout and performs the ritual sequence, but her choices are procedural (cleaning lens, aligning mirrors, inserting wick) rather than pressure-tested decisions. The prophetic laughter frames the story but does not create a key turn or alter tactics. Present in closure (watching dawn) but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass wick is introduced in paragraph two (velvet-wrapped, predecessor's artifact), handled on-page during the insertion sequence, and its mechanics (total internal reflection, trapping light, glowing green, pulsing brighter) drive the beam that steers ships. Returns in the final image as "ancient light shaping everything new." Three distinct beats (setup, ritual insertion, storm peak), causal pressure (enables steering), and closure linkage present. Swappable with another light source only by rewriting core mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Otherworldly routine" is named twice (title phrase, paragraph three) but functions as thematic label rather than stake-shaper. The ritual sequence is vivid but mundane in execution; no moment where the otherworldly aspect narrows options or generates cost. Present as atmosphere, not as a driver of on-page choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Accidentally prophetic" is demonstrated twice off-page (fish/squid three days later, salvage captain twelve miles east) but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. Mara jokes, things happen elsewhere, no trade-off. Label-only trait that could be removed without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Steer" operates throughout: the wick's beam "actively steered vessels," ships "alter course in perfect synchronization," and the final image shows "ancient light shaping everything new." Present in setup (paragraph one "storm herald"), middle (beam adjustments), and closure (dawn breaking green across waves). However, the steering is automatic once the wick is inserted—Mara's agency is maintenance, not navigation. The action shapes the central event but could be replaced with "guide" or "direct" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Total internal reflection is explained in paragraph four (photons bouncing through crystalline maze, trapped at precise angles) and shown in the storm sequence (wick glowing, pulsing, creating internal galaxies). The mechanics enable the steering function and are signaled before use. However, the method could be replaced with another light-amplification principle (fiber optics, prism array) without altering Mara's ritual or the ships' response. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse supplies the lamp room, spiral stairs, glass walls, and stellar-chart navigation. The jade walls and green beam create a coherent color motif that charges the final image. The setting constrains the ritual sequence (copper bowls, mirror alignment, wick insertion) and the tower's height enables the steering function. Present in setup, middle ritual, and closure (dawn breaking green). Could be replaced with another lighthouse color/structure with moderate edits, but the green-emerald-jade through-line shapes the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After the last print newspaper" is mentioned once in paragraph one (archives crumbled seven years ago) and again obliquely in the midnight logbook ("no one read anymore"). The timeframe does not tighten decisions, alter tactics, or shape the storm sequence. Ornamental world-building detail easily removed without affecting closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated in paragraph six and echoed in the final image ("ancient light shaping everything new"). The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; Mara's ritual proceeds without friction between old methods and new needs. Present in setup (predecessor's techniques, archaic maps) and closure (dawn image), but no middle beat where the motivation generates cost or alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Shadowed elation" is named in paragraph five and modulates across the storm sequence: laughter preceding the storm, "peculiar joy found only in darkness," chuckling mixed with thunder, and the final dawn image. Tone is coherent but static—no meaningful pressure shift or tonal deepening at closure. The laughing-herald motif recurs but does not charge the final image with undeniable pressure; it remains atmospheric rather than causally active.</comment>
