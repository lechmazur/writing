<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's interior journey from grief to understanding is embodied through her ritual photography practice and micro-choices (choosing aureolin yellow, photographing the palette itself). The discovery of Iris's message in the palette feels earned by prior causality—six months of searching transformed into fluency. Internal contradiction operates cleanly: longing to recover Iris versus learning to see absence as presence. Minor slip: the final walk-away lacks a visible cost that forecloses a path; the resolution feels more like acceptance than renunciation with stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marina discovers the scratched message and reweights her entire search—not Iris returned, but "Iris understood, translated from absence into a language made entirely of light." The cost is conceptual and felt: she must continue the vigil alone, frame by frame. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the sunrise ritual deepens from mechanical to revelatory. Orientation anchors early (librarian, archipelago, dawn). One meaningful tightening occurs when the palette message rewrites six months of grief into a communication system.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The whispering archipelago, eastern cliff, and ferry schedule create a coherent micro-world that constrains Marina's ritual to dawn hours. The watercolor palette functions as a recurring object that charges the final image when its hidden inscription is revealed. Sensory detail is purposeful (fog "like a living thing," honey light through aureolin) and filtered through Marina's grief. Minor slip: the maritime library and three-island triangle are named but don't constrain later choices; they read decorative rather than pressure-bearing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding Iris's disappearance through sunrise photography) is signaled early and tightens when Marina chooses the nearly empty aureolin pan—Iris's favorite—forcing proximity to loss. The palette-message discovery narrows options: she can no longer search for Iris's return, only for understanding. Agency is present in the choice to photograph the palette itself and the commitment to return tomorrow. Cost is felt in the renunciation of reunion and the acceptance of indefinite vigil. No second reversal required at this length; the single deepening reweights the stake sufficiently.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (love as translation, absence as language) emerges through Marina's dawn practice rather than statement. The final image—palette as "tiny oceans" holding "dissolved distances"—offers a non-literal answer to how grief transforms into communication. Subtext operates in the scratched message's six-month concealment and Marina's slow fluency in "light and longing." Minor overreach: "luminous absence" and "cipher of longing" are articulated too directly in the narration, edging toward prompt-echo rather than full dramatization, though the palette discovery earns the concept.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds steady; perceptual signature is Marina-specific (cartographer's eye, librarian's patience). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from intimate ("her hands trembled") to reflective sweep. Iris's dialogue feels natural and distinct from narration. Register slips slightly elevated in peak beats: "vitalize this runaway dream into something she could almost hold" and "perpetual translation between light and longing" drift toward lyric abstraction that edges past Marina's established idiom under emotional pressure. The vocabulary remains controlled but occasionally strains against the focalizer's lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings and lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high—nearly every line advances atmosphere or Marina's interior arc. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent (honey light, paint-wells as oceans). Deductions: "vitalize" appears three times as a thematic keyword, edging toward prompt-artifact repetition. "Cipher of longing" and "luminous absence" recur as labeled concepts rather than fully embodied images. Template stems appear twice: "She carried… She painted… She was learning…" in adjacent paragraphs. These accumulate to −0.8 in this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise (grief as language-learning through filtered photography) offers a fresh angle on disappearance narratives. The watercolor-palette-as-decoder and hidden inscription transform the familiar "letter left behind" trope through visual-art specificity. Emotional truth in Marina's slow shift from searching to translating feels earned. Minor proximity concern: "light is the only honest medium" and the general structure (daily ritual reveals hidden message) echo craft-essay and inspirational-narrative templates without full transformation. The archipelago and maritime details add texture but don't alter the emotional algebra enough to feel indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's odd-hour schedule (night desk, dawn ritual) frames the story and her choice to photograph the palette itself after discovering the message is a key turn. Present in setup, middle (palette choice), and closure (photographing the palette, committing to return). The librarian role constrains her to ferry hours and shapes her cataloging metaphor ("studied that note like a cartographer"). Her decisions—selecting aureolin, opening the palette fully, raising the camera again—drive the accumulative deepening and the final stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The watercolor palette appears in at least four beats: carried to the cliff, used as a filter/decoder, the nearly empty aureolin pan chosen, and the hidden inscription discovered. It enables Marina's photographic method (holding colors before the lens) and contains the climactic message that reweights her entire search. The palette's physical state (paint worn to metal, scratched inscription) matters causally. Removing it would collapse both the visual method and the closure revelation. Specificity and irreplaceability are high; cost is tied to its revelation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Cipher of longing" is named explicitly and operationalized: Marina decodes Iris's absence through color-filtered photography, treating each sunrise as encrypted communication. The concept shapes her stake (learning Iris's language) and her method (palette as decoder ring). It drives the middle choice (selecting aureolin to access Iris's favorite) and the closure reweighting (grief becomes fluent translation). The label appears twice in narration, edging toward theme-claim rather than pure dramatization, but the palette-message discovery enacts the decoding on the page with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is named once and demonstrated through Marina's sunrise photography practice with the palette filter. The method enables her ritual and the final palette photograph, but the exact phrase "paints with light" functions more as thematic description than a constraint with visible tradeoff. The practice matters (she wouldn't discover the message without it), but the "painting" metaphor itself is swappable with "photographs through color" or similar framing. Setup and closure participation present; middle development weaker.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Vitalize" appears three times, always tied to Marina's effort to make memory and absence concrete. The final instance ("vitalize this runaway dream into something she could almost hold") articulates her ongoing project post-revelation. However, the action itself is somewhat abstract—no single turn hinges on "vitalizing" as opposed to "capturing" or "translating." The word charges the thematic texture but remains swappable at the plot level. Lyric reprise (early use → closure) reweights the dominant stake but doesn't narrow options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sunrise photography is Marina's established method (setup), executed on the page (she shoots "frame after frame" through the aureolin filter), and culminates in photographing the palette itself after the message discovery. The practice is signaled early, shapes her middle choice (which color to use), and the camera's final click punctuates the closure beat. Mechanics matter: holding the palette before the lens, the shutter sound, the accumulation of frames. Removing this method would eliminate both the ritual structure and the closure gesture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The whispering archipelago anchors the story's geography and recurs in the final paragraph ("the whispering archipelago kept its secrets"). The three-island triangle and ferry schedule constrain Marina's ritual to dawn. The eastern cliff provides the physical platform for her practice. However, the "whispering" quality remains atmospheric rather than causal—the islands could be silent or singular without altering Marina's choices. Setup strong, closure reprise present, but middle pressure weak; the setting enables rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"The hush of improbable beginnings" frames the entire ritual timeframe (those suspended minutes between night and day) and recurs in the final reference to "improbable beginnings when the world paused between darkness and day." This temporal window constrains Marina to dawn practice and charges the closure image. The phrase itself is poetic but specific: it's the liminal moment that makes her light-painting possible. Setup, development (choosing this morning's color during the hush), and closure participation all present. The time pressure is gentle but real.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marina's desire "to capture a runaway dream" is dramatized through her six-month ritual, the choice of Iris's favorite color (bringing her closer to loss), and the discovery that the dream isn't Iris returned but "Iris understood." Friction between longing and cost is visible: she must accept indefinite vigil and renounce reunion. The motivation drives setup (daily practice), middle choice (aureolin), and closure stance (committing to return tomorrow). The "runaway" quality shifts from Iris-as-person to Iris-as-way-of-seeing, which is a meaningful transformation on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" is named once and operationalized throughout: Marina learns to photograph what isn't there, perceiving Iris in every sunrise she vitalizes. Tone is coherent—elegiac, patient, accumulative—and modulates under pressure when Marina's hands tremble at the discovery. The final image (palette wells as oceans, shutter click in vast morning) charges the tone with quiet inevitability. The piece commits fully to this tonal register from the fog pressing "like a living thing" through the "small, certain sound" at closure. Distinct, stable, and purposeful.</comment>
