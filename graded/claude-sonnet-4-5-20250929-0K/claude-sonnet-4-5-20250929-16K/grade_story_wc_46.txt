<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is consistently rendered through the polishing ritual and embodied grief. The contradiction between earthbound yearning and light-sharing mission creates internal tension. Minor slip: the daughter's laughter memory arrives as a label ("bright as wind chimes") rather than a sensory reactivation that forces a present micro-choice. The final placement choice earns the stance but could show more cost in the gesture itself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara's patient polishing reframes trauma as shared light, and the final placement crystallizes her ongoing choice with visible cost (solitary vigilance, tending rather than moving on). The accumulative lens holds cleanly—each polishing session deepens the practice. Orientation anchors early (cliffs, grotto, telescope). One minor causality question: how strangers find this hidden grotto is elided, though the notes suggest discovery has occurred.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto functions as sanctuary and frames every polishing beat; mist softens edges and charges the light-diffusion effect. The flat stone table and wall niches constrain her method. The eastern-wall gap awaiting morning sun charges the final placement. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Cap at 8.8 per the 9+ gate: the grotto pressures tone more than it narrows a tactical choice in a high-stakes beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming grief into shared light—is signaled early and coheres. The white-glass piece tightens pressure (her daughter's memory) and the eastern-wall placement deepens commitment. Visible cost: decades of solitary ritual, ongoing loss. No antagonist required under accumulative lens. One friction: the escalation is textural (adding one more piece) rather than a choice that forecloses an alternate path with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (light persists through transformation, not erasure) emerges organically from the polishing method and fire backstory. The sea-glass motif recurs with shifting weight: each shard holds memory, the collection becomes constellation. "Pearl of stillness" and "share light without using fire" integrate without thesis statement. The ending offers a resonant image—tomorrow's visitor and Mara's patient labor—that reweights grief as generative. Minor: "zephyr bloom of possibility" edges toward ornamental diction in the grotto-breathing passage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable close distance; Mara's perceptual signature (star watcher turned inward, fire-trauma lens) colors every detail. Diction is consistent and textured ("serpentine," "reflectively vibrant," "pearl of stillness"). No head-hopping. One register slip: "zephyr bloom of possibility" reads slightly elevated for the established voice under pressure. Rhythm modulates well between reflection and ritual action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; information density is high in the polishing beats. Two paraphrase loops: "as memories resurfaced" appears in paragraph 3 and 19 without added pressure; "earthbound" recurs in paragraphs 1, 11, and final without evolving meaning. Template cadence in paragraph 9–10 ("This amber shard... That green curve... The blue fragments...") teaches a pattern but stretches three beats. No major clarity breaks. Final image propels cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise—grief ritual through sea-glass polishing—synthesizes familiar transformation metaphors with specific method (gem polishing, grotto sanctuary). The fire/light opposition and star-watcher frame add dimension. Risk: the visitor notes and candle offerings are told rather than dramatized, reducing the stakes' social dimension. The white-glass daughter memory and eastern-wall choice feel earned but not surprising. Solid execution within a well-worn template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara ("earthbound star watcher") is present throughout and her polishing choices drive each beat. The final eastern-wall placement is a decision that reaffirms her sanctuary role. However, most beats are iterative ritual rather than choices that narrow options or alter tactics under new pressure. The character观察s more than she pivots.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sea glass appears in paragraphs 4–5 (pouch, pieces described), 7–13 (polishing method and memory anchors), 17 (white piece begun), 20–21 (placed in eastern wall). Handled across multiple beats, its meaning evolves from broken remnant to transformed vessel. The final placement charges closure. Specific cost: decades of collection, patient labor. Strong causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Pearl of stillness" is named in paragraph 12, demonstrated in paragraph 14 (the piece achieves that quality), and executed again in paragraph 22 (white glass achieves it). It shapes her success criterion and the ending hinges on achieving it for the new piece. However, the concept itself doesn't create tactical friction or narrow options; it's a quality she seeks rather than a constraint that costs her.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Reflectively vibrant" describes the sea glass in paragraph 5 and recurs implicitly in paragraph 18 (arranging pieces that spread light). It characterizes the aesthetic goal but doesn't enable or constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost. Largely label-only; swappable with "luminous" or "radiant" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Weigh" appears in paragraphs 4, 8 (weighing memory), 20 (weighing new piece), and 24 (others might weigh sorrows). The action frames the ritual method and the white-glass beat hinges on weighing her daughter's memory. It's threaded through escalation. However, easily replaced with "consider" or "hold" in most instances; the physicality matters less than the metaphoric work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Gem polishing is introduced in paragraph 7, detailed in paragraphs 10–14 (sand, circular motion, achieving stillness), repeated for the white glass in paragraphs 17 and 22. The method structures every transformation beat and the ending depends on completing one more polish. Mechanics matter: fine sand, patient motion, achieving a surface quality. Integral to escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto is discovered in paragraph 2, becomes the sanctuary in paragraph 6, houses the stone table and wall embeddings, and frames the final eastern-wall placement. Mist curls through entrance (paragraph 15), grotto "breathes" (paragraph 23). The setting enables her method, shields her practice, and the wall niches constrain the arrangement. The eastern gap awaiting morning sun charges the closure placement. Strong micro-setting work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"As memories resurface" appears in paragraphs 3 and 16, framing her visits. The white-glass piece triggers daughter memory in paragraph 20. The timeframe recurs but doesn't tighten a deadline or alter tactics under pressure. It's a recurring condition rather than a clock. The lyric reprise (first third to ending) reweights the ritual's ongoing nature with some cost (perpetual vigilance).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To share light without using fire" is stated in paragraph 16, dramatized in paragraph 18 (arranging glass to spread light), and enacted in the ending (placing white glass for tomorrow's visitor). Fire took her family (paragraph 17); the grotto method opposes it with shared glow. Motivation shapes the ritual and closure. Minor friction: the desire is more declared than shown in conflicted choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Zephyr bloom" appears once in paragraph 23 ("a zephyr bloom of possibility"). Tone throughout is elegiac, patient, mist-softened—coherent with the grotto and grief-transformation arc. However, "zephyr bloom" itself is ornamental in that single line and doesn't modulate pressure or charge the final image. Swappable with "breath" or "whisper." The broader tone succeeds; this phrase doesn't drive it.</comment>
