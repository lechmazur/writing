<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her role as reality checker grounds her actions, but internal conflict remains thin—she experiences "luminous doubt" as a label rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to plant the seed feels inevitable from the start rather than earned through visible struggle that forecloses other paths. Embodied emotion is present (gasping, fingers in soil) but the interiority leans toward explanation of her function rather than messy, irrational experience under pressure. The transformation reads more as completion of a task than a stance shift with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Hybrid (Causal setup → Accumulative/Textural closure through dream-space imagery and returning details). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The piece delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the seed is planted, the gray mist pauses, and specific details return ("honey and cardamom," "Kael"), reweighting the collective memory's fate with felt urgency even though weeks/months remain before fruiting. Cost is conceptual and temporal (years to bear fruit) rather than a decisive forfeiture on the page, which keeps this out of the high 8s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient ridge, blooming irises, and warm stone marker provide vivid sensory grounding and constrain Mira's choice—she must find the oldest marker before the monsoon. The dream-space's "impossible colors" and translucent figures are evocative, and the gray mist functions as a spatial antagonist. Monsoon clouds on the horizon supply temporal pressure. The seed's burial in "rich soil" and Mira's bare hands create tactile specificity that charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect cultural memory from erasure) is signaled early and tightens when Mira witnesses the gray mist consuming specifics in the dream-space. The escalation is driven by her realization that the tree's absence caused the erosion, which narrows her options to planting the seed. However, the core conflict unfolds largely in reflection and vision rather than through on-page choices that visibly foreclose alternatives; the act of planting feels like the only available path from the start, reducing felt cost. One meaningful deepening is present, but agency at closure is more completion than transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (the tension between empirical verification and collective dreaming, memory as a fragile construct requiring anchors) emerges through the knowledge fruit's chemistry and the dream-space imagery. The final image—details returning "like flowers opening to face the light before the storm"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, "empirically whimsical" and "luminous doubt" feel like imposed prompt labels rather than earned contradictions, and the closing phrase "protecting the specific truth of who her people had actually been" edges toward thematic summary. The piece invites reflection but doesn't fully resist tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Mira's perceptions. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("blooming ridge," "translucent figures," "gray mist"), with a consistent narrative texture. However, phrases like "empirically whimsical" and "luminous doubt" feel authorial rather than character-particular, creating slight register drift. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets are N/A. The dream-space transition is legible, and psychic distance shifts intentionally between waking and dreaming states. Perceptual signature is present but could be more selective and biased.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with varied sentence rhythm and no loops or scaffold. Information density is high: most lines advance situation, character knowledge, or atmosphere. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly, and the final image ("roots reaching deep into the collective dreaming") recharges earlier motifs without overexplaining. Minor register drift with "empirically whimsical" as a repeated phrase, but it doesn't obscure causality. No paraphrase loops, template cadence, or filter-verb stacks detectable. Strong line-level execution throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise (collective dreaming eroding cultural memory, restored by a botanical anchor) is specific and fresh in its synthesis of magical realism and ethnobotany. The role of "reality checker" and the knowledge fruit's chemistry offer non-obvious angles. However, the emotional arc—doubt followed by faith in planting—follows a familiar template, and the transformation test is borderline: swap the knowledge fruit for another memory-anchor and the structure holds unchanged. The piece commits fully to its premise but doesn't take bold structural or perspectival risks that elevate originality into the high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira as reality checker frames the opening and her final act (planting the seed) constitutes a key turn, but most middle beats are observational (interpreting the dream-space) rather than decisional. Her choice to plant is present early and never wavers, reducing friction. She appears in setup, dream interpretation, and closure, meeting all three gates, but causal pressure is moderate—she executes a plan rather than navigating competing options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The knowledge fruit seed is received in the opening, carried in the satchel, and planted at closure, appearing in three distinct beats. Its unique property (locking personal to cultural memory via chemistry) is irreplaceable and drives the resolution. Early signal strong, closure linkage clear, and a visible cost (years to bear fruit) attached. Removing it would break the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Collective memory shapes the central stake and every tactic: Mira's role exists to verify it, the dream-space visualizes it, the gray mist erodes it, and the seed's planting aims to restore it. The concept appears in setup, drives the dream-interpretation beat, and charges the closure image (details returning). Causal pressure is strong, closure participation undeniable, and specificity high (shared dreaming, cultural memory erosion). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Empirically whimsical" is introduced as a label describing Mira's position and repeated in the final paragraph, but it never constrains an on-page action or reveals a visible tradeoff. The phrase functions as thematic decoration rather than a trait that enables or limits choice. Present in setup and closure (lyric reprise), but ornamental; swappable with "pragmatically mystical" or similar without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Waken" appears as the archive keeper's instruction ("waken what we're losing"), drives Mira's interpretation in the dream-space (memories "trying to waken"), and charges the closure ("the knowledge fruit seed would waken beneath the earth"). The action is thematic and causal—without it, the seed's function lacks narrative charge. Present across setup, middle, and closure; reweighted meaning at each mention. Essential to the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dream interpretation is Mira's trained method, introduced early ("interpreting the collective dreams"), and the dream-space sequence (middle beat) demonstrates its mechanics: she presses palms to stone, opens herself, and witnesses memory erosion. The method enables her realization that the tree's absence caused the problem, shaping her tactic (plant the seed). Signaled in setup, used in a key beat, and its result informs closure. Causal role clear, but not revisited at the ending itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ancient ridge supplies spatial grounding, the oldest stone marker anchors Mira's ritual, and the blooming irises frame urgency (early bloom signals time running short). The ridge's soil is where the seed must be planted, and its position allows Mira to see the monsoon clouds gathering. Present in setup, middle (dream-space is "the same ridge, but transformed"), and closure (Mira's fingers in the blooming ridge). The setting constrains choice and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The monsoon deadline is introduced early ("Plant it before the rains come"), mentioned at the dream-space entry ("early bloom… time was running short"), and returns at closure ("Rain clouds gathered… the monsoon would come"). The timeframe tightens Mira's decision window and justifies her urgency, but the on-page action spans hours at most and the years-to-fruit acknowledgment undercuts immediate pressure. Functional across setup and closure; modest causal force.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Protecting cultural memory is Mira's stated purpose in paragraph two, dramatized when she watches the gray mist erase specifics in the dream-space (middle beat), and reaffirmed in the closing line ("protecting the specific truth of who her people had actually been"). The motivation drives her choice to plant the seed and her willingness to wait years for results. Friction is present (luminous doubt vs. faith), though the doubt never seriously threatens her course. Strong setup, clear closure linkage, felt cost in the long wait.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Luminous doubt" is introduced mid-story ("luminous doubt flooding her mind") and repeated in the closing paragraph ("smiled through her luminous doubt"), creating a lyric frame. The phrase itself is evocative but functions more as a label than a modulating atmospheric quality—tone remains contemplative and hopeful throughout without significant darkening or brightening under pressure. The doubt is told more than felt in moment-to-moment perception. Early-to-final reprise qualifies it for mid-band, but static mood and ornamental use prevent higher scoring.</comment>
