<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior life is richly embodied—trembling hands, accumulated silences pressing like "unfallen snow," the half-finished mask as physical manifestation of her brokenness. Her choice to "drive the needle deep" knowing it will free the boy but not grant peace shows genuine moral complexity without tidy resolution. The boy's contradiction (wanting voice over peace) adds pressure. Minor deduction: the brother's guilt and Mara's parallel brokenness feel slightly telegraphed rather than fully earned through prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors quickly (who/where/what). The story accumulates pressure through the boy's secret, then delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Mara adds a new, heavier silence to her collection and reaches for the next knot—an earned refusal of escape with visible cost ("emptier, heavier"). The cascade of unraveling is irreversible once triggered, narrowing options. Cost is legible in the final image: she continues despite accruing weight. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary fracturing starlight into "nervous colors" sets tone and recurs as her mask reflects "fractured starlight" at closure, charging the final image. The net is tactile ("salt-stiff," knots resist then yield), and Mara's tools (needle, silver wire) constrain her method. The boy's phosphorescence and the cliffs above provide spatial pressure. Minor gap: the sanctuary's vault and stone floor are noted but don't actively shape a choice mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: freeing the boy versus the cost of her accumulating silence. The boy's revelation ("my brother pushed me") tightens stakes—freedom won't equal peace, and Mara knows it. Her decision to proceed despite understanding the cost is genuine agency with trade-off. The unraveling cascade is irreversible, a visible narrowing. The brother's presence "somewhere in the night" and the heavier silence Mara adds are felt consequences. One meaningful turn with clear price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: brokenness (mask, hands, net), silence versus voice, and the gap between truth and peace. The boy chooses voice over peace; Mara's own brokenness enables her sanctuary work. The final image—adding silence and reaching for the next knot—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: endurance of weight is the work, not resolution. No moralizing. The interlaced hush as metaphor for unspoken truths is earned through action, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara with a distinct perceptual signature: she notices "salt-stiff" rope, "unfallen snow" pressure, the boy's phosphorescence through prisms. Diction matches her restorer's precision ("thread," "yield," "exhume"). The boy's dialogue is plain and child-voice without caricature ("Will it hurt?"). Psychic distance tightens during the unraveling. Minor slip: "across sharing a secret" in the narration feels slightly meta-commentative, though it coheres with the reflective tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; the opening line anchors voice and stakes. High information density (most lines advance character, action, or atmosphere). "The interlaced hush" recurs with shifting meaning. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates during the unraveling cascade. Minor artifacts: "exhume from the weave" is slightly strained (exhume typically applies to buried bodies, not woven objects); "ground you properly" carries a faint therapeutic-register echo in a peak beat. No loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—net catching drowned spirits, mask restorer with trembling hands—offers a fresh synthesis. Transformation of the "silence as burden" trope through the specific mechanics (knots, needle, cascade) feels earned. The brother's living guilt versus the boy's trapped accusation is a strong, non-obvious angle. Risk: the metaphor-heavy opening and the prism sanctuary could trend ornamental, but they charge the closure. Deduction: the "broken healer" frame is familiar; specificity (trembling hands, unfinished mask) elevates it but doesn't fully escape the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's role as broken mask restorer frames her backstory (trembling hands ended her career, leading her to the sanctuary) and motivates her work freeing spirits. Her self-aware irony ("a broken mask restorer, mending spirits instead of clay") seeds the theme. Her decision to "drive the needle deep" despite understanding the cost is the story's pivot. The restorer identity shapes her method (precision, tools) and her accumulation of silence. Present in setup, middle choice, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tapestry needle appears twice in distinct beats: threaded with silver wire mid-scene ("hands trembled") and driven "deep into the net's heart" at the climax, triggering the cascade. The needle's fineness ("the only tool fine enough") justifies its use and links to Mara's precision. It's the instrument of the central action. Not charged at closure (she reaches for "the next knot," not the needle again), and the silver wire detail feels slightly ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Interlaced hush" names the net's function (tangling spirits "in an interlaced hush that neither released them nor let them speak") and recurs when Mara realizes it has kept brother and boy separate for sixty years. The hush's dual nature—holding without peace—shapes the boy's stake (tired of silence) and Mara's method (unraveling to break it). The concept reweights at closure: "the silence that rushed back was different. Emptier. Heavier." Drives tactics and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara "accumulated silence the way others collected scars" is dramatized on the page: each freed spirit adds "its particular quiet" (the held-breath before drowning). This trait constrains her—she carries "dozens of these silences… pressing against her ribs." At closure, she "added it to her collection," a visible cost tied to her continuing the work. The accumulation explains her brokenness and her sanctuary's purpose. Trade-off legible in the heavier silence she accepts.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Exhume" names the first loosening ("She felt something exhume from the weave—not the boy, but something older, colder") and signals the unraveling's irreversible nature. The verb's specificity (unearthing/releasing) fits the story's logic. It's causally active in one key beat but not recurrant or charged at closure; the ending emphasizes the "next knot" and the added silence rather than the exhumation itself. Swappable with "release" or "emerge" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Unraveling knots in the fisherman's net is the story's engine. Setup: Mara discovers the net three months prior and understands its purpose; it's "salt-stiff and knotted with more than rope." Middle: she works the needle into a knot, feels resistance then yield, loosens one loop. Climax: driving the needle into "the net's heart" triggers "a cascade she couldn't stop." The mechanics matter—sequence, irreversibility, the net's centuries-old origin—and shape every beat. The method is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary fractures starlight into "nervous colors," setting tone and recurring when Mara's mask reflects "fractured starlight" at closure. Starlight provides the visual atmosphere (boy painted in "anxious blues and greens"). The sanctuary's role as refuge ("found by accident when she'd come here to hide") motivates Mara's presence. The cliffs above create spatial pressure (brother's proximity). Micro-setting (body, tools) arguably does more work than the sanctuary itself, which trends atmospheric rather than choice-constraining.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Across sharing a secret" is signaled mid-story ("This was the timeframe she'd learned to recognize") and frames the boy's confession ("I wasn't alone when I drowned"). The timeframe narrows the beat: the boy becomes "most real. Most dangerous, too" in this window, raising stakes. It's purposeful but not a live clock that visibly alters tactics; the unraveling proceeds without time pressure once she begins. Present in middle development and implicit at closure (the truth is now spoken).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"To ground restless spirits" is Mara's stated purpose and drives every beat: she works to free the boy, knowing it won't bring peace ("That's not the same as peace"). The boy's desire to reach his brother complicates the goal. Mara's final act—adding the silence and reaching for the next knot—enacts the motivation with visible cost (heavier silence, ongoing burden). Friction between her desire to free spirits and the weight she accumulates is legible and shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Lucid unrest" is established in the opening (fractured starlight, "nervous colors," trembling hands) and sustained through the boy's phosphorescence, Mara's "held-breath moment before drowning" silences, and the accelerating unraveling. Tone modulates from contemplative (Mara's reflection) to tense (the cascade, the screaming) to resigned weight (the "emptier, heavier" silence). The final image—broken mask reflecting fractured starlight, restless hands already moving—crystallizes the tone without resolving it. Coherent and purposeful pressure throughout.</comment>
