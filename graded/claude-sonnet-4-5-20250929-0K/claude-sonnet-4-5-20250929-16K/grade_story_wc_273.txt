<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in the brother's death, with embodied emotion in "anger was a still lake" and the tracker's "consciously wild grace." Internal contradiction appears in the push-pull between hunting for understanding versus revenge. The final choice to pursue the target is earned, though the brother's death feels somewhat told rather than fully dramatized in its pressure on present decisions. Micro-choices under pressure (kneeling to study patterns, packing the bowl) reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael's decision to follow reweights the opening anger and brother's death with undeniable cost (she will "disappear too"). The piece operates under a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage: spilled ink → patterns → drone footage → understanding of the target's method → Kael's resolve. Orientation anchors (Kael, wind-carved encampment, post-eclipse) are present early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the drone footage reveals the target stepping into patterns, narrowing Kael's options to pursuit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The wind-carved sandstone encampment supplies specific tactile detail (twisting pillars, hollowed chambers, pale rock) filtered through Kael's tracker sensibility. The ceramic bowl and disappearing ink constrain investigation choices. Spatial choreography is clean (edge of encampment → sheltered alcove). The environment charges the final image through the wind carving "new shapes...patient and relentless," mirroring Kael's resolve. Some details (pink eyes sensitive to sunlight) feel ornamental rather than choice-shaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: understanding the crisis-time phenomenon that killed her brother. The spilled ink discovery tightens pressure by revealing the target's escape method, narrowing Kael's options to replication. Agency appears in her decision to hunt for more ink and wait for the next eclipse, foreclosing the path of abandoning the chase. The cost is legible in "She would disappear too, eventually"—a visible price that charges the final image. One meaningful escalation (ink patterns → drone footage → understanding) drives the arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the brother's death, the stretched seconds, the ephemeral ink patterns as keys to navigating suspended time. The final image offers a non-literal answer—Kael will become absence herself to prove those moments were real—without stating a moral. Subtext operates in "Not for revenge, but for understanding" and the serenity of her anger. The wind-carving comparison recurs with shifted weight. No thematic echo or explicit moralizing mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: Kael notices wind-carved shapes, tracks with "consciously wild grace," processes evidence like a predator. Psychic distance is stable and apt (tight third). Diction remains controlled ("anger was a still lake," "moved through honey") with purposeful rhythm that breathes during discovery beats and tightens at the drone-footage revelation. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("she had been tracking") are minimal and voice-motivated. Internal voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance discovery or deepen motivation. The opening paragraph efficiently anchors setting, character trait (pink eyes), and stakes (someone disappeared). Minor scaffold appears in "That day, time had slowed" transitioning to backstory, but it's anchored and brief. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language ("anger was a still lake," "consciousness...touching something") is coherent and pressure-driven. Propulsion is strong through the alcove discovery to the final resolve.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—disappearing ink as doorways through crisis moments—offers a fresh synthesis of ephemeral materials and subjective time dilation. The albino tracker detail and wind-carved setting avoid generic placeholders. Emotional specificity in the brother's death anchors the quest beyond surface novelty. Risk-taking in the "becoming absence" closure heightens stakes. The transformation test mostly passes: swapping names/places would weaken the wind-carving motif and tracker identity. Some tropes (albinism, tracker protagonist) are present but given specific purpose.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael (albino tracker) drives key turns: kneeling to study patterns, retrieving drone memory, deciding to pursue. Albinism provides the pink-eye sensitivity detail but doesn't constrain on-page choices with visible cost. "Tracker" shapes observation methods and the "consciously wild grace" perceptual filter. Setup early, active in discovery beats, shapes the ending decision. Swappable with "skilled tracker" without major structural loss, limiting the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The drone appears in three beats: hovering near the crevice (opening), landing on her palm for memory retrieval (middle), and called back to her shoulder (ending). Its footage enables the key discovery (target stepping into patterns), thus constraining Kael's understanding and tactics. Setup early, development through memory core revelation, present at closure. Specific properties (mechanical wings, memory core) matter. Could be replaced with another recording device (camera, witness) with moderate edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Disappearing ink shapes stakes and tactics on the page: its fading patterns are keys to the doorways, it drives Kael's realization about crisis moments, and her plan requires finding more of it. Setup in the alcove, development through the pattern study and evaporation, closure linkage in her resolve to acquire more and use it. Causal pressure is strong—without this exact ink, the escape method and Kael's next steps collapse. Removal would break the logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Consciously wild" appears as a label describing Kael's movement style ("consciously wild grace of a predator") and thinking pattern ("half-feral, thinking in patterns of wind and stone"). It colors perception but doesn't constrain an on-page action with visible cost. Present early, informs voice, but remains largely ornamental—could be cut with minor voice adjustments. No clear tradeoff where wildness enables success or causes failure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The target's disappearance during totality is the inciting mystery, and the act of "stepping into" the patterns is the key turn that redefines Kael's understanding and options. Kael's vow to "disappear too, eventually" directly mirrors and reweights this action at closure. Setup via "Someone had disappeared," development through drone footage showing the act, payoff in Kael's plan to replicate it. Removing this action collapses both the mystery and the thematic question about navigating suspended time.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method (ephemeral patterns in spilled ink) is signaled early in the alcove discovery and its mechanics matter: patterns form as ink evaporates, creating doorways through crisis moments. The whorls and spirals are studied, linked to the brother's death memory, and shown in the drone footage as the mechanism the target used. Kael's plan depends on replicating this method—finding ink, waiting for a crisis, reading patterns. Shapes attempts and closure. Specific and indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment provides specific spatial resources (sheltered alcove for discovery, sandstone that holds ink temporarily) and its ongoing carving mirrors Kael's patient resolve in the final image. Setup early with "twisting pillars and hollowed chambers," used in the alcove beat, reprised at closure. The wind carving charges the ending but doesn't constrain middle choices with pressure. Lyric reprise is purposeful and reweights the stake. Present across beats but not essential to tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After the eclipse ends" (three hours post-totality) frames the temporal window and signals that the crisis moment has passed, creating urgency for understanding what happened during it. The timeframe enables the investigation (evidence remains) and shapes Kael's plan (wait for the next eclipse). Setup in the opening line, implicit throughout, mentioned at closure ("next eclipse"). It doesn't tighten on-page decisions with a live countdown but does provide the causal backbone. Functional but somewhat passive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Kael's motivation—to discover why time slows in crisis, proving the brother's death seconds were real—is dramatized through her study of the patterns, drone footage review, and final resolve. The friction between "Not for revenge, but for understanding" and the "serene...fury" creates tension. The desire drives her choices (kneeling, retrieving memory, planning pursuit) with visible cost (she will disappear). Setup via brother backstory, shapes middle investigation, payoffs in the closure vow. Desire is conflicted and drives the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Serene anger" ("still lake...deep," "calm fury," "quiet certainty") is coherent through discovery and decision beats. Tone modulates subtly—intensifies at the drone footage revelation ("calm fury intensified"), breathes during the wind-carving coda—without breaking the sustained control. The serenity charges the final image of patient, relentless pursuit. Setup early, maintained under pressure, reprised at closure. Consistent and purposeful, though the emotional range within "serene anger" is narrow, limiting the tonal arc's dynamism.</comment>
