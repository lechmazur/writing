<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's grief is embodied through concrete actions—tracing atlas pages, naming monsters, pressing the blade—rather than diagnostic labels. The hollow place filling with "sharp-edged and solid" crystallized words shows contradictory impulses (emptiness and accumulation) acting simultaneously. The final renunciation of fear is earned through the naming ritual, with visible cost in carrying forward the pain. Minor weakness: the daughter remains more symbol than person, limiting relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density increase and pattern-taught recurrence (echoes, monsters, naming) that reweights Mara's reaper work. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she moves from hollow namelessness to deliberate naming, carrying crystallized fears forward—a renunciation of avoidance with visible cost (the pocket of sharp crystals, the transformed work). Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when naming the monsters fills the hollow place, altering her stance toward reaping.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The observatory functions as micro-setting: the cracked dome filters light that enables crystallization, the telescope angles toward horizon during her ritual, dust motes model the transformation she seeks. The atlas page as recurring object constrains her naming ritual and charges the final departure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The copper dome oxidized to green and scattered light are filtered through Mara's focus on loss and transformation, not tourist description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake clearly signaled: Mara's inability to name souls after her daughter's death. Pressure tightens when she begins naming the atlas monsters, crystallizing grief into portable form—a meaningful deepening that forecloses the path of avoidance. Agency expressed through deliberate naming and blade-work, with visible cost: she must carry the sharp-edged crystals forward. The transformation from "could not remember a single name" to mapping fears for others demonstrates escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: naming monsters to navigate darkness, sacrifice transforming into light-crystals, the reaper's purpose shifting from guiding souls to mapping the spaces they leave. The final image—carrying light-crystals formed from named fears—offers a resonant answer without moralizing: love transforms into something "hard and clear enough to light the way." The daughter's voice echoing Mara's words creates dramatic irony that deepens rather than explicates theme. No thematic echo or safety-hedging; the piece commits to its metaphor of cartography as grief-work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara notices sea monsters, echoes, crystallization—details filtered through her grief and professional lens as reaper. Voice modulates purposefully from the opening's skeletal imagery to the charged final departure. Minor filter-verb density ("seemed to remember," "began to speak") slightly dulls immediacy in two beats but doesn't obscure focalization. Diction remains controlled; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong opening anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges "I'm not afraid" motif with earned weight. Information density high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and symbolic structure simultaneously. Minor template cadence in middle section: "She had come/She had found/She understood" stems repeat across four paragraphs, creating slight rhythmic monotony (−0.4). One paraphrase moment: the hollow-place filling is described twice in adjacent paragraphs with different metaphors that don't add new pressure (−0.2). No loops in closure beat; propulsion clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of reaper-as-cartographer and grief-as-monster-naming offers a specific, non-obvious angle. The light-crystallization mechanic through blade refraction provides concrete physics to emotional transformation, avoiding pure abstraction. However, the "hollow place filling" and "naming fears to navigate them" concepts trend toward familiar grief-processing templates. The wax cylinder recordings and child's voice practicing bravery risk sentimental territory but stay specific enough through the phonograph's material detail and the echo mechanic to avoid stock execution.</comment>
