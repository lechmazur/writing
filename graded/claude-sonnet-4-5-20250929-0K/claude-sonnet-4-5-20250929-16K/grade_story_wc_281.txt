<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's skepticism and subsequent devotion to mapping the pathways shows clear progression, with her "affection warring with frustration" embodied in concrete action. The three-week work sequence demonstrates contradictory impulses—grief over Iris's condition versus scientific excitement—acting simultaneously. However, the final-paragraph warmth recognition ("Recognition. Love.") edges into label-speak at a pivotal beat, and the leap from static shock to comprehensive diagnostic tool compresses earned struggle into summary. Internal conflict is present but the cost of Maya's transformation remains more told than dramatized in micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the opening premise (telepathy pills as shortcuts) is reweighted by the ending's "way to make visible what had always been invisible," with the cost felt in "hope...delicate as willowglass, ready to shatter but somehow holding." The causal lens holds—static shock → muscovite experiments → light-painting lexicon—with one meaningful deepening (discovery that pathways form a language). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening beat. The three-week montage compresses what could be dramatized beats, slightly diluting escalation pressure, but the through-line from loss to diagnostic breakthrough remains legible and the final image reconfigures the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The light painting studio functions as more than backdrop: LED arrays enable the inciting shock, long-exposure photography captures the pathways, and studio walls displaying hundreds of images become the proof Dr. Chen studies. The muscovite geode's piezoelectric properties constrain the mapping method, qualifying as micro-setting. Spatial choreography (Maya adjusting array, thrown backward into Iris, holding sliver between palms) tracks cleanly. The one-year-anniversary return to the studio charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that environment or object constrain choice or charge the final moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: help Iris access lost telepathic pathways. The static shock provides one meaningful reversal (from passive care to active research), and the discovery that pathways form a language deepens options from "cure" to "illuminate hidden pathways for thousands." Maya's agency drives escalation—she devises the muscovite bridge, photographs sessions, presents to Dr. Chen—with visible cost in the three-week labor and the acceptance that "there was no cure." The final image shows both earned stasis (Iris remains damaged) and forward motion (guiding another survivor), with the cost of fragile hope made undeniable. Pressure coheres under the causal lens throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the opening skepticism about "shortcuts to consciousness" is answered not by telepathy but by a hand-drawn lexicon that makes loss comprehensible. The muscovite's natural translucency and piezoelectric properties anchor the metaphor of revealing hidden structure. "Not telepathy...something better. A lexicon" avoids moralizing by showing transformation through specific action (light paintings as diagnostic tools). The closing image—"a way to make visible what had always been invisible, to transform loss into understanding"—reprices the premise without stated thesis, and the "willowglass" hope carries earned fragility. Minor deduction: "fractally precise" recurs as concept-label more than lived constraint.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, with Maya's perceptual signature clear (scientific problem-solving, visual artist's attention to light and pattern). The piezoelectric explanation and light-painting technique read as character-specific expertise without exposition dump. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot: "You felt that" (not a question) economically conveys Iris's recognition. Distance control is clean except for one slip: "The revelation didn't cure Iris—there was no cure" briefly adopts narrator-omniscient certainty rather than Maya's bounded knowledge. Diction remains consistent, avoiding register drift. The closing beats compress reflection but maintain present anchoring through concrete action (Iris guiding another survivor, Maya adjusting camera).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high throughout. The opening beat economically establishes backstory, relationship, and conflict. However, the three-week montage suffers from summary compression: "For three weeks, they worked" followed by process description lacks the propulsive particularity of surrounding beats. Minor template cadence in the Dr. Chen section: "It's not telepathy...It's better. It's a lexicon" / "Not telepathy, but something..." recycles the same rhetorical frame. The somatic-marker catalog (curiosity spirals clockwise, fear fractures, love blooms) edges toward ornamental listing. No major loops or scaffold, but these mid-story artifacts prevent entry to higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of light painting, piezoelectric minerals, and somatic-marker mapping offers a fresh angle on the telepathy-pill premise. Transforming a pharmaceutical failure into a visual diagnostic lexicon through artist's technique shows specific, non-obvious problem-solving. The fractally precise pathways visualized through long-exposure photography avoids stock metaphor. However, the core emotional arc—partner helping damaged loved one find meaning in loss—follows a familiar template, and the three-week leap to comprehensive breakthrough compresses struggle that could distinguish this further. The muscovite geode as solution element arrives with sufficient grounding (grandmother's collection) but the speed of success softens the risk. Fresh inflection present; boldness moderate.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maya as "affectionate skeptic" is present early (warned Iris about pills, "didn't believe in shortcuts") and drives key turns: devises the muscovite method, conducts three weeks of experiments, approaches Dr. Chen, and operates the camera in the final beat. Her skepticism-turned-scientific-devotion shapes the "not telepathy, something better" realization. However, her choices in the middle montage are summarized rather than dramatized in distinct pressure beats, and the final-paragraph reflection on "recognition, love" is more observational than decisional.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The muscovite geode sliver appears in four distinct beats: retrieval from grandmother's collection (setup with specificity—"paper-thin, naturally translucent"), three-week use holding it between palms to generate charge (middle development), implied presence when "photographs covering Maya's studio walls" are examined, and indirect presence in the closure when Maya picks up her camera. Its piezoelectric properties constrain the mapping method and enable the breakthrough. The sliver's natural translucency connects thematically to "illuminate hidden pathways." Strong causal role, though it does not return with explicitly reweighted meaning in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The telepathy pill recall frames all stakes from the opening line ("forty thousand who'd taken the telepathy pills before the recall") and shapes every tactic: Iris's loss of pathway access is the inciting wound, the "fractally precise tangles that nobody understood" explain why conventional imaging failed, and the closure explicitly addresses "thousands of others trapped in the recall's aftermath." The one-year anniversary anchors the timeframe. The concept is not merely thematic backdrop but the structural problem Maya's entire effort addresses, with visible cost (no cure, only comprehension). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" is signaled early as the reason for recall failure ("fractally precise tangles that nobody understood") and recurs when Maya's photographs reveal "fractally precise patterns repeated at every scale, branching like lightning or lungs." It constrains the problem (conventional imaging can't map them) and enables the solution (light paintings capture them). However, the attribute functions more as concept-label than on-page tradeoff; we don't see Maya struggle with the fractal complexity in a way that costs her a choice or alters tactics within a dramatized beat. Present across setup, development, and closure, but the mechanics remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Devise" drives the major turn: Maya's "What if electricity can bridge it? ...what if we could map them differently?" launches the three-week experiment, leading to the lexicon discovery and diagnostic breakthrough. The action is signaled in dialogue ("We devise something new"), executed through the muscovite method, and pays off when Dr. Chen confirms "You've documented the pathways." Removing this action would collapse the plot from passive care to no solution. The verb reappears implicitly in the closure (Maya "began to paint with light" as continuation). Causal pressure is strong, though the ease of success slightly softens irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Somatic markers are introduced early when Maya experiences them firsthand ("pressure behind her left eye meant curiosity. Warmth in her solar plexus meant recognition"), shape the three-week mapping process ("Iris described the somatic markers she felt" while Maya photographed), provide the key insight ("Each somatic marker corresponded to a specific movement pattern"), and return charged in the final beat ("Maya felt that familiar warmth in her solar plexus. Recognition. Love."). The method is both the means of discovery and the proof of success, with the markers becoming a readable language. Essential across all three gates with clear cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The light painting studio supplies the faulty wire that triggers the static shock, houses the LED array Maya is adjusting, provides the long-exposure camera technique that captures pathway movements, and becomes the diagnostic space where "photographs covering Maya's studio walls" prove the lexicon. In the closure, "their studio" is the location where Iris guides another survivor and Maya prepares to photograph again. The setting is not mere backdrop but workspace whose tools (camera, lights, exposure technique) enable the solution. Specific resources alter outcome; micro-setting criteria satisfied.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the static shock" is anchored with "The static shock happened on a Tuesday," the three-week experiment period is explicit, and the closure occurs "on the one-year anniversary of the static shock." However, the timeframe functions more as chronological marker than pressure device—no ticking clock tightens decisions during the three weeks, and the one-year gap is commemorative rather than tactical. The time structure organizes causality but does not constrain choices or escalate urgency within beats. Present across all sections but not a live pressure source.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation "to illuminate hidden pathways" is dramatized through action: she devises the muscovite method in direct response to glimpsing the pathways, conducts three weeks of experiments, photographs each session, and persists until Dr. Chen validates the discovery. The motivation is conflicted—"affection warring with frustration"—and the cost is visible (three weeks of labor, acceptance that Iris won't be cured). The final beat shows the motivation extended to others ("helping doctors understand which neural patterns were damaged"). Desire shapes all major choices, though the middle montage summarizes rather than dramatizes specific friction points.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope" is tonally consistent from the opening's "hollow" skepticism through the experimental process to the explicit closure image: "The hope in the room felt delicate as willowglass, ready to shatter but somehow holding." Tone modulates under pressure—initial grief, excited discovery, cautious validation, fragile optimism—without breaking into false triumph or despair. The final paragraph's "Not telepathy, but something...a way to make visible what had always been invisible" maintains the delicate balance. The simile "delicate as willowglass" is deployed once at closure, charging the final image without over-insistence. Coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
