<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through her physicalized relationship with vibration and music. Her fingers bleeding on the wire demonstrates genuine cost and commitment. However, the piece leans heavily on reflective interior—"She understood what others had forgotten," "Mara understood that the Silence hadn't killed music"—that tells rather than dramatizes discovery through micro-choices under pressure. The final "understanding" arrives as epiphany rather than earned realization from failed attempts or resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly: Mara, grove, post-Silence dawn. The piece follows an Accumulative lens—density builds from wire-positioning to strumming to grove-wide resonance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid) where the final image reweights the premise: music persists as motion beneath sound. Cost is visible (bleeding fingers) and conceptual (acceptance that sound is gone but vibration endures). One meaningful deepening occurs when the symphony manifests through the grove's response, shifting Mara's stance from sculptor to witness of a transformed art form.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grove is vividly specific—siskin alders, silver bark, root systems, telegraph insulators—and the porcelain/copper apparatus constrains Mara's method. The stress-cracked sculpture anchors the workspace with purposeful detail. However, the setting primarily stages action rather than forcing a tactical choice; the grove responds to Mara's strumming but does not resist or complicate her execution. Sensory detail is strong (cool porcelain, wire tension) but the environment remains cooperative rather than pressuring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving music can persist in a silent world—is signaled early and sustained. Mara's strumming tightens pressure as the grove responds, culminating in synchronized movement across all living things. The bleeding fingers provide visible cost. However, there is no resistance or failure; every wire placement succeeds, every vibration travels as intended. The escalation reads as intensification of effect rather than narrowing of options or tactical adjustment under opposition, which limits high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the stress-crack analysis and porcelain-wire system: vibration as music's essence, empathy as physical resonance between materials. The final image—"the Silence hadn't killed music at all. It had simply changed the instrument"—reweights the premise through concrete action (strumming, synchronized swaying) rather than abstract claim. The hedgehog's dream provides resonant closure without moralizing. One minor slip: "empathy flowing between all things that grew and moved and lived" edges toward thematic statement where the prior particulars already conveyed it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices vibrations, stress patterns, harmonics. Diction remains controlled—"symphonically minded," "spider-webbed," "crystalline quality"—and voice-appropriate for an artist-engineer. However, under peak pressure (the strumming climax), the prose becomes explanatory rather than compressed: "The entire grove pulsed with the symphony, every living thing synchronized in movement" tells effect rather than trusting image. Psychic distance widens when most needed, reducing immediacy at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively; opening and closing images are strong. Information density is high in technical passages (wire tension, porcelain properties, stress-crack mechanics). However, two paraphrase loops appear: the paragraph beginning "She had spent weeks analyzing" repeats the concept that cracks tell stories across three sentences with synonym variation (fissure/crack, forces/tension, empathy/responding). The climax paragraph stacks filter constructions: "felt rather than heard," "felt the rhythms," "felt the vibrations." These clusters dull immediacy in high-pressure beats, preventing 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—music through vibration in a silent world—offers a fresh angle, and the stress-crack-as-notation mechanic is specific and non-obvious. The porcelain insulator and wire-web system feel researched and particular. However, the emotional arc follows a familiar template: lone artist preserves beauty through specialized knowledge in a transformed world. The resolution lacks friction; Mara's experiment succeeds on the first sustained attempt without miscalculation or cost beyond bleeding fingers, reducing the sense of hard-won discovery that would elevate originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her choices—positioning wires, calculating tension, strumming—drive all beats. The final decision to continue ("Tomorrow she would return and strum again") shapes her ongoing stance. However, her agency mostly executes a plan without pivots; no on-page choice alters tactics or forecloses a path. She decides to strum and does; the grove responds as hoped. Setup ✓, Development (execution rather than complication) ~, Payoff ✓.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The porcelain insulator appears in the salvage beat, is handled and positioned in the wire-web construction, and its crystalline vibration properties enable the climax. Three beats. However, it does not return with reweighted meaning or charge the final image; once installed, it becomes infrastructure. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff (present but not reweighted) ~. Causal pressure +0.6, beat involvement +0.9, but no closure linkage beyond continued presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The phrase "empathy in motion" appears explicitly ("a record of empathy in motion, the wood responding to everything around it") and the concept structures the grove-wide resonance at closure—materials responding sympathetically. However, it shapes theme more than it constrains tactics; Mara does not face a choice between empathic and non-empathic methods. Setup ✓ (stress cracks as empathy record), Development (described rather than tested), Payoff ✓ (synchronized response). Thematic presence strong; causal pressure on protagonist choice weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Symphonically minded" is named early and enables Mara's translation of Beethoven/Debussy scores into wire patterns—one on-page action with causal weight. The trait justifies her unique approach and shapes the method. However, no visible tradeoff or cost attaches to thinking symphonically; it is purely enabling. Setup ✓, Development ✓ (score-to-vibration translation), Payoff ~ (implicit in success but not charged). One beat involvement +0.4, causal pressure +0.5, no cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strumming is the pivotal action: Mara raises her hand and strums the wires in symphony patterns, triggering the grove's response and the climax realization. Removing it would collapse the plot. Three distinct beats: preparation (tension calculation), execution (strumming in Beethoven/Debussy patterns), and consequence (synchronized grove, bleeding fingers). Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff ✓. Causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, beat involvement +1.4, cost connection +0.4 (bleeding fingers). High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stress-crack analysis method is signaled early ("analyzing those stress cracks"), structures the wire-web design (connecting stress points), and the cracks channel vibrations at closure, creating harmonics. The mechanics matter: cracks as frozen tension become conduits. Three beats: discovery, application (wire positioning by stress-point prediction), payoff (harmonics spread). Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff ✓. Causal pressure +1.0, beat involvement +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove provides staging and the root-system network enables vibration spread. The living alders sway in response, participating in closure. However, the grove does not resist or alter Mara's tactics; it is cooperative infrastructure. Spatial detail is vivid but primarily atmospheric. Setup ✓, Development ~ (responsive rather than constraining), Payoff ✓ (synchronized movement). Present across beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but low causal pressure on protagonist choice −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the hedgehog uncurls" bookends the story (opening and closing hedgehog image) but does not function as a live clock. The dawn timing anchors setting but no deadline tightens Mara's choices; she works at her own pace. The hedgehog returns with slight reweighting (dreaming of sound) but the timeframe itself is ornamental. Setup ✓ (lyric frame), Development (absent), Payoff ~ (hedgehog reprise, not timeframe pressure). Lyric-resonance allowance applies +0.3, but missing middle development caps at 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation—to create music in a silent world—is stated early, dramatized through wire-strumming with visible cost (bleeding fingers), and validated at closure when the symphony manifests. Mara's singular purpose drives all beats. However, the motivation faces no internal conflict or competing desire; she pursues it without friction or doubt. Setup ✓, Development ✓ (enacted with cost), Payoff ✓ (realization that music persists). Causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, cost connection +0.5, but no want-versus-need tension −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and purposeful: "intensely quiet" pervades through silent strumming, "felt rather than heard," grove settling into "patient waiting." The oxymoron of silent music charges every beat. Tone modulates subtly—calm preparation to physical intensity (bleeding) to still realization—without breaking the quietness. The final image ("dreamed of sound it had never known") sustains tone through closure and reweights the premise. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff ✓. Coherence across turns +1.0, closure charge +1.2, modulation under pressure +0.6.</comment>
