<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior is grounded in sensory detail (pressure through the rope, temperature shifts) and her curiosity drives concrete actions with cost—she bypasses automated sirens, risking her authority. The decision to use the bell instead of the mechanical alarm feels earned through prior observation and embodies her values. Minor deduction: "credibly curious" is labeled rather than fully dramatized through contradiction or mistake under pressure, and her competence never stumbles meaningfully before the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Mira's weeks of tracking → discovery of the rope's resonance → solstice reading → choice to ring the bell rather than sound the siren forms a clean because/therefore chain. Closure is Decisive Change with visible cost: she abandons mechanical protocol, risking panic and her role, and the sanctuary survives because of her listening. One tightening (the inversion building "within the hour") narrows options effectively. Orientation is clear by ~80 words. Cost is legible in her choice and the priest's acknowledgment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cathedral suspended in cloud, spiral stairs, bell tower, and open arches create vivid spatial anchors. The rope's physical vibration ("hemp fibers," "decades of dust") and the storm's "violent upheaval of wind and ice" constrain Mira's choice and charge the ending. Micro-setting (the rope as antenna) functions as setting and drives the climax. Slight deduction: the sanctuary's interior layout (quarters, arches, number of inhabitants) remains vague during the crucial sealing sequence, creating minor choreography uncertainty.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save the sanctuary from zero hour) is signaled early and tightens when Mira discovers the inversion arrives "within the hour." Her choice to use the bell instead of the siren is protagonist-driven and forecloses the mechanical option with visible cost—potential panic, defiance of protocol. The storm's arrival and survival constitute one meaningful reversal. Agency is clear: her listening versus noise philosophy drives the turn. The cost (risk of being wrong, institutional defiance) is felt though not ruinous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—listening over mechanical noise, humility over automation—emerges organically through Mira's practice and the priest's closing line without sermon. The bell rope (clapper removed, yet still functional through vibration) and her notebooks embody the theme through particulars. The ending image ("listening had finally become louder than sound") is non-literal and reweights the premise cleanly. No forced moralizing; the solstice hush and the rope as "old friend" resonate without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mira; no head-hopping. Her perceptual signature (microclimate focus, tactile attention to rope vibration, wind patterns) is distinct and character-specific. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: the priest's closing line carries subtext (institutional admission) without exposition. Diction ("credibly curious," "carpenter's glue," "hemp fibers") fits her practical, observant voice. Minor deduction: the priest's single line feels slightly pat, and Mira's interior occasionally edges toward explaining rather than trusting dramatization ("The patterns told stories the mechanical sirens couldn't hear").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Syntax varies; information density is high (glue repair, rope vibration, pressure inversion mechanics). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Opening and closing lines anchor and charge effectively. Minor deductions: "peculiar hush had settled" and "the air felt charged, expectant" are stock constructions; "credibly curious—that's what the head priest called her, though not always kindly" is a tell-heavy aside that could be cut. Filter verbs ("felt," "sensed") cluster in the tower sequence but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy significantly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cathedral-in-sky setting and bell-without-clapper as resonance instrument offer fresh specificity. The trope of intuition-versus-technology is familiar but grounded through concrete detail (microclimate tracking, rope vibration mechanics, carpenter's glue repair). The turn (using the bell's vibration instead of the siren) feels earned in hindsight. Deduction: the storm-tester premise and the "listening becomes louder than sound" closure echo established genre patterns (humble technician trusts analog wisdom over machines); transformation is solid but not fully surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira (humble storm siren tester) is present from the opening, drives the key choice (bell versus siren), and her prior weeks of observation create the climax. Her humility is embodied in her role and her choice to call instructions rather than let alarms shriek. She shapes setup, middle discovery, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cathedral bell rope appears early (bell tower paragraph), is used in the glue-repair discovery beat, tested experimentally, and becomes the instrument of the climax when Mira pulls it in rhythm. Its clapper-less state and vibration properties are irreplaceable; swapping it for another tool would break the story's logic. Specific cost: choosing it over the siren risks intelligibility and panic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Zero hour" is named early, frames the dominant stake (catastrophic storm arrival), and tightens when Mira discovers it arrives "within the hour" rather than days. It pressures her choice and appears in her instructions during the climax. The concept shapes tactics (seal arches, tie down) and closure acknowledgment. Strong integration, though the phrase itself is slightly generic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Credibly curious" is attributed to Mira by the priest and manifests in her weeks of tracking and rope experiment. It enables her discovery but is labeled rather than shown through a costly mistake or contradictory impulse. It appears in setup and informs middle action, but does not directly constrain the climax choice or carry visible friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "switch" (emergency siren control panel) appears at the crisis beat when Mira's hand hovers over it, and her refusal to activate it creates the story's central turn. However, the switch itself is generic; the choice could be reframed with minor edits (e.g., activating versus not activating any alarm system). The switch enables the turn but is not irreplaceable as an object.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Tracking microclimate variations" is introduced early (weeks of observation, notebooks, temperature shifts, pressure changes) and directly enables Mira's discovery of the pressure inversion timing. The method shapes her credibility and the climax decision. It appears in setup, middle (rope vibration extends the method), and informs closure. Solid causal role, though the mechanics remain somewhat summary-level.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "windblown sanctuary above the clouds" is established in the opening line, supplies the storm threat, and the arches/buttresses provide tactical resources (seal the eastern arches, tie down). The setting's verticality and exposure create the stakes and constrain the response. The final paragraph returns to "windblown sanctuary," recharging the opening image. Strong integration across setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"After the glue dries" is the timeframe anchor: three days ago Mira repaired the rope, tested it after the glue dried, and discovered the vibration property. This discovery directly enables the climax choice. The solstice marks the crisis day. The timeframe tightens when "zero hour" shifts from days to "within the hour," pressuring Mira's decision. The glue-drying detail is specific and causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to favor listening over noise" is dramatized in Mira's hand hovering over the siren switch, her choice to use the bell's vibration instead, and her calling instructions in the intervals. The friction between mechanical alarm (noise) and tactile/verbal communication (listening) creates the story's central cost and is embodied in action. The priest's closing line confirms the thematic stakes. Strong dramatization with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Solstice hush"—the peculiar quiet before the storm—is introduced early, creates atmospheric pressure, and contrasts with the violent storm that follows. The hush modulates into rhythm (bell tolls) and then the storm's fury, and the closing paragraph returns to post-storm balance. Tone coherence is strong and charges the ending's return to quiet. Solid integration, though "hush" itself is slightly abstract as a concrete element.</comment>
