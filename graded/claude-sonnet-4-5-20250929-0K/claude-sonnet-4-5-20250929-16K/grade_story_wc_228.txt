<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's internal arc is consistently rendered through embodied choice: the physical immersion in cold water is a concrete break from "intimately aloof" patterns. Her reflection on Thomas's letter and the promise to herself at nineteen shows contradictory impulses—fear of endings versus desire to live boldly—acting simultaneously. The final knock on the gallery owner's door earns its weight through the cave sequence, forecloses the observer stance with visible cost (ruined clothes, shattered mirror left unfixed). Minor slip: "intimately aloof" is told rather than shown in early beats, though later action dramatizes it well.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: Marina's immersion and declaration to the gallery owner reweight her twenty-year pattern with felt cost (abandoning safety, ruining clothes, rejecting reflection). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through cave discovery, shell placement, and final stance shift. Causality holds: wrong turn → hidden chamber → Thomas's letter recalled → immersion choice → gallery declaration. One meaningful deepening (cave realization) tightens options. Minor deduction: the gallery knock feels slightly rushed after the cave's lyric density, compressing the final turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cave constrains Marina's choice by existing as "temporary eternity," pressuring her to abandon observational distance. Mineral deposits, light-shaft, hermit crabs, and anemones are selective and purposeful, filtered through her painter's eye yet forcing present participation. The coastal path, quay references, and tidal pools anchor locale early. Spatial choreography (passage narrows, chamber opens, rock shelf placement) tracks cleanly. The cave's fragility ("next storm surge or rockfall") directly charges the final image of impermanence. No occupational depth issues; the painter lens shapes what's noticed without catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Marina will remain "intimately aloof" or risk immersion—is signaled early and tightens through cave discovery. The wrong turn escalates pressure by confronting her avoidance with Thomas's challenge ("you're afraid to live inside them"). One meaningful deepening: sitting in cold water forecloses the observer stance with visible cost (ruined clothes, time spent, vulnerability). The gallery knock extends this with relational cost. No antagonist required; the situational pressure (cave beauty, shell's arrival, memory) coheres. Minor issue: the declaration to the gallery owner tells the shift rather than showing a harder choice in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence versus engagement emerges through cave particulars (temporary ecosystem, light-shaft timing) without moralizing. The painted shell shifts meaning across beats: past promise → burial attempt → reminder of self-promise → catalyst for immersion. Thomas's letter insight ("everything ends. The ending isn't what matters") is earned by Marina's twenty-year pattern and the cave's fragile beauty. Final image—shattered mirror unreplaced, seeing clearly—offers non-literal answer to the opening's "What use was reflection." Subtext operates in gesture (sitting in cold water) and the shell's placement where tide "might take it or leave it." No thematic echo or thesis statement mars closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly; Marina's perceptual signature (painter's external eye versus present self) is consistent and shifts purposefully under pressure. Diction remains within her register; no head-hopping. Interior access is embodied: "ruining her clothes and her carefully maintained remove" integrates action and meaning. Psychic distance tightens appropriately in the cave (sensory immersion) and opens for reflection (Thomas's letter). Dialogue is sparse but functional ("I need to paint something different..."). Minor deduction: "intimately aloof" in paragraph one reads slightly expository for a character who would internalize that judgment differently, though the phrase is attributed to the gallery owner.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; opening and closing images bookend cleanly (mirror's fractured angles → seeing clearly). Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Minor loop: "The promise she'd made wasn't to Thomas—not really" then "At nineteen, painting that shell, she'd promised herself" restates across two beats without added pressure. Stock phrase: "yawned ahead" for cave entrance. Filter verbs ("she'd meant to leave," "she understood") occasionally dull immediacy but remain voice-appropriate. Figurative language (mineral sculptures, light-shaft glow) is controlled and legible. No major artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—painter's aloofness challenged by temporary beauty requiring presence—feels fresh within a familiar arc. Wrong-turn-to-hidden-place is a known mechanism, but the cave as "temporary eternity" and the delayed-post shell add specificity. Transformation test: plot would suffer with generic names/places; Marina's painter identity and the quay setting matter. Emotional truth (grief held at distance, belated immersion) avoids template stages. The mirror frame (shattered, unreplaced, then clear sight) offers a light symbolic touch that doesn't shout. Risk is moderate; structure is linear and clear. Deduction: the core arc (avoidant artist learns to engage) is well-worn; elevation comes from execution rather than premise novelty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's choices create all key turns: entering the cave (setup), turning right at the fork (middle), sitting in cold water (climax), knocking on gallery door (closure). Observation-to-decision progression is the story's spine. Her painter identity (quay subjects, external eye) constrains early stance and makes immersion costly. Appears in first paragraph, recurs in cave perception, transforms at closure. Causal pressure throughout; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Shell is handled in three beats: arrival memory (paragraph two), unwrapping and placement in cave (middle-to-end), and its meaning reweighted at closure ("promise to herself" realization). Setup early, drives cave mission, charges final image by being left where tide may claim it—mirroring impermanence theme. Specific properties (cerulean and gold, Thomas's intended return) matter; swapping for another object would break the promise motif and temporal bridge. Visible cost: letting it go.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Temporary eternity" is dramatized through cave ecosystem ("exist until the next storm surge or rockfall"), which forces Marina's realization that beauty's impermanence doesn't diminish it. This shapes her tactic shift from burial-at-distance to immersion. Concept is named on-page and structurally integrated; the oasis's fragility enables the thematic turn. Not merely echoed but enacted through setting constraint. Deduction: phrase itself appears only once; more distributed pressure across beats would reach higher.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Intimately aloof" is attributed to the gallery owner in paragraph one, describes Marina's art and life, and constrains her choices (keeping everyone at arm's length). The cave scene tests this trait via immersion, and the ending action (gallery knock, sitting in water) forecloses the aloof stance with visible cost (ruined clothes, vulnerability). Present in setup and closure. Deduction: labeled more than embodied in early beats; the phrase does heavy lifting without enough prior demonstration of how distance operates in micro-choices before the cave.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The reveal (cave chamber discovery after wrong turn) redefines Marina's options by confronting avoidance with beauty requiring presence. It triggers memory of Thomas's letter and enables the immersion choice. Swappability test: another catalyst could work, but this one integrates setting and concept (hidden oasis, light-shaft timing). Present in middle third, drives climax. Deduction: "reveal" as such is standard; the specific content (ecosystem, temporary beauty) does the work, but the action itself is not irreplaceable—any pressure-point discovery could serve.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Wrong turn is signaled ("At the third fork, Marina turned right instead of left"), its mechanics matter (she follows memory, not map), and it leads to the chamber that transforms her stance. Method is setup (planned tidal-pool burial), disrupted (wrong path), and pays off (hidden oasis forces immersion theme). Removal would eliminate the catalyst and the story's central image. Causal throughout; the oasis must be hidden to embody the concept. Specificity and irreplaceability both high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cave network pressures Marina by narrowing passage (physical constraint), then revealing hidden chamber (opportunity/test). Tidal pools are the intended destination; the wrong turn creates story. Setting supplies the temporary ecosystem that dramatizes the theme and the cold water that makes immersion costly. Micro-setting (rock shelf for shell, shallow pool, light-shaft) alters tactics. Present in setup (coastal path, cliffs painted), middle (passages, fork), and closure (emergence, cold/shivering). Not postcard description; every detail constrains or enables.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Three days ago" anchors the mirror's fall and Marina's state; "yesterday" for shell arrival; "fifteen years ago" for Thomas's death. Timeframe tightens the present action (shell just arrived, Marina acts now) and contrasts with twenty-year pattern. The cave immersion ("until the light shifted") uses time to show commitment. Closure action (walking back, knocking) happens same day. Present but not a live countdown; time shapes context more than urgent tactics. Mid-band: functional sequencing without pressure-clock that alters moves beat-to-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Hidden promise ("she'd live as boldly as she painted") is dramatized through shell memory, tested in cave (burial versus immersion choice), and fulfilled at closure (gallery declaration, leaving mirror broken). Desire conflicts with fear of endings throughout. The promise is to herself at nineteen, forgotten/avoided for twenty years, then reclaimed with cost (vulnerability, ruined stance). Friction between want (safety/distance) and cost (missed life) drives all choices. Setup, middle realization, closure enactment all present; irreplaceable to arc.</comment>
