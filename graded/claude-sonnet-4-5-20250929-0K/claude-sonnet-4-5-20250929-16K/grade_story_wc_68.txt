<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcellus is motivated by demonstrable fact over decree, with his "abrasive calm" showing consistent contradiction between internal conviction and external irrelevance. His micro-choices—excavating, cataloging, hiding evidence—are purpose-driven and reflect a philosopher's hierarchy of values. The interiority remains specific ("primitives who measured time in microseconds") and embodied through tactile engagement with artifacts. However, the internal conflict never forces a visible cost or stakes-altering choice on the page; he ends exactly where he began, methodically preserving, with no path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, when by the second paragraph). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: sedimentary layers, competing narratives, and chronometer cogs build density toward the final image of patient artifacts waiting. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Marcellus seals evidence and ascends "surrounded by drowned streets and the abrasive calm of knowing he was right"—but the cost remains abstract (future relevance, not present forfeiture). The tightening is atmospheric rather than tactical; no live option is foreclosed, no immediate consequence paid, weakening the felt price at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken city is vivid and purposeful: "fish now nested in judge's chambers and coral grew on subway tiles" grounds the world in specific ruin. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through storm drains, collapsed archways, and sedimentary layers. The setting constrains Marcellus's movements (patrol boats overhead, waterproof cases, pipe networks) and charges the final image—his ascent through "drowned streets" reweights his solitary mission. Micro-setting (the chronometer cog, the archive) functions as both tool and metaphor without becoming ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve truth against the Council's mysticism—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is descriptive rather than decisive: Marcellus excavates, catalogs, hides evidence, ascends. No choice narrows his options or raises immediate cost; patrol boats pass without confrontation, and his final act (sealing notes) mirrors his opening methodology. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is needed; here the sedimentary metaphor intensifies but never forces a trade-off or alters tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the chronometer cogs, sedimentary layers, and competing epistemologies without overt statement. "The toolkit for truth-seeking that the new narratives deliberately abandoned" is earned through hospital records, tidal charts, and engineering proofs. The final image—"patient as mathematics, through whatever sedimentary layers time added next"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of preservation's value. Minor deduction: the phrase "epistemological methods that separated justified belief from comfortable fiction" edges toward direct thematic declaration rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with consistent distance. Marcellus's perceptual signature—"abrasive calm," methodical notation, tactile focus on brass teeth and sediment—is distinct and voice-specific. Diction fits his philosopher's register ("epistemological methods," "demonstrable fact") without jarring shifts. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close observation ("feeling its brass teeth catch the dim light") to reflective remove ("They could decide which narrative made more sense"). Minor slip: "The new historians called it the Great Forgetting, which Marcellus found laughably ironic" opens with summary judgment rather than immediate perception, briefly flattening the voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean with strong information density: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language (sedimentary layers, brass teeth, seafarer precision) integrates without overwriting. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "Evidence that contradicted the Council's narrative" immediately after showing the same idea through nautical charts; "Ancient methods weren't just techniques; they were frameworks" restates the prior paragraph's epistemological claim. The template cadence "This was why he agonized... The Council couldn't execute him... but they could make him irrelevant" uses parallel construction that reads scaffolded rather than voice-driven. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting, epistemological conflict, and archaeological method offers a fresh angle on truth-versus-narrative. The chronometer-as-proof and sedimentary-excavation metaphor feel specific rather than generic. However, the core emotional arc—lone scholar preserving forbidden knowledge against revisionist authority—is a familiar template, and the story does not transform it through a non-obvious choice or moral calculus at closure. Marcellus's final act (sealing evidence for future discovery) is the expected move, earned but not surprising. Strong execution of premise without bold structural or thematic risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marcellus, the sewer philosopher, is present throughout and his choices (excavating, cataloging, hiding evidence, ascending) drive all beats. He appears early, shapes middle action (the archive, the patrol evasion), and his final sealing of the cylinder is the closure act. His role is causally active and irreplaceable—the story requires this exact character. However, his decisions do not alter his own tactics or foreclose a path; he ends as he began, methodically preserving. Strong presence and beat involvement, but closure participation lacks visible cost tied to his choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chronometer cog appears in the opening ("held... between thumb and forefinger"), is contextualized through nautical astronomy and precision gearing, reappears when Marcellus places it with sixteen others in his archive, and charges the final image ("The chronometer cogs would wait, patient as mathematics"). It shapes the thematic argument (proof of pre-flood sophistication) and constrains Marcellus's mission. Early signal, multiple beats, closure linkage, and specificity (brass teeth, microsecond precision) make it indispensable. Minor cap: it does not enable a tactical choice under pressure or carry a felt cost at closure; its role is evidentiary and symbolic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Competing narratives (Council mysticism vs. Marcellus's evidence) are introduced immediately ("the survivors had decided the past needed revision") and shape every beat: the chronometer proves sophistication, hospital records show natural pathogen vs. moral corruption, infrastructure vs. primitives. The concept drives Marcellus's stake (preserve truth) and constrains his tactics (irrelevance vs. execution). It reweights at closure: "Future excavators... would find both the Council's mysticism and his evidence. They could decide which narrative made more sense." The concept is causally active, not merely thematic, and the final image depends on its tension.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Rationally rebellious" is defined early ("someone who didn't reject authority through emotion but through demonstrable fact") and colors Marcellus's choices: he excavates methodically, writes technical documentation vs. transcendence treatises, remains still when patrol boats pass. The trait constrains his approach (no emotional outburst, no direct confrontation) and enables his survival. However, it is never tested under pressure with visible cost—no moment where rational restraint forecloses an emotional option or vice versa. Present across beats, but the tradeoff remains implicit rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Agonize" appears once as summary ("This was why he agonized, not from doubt but from the weight of what preservation meant") but is not dramatized through conflicted choice or visible struggle. The text immediately clarifies he does *not* doubt, undercutting the action's tension. His methodology remains steady from opening to close; no beat shows him torn between preservation and another live option. The word functions as atmospheric labeling rather than a causal engine. Missing middle development and closure participation; no cost tied to agonizing on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Through sedimentary layers" is introduced early ("excavating through sedimentary layers of the submerged plaza, each stratum revealing a different era's refuse"), shapes his method (cross-referencing manufacture dates with tidal charts and building records), and charges the final image ("patient as mathematics, through whatever sedimentary layers time added next"). The metaphor is specific (hospital records at one layer, chronometer at another) and irreplaceable—the story's logic depends on stratigraphic reconstruction of knowledge. It appears in opening, middle, and closure. Minor cap: it does not constrain a tactical choice under immediate pressure; its role is methodological and thematic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sunken city is signaled immediately (storm drain, green water overhead, submerged plaza) and pressures every choice: patrol boats force concealment, waterproof cases enable archival, pipe networks hide the cylinder above the waterline, drowned streets frame the ascent. The setting supplies resources (sewer-philosopher's cell, sedimentary access) and constraints (water, patrols, accessibility) that alter Marcellus's tactics. It charges the final image (ascending through drowned streets, patient artifacts). Essential across all three gates with high causal involvement and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After the plague ends" is stated early ("The plague had ended three years ago") and establishes the Council's revisionist window, but time does not tighten decisions on the page. No clock, deadline, or temporal pressure forces Marcellus's choices in this scene; the three-year gap is context, not engine. The future-orientation (decades hence, excavators will decide) is thematic rather than tactical. Present in setup and thematically at closure, but missing middle development where time would narrow options or raise cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve ancient methods is dramatized early (excavating, cataloging evidence that contradicts the Council) and drives every beat: recovering the chronometer, cross-referencing records, establishing the archive, sealing notes for future discovery. Friction appears between preservation and irrelevance ("irrelevance was a philosopher's death"), and the final act (hiding the cylinder) embodies the choice with visible cost (solitary ascent, knowing "no one listened yet"). The desire is tested and conflicted across all three gates, with cost legible at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Abrasive calm" is introduced early ("Marcellus disagreed, but calmly, methodically") and modulates purposefully: tactile focus on brass teeth, patient stillness during patrol, ascending "surrounded by... the abrasive calm of knowing he was right." The tone charges the final image and remains coherent through pressure. However, "abrasive" is underplayed—his interiority reads more as methodical confidence than friction; the bristling edge promised by "abrasive" never sharpens into visible interpersonal or internal tension. Present across beats and at closure, but specificity is softer than the label suggests.</comment>
