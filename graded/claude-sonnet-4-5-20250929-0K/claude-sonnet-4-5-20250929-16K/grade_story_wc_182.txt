<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's character traits—careful resourcefulness, years of study, mastery of gaps—are established early and shape her rescue tactics. Her interiority often leans on elevated linguistic abstractions rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The traveler's recursion hollowness is declared but not dramatized through micro-choices; his desire to remember/forget cycles remains conceptual. The students function as plot objects without agency or presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The mountain's architecture and linguistic layering accumulate across beats (temporal rift discovery, diary consultation, harmonic bridge construction). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the students materialize and Mira's reflection reweights rescue missions as self-discovery cycles; the conceptual cost (eternal repetition, teaching through loss) is legible in the final image of the traveler disappearing again. Orientation anchors who/where by ~150 words ("arcane linguist," "Codex Mountain," "labyrinthine bookstore")—slightly late but functional. One tightening (rift → diary → bridge solution) suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mountain's "labyrinthine bookstore," "obsidian study," "Philosophy section," and "Cartography of Hours" are vividly particularized and purposefully chosen. The botanical diary (object-as-micro-setting) constrains Mira's solution by providing temporal-preposition entries. Sensory detail ("shelves that hummed," "mountain whispered") is selective and voice-filtered. Spatial choreography across sections remains clear despite scope.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rescue the trapped students. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira identifies the overlapping seventeen visits as the rift cause, narrows her tactic to the diary's circular-etymology entries, and forges the harmonic bridge. The traveler's contract with forgetting functions as the pressure point that enables resolution. Agency is shared (Mira speaks, traveler reads), and the cost—eternal recurrence for the traveler, another cycle for Mira—is conceptual and felt in the ending image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (knowledge through loss, cycles of seeking/forgetting) emerges from the library-of-unlearned-lessons concept and the botanical diary's semantic roots. The ending image—"rescue missions…were about ensuring the lost could find themselves again"—edges toward stated moral but is anchored by the traveler's disappearance and Mira's preparation for "the next disturbance." The "unheard symphony" motif recurs but risks decorative resonance rather than constraining choice. Subtext operates in Mira's gentle deflection ("You find it every time") and the mountain's twelve-language agreement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited on Mira; perceptual signature (linguistic, botanical precision) is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("harmonic shift," "semantic evolution," "symphonic architecture") that reads as narrative overlay rather than Mira's lived lexicon under pressure. Dialogue—"You're searching for the library of unlearned lessons," "Will I find it this time?"—carries subtext and advances plot. No head-hopping. The prose texture is distinct but leans abstract at peak beats (the bridge-building moment) where embodied action would sharpen focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; paragraph structure supports beats. Figurative language density is high throughout ("harmonic shift," "probability spirals," "linguistic singularities," "verbal flowers," "semantic evolution," "unheard symphony") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff at closure; this risks ornamental overwriting. Clarity holds across beats; no loops or scaffold. One minor simultaneity slip: "She began to speak…The mountain listened" implies instant response without clear elapsed beat. Information density is strong; sentences multitask. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—arcane linguist, time-travel rift, library of unlearned lessons, botanical-diary-as-linguistic-map—is specific and non-obvious. The "teaching through loss" paradox and the overlapping-visits mechanism feel fresh. Risk-taking in the accumulative/conceptual design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The traveler's eternal recursion and Mira's acceptance of cycles avoid tidy resolution. Transformation of the "rescue mission" trope (not preventing loss but enabling self-recovery) is purposeful and grounded in prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's choices (descend to study, retrieve diary, speak harmonic structure, hand traveler the entries) create all key turns. Early signal, two distinct beats (diagnosis + solution), causal pressure, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Botanical diary is retrieved, consulted for temporal-preposition and circular-etymology entries, handed to the traveler, and returned to its place—four distinct touches. Its unique properties (linguistic roots as botanical growth) enable the solution. Early signal, beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage demonstrated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rescue missions frame the story (inciting incident: students trapped; resolution: students freed) and shape Mira's tactics. The concept is thematically reweighted in the ending reflection but the stakes remain abstract; the students' plight is not dramatized with personal cost or agency.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is signaled early ("the mountain provided, but only if asked in proper conjugations") and demonstrated through Mira's diary retrieval and language choice. The trait constrains her method (must speak in "missing prepositions") but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Renegotiate" is the action that unlocks closure: Mira tells the traveler he must renegotiate his contract with forgetting, and the harmonic structure they co-create frees the students. The verb is specific, non-swappable, and redefines options at the climax.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"By researching gaps" is signaled early ("By researching gaps, Mira had mastered the mountain's hidden grammar") and demonstrated when she consults the diary's temporal-root sketches. The method shapes her approach (speaking in missing prepositions, absence syntax) and matters at closure, though its mechanics remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore/mountain pressures choices (sections trap students, the Cartography of Hours section houses the traveler, obsidian study provides the diary) and supplies resources (the diary, the mountain's "breathing audience"). Early signal, beat involvement, and closure linkage (mountain settling, whispering agreement) present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Timeframe ("after the time traveler arrives") anchors the inciting incident but does not function as a live clock. The "Tuesday…Thursday" gap is the problem rather than a ticking constraint; elapsed time within the rescue is not tracked or used to pressure Mira's choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation (find the library of unlearned lessons, remember what he learned) is dramatized through his seventeen recursive visits, his hollow-eyed recursion, and his final disappearance. Friction between wanting to remember and being unable to retain creates the conceptual stakes; the cost (eternal repetition) is felt in the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" as tone is signaled early ("note played in the wrong octave," "melody seeking resolution") and recurs at closure ("symphonic architecture," "music existed in the spaces between notes"). Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure (disruption → rescue → settling). The final image charges the motif with the mountain's twelve-language whisper, though the metaphor risks decorative abstraction rather than embodied constraint.</comment>
