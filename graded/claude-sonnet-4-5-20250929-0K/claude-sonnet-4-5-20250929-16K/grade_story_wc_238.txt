<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's internal conflict and guilt are embodied through specific actions (touching the perfume bottle, setting it down as offering) and her abandonment of metaphor marks genuine change. Derrick's wounded exhaustion and the choice to neither forgive nor fully reject show contradictory impulses in scene. The apology arrives with visible cost—fifteen years late, no guarantee of repair—and both characters' micro-choices (his withdrawal of the score, her physical offering) reveal hierarchy of values. Minor slip: Derrick's exposition about sound and induced currents feels slightly over-articulated for natural speech under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening: Mira in the archive facing demolition, Derrick's arrival, the fifteen-year wound. The closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "not friendship yet, maybe never again. But something real existed"—the apology is delivered, partially received, and the cost (lost years, incomplete repair) is undeniable on the page. Causal lens holds: Mira's column betrayal → estrangement → impending demolition forces the meeting → apology → tentative acknowledgment. One clean tightening when Derrick says "I don't forgive you...But I'm glad you came" forecloses easy reconciliation with felt relational cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archive's "paper ghosts," amber light, and Baroque shelves create tactile atmosphere; the orchard outside functions as both countdown clock and thematic mirror. The perfume bottle recurs as anchoring object and constrains Mira's final gesture (setting it on the score). Spatial choreography is clear: shelves, filing cabinet, window sightline to trees. Minor gap: the "neutral ground" claim tells rather than shows how the space uniquely enables this confrontation, and occupational detail (musicology, archival work) remains ornamental rather than pressure-generating.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mira's need to apologize before the archive (and chance) is destroyed—is signaled early and tightens when Derrick refuses easy forgiveness, forcing her to endure uncertainty. Agency is clear: Mira chooses to come, abandons her defensive metaphors, and offers the bottle as tangible renunciation of her old armor. The refusal of full reconciliation forecloses the path to restored friendship with visible relational cost. No false reversal; Derrick's "I'm glad you came" deepens pressure rather than deflating it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect miracles emerges through the apology's partial success and the archive/orchard's irreversible endings; the induced-current metaphor (connection without touching) charges the final dynamic. The perfume-bottle reprise and tree imagery avoid overt moralizing and invite reflection on harm, time, and incomplete repair. Minor penalty: "imperfect miracle" appears as both Mira's professional label and the story's thesis, creating a Thematic Echo (−0.5). The ending's "silence spoke its own truth" borders on summary, though the image of the bottle on the score provides concrete anchor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira's POV distance is stable; her metaphor habit is embodied and then visibly dropped ("I can't anymore"). Dialogue carries subtext—Derrick's "There's my metaphor-addicted friend" lands as rueful recognition, not reconciliation. Perceptual signature (paper ghosts, induced currents, trees as audience) is consistent and voice-specific. Minor friction: Derrick's explanation of sound physics reads slightly expository for naturalistic dialogue under emotional pressure, and both characters' diction remains elevated throughout without stress-driven compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings and lengths create visual variety. Information density is high—most lines advance character, mood, or stakes. Two minor issues: "suspended moment before irreversible change" and "the hush deepened" are near-paraphrases of the same atmospheric state (paraphrase-loop penalty −0.2). The metaphor density in the opening and closing paragraphs (paper ghosts, frozen prayers, invisible symphonies, paper cathedral) approaches saturation without full pattern-teaching, though it does not obscure causality (−0.3 for density in non-peak descriptive beats).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gossip-columnist-seeks-forgiveness premise is familiar, but the induced-current physics metaphor and the archive/orchard dual-destruction frame add specificity. Emotional truth (partial forgiveness, enduring wound) avoids tidy resolution. The perfume-bottle object and Mira's shift from metaphor to directness show craft. Transformation test concern: the core arc (betrayer apologizes, receives ambiguous response) could transfer to other betrayals with minimal rewriting; the archive and music details enrich but do not fundamentally alter the emotional template (−0.5 for moderate template reliance).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira's occupation as "gossip-column exorcist" is labeled early and motivates her guilt, but the exorcism metaphor remains thematic rather than shaping on-page tactics. Her decisive choice is to apologize directly, abandoning the column's metaphor style—integration is functional but the "exorcist" frame could be swapped for "investigative journalist" or "scandal writer" with minor edits. Present in setup (opening paragraph) and thematically at closure (she renounces her old method), but no middle beat where her professional skill or identity enables or constrains a specific action. Swappability and label-only use lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The perfume bottle appears in beat one (Mira touches it for comfort), is explained via backstory (grandmother's gift, the suffocation metaphor), and returns at closure when Mira sets it on the score as "talisman, offering, physical prayer." Three touches across setup, middle exposition, and ending. The bottle's meaning shifts from defensive comfort to public renunciation, reweighting her relationship to her grandmother's unheeded advice. Strong lyric reprise with visible cost (she relinquishes the object). Caps at ~6.9 due to middle use being reflective/expository rather than a distinct action beat, and the object does not constrain a middle choice—it enables the final gesture but is not irreplaceable (another keepsake could serve similarly).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Imperfect miracles" is named early as Mira's professional specialty, recurs in the penultimate paragraph to frame the partial reconciliation, and shapes the story's stakes (truth that harms and heals). However, it functions more as thematic overlay than on-page constraint—Mira does not perform an "imperfect miracle" procedure; she simply apologizes. The concept colors interpretation but does not alter her tactics or Derrick's response in a way unique to "miracle" framing. Present in setup and closure with clear thematic charge, but middling causal pressure (a "partial reconciliation" or "incomplete repair" lens would yield near-identical beats). Lyric-resonance allowance applies; score lands in mid-5s for theme-driven presence without tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mira's metaphor habit is demonstrated early ("trees remember everything"), explicitly named by Derrick ("You always talked like that when you couldn't say what you meant"), and dramatized in reversal when she abandons it mid-scene ("I've spent fifteen years justifying...I can't anymore"). The attribute shapes one key turn: her shift to directness signals genuine contrition and costs her defensive armor. Derrick's reciprocal use of metaphor (induced currents) and his recognition ("There's my metaphor-addicted friend") bookend the trait. Strong causal and closure work; the attribute constrains and then is renounced with visible cost. Eligible for ≥6.1 (all three gates) with solid beat involvement and closure linkage. Specificity and irreplaceability are high—remove the metaphor trait and the apology loses its dramatized vulnerability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Reconnect" is the dominant stake from the opening (Mira comes to reconnect through apology) and drives every major beat: her arrival, her abandonment of metaphor, Derrick's refusal then partial acceptance, the final "something real existed" acknowledgment. The action is early-signaled, causally central, and irreplaceable—without the reconnection attempt, the story has no engine. Two beats shaped: Mira's direct apology and Derrick's ambiguous response. Closure directly enacts the element (they reconnect imperfectly). Strong integration with visible cost (no guarantee of restored friendship). Minor limiter: the element is broad enough that swapping "reconcile" or "repair relationship" would require only minimal rewording (−0.3 for modest swappability).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Induced currents" is introduced mid-scene via Derrick's metaphor about sound traveling through bodies without direct contact, then echoed in the penultimate paragraph ("induced current of genuine remorse finally traveling"). The method is explicitly named and thematically apt (connection despite separation), but it does not constrain Mira's tactics or alter the apology's execution—she could reconnect via direct conversation, letter, or silence with equal plausibility. The physics metaphor enriches atmosphere and provides a lyric frame but remains ornamental to the action. Present in middle exposition and closure reprise (two touches), but neither beat requires this specific method to function. Lyric-resonance credit applies; score in low-5s for thematic presence without mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sheet music archive is vividly established (amber light, Baroque shelves, Schubert score) and its impending demolition creates the story's urgency—Mira must apologize "before they tear this place down." The setting provides the neutral-ground rationale and the Schubert score becomes the altar for the perfume-bottle offering. Two beats: opening orientation/urgency and final-image platform. The archive's destruction tightens the timeline and its paper-cathedral atmosphere charges the reconciliation's solemnity. Solid setup and closure work. Minor friction: the archive's music/sheet-music specificity is described but not functionally necessary—a library, chapel, or condemned family home would yield similar pressure with adjustments (−0.4 for moderate swappability). Demolition clock and symbolic resonance elevate into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe—"chainsaws scheduled for dawn," "final twilight," "tonight"—is established early and recurs to tighten urgency. The orchard's imminent destruction frames the now-or-never pressure on Mira's apology. Clock references appear in opening, middle ("this paper cathedral...would fall with the trees"), and ending ("Tomorrow they'd fall"). The hush/threshold mood is sustained and the deadline constrains the emotional window, though not the conversation's specific tactics (they could speak for hours or minutes without on-page consequence). Strong thematic charge and setup/closure presence. The element is tracked and felt but does not alter micro-choices within the dialogue. All three gates met; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong via the "final songs" image.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—to deliver an overdue apology—is stated early ("I came to apologize, properly"), dramatized through her abandonment of metaphor and defensive justifications, and tested by Derrick's refusal to forgive. The apology is the story's central action and every beat hinges on it: her vulnerability, his ambivalence, the perfume-bottle offering. Visible friction between her want (reconnection) and cost (no guarantee, exposure of shame). Closure directly enacts the element (apology delivered and received ambiguously). Strong causal work across all three gates with visible price. Minor limiter: the motivation is common enough in reconciliation narratives that it lacks unique specificity (−0.3), but execution quality and cost visibility keep the score in the 7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" coheres across the piece: amber light and paper ghosts (ethereal) layered with varnish smell, chainsaws, and the fifteen-year betrayal wound (grit). Tone modulates purposefully—lyric in setting passages, direct in the apology exchange, hushed at closure. The combination charges the final image: beauty (orchard trees, Schubert) meeting irreversible loss (demolition, incomplete repair). Tone is stable through pressure and enhances rather than undermining the emotional stakes. Strong setup and closure integration. The pairing is voice-consistent and specific to this story's needs; removing either pole (ethereal or grit) would flatten the ending's resonance.</comment>
