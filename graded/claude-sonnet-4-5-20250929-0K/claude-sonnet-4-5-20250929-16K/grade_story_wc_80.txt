<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Garrett's interiority is concrete and well-anchored in sensory detail ("brass worn smooth by generations of palms"), and his grief-driven motivation is embodied through selective perception. The character's shift from measuring what exists to preserving what has vanished is traceable, though the progression feels more contemplative than pressured. Internal contradiction is present (the technical surveyor becoming emotional archivist) but operates mostly in reflection rather than forcing difficult micro-choices in scene. The final act of placing the note is consistent but lacks a visible cost or renunciation that would elevate the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered memory, sensory detail, and the ritual of documentation toward a charged final image. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Garrett completes his offering and the final paragraph crystallizes his ongoing purpose with undeniable emotional weight. Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early). The cost is felt but oblique: he remains isolated in his mission, and the price is loneliness and the impossibility of recovery, legible in "part of him would remain here, archived in stone." One meaningful deepening occurs when he shifts from technical survey to emotional excavation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion supplies concrete constraint: knee-deep water, shifting light columns, the fissure in the central column that enables his offering. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("sunlight filtered through the surface in shifting columns"), filtered through Garrett's professional and grieving perspective. The inkwell, water, and stone all recur and charge the final image. The pavilion's transformation from celebration site to ruin directly mirrors the story's thematic concern with absence, and the physical space constrains his movement and shapes the ritual act at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible: Garrett's need to preserve vanished meaning against oblivion. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens but escalation is gentle—the story deepens rather than tightens. The act of placing the note is agency (a choice to document and preserve), but no live option is foreclosed with visible cost; he will continue this practice tomorrow at another site. The timeframe (drawbridge risen, isolated until dusk) creates a boundary but does not force a trade-off or narrow tactics. One meaningful deepening occurs in the shift from measurement to elegy, but the stakes remain steady rather than escalating.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: interlaced absence, the preservation of vanished dreams, the tension between documentation and loss. The inkwell, the flooded pavilion, and the hidden note all carry thematic weight without overt statement. "Interlaced absence" is introduced early and demonstrated through concrete particulars (empty chair, unworn shoes, the erased celebrations). The final image offers a resonant answer—Garrett as "archeologist of abandoned dreams"—though the phrase risks being slightly on-the-nose. The story resists tidy resolution; Garrett's mission is ongoing, solitary, and tinged with futility, which deepens rather than resolves the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, anchored in Garrett's professional precision and grief-shaded perception. Perceptual signature is strong: he notices structural damage, light through water, the weight of brass, filtered through both technical expertise and memory. Diction is elevated but consistent ("hushed blaze," "interlaced absence"), appropriate for a contemplative, elegiac register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, moving from external observation to reflection without head-hopping. No dialogue present. Focalization is clean throughout; no filter-verb stacks or register drift mar the execution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with strong rhythm and vivid imagery ("columns listing like drunken dancers," "hushed blaze"). Information density is high and sentences typically do multiple jobs. However, several phrases veer into overwriting: "hushed blaze, silent yet burning with memory" mixes metaphors (a blaze that is silent), and "interlaced" appears three times, risking redundancy. "Wrestled it into the column's crack" introduces a verb ("wrest") that feels forced by the prompt requirement. Minor template cadence in the middle section ("He moved...," "He unscrewed...," "He tightened...") slightly flattens momentum. No major loops or scaffolding, but figurative density in reflective passages occasionally slows the beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—a surveyor who secretly archives lost meaning in building repairs—offers a fresh angle on grief and preservation. The combination of technical work and emotional archaeology is specific and memorable. However, the execution leans toward the elegiac and contemplative without a sharp turn or risk; the story unfolds as expected once the concept is established. "Archeologist of abandoned dreams" borders on prompt-echo language. The piece synthesizes familiar grief-work themes through a distinct professional lens, but the lack of surprise or complication in the final third keeps it from higher originality scores.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Garrett is present throughout, and his decision to place the note (rather than merely survey) is the story's central action. He is introduced early, his professional role shapes perception and access, and his choice at the column directly enables closure. However, his agency is more methodical than conflicted—he arrives intending this act and executes it without meaningful obstacle or cost. The character is essential but his choices do not create key reversals or alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The inkwell appears in the opening (grandfather's antique, "ink that never seemed to dry"), is withdrawn from the case at the central column, and is replaced at the end ("warm against his palm, heated by sun through water"). It anchors three beats and carries symbolic weight (generations of documentation). However, its function is passive—a container and inheritance marker—rather than constraining choice or altering tactics. The inkwell charges the final image but does not drive a turn; it could be replaced with another inherited tool without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Interlaced absence" is introduced early ("absence could be interlaced—woven through presence"), demonstrated through examples (empty chair, unworn shoes), and applied to the pavilion's lost celebrations. It shapes Garrett's perception and mission, but remains primarily thematic rather than altering on-page tactics or creating friction. The concept is present across beats and informs his documentation practice, but does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off. It is essential to tone and meaning but not to plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Stoically sensitive" is signaled once ("He moved stoically through the water, his sensitive eyes cataloging every crack") but functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains action. The stoicism is consistent with his methodical work, and sensitivity informs his emotional cataloging, but no moment shows these qualities in tension or forcing a visible cost. The attribute describes rather than drives; removing the explicit mention would not alter the character's behavior or the story's outcome.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears once in a single sentence: "To wrest something from oblivion required both strength and gentleness." It describes the act of securing the note in the fissure but is not a repeated action or a pivot point. The verb is thematically apt (pulling meaning from loss) but could be replaced with "pull," "retrieve," or "secure" without structural change. It colors the moment but does not redefine options or shape multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method is introduced early ("placing notes inside foundation repairs for the past year"), shapes the middle section (finding the fissure, writing the note, sealing it with clay), and directly enacts the closure. It is Garrett's ongoing practice and the story's central ritual. The mechanics matter: he must find a suitable crack, the repair crew will arrive next week, and the note will be discovered by a future surveyor. This method is essential to plot and closure, though it unfolds as planned without obstacle or adaptation under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is established immediately (drawbridge locked, flooded terrace, listing columns) and supplies the physical constraint that enables Garrett's work: the water he wades through, the fissure in the central column. It anchors memory (anniversary party twenty years ago) and mirrors theme (celebration turned ruin). The setting shapes the atmosphere ("something between ruin and cathedral") and provides the specific site where the note is placed. Removing the pavilion's submerged state would not break the plot but would drain much of the story's visual and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The drawbridge rising at dawn and lowering at dusk creates a boundary (island isolation) but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Time is mentioned at the opening and closing but remains untracked in the middle; there is no clock pressure or urgency. Garrett could complete his work in an hour or linger all day with no consequence. The timeframe provides setting detail and a lyric frame but does not constrain choice or escalate stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation is introduced early ("his true calling...to preserve what had vanished") and demonstrated through action (writing the note, placing it in the column). It is rooted in grief (five years since Sarah's death) and unfolds in the decision to document "interlaced absence." However, the desire is not conflicted—Garrett pursues it without friction, cost, or competing want. The motivation explains and drives the plot but lacks internal opposition or a moment where pursuing it forecloses another path. It is told and shown but not tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" is introduced early ("The atmosphere held a hushed blaze, silent yet burning with memory") and reprised in the penultimate paragraph ("The hushed blaze of morning shifted toward afternoon"). The tone is elegiac, reverent, and consistent across beats. However, the phrase itself is somewhat contradictory (a blaze that is hushed and silent) and does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image in a fresh way. It establishes mood effectively but remains more static than dynamic, and the final reprise feels ornamental rather than reweighting prior material.</comment>
