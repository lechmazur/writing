<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Meridian's interior world is developed through her mapping obsession and the grandmother connection, but her choices feel contemplative rather than pressured. The "reawaken" moment reads as epiphany without embodied contradiction or cost—she arrives at understanding through observation, not struggle. The sanely-eccentric trait remains label-only; no on-page moment shows how this particular eccentricity constrains or enables a choice. Interiority is specific (hyperbolic curves, translucent sheets) but the emotional stakes stay abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates texture through the mapping project and arrives at a Conceptual Repricing in the final paragraph ("Stories live in the curvature"). However, the cost is conceptual only—no visible forfeiture, no path foreclosed, no felt price paid on the page. The "voids" discovery and final notation feel like observations rather than decisive changes that reweight options. Orientation is clear early (3 AM, library, Meridian's project), so no penalty there.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The converted observatory setting is vivid and purposeful, grounding the scientific-poetry hybrid. The translucent sheets, desk lamp shadows, and the scarf draping across the model create tactile micro-setting that charges the discovery moment. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (outer rings, deepest section, desk). The grandmother's scarf functions as both object and setting anchor, settling into valleys and peaks to reveal interference patterns—environment directly enables the breakthrough.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where stories live—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The "voids" discovery is a tightening, yet no live option is foreclosed and no trade-off dramatized. Meridian's agency is observational; she arranges sheets and notices patterns, but pressure does not force a renunciation or choice with visible cost. The piece deepens understanding without escalating tension or narrowing paths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the hyperbolic geometry conceit: connection arises from unmappable distance. The scarf recurs purposefully, linking grandmother's analog star-cataloguing to Meridian's book-mapping. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("Stories live in the curvature. Not as metaphor, but as literal truth") rather than letting the image resonate. The piece invites reflection but the ending asserts rather than earns its wisdom through pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and clean, with no head-hopping. Meridian's perceptual signature is distinct—she sees geodesics and saddle points where others see shelves. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("hyperbolic distance," "topology of near-misses"). The prose carries a meditative rhythm appropriate to the 3 AM setting, modulating slightly at the discovery beat. No dialogue present; interiority remains specific to her mathematician-librarian lens throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is generally high. Two minor issues: the phrase "sanely eccentric" (paragraph 2) is tell rather than show, and "emotional coordinates on translucent sheets" (paragraph 3) mixes metaphor slightly. The final paragraph contains mild overwriting—"the hyperbolic geometry wasn't a method for finding where stories lived; it was the place itself" followed immediately by another restatement. No loops or severe artifacts, but the closure beat could be tighter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The hyperbolic-geometry-as-story-cartography premise is fresh and the scientific-poetry library feels specific. The analog-memories thread (grandmother's handwritten logbooks, pen pressure, coffee stains) offers texture. However, the emotional arc is contemplative rather than surprising—Meridian seeks, finds, understands—without a non-obvious turn. The piece commits fully to its conceit but the final realization ("she'd been living inside the answer all along") lands as anticipated rather than freshly inflected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Meridian is present throughout and her odd-hour preference is established early. Her mapping work drives all beats. However, her choices are observational (arranging sheets, noticing patterns) rather than decisional. She discovers rather than decides, and the ending is realization without a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The scarf appears in paragraph 1 (inherited, frayed edges, fidgeting), paragraph 5 (draping to anchor sheets, settling into curves), paragraph 7 (wrapping around shoulders, feeling history), and the final paragraph (touching frayed edge, grandmother's presence). It enables the discovery (its weight reveals interference patterns) and charges the closure image. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but the causal pressure is moderate—the sheets could be anchored another way.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Analog memories frame the entire quest: grandmother's handwritten logbooks crystallize Meridian's motivation (paragraph 4), and the contrast between "pen pressure varying with excitement" versus "digital databases" shapes her belief that presence encodes in tactile relationships. The concept drives her three-year mapping project and returns in the final image ("analog memories and tattered silk scarves could properly measure"). Essential across beats and ending, though the mechanics remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is named in paragraph 2 but never dramatized. The text tells us "most people found her sanely eccentric" and describes her organizing method, but no on-page action shows how this particular trait constrains or enables a choice with cost. It's decorative characterization without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Reawaken" appears at the closure beat (paragraph 6): "Meridian felt something reawaken in her chest, a sensation like remembering how to recognize constellations after years of looking at processed sky surveys." This moment crystallizes her understanding and charges the final image. The action is internal and pivotal, framing the entire resolution. Removing it would weaken the closure significantly, though the mechanics are perceptual rather than decisional.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is signaled early (paragraph 2: "geometric relationships between their metaphors, tracing invisible hyperbolic curves") and developed throughout (paragraph 3: saddle-shaped surfaces, diverging parallels; paragraph 5: geodesics, negative curvature). The method enables the discovery—overlaying translucent sheets creates interference patterns that reveal voids. It shapes her entire approach and the final insight ("Stories live in the curvature"). The mechanics matter on the page and closure depends on it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is established in paragraph 2 (converted observatory, Maxwell's equations as villanelles, thermodynamic sonnets) and provides the entire arena. The deepest section, translucent sheets, and desk lamp are micro-setting that enables discovery. Outer rings versus deepest section creates spatial pressure. The setting is purposeful and specific, though it does not force a choice with cost—it supplies resources rather than constraints.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "while patrons browse" is present throughout—pharmaceutical researcher and heartbroken engineer are mentioned (paragraph 3), and the final paragraph returns to "early-morning patrons...quietly browsing." However, time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. The patrons remain background texture; their browsing does not create urgency or pressure. The clock is static rather than live.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Meridian's motivation to find where stories live is established early (paragraph 4: grandmother's logbooks sparked the realization) and drives the three-year mapping project. The quest is sustained across all beats and resolved at closure ("The place where stories lived wasn't in the books themselves...but in this unmappable geometry between them"). However, the motivation is contemplative rather than conflicted—no friction between wants and costs dramatized on the page. The desire shapes all action but without visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Observed solitude is coherent from the opening (3 AM, insomniacs and doctoral candidates, "her odd-hour work") through the middle (patrons in outer rings, Meridian alone in the deepest section) to closure ("alone among the quietly browsing patrons"). The tone modulates slightly at the discovery beat (excitement, reawakening) but returns to meditative solitude in the final image. The tone charges the ending by emphasizing connection-within-isolation, though the modulation is subtle rather than dramatic.</comment>
