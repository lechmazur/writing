<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Isla's motivation to reconcile is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies heavily on elevated, abstract diction ("fury rising," "desperate hope") rather than embodied contradiction. The medium functions more as oracle than character with agency. The sister exists only through reported letters and condensation-writing, never testing Isla on the page. The final choice to "run toward reconciliation" arrives without visible cost or foreclosed alternative—no dramatized renunciation of pride, fear, or competing need.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a hybrid causal-accumulative lens: the medium's ritual (gargoyle shard + moonlight + letters) triggers a memory-vision that reframes Isla's understanding, then produces the sister's letters as proof of mutual longing. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Isla holds both letter bundles and runs toward reconciliation, the cost implied by five years of silence and the spirits' path. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than on-page forfeit—no dramatized sacrifice or tactical narrowing occurs in the final beats. The memory-space visit functions as revelation without complication, and the sister's letters arrive as deus ex without prior setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is vivid and specific: twisted roots, brackish water, moonlight filtering through canopy, spirits singing in harmonies. The hanging window between mangrove trunks and the gargoyle shard both appear as tactile objects. The setting pressures Isla's journey (she navigates by spirit-voices) and the moonlight is essential to the shard's function. The mangroves frame the medium's dwelling and the spirits' song becomes a luminous path home, directly shaping the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconciliation with her sister after five years—is signaled early and sustained. The medium's ritual provides one meaningful deepening: the memory-vision shows Isla the "instant before the cruel words" and lets her witness her sister's trembling hope, reweighting her understanding of that pivotal moment. However, the escalation lacks a second tightening or visible trade-off; the sister's letters appear as convenience rather than complication, and Isla's decision to run toward reconciliation incurs no on-page cost (no fear overcome, no alternate path refused, no tactical price paid in the moment).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—the persistence of apology and the retrieval of missed moments—emerges through the window's condensation messages and the gargoyle shard's power to "heal moments." The medium's line "The moment before deciding never truly passes" articulates theme directly rather than letting it resonate through image alone. The final image (spirits' song, condensation blessings, Isla running with both letter bundles) offers a non-literal answer but leans toward sentimentality ("fierce tenderness that had survived everything") without ambiguity or cost that complicates the reconciliation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Voice is stable third-person limited with elevated, lyric diction throughout ("frozen thoughts," "layered quality," "trembles with possibility"). Psychic distance remains consistent. However, the register skews uniformly poetic even under pressure: "the space was so small—a single breath, a heartbeat—but infinite with possibility" reads more like thematic summary than embodied urgency. The medium's dialogue carries distinct oracular cadence, but Isla's internal voice lacks perceptual signature beyond the lyric frame. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("roots twisted like frozen thoughts," "singing their contents into the roots"), but some metaphors drift toward abstraction without grounding ("ghost of what you meant to send," "space where an apology waits unspoken"). The piece avoids major loops but carries minor scaffold: "The singing spirits crescendoed, their voices forming a luminous path" recaps the spirits' role without adding new pressure. Sentence openings vary, rhythm modulates, and clarity holds. Line-level control is solid but not exceptional; the elevated register persists uniformly without degradation under stress.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—medium facilitates reconciliation through magical objects and memory-space—follows a familiar spiritual-intermediary template. The gargoyle shard that "heals moments in moonlight" and unsent letters as portals offer specific details, but the emotional arc (regret → revelation → decision to reconcile) proceeds without friction or surprise. The sister's matching unsent letters, produced at the perfect moment, feel convenient rather than inevitable. No bold structural risk or non-obvious synthesis; the turn relies on external magic rather than character-driven complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The cryptic medium appears early, performs the ritual (spreading letters, pressing shard, producing the sister's bundle), and delivers oracular guidance. She enables the memory-vision and the revelation of mutual letters, shaping two key beats. However, she makes no on-page choice under pressure; her role is facilitator, not agent with competing stakes. She does not constrain Isla or force a trade-off. Closure participation is indirect—she fades as Isla runs, blessing rather than deciding.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The gargoyle's rainspout shard appears in the second paragraph, described as "ancient and water-worn" and holding memory of storms and prayers. The medium presses it against a letter, triggering the memory-vision (middle beat). It glows and pulses with lunar light at closure, and Isla carries it as she runs. Present across three beats with causal function (enables the vision), but its specific properties (eight hundred years, water-worn) do not constrain or complicate Isla's choice. Swappable with any "healing relic."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Unsent letters frame the entire story: Isla clutches her bundle in the opening line, the medium spreads them across the window to trigger condensation-messages, and the revelation of the sister's matching bundle reweights the stake. The letters are portals and proof, shaping both the middle ritual and the closure decision. Removing them collapses the plot. They constrain Isla's understanding (five years of unspoken words) and charge the final image (she runs with both bundles).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Heals in moonlight" is stated by the medium and demonstrated once: the shard glows when pressed to the letter under moonlight, enabling the memory-vision. The trait is essential to that beat but does not recur or impose a visible cost (no consequence for using it, no limitation shown). The moonlight remains ambient rather than a constraint Isla must work around. Functional but not irreplaceable; "activates under moonlight" could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Evoke" governs the memory-vision beat: the shard "can evoke what was never quite lost," placing Isla in the crystalline moment before her cruel words. This revelation reweights her understanding and drives her decision. However, the action occurs once and passively (Isla is "standing" in the memory-space without struggle). The ending runs on the revelation's momentum rather than a second evocation. Present and causal, but not repeatedly tested or charged at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Messages in condensation on windows appear in two beats: first, her sister's words form on the glass as moonlight strikes it; second, Isla's own apology appears. The method is signaled early and visually specific. However, the mechanics are not constrained—Isla does not negotiate or fail with the window, and its function duplicates the shard's revelation without complication. The final image mentions "messages still forming in condensation" as ambient blessing, not causal driver. Functional but not load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is vivid and present throughout: Isla navigates by spirit-voices, the medium's dwelling appears where two mangroves form an arch, and the spirits' song becomes "a luminous path through the labyrinth back toward the living world" at closure. The setting provides navigation cues and atmosphere. However, it does not constrain Isla's choice—no wrong turn, no danger, no resource scarcity. The spirits guide rather than test. Present across all beats and charged in the final image, but pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"The space where an apology waits unspoken" is articulated by the medium and governs the memory-vision beat: Isla is placed in "the instant before the cruel words emerged." The timeframe is conceptual rather than ticking—no urgency that alters tactics, no visible deadline. Isla does not race the moon's setting or the spirits' patience. The phrase recurs thematically ("The moment before deciding never truly passes") but does not tighten decisions on the page. Present, thematic, but not pressuring.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Isla's desire to find the moment before her mistake is voiced in dialogue ("I want to find when I could have apologized") and drives the journey to the medium. The memory-vision dramatizes that moment, showing her sister's hope and Isla's rising fury. The revelation shifts Isla's understanding and fuels the closure decision. However, the motivation is not conflicted on the page—no competing fear, no cost of seeking help, no visible sacrifice to enter the memory-space. Single-note longing without friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Fierce tenderness" is named in the final paragraph ("the fierce tenderness that had survived everything") and implied in the medium's "eyes that blazed with an intensity that held both challenge and absolute protection." The tone aims for lyric warmth but remains declarative rather than embodied in action or image under pressure. The piece does not modulate—no moment of fury, fear, or hesitation that tests the tenderness. Stated more than charged; the final image leans sentimental without contradiction.</comment>
