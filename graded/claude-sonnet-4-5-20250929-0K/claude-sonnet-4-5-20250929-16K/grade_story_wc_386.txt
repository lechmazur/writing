<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and her method is specific (mapping dream fragments), but her interiority remains largely abstract—she observes patterns without embodied emotion or visible internal contradiction. The captain's arc is told rather than dramatized; we never see the choice to drown with the data, only Maya's inference. The final promise ("I'll make sure they know") lacks visible cost or renunciation that would foreclose a path; Maya succeeds without struggle in this scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates dream fragments toward a conceptual repricing—Maya understands the captain's sacrifice and promises to expose it. Orientation anchors within ~120 words (Maya, glacier shrine, night, wreck-diver). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (promise to contact archives), but the cost remains abstract; no on-page action shows what Maya risks or forfeits by making this promise. One meaningful deepening occurs when she names the captain's choice, yet the final beat resolves too smoothly without friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glacier shrine with seventeen candles provides strong sensory anchors (ice walls, reflected light, breath crystallizing). The melted snow globe constrains Maya's understanding (she reads its tilted ship as the Katerina). The aurora metaphor in the final paragraphs charges the closure image with borrowed-light resonance. Spatial choreography is clean; the setting enables discovery without merely decorating.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: ensuring the Katerina's research reaches the world. The pressure tightens once—Maya moves from mapping fragments to identifying the captain and his motive. However, no on-page obstacle tests her; she deduces, promises, and the ghost departs satisfied. The resolution lacks a visible trade-off or complication; coincidence (the dreams arriving, the ghost cooperating) enables rather than complicates. One meaningful deepening is present but not a turn that narrows options with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the borrowed-starlight motif: ghosts, truth, and sacrifice all arrive via indirect paths. The captain's choice (data over life) and Maya's method (listening to dream-whispers) create a coherent meditation on indirect testimony. The final aurora image answers the thematic question without stating a moral. However, the piece occasionally edges toward overt statement ("the small, fierce love that makes someone choose to drown with their conscience intact") rather than letting the image alone carry weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, and a distinct perceptual signature: Maya notices reflection, metaphor, and pattern ("windows of connection"). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("weaves truth carefully," "cameo appearances"). The prose modulates rhythmically, slowing for reflection and tightening for the promise beat. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Minor: the narrator occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the slow violence of warming seas") that feels slightly above the tactile voice established elsewhere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do two jobs. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. The opening and closing images (candles, aurora) bracket the piece cleanly. Minor deductions: "borrowed starlight" appears three times with slightly different vehicles (candles/ice, aurora/magnetic fields, ghosts/truth/love), creating mild figurative drift. One scaffold phrase: "She had to expose this truth—not for sensation, but because it mattered" explains motive already shown.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The wreck-diver who reads ghosts through strangers' dreams is a fresh synthesis; the glacier shrine and melted snow globe add specificity. The captain's sacrifice (data over life) transforms a disaster-story trope into a climate-witness parable. However, the premise leans on a familiar template (psychic investigator solves historical mystery via supernatural method) without fully defamiliarizing it. The ending's emotional beat (promise, ghost departs satisfied) follows expected resolution contours. Risk-taking is present but restrained.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout, and her interpretation of the dreams drives the key turn (identifying the captain and his motive). She makes the decision to contact the archives, altering tactics from passive mapping to active exposure. However, the choice is announced rather than dramatized with visible friction or cost in the moment. Present in setup, middle deduction, and closure promise; causal but not strongly pressured.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The melted snow globe appears in paragraph two (setup), Maya handles it and reads its tilted ship as the Katerina (middle), and she picks it up again at the promise beat (closure). Its warped-by-fire state and dried glycerin signal the captain's loss; its miniature ship replica constrains Maya's interpretation. Three distinct beats, charged reprise, and causal pressure. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Windows of connection" is named early and frames the method (ghosts slip into strangers' dreams). It shapes Maya's approach (mapping dream fragments) and reappears at the promise ("Your windows of connection—I found them"). However, it functions more as thematic label than tactical constraint; removing the phrase would not break the plot. Present in setup and closure, but mid-band for limited causal grip.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully, never rushing to conclusions" is stated in paragraph five and demonstrated when Maya maps seventeen dreams before naming the captain. It constrains her method (slow accumulation) but does not create visible cost or force a trade-off. The trait is functional but could swap for "methodical" without structural loss. One beat, descriptive more than pressured.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Expose" is the stated goal ("She had to expose this truth") and the promise action ("I'll make sure they know"). It drives the closure decision (contact the archives) and links to theme (truth that doesn't stay buried). However, the action is declared more than enacted; we do not see Maya begin the exposure or face resistance. Present in setup (implicit mission) and closure (promise), but swappable with "reveal" or "share."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Analyzing dream cameos is demonstrated on-page: Maya reviews the Portland drowning (diesel fuel taste), Oslo child (frozen eyelashes, Russian lullaby), Toronto professor (reaching for snow globe). The method enables her to identify the captain and his final act. It shapes two beats (mapping fragments, naming motive) and is integral to the ending's epistemic closure. Strong causal role, though the mechanics are told more than shown in action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glacier shrine provides spatial anchor and symbolic resonance (ice walls, seventeen candles). It enables the ritual framing and houses the snow globe. The setting pressures tone (coldness, reflection) and charges the final candle-extinguishing beat. However, it does not alter Maya's tactics or constrain her choices; she could perform this deduction elsewhere. Present in setup, middle, and closure; strong atmospheric contribution but limited tactical grip.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>Timeframe: None specified.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To salvage something pure from the wreckage" is Maya's explicit motive and mirrors the captain's (saving the data). It drives her promise to contact the archives and frames the thematic closure. However, the motive is declared more than tested; no on-page conflict forces Maya to choose between purity and pragmatism. Present in setup (implied) and closure (stated); thematic but not dramatically pressured.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Borrowed starlight" anchors tone from the opening (candlelight on ice "casting borrowed starlight") through the closing aurora ("borrowed starlight indeed, solar wind caught in magnetic fields"). The tone remains coherent—elegiac, indirect, layered—and modulates subtly as Maya moves from observation to promise. The metaphor charges the final image, linking ghosts, truth, and reflection. Strong setup-to-closure integration and tonal control under pressure.</comment>
