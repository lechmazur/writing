<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Amal's motivation is grounded in trauma and her interior contradictions are palpable—she clings to grief-mad science while acknowledging rational warnings. The geode's dual function (scientific instrument and grief anchor) embodies her psychological state concretely. The final smile before devastation shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor slip: "bleak exhilaration" appears twice as a label rather than fully embodied sensation in pivotal beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with visible cost: Amal's smile before unleashing catastrophe crystallizes her choice to weaponize grief against the world (Charged Poise/nascent DC). The lens reads Causal-Situational Hybrid—her hunt progresses through instrument calibration and theoretical modeling, then crystallizes into a stance of deliberate apocalypse. Orientation anchors arrive within the first 150 words. One friction: the "concentration was growing" discovery doesn't clearly narrow her tactical options before the final beat; escalation reads more as confirmation than complication.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The observatory's failing systems (cooling circuits, decreasing altitude, life support) pressure every choice with a live countdown. The geode physically constrains her method—she mounts it, adjusts its position, presses her forehead to it—and its warmth pulse charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the drifting platform and the desert thirty miles below. The floating observatory as isolation chamber/weapon synthesis is specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding where potential pools to weaponize it) is signaled early and tightens when the concentration proves critical-mass-scale. The climactic choice—amplifying perturbations toward the pool—is protagonist-driven and forecloses mercy with visible cost: "the world would feel what she'd felt." One gap: the decision to "focus its resonance toward the concentration" feels like crossing a threshold, but no on-page obstacle or trade-off dramatizes the moment of no return; she simply proceeds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (violence's quantum scars and the weaponization of stolen futures) emerges from concrete particulars: the geode's dual halves, the ghost-weddings in sensor data, perturbation math. The final image—her smile before unleashing unfiltered reality—offers a resonant answer without moralizing: grief can make survivors of everyone by shattering their certainty. The "bleak exhilaration" motif recurs but earns its charge by shifting from survival reflex to chosen apocalypse. No false balance; Amal's stance is neither redeemed nor condemned, only made inevitable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with high intimacy; perceptual signature is consistent (physics as grief language, instruments as extensions of her wounded body). Diction control is strong—"quantum-locked," "perturbation equations," "ghost-weddings"—but slips toward overwrought register in "the beautiful, mundane futures that violence had stolen" where the abstraction dilutes urgency. The geode whisper to her dead uncle and the final smile both feel earned by prior interiority. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theory. Rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives ("The concentration was growing") punctuate longer exploratory sentences. Two frictions: "bleak exhilaration" appears identically twice (label loop), and "the physics of small disturbances revealing hidden structures" reads as scaffold exposition mid-beat. The geode's "facets dig into scarred skin" and "observing drifted three miles above" anchor concretely. Propulsion is strong through the final sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief science, quantum theory, and apocalyptic reckoning feels specific and non-obvious. The geode as amplifier of unused potential is a fresh inflection on the "personal object as scientific key" trope. The floating observatory setting and perturbation-theory frame avoid stock post-apocalypse staging. Risk-taking: the protagonist's final choice is to unleash devastation without redemption arc, and the story commits fully. Minor conventionality: the lone-scientist-vindicated-too-late structure echoes familiar templates, though the moral calculus (weaponized grief as justice) transforms it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Amal's survivor status drives her hunt and justifies her isolation; the wedding memory anchors her motivation and the final choice to make "survivors of everyone." Her decisions—calibrating instruments, focusing the geode, choosing to trigger the awakening—create all key turns. The attribute is causally active across setup, development, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The geode appears in four distinct beats: gift/grief anchor in backstory, mounted detection array, adjustment for focus, forehead press with warmth pulse at closure. Its crystalline lattice enables perturbation detection (causal), its dual halves embody severed futures (thematic), and its final warmth charges the ending image. Removing it breaks the method and the emotional through-line.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Unfiltered awakening" frames the climax—reality's unused possibilities erupting unfiltered by linear time—and Amal's final choice hinges on triggering it. The concept shapes her theory (quantum-locked futures achieving critical mass) and the stakes (world-scale rupture). It appears in closure but could be reframed as "reality break" or "quantum collapse" without deep structural loss; specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" describes her quarry (the mathematical ghost of unused potential) and is signaled early. It constrains her method—she needs instruments to detect the intangible and the geode to amplify it—but the attribute itself functions more as thematic coloring than a lever that alters on-page tactics. Present in setup and development; modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The hunt structures the entire arc: Amal tracks perturbations, discovers the massive concentration, models critical mass, and amplifies resonance toward it. Two beats depend on hunt progress (concentration discovery, geode focus). Removing "hunt" requires reframing as passive observation or accidental discovery, which would collapse her agency. Strong but not indispensable—"track" or "pursue" could substitute with minor tonal loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Perturbation theory is signaled early ("the physics of small disturbances"), provides her method (detecting quantum echoes, modeling critical mass), and enables the climax (amplifying perturbations toward the pool). It shapes two beats (detection array readings, final calculation). The mechanics remain abstract—no on-page constraint from the theory itself forces a tactical trade-off—so it reads more as flavor than hard lever. Present across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating observatory provides isolation, failing life support that pressures time, decreasing altitude as power diverts, and the physical platform for her detection array. It enables her method (distance for sensor range) and contributes to closure (she doesn't care if it drifts until life support fails). The setting is causally active in two beats and inseparable from her stance. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"While circuit breakers cool" appears twice (opening and mid-story reset) and adds texture, but the timeframe never tightens decisions—Amal proceeds whether they cool or not. The cooling period doesn't create a countdown or alter her tactics; she explicitly dismisses the constraint ("The circuit breakers would cool or they wouldn't"). Present but ornamental; replaces urgency with atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Finding where unused potential pools is Amal's explicit goal, stated early and pursued through every beat: calibrating instruments, reading data, discovering the concentration, modeling its behavior, focusing the geode. The motivation is dramatized in micro-choices (feeding power carefully, adjusting the geode's position) and costs (isolation, life support failure acceptance). It drives closure directly. Strong causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Bleak exhilaration" is named twice and embodied throughout: her grief-mad experiments, fierce joy at approaching revelation, smile before devastation. Tone modulates from bitter hunt to apocalyptic triumph without losing coherence. The phrase charges the final image ("Finally, the world would feel what she'd felt") and the combination of bleakness (stolen futures) and exhilaration (unmoored certainty) is specific and sustained. Minor dock for label repetition rather than full dramatization in one peak beat.</comment>
