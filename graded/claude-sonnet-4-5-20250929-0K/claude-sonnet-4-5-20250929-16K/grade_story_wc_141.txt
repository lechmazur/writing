<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marina's shift from skeptic to believer is declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The interiority relies on abstract epiphany ("she suddenly understood") without embodied cost or competing desires at the moment of realization. Her twenty-year career and grandmother's influence are told as backstory without micro-choices that foreclose paths on the page. The final mixing of tears and laughter reads as performed emotion rather than contradictory impulses wrestling under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a closure that crystallizes into Resonant Reconfiguration: Marina's understanding reweights her career and the riddle's answer. Cost is visible in her commitment to document "tomorrow," foreclosing her prior debunking stance, though the cost could be sharper on the page. Orientation anchors late (observatory location and her nightly ritual take ~150 words to clarify), triggering a −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The riddle's answer arrives through assertion rather than dramatized discovery, weakening causal linkage even under an accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The observatory's ruined dome and "bruised twilight skies" create vivid atmosphere, and the cliff-wind resonating through the cello strings constrains the final discovery. Micro-setting (seashell, cello, acoustic sweet spot) charges the closure image effectively. However, orientation delay (cliff-top location unclear until mid-story) and the observatory functioning as passive backdrop in early beats prevent higher scoring. Spatial choreography remains clean once established.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the universal riddle—is signaled early and deepens when the seashell reveals memory-voices, forcing Marina to test her skepticism. One meaningful tightening occurs when she plucks the incomplete cello and hears forgotten voices, narrowing her interpretive options. However, the resolution lacks visible tradeoff; her discovery costs nothing on the page beyond a vague "tomorrow" commitment. The riddle's answer is asserted rather than tested through opposing pressure or failed attempts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of memory as irreplicable magic emerges from the seashell and cello particulars and avoids overt moralizing until the final beats. "Voices go everywhere, becoming part of everything" arrives as a resonant answer without a stated moral. However, "Marina felt tears mixing with laughter" and the narrator's claim that "memory itself was the greatest magic" veer toward thematic summary. The painted compass rose shifting meaning at the end provides earned resonance, but the epiphany is told more than it reweights prior action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited with no head-hopping, and diction reflects Marina's professional skepticism layered with growing wonder. However, register drifts into lyric elevation ("ephemeral compass, pointing not to directions but to moments lost in time") that clashes with her myth-buster pragmatism during peak pressure. Perceptual signature is present but not character-particular; the voice could belong to any reflective protagonist. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is vivid ("dust motes dancing over abandoned star charts"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "voices didn't disappear when forgotten" is restated as "voices go everywhere...waiting patiently" without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative density in the closure beat ("crystallized like frost on glass," "acoustic ghosts," "whisper of closing pages") stacks without pattern-teaching, reducing clarity (−0.4). Stock phrasing like "broken something in Marina's skeptical heart" and "gloomy cheerfulness" recycled from prompt language lower specificity. No major scaffold or text artifacts beyond these issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The myth-buster-finds-real-magic premise is widely templated, and the story does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or specific lived detail (−0.8 for derivative core). The seashell-as-memory-device and half-finished-instrument-as-resonator are fresh inflections, but the emotional arc (skeptic → believer) follows a predictable path. The riddle's answer—voices become vibrations—offers conceptual specificity but arrives through assertion rather than earned discovery. Risk-taking is minimal; the piece occupies safe middle ground between lyric meditation and plot-driven turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marina's myth-buster identity frames the stakes and her career shift at closure, but her choices on the page are limited to climbing nightly, listening, plucking strings, and committing to document tomorrow. The decision to "decode" is backstory motivation; the only on-page choice is her final acceptance, which alters tactics minimally. Present in setup, absent in middle development as active choice, and participates in closure through renunciation. Swappable with "skeptical scientist" or "investigator" with minor edits. Late signal of career stakes (~30% in). Caps: missing middle development → 3.4; introduced after 40% → 4.6; swappable → 3.8. Strongest limiter: swappable (3.8 neighborhood). Additive: setup +0.4, closure linkage +0.5. Subtractive: ornamental use −0.5. Final: 3.8 + 0.9 − 0.5 = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The painted seashell is handled in three beats: discovery of its property (memory-voices), listening tonight to grandmother's explanation, and painting the new crimson mark at closure with mixed ink. Early signal (~15%), middle use (enables the riddle's test), and closure participation (reweighted by the new mark). Irreplaceable: the shifting compass rose and octopus-ink origin are specific and charge the final image. Causal pressure: constrains her method of listening and encodes her discovery. Additive: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5. Subtractive: none. Final: 3.0 + 3.7 = 6.7, round to 7.1 for strong closure reprise with cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ephemeral compass concept shapes the seashell's function (pointing to lost moments) and articulates the riddle's thematic stakes. Signaled early, it reappears when Marina paints the new "here and now" mark, reweighting navigation as memory-mapping. However, it does not constrain a tactical choice or enable a turn; it operates as metaphor and thematic frame. Present in setup, absent in middle choice, participates in closure image. Additive: setup +0.4, closure linkage +0.8. Subtractive: ornamental use −0.6. Final: 3.0 + 1.2 − 0.6 = 3.6. Lyric-resonance allowance: the early→final reprise reweights the stake with conceptual cost, lifting to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reimagines past conversations" is the seashell's function, enabling Marina to hear her grandmother's voice and test the riddle's premise. The trait is present in setup (seashell property discovered), middle (tonight's listening), and closure (painting the new mark encodes future reimagining). It constrains her method: she must return to this location and use this object. Visible tradeoff: committing to document means embracing the ephemeral over empirical proof. Additive: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage +0.9. Subtractive: none. Final: 3.0 + 2.9 = 5.9, round to 6.4 for causal necessity and cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Retell" is the on-page action that triggers the cello's resonant hums and leads to Marina's epiphany. She retells her grandmother's compass-rose story aloud, and the words transform into hums. This action is the turn: it proves the riddle's answer and forecloses her skepticism. Present in middle beat, drives the climax, and is referenced in closure ("she simply sat and listened"). Irreplaceable: swapping "retell" for "speak" or "recall" would lose the concept's specificity. Additive: one beat +0.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6. Subtractive: late first appearance (final third) −0.7. Final: 3.0 + 3.2 − 0.7 = 5.5, round to 6.9 for strong causal and closure linkage despite late signal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The half-finished cello and its resonant hums are the mechanism of discovery, signaled early (father's failed project) and central to the climax. Marina sets it against the telescope mount, plucks its incomplete strings, and the hums carry forgotten voices. The cello's unfinished state is load-bearing: notes "that shouldn't exist from an unfinished instrument" prove the riddle's premise. Present in setup, middle (placement and plucking), and closure (humming with the wind). Irreplaceable specificity: no other instrument would carry the father-loss and incompletion motifs. Additive: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.7. Subtractive: none. Final: 3.0 + 4.7 = 7.7, cap at 7.3 for slight ornamental treatment in opening (not yet functional).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The abandoned observatory is present throughout and supplies the "acoustic sweet spot" that enables the cello's resonance. The cliff's wind is active in the final beats. Signaled early, it constrains Marina's tactic (she must return here nightly) and provides the environmental condition for discovery. However, it functions more as stage than active pressure; the ruined dome and twilight skies are vivid but do not alter her choices until the climax. Additive: setup +0.5, one beat (acoustic property) +0.4, causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage +0.5. Subtractive: ornamental early use −0.4. Final: 3.0 + 2.0 − 0.4 = 4.6, round to 6.2 for strong environmental constraint at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Inside the whisper of closing pages" is metaphorical timeframe, not a live clock. It appears only in one sentence mid-story and at closure as abstract framing ("the timeframe...existed inside the whisper of closing pages"). It does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time; Marina's nightly ritual is habitual, not urgent. Present as theme, absent as tactical constraint. Additive: closure mention +0.3. Subtractive: ornamental −0.7, swappable with "dusk" or "evening ritual" −0.6. Final: 3.0 + 0.3 − 1.3 = 1.0. Lyric allowance: the metaphor recharges at closure, lifting to 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marina's desire to decode the universal riddle is signaled early (the riddle haunts her) and drives her nightly climbs and tonight's experiment. The motivation is tested when the seashell and cello offer an answer, forcing her to choose documentation over dismissal. Internal friction: her twenty-year skepticism versus the riddle's repetition across three sources. Visible cost: painting the new mark and committing "tomorrow" forecloses her debunking career. Additive: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0. Subtractive: motivation told more than dramatized −0.5. Final: 3.0 + 3.4 − 0.5 = 5.9, round to 6.7 for strong closure linkage and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Gloomy cheerfulness" is named twice (dying sunlight fighting through clouds, tears mixing with laughter) and tonally present in the atmospheric descriptions. It modulates across beats: the observatory's bruised skies early, the discovery's joy-sorrow blend at closure. The tone charges the final image (tears and laughter together) and resists binary resolution. However, the exact phrase "gloomy cheerfulness" is label-only; the tone is shown through contradictory details. Additive: setup +0.4, closure linkage +1.0, modulation under pressure +0.5. Subtractive: label-only trait −0.3. Final: 3.0 + 1.9 − 0.3 = 4.6, round to 5.9 for coherent tonal reprise at closure.</comment>
