<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's copyist work and clandestine encoding are given concrete embodied detail ("pen scratching," handling the radio, weaving fragments into scores). Her motivation to preserve narrative is clear and consistent, though her internal contradiction—desire to resist versus fear of discovery—remains somewhat muted; the "thistled calm" exterior softens the stakes of her choices. The closing image of continuing work is Earned Stasis with visible cost (isolation, perpetual vigilance), but the emotional progression flattens slightly as urgency never spikes on the page. Minor vocabulary register drift ("thistled calm," "pirate broadcast") reads slightly elevated for a working copyist under stress, though it remains within plausible poetic interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story layers ritual, hidden encoding, and the glowing-dust motif to reweight narrative's persistence without a causal reversal. Orientation anchors promptly (who, where, when by ~80 words). Closure is Conceptual Repricing with visible cost: the final paragraph crystallizes the ongoing risk and the conceptual wager that "dust and air cannot be burned," foreclosing ordinary safety with felt isolation. One tightening occurs when the cultural patrol passes—Maren cloaks the dial, pressure spikes briefly—but no second reversal; the piece deepens rather than turns. The timeframe "after the story famine" remains abstract (no calendar anchor or clear "how long ago"), slightly weakening historical pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ember alcove is vividly micro-setting: mist for cover, dying coals for light, hidden floor panel, all constraining Maren's work rhythm and detection risk. Sensory detail is selective (mist, amber glow, cobblestone footsteps) and filtered through her copyist's priorities. The luminous dust functions as both atmospheric detail and conceptual anchor, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (alcove behind chimney, radio beneath stones, boots outside). Minor gap: the concert hall's larger geography and the watch-towers' sightlines remain vague, limiting the tactical pressure of her hiding spot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and early: preserve forbidden stories through covert encoding. One tightening occurs when the cultural patrol passes (Maren cloaks the dial, footsteps recede), briefly foreclosing carelessness with felt cost. No second reversal, consistent with Accumulative lens. The irony of embedding sedition in the state orchestra's concerto adds layer but remains offstage anticipation rather than on-page consequence. Maren's agency is embodied in her copying method and ritual vigilance, but the lack of a second pressure point or visible tradeoff (stamina, missed opportunity, social cost) keeps escalation modest. The ending renews her commitment (Earned Stasis) with the conceptual price of perpetual clandestine labor visible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—narrative's indestructibility, the persistence of stories in matter and memory—emerges from concrete particulars (luminous dust, embedded notes, pirate broadcast fragments) without thesis statement. The final image ("stories written in dust and air cannot be burned") is earned by prior accumulation and offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the famine premise. Subtext operates in the method itself (obedience disguised as defiance) and the motif of teaching inanimate matter to remember. No moralizing; the piece trusts its conceit. Minor issue: "thistled calm" and "inevitability" edge toward explaining the tone rather than embodying it, and the phrase "stories persist, stories return" in the final line risks slight redundancy with prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable and clean; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with a lyric-textural register ("ember alcove breathed," "thistled calm," "dust…secretly luminous") that fits the accumulative design. Perceptual signature is clear: Maren notices embers, dial glow, footsteps, dust—details tied to her craft and risk. Psychic distance remains close throughout. Minor register elevation in phrases like "thistle calm" and "irony pleased her with its thistled calm" reads slightly above a working copyist's spontaneous interiority under stress, though it remains voice-consistent across the piece. No dialogue present; evaluate voice only. Reflection is purposeful and anchored to present stimuli (noticing the dust, hearing boots).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high (copyist work, radio ritual, encoding method, dust motif, patrol threat, all in ~790 words). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Clarity is strong; grammar and tense are clean. Minor overwriting: "thistled calm—sharp as the danger, peaceful as inevitability" is a near-paraphrase within one sentence, and "stories persist, stories return, stories written in dust and air cannot be burned" in the final line cycles through three restatements of one concept where two would suffice. The metaphor "captured fireflies" for dial glow is vivid but slightly incongruous with the established ember/coal imagery. No major line-level artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—encoding forbidden narratives in orchestral scores via musical alphabet and tempo markings—is fresh and specific, avoiding template dystopia. The luminous-dust motif is memorable and thematically integrated. The irony of performing sedition for officials is a strong turn. Minor derivative element: the pirate-broadcast setup and the "Archivist" archetype echo familiar resistance-under-totalitarianism patterns without full transformation; the story famine and cultural patrol remain somewhat stock. The integration of copyist craft, shortwave ritual, and dust-as-witness feels organic. Emotional truth (vigilance, isolation, patient defiance) is specific and avoids generic template arc. The piece does not take bold structural risk but executes its accumulative design cleanly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren as diligent copyist is setup early, constrains her access and method (copying parts by ember light, weaving encoded fragments), and her craft drives the entire encoding tactic. Her choices—transcribing the broadcast, embedding story-words, cloaking the dial, continuing work—create all key beats and the Earned Stasis closure. Cost is visible: isolation, perpetual vigilance, the risk of discovery. Present in setup, middle (encoding the concerto, reacting to patrol), and closure (continuing work). Irreplaceable: the story requires a music copyist with access to state scores. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The shortwave radio dial glow is setup early (hidden beneath floor, "soft and amber"), handled in the tuning beat (dial glows, she cloaks it with her palm when patrol passes), and recurs in the final paragraph ("dial cooled beneath the floor, but its amber glow persisted in her memory"). Two distinct beats: tuning and cloaking. The glow functions as both tactical resource (finding broadcast) and symbolic anchor (promise motif). Minor issue: the glow's evolution is metaphorical (memory) rather than causal at closure; it does not alter the final choice. No visible cost tied specifically to the dial. Present in setup, middle, and closure reprise, but the closure linkage is thematic rather than plot-driving.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pirate broadcast is setup early (The Archivist's transmission), shapes Maren's tactic (she tunes nightly, transcribes lyrics), and provides the raw material for her encoding work. Present in two beats: the initial tuning and tonight's "string quartet…revolutionary themes." The broadcast constrains her method (she depends on its schedule and content) and enables her tactic. Minor gap: the broadcast itself does not create direct on-page pressure or cost; it is a resource rather than a complication. Present in setup and middle development but absent from the closure paragraph. Functional and purposeful but swappable with "underground transmissions" or similar without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Secretly luminous" dust is setup by ~300 words ("dust…began to hold light"), recurs in the middle ("dust on her desk glowed brighter"), and charges the final image ("dust would speak first…every surface remembered"). Three beats. The attribute is Maren's confirmation that narrative has material weight, motivating her continued risk. Minor issue: the luminosity does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with tactical cost; it functions thematically (evidence of story-persistence) rather than causally. No visible tradeoff tied to the dust's glow. Present across setup, middle, and closure, but the causal role is atmospheric/thematic rather than plot-driving.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Cloak" appears once: "She cloaked the radio dial with her palm" when the patrol passes. This action creates the story's sharpest pressure spike (risk of discovery) and embodies Maren's tactical response. Present in the middle beat but absent from setup and closure. The cloaking constrains her in the moment (she must hide the glow, cannot continue copying) with felt immediate cost (fear, brief paralysis). Swappable: "covered," "hid," or "smothered" would serve identically. One beat, middle only, functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Elusive song lyrics" as method is setup early ("lyrics…formed patterns. A line from a folk ballad, then a phrase from an opera"), developed in the middle ("transcribed the lyrics encoded in the soprano line"), and implicit in the closure (the encoded concerto awaits performance). The method shapes Maren's entire tactic (transcription, pattern-finding, embedding). Present across three beats. Minor gap: the lyrics' elusiveness (scattered, hard to decode) is asserted but not dramatized as a constraint that complicates her work or imposes visible cost. The method is purposeful and specific but could be replaced with "coded messages" or "cipher fragments" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ember alcove in mist is setup early ("tucked behind chimney, a pocket of warmth"), supplies resources (coals for light, mist for cover from watch-towers, hidden floor panel for radio), and constrains Maren's work schedule ("only when the mist grew thick enough"). Present in setup, middle (she works by ember glow, mist cloaks her), and implicit in closure (she continues work "in the breathing alcove"). The setting shapes tactical choices (when to work, where to hide radio) and the mist provides on-page cover during the patrol beat. Micro-setting qualifies. The alcove is irreplaceable to the story's logistics. Strong integration across beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the story famine" (seven years when narrative was rationed) is setup early and frames the world stakes. Present thematically throughout (Maren remembers "what had been lost," works to restore forbidden tales). The timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions or create a live clock; it is historical context rather than active pressure. No specific "how long since the famine ended" or countdown. Maren's assertion "it would end" is future hope, not present constraint. Functional background but does not shape tactical urgency. Present in setup and thematic layer but absent from middle pressure or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To teach dust to tell stories" is Maren's stated motivation (~midpoint: "her true motivation"). It explains why she continues risky work and charges the final image ("dust would speak first…every surface remembered"). Present in middle reflection and closure. Minor issue: the motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choice; Maren never faces a moment where teaching dust competes with immediate safety or another want. No visible friction or cost uniquely tied to this desire versus a simpler "preserve stories" motive. The dust motif integrates well thematically, but the specific phrasing ("teach dust") does not constrain on-page action. Thematic anchor, functional, but swappable with "prove narrative cannot be destroyed."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Thistled calm" is named once mid-story ("irony pleased her with its thistled calm—sharp as the danger, peaceful as inevitability") and modulates elsewhere as controlled vigilance (ember work, ritual tuning, patient defiance). The tone is coherent: lyric accumulation without hysteria, calm persistence under threat. It charges the final image (continuing work "diligent and patient"). Minor issue: the phrase "thistled calm" itself is over-explained in the moment it appears ("sharp as the danger, peaceful as inevitability"), reducing its subtextual power. The tone supports the Accumulative lens and Earned Stasis closure cleanly. Present thematically throughout, named once in middle, implicit in closure.</comment>
