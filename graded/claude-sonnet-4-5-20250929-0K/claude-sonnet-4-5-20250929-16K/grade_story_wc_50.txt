<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locksmith's motivation is clear—she seeks to understand and preserve wonder—but her choices feel observational rather than conflicted. The "peripherally focused" trait is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her decision to seal the cavern and keep the discovery private arrives without visible internal struggle or cost that forecloses a live alternative. No secondary character applies pressure, leaving the protagonist's arc feeling more like contemplative documentation than transformation under duress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation cleanly (locksmith, cavern, autumn-to-spring) and follows an accumulative lens: mounting discoveries layer toward the final decision to seal and preserve in private. The closure reads as Earned Stasis—she chooses solitude and silence over fame—but the cost is asserted ("she didn't publish") rather than dramatized with a moment of renunciation that forecloses an on-page option. The causal chain is legible but the final image doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; it summarizes her stance rather than charging it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The marble cavern is vividly realized with gold veins, acoustic geometry, and seasonal shifts that structure her visits. The broken timer mechanism functions as a tactile puzzle that constrains her method and enables the harvest-of-echoes reveal. The setting's acoustic properties directly shape her experimental approach (dawn/noon/midnight angles), satisfying the micro-setting constraint test. Minor: spatial choreography within the cavern is somewhat vague, but the cave's properties charge the closure image when she seals it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the cavern's purpose—is signaled early and accumulates through discovery beats. However, escalation is textural rather than narrowing: each visit adds knowledge without a tightening choice or trade-off that forecloses an option. The decision to seal the cavern is presented as satisfying rather than costly; no live alternative (publish, share, monetize) is dramatized and refused on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (timer reconstruction unlocks the harvest), but the lack of visible price at closure keeps this in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—wonder and understanding as partners, not enemies—emerges organically from the locksmith's method and final choice. The "store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later" motivation anchors the thematic question without overt moralizing. The ending offers a quiet, non-literal answer: solitary knowledge can satisfy without external validation. The harvest-of-echoes concept and the sealed cavern charge the closure image with resonance. Minor: the final paragraph edges toward abstraction ("mystery and understanding... endless dance") but recovers with the concrete memory of layered echoes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable throughout; focalization remains cleanly on the locksmith's perceptions and her distinctive method of noticing periphery over direct focus. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("lull of that wounded season," "Rosetta Stone"), establishing a literary register that fits the contemplative stance. No dialogue appears. The locksmith's perceptual signature—observing by not looking directly—is asserted more than it constrains on-page action, but the voice remains coherent and specific under the story's quiet pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically varied, with strong concrete detail ("bronze doors corroded shut," "velvet cloth"). Minor loop issues: "arriving at dawn, noon, dusk, and midnight" / "Morning light... At noon... Midnight" restates the same pattern within two paragraphs. "Understanding bloomed slowly, like ice melting in reluctant spring" is a mixed seasonal metaphor (bloom/melt/spring overlap without coherent vehicle). Filter-verb density is moderate but not intrusive. Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary well. No major artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "harvest of echoes" concept and the locksmith's peripheral observation method offer a fresh angle on the explorer-discovers-mystery frame. The timer-as-Rosetta-Stone is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. However, the emotional arc—solitary seeker preserves secret knowledge—follows a familiar template without a risky or unexpected inflection. The choice to seal rather than share is presented as temperamentally inevitable rather than a bold stance with visible cost. Specificity in the acoustic mechanics elevates, but the piece does not transform its premise through high-stakes moral calculus or unconventional structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The reflective locksmith is present throughout and her observational method shapes her approach, but her choices are largely exploratory rather than stake-altering. She decides to return daily, rebuild the timer, and seal the cavern—functional beats but none narrow live options with visible cost. The seal-and-keep decision is her clearest turn, yet it is told rather than dramatized as a renunciation. Two gates met (setup, closure presence), but causal pressure and cost are weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken timer mechanism appears early, anchors multiple beats (study, reverse-engineer, rebuild), and enables the harvest revelation. Its reconstruction is the pivotal middle turn that unlocks the cavern's function. It is present in the closure reflection ("the device... controlled which veins were active"). High irreplaceability: no other object could serve this role. Stops short of 8.5+ because its final reprise is remembered rather than handled or reweighted in the ending action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Harvest of echoes" is seeded early ("sound... lingered, overlapping"), drives the locksmith's investigation, and crystallizes at the timer-rebuild beat when "the cavern sang." It shapes her goal and constrains her method (mapping veins, tracking reflection). Present in closure when she recalls "that harvest of sound preserved in marble and memory." All three gates met with specificity, but it remains more thematic anchor than a mechanism that narrows on-page choices with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "peripherally focused" trait is signaled in paragraph one and described in paragraph six ("by not looking directly... detect patterns invisible to direct scrutiny"), but it does not visibly constrain or enable a choice with cost. It flavors her method without forcing a trade-off or altering tactics under pressure. Two gates (setup, stated in middle), but no closure payoff where peripheral vision costs her something or grants a decisive advantage. Lyric presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Reverse-engineering the timer mechanism is the story's central investigative action, occupying weeks of effort and multiple beats (laying out gears, studying interlocks, rebuilding). It unlocks the harvest-of-echoes understanding and enables the closure choice. Setup and development gates met. Present at closure via memory but not as an active verb. Swappability test: another investigative verb could replace it with edits, keeping it below 8.0. Strong but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Studying reflection angles at different times" is introduced early (paragraph one mentions "observation"), detailed across paragraph six (dawn/noon/dusk/midnight visits alter which veins activate), and informs her understanding of the acoustic geometry. It shapes her experimental method and the middle discovery beat. Two gates met (setup, development). Absent from the closure action; she recalls the result but not the method itself. Specific mechanics matter, lifting it above mid-band, but closure linkage is weak.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The marble cavern is introduced immediately, dominates setting and action throughout, supplies the acoustic puzzle that drives investigation, and is the object of the final choice (she seals it). Its gold veins and geometry constrain her method and enable the harvest. Present in every major beat and essential to closure: without this exact setting, the story's logic fails. High irreplaceability and closure linkage. Stops shy of 8.5+ because it does not impose a visible cost—it facilitates rather than restricts.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Across the lull of that wounded season" and "as winter deepened" frame the investigation, and "Spring came eventually" closes it. Time structures the daily-visit rhythm and the dawn/noon/midnight experiments, meeting setup and development gates. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; it provides duration without pressure. The seasonal progression adds atmosphere but is swappable with any multi-week span. Lyric presence without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later" is stated late (paragraph fifteen) and anchors the seal-and-keep choice, meeting the closure gate. It explains her refusal to publish and her satisfaction in solitary knowledge. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices that pit wonder against reason or privacy against recognition. One gate (closure) plus thematic coherence, but no visible friction or cost on the page. Asserted motivation without embodied struggle.</comment>
