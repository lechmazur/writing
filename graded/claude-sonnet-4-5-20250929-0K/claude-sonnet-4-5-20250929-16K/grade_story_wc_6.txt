<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistently embodied through her firefighter's hands and watchful presence. Marcus functions primarily as a vessel for her healing work rather than creating pressure through his own choices; his scarred hands are described but he makes no decision that alters tactics. The father's backstory provides weight but remains entirely off-page. Internal contradiction is minimal—Maya's gracefully alert quality reads more as a stable trait than as competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with Maya's therapeutic ritual building toward Marcus's first real smile as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, the cost remains abstract—"healing" is declared rather than shown through a visible foreclosure or tradeoff on the page. The grafting metaphor accumulates meaning but the final image ("Marcus smiled at her, the first real smile") asserts transformation without dramatizing what option or stance he has renounced or what price Maya pays in this specific encounter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, black volcanic sand, and grafting site are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (kelp-drift peace, grain catching light, dune grass whisper). The grafting tools and plants function as micro-setting that enables the central therapeutic action. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The lagoon constrains the scene's possibilities and charges the final image, though it does not force a difficult choice between competing paths in this session.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Maya proving scars can sing through therapeutic ritual—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the grafting instruction and coin symbolism but remains largely one-directional; Marcus is receptive rather than resistant. The smile at the end represents a tightening of emotional stakes, yet no on-page reversal forces Maya to alter her approach or confront a meaningful obstacle. The father's imprisonment and the firefighters' suspicion are backdrop rather than live complications that narrow options during this scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the grafting metaphor and transformed coins rather than direct statement. The piece resists tidy resolution—Maya's work continues, her father will never understand—and the scars-singing concept grows from concrete action (binding plants, drilling coins). However, "a fierce and unyielding compassion that refused to let fire have the final word" and "redemption wasn't about erasing the past, but about grafting something beautiful onto it" edge toward thematic summary in the penultimate paragraph. The final image of Marcus's smile reweights prior material without overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with Maya; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("obsidian lagoon waited beneath the dunes like a held breath," "kelp-drift peace") that matches the contemplative ritual. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext (Marcus's "Why do we do this?" and his statement about his mother). Perceptual signature is consistent—Maya notices through a firefighter's lens (smoke-filled rooms, destruction turned toward mercy) and a healer's metaphorical frame. Psychic distance remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with strong opening and closing images. However, line-level craft shows repeated scaffold: "She had been coming here for three years" immediately followed by exposition; "Today she'd brought Marcus" starts a new paragraph with similar stem. The phrase "gracefully alert quality" appears twice in identical form. Mixed metaphor: "rippled landscapes of third-degree burns" conflates topography with injury in ways that strain plausibility. "Kelp-drift peace" is evocative but the metaphoric vehicle (kelp drifting) does not clearly map to the tenor (calm after storms). Information density is generally high but some lines do double work inefficiently ("The other firefighters at Station 12 knew her story; some looked at her differently, wondering if flame-setting ran in blood" could be tighter).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The firefighter-daughter-of-arsonist premise is familiar but the volcanic-beach grafting ritual and drilled-coin transformation offer fresh specificity. The piece commits fully to its metaphor system (grafting, volcanic transformation, fire-made-sand) and integrates it with character motive. The coins as inheritance transformed are a strong particular. However, the therapeutic-healing-through-nature frame and the mentor-wounded-child dynamic follow well-worn templates. The final insight about grafting beauty onto darkness is earned through prior material but lands close to expected territory for this premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout and her firefighter identity and arsonist-father backstory provide motive. However, she makes no on-page decision that creates a turn; her approach to Marcus is stable and uncontested from start to finish. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is indirect (her certainty deepens as Marcus smiles). The element shapes one beat (her reflections on her father and Station 12) but does not drive key reversals.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Black sand appears in three beats: Maya spreads it at opening, explains "The sand remembers the fire that made it," and Marcus takes a handful at the end. Early signal is strong. The sand's volcanic origin ties directly to the fire/transformation theme and it is physically handled in multiple moments. It enables Maya's teaching metaphor and charges the closure image (Marcus taking it home). Causal pressure is moderate—it illustrates rather than constrains choice—but closure linkage is clear and the specific volcanic property matters.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Unyielding compassion is named explicitly ("her unyielding compassion had become legendary") and demonstrated through Maya's refusal to turn anyone away and her patient grafting instruction. It shapes her dominant stake (proving scars can sing) and tactics (never rushing healing). However, it is not tested by a conflicting pressure on the page; Marcus is receptive and no complication forces Maya to choose between competing goods. Setup and payoff are present; development occurs but without friction. The concept trends toward theme echo rather than a choice-shaping constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Gracefully alert" is introduced early ("that gracefully alert quality she carried") and repeated identically later. It is tied to her movement through smoke-filled rooms with caution and certainty. However, it remains a label without an on-page action where this specific trait enables or constrains a choice with visible cost. The trait describes her general demeanor but does not precipitate a turn or tradeoff in this scene. Setup is present; development and closure linkage are absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Grafting is introduced early, demonstrated with physical detail (taking a cutting, joining it to another, binding with cloth), explained metaphorically ("the wound where they join becomes the strongest part"), and drives the central teaching beat. It is irreplaceable—the story's logic depends on this exact action to embody the transformation theme. Marcus participates in grafting three plants. The action shapes two major beats (the instruction and the metaphoric explanation) and the final paragraph's "grafting something better from the ash" callback charges closure. Causal pressure is high; visible cost is moderate (the work of binding and care).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The drilled coin strung on red thread is signaled early (Marcus wears it, "It had belonged to her father"), explained in mid-scene (Maya's practice of drilling his hoarded treasures and threading them with red), and returns at closure when Marcus touches it and Maya names it "your graft." Setup, development, and payoff gates are all met. The coin's specific mechanics (drilled, red thread for flame/blood/heart) matter and the method is irreplaceable. However, the coin does not constrain a choice in this scene—it is received and worn rather than used to solve a problem. It charges the closure image but does not drive a reversal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is established in the opening line, provides the setting for all action, and anchors the final image ("here at the obsidian lagoon, beneath shifting skies"). Its volcanic soil is rich and enables the grafting. The lagoon functions as more than backdrop—it is Maya's chosen therapeutic space, visited for three years. However, it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome in this specific encounter. Setup and closure presence are strong; mid-scene causal work is minimal. The setting frames rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"The slow migration of clouds" opens the story and "The clouds continued their ancient migration overhead" appears mid-scene; "beneath shifting skies" closes. However, cloud movement does not track elapsed time, tighten a deadline, or alter tactics. The timeframe remains poetic atmosphere rather than a live constraint. Setup and closure reprise are present but the element does not develop or shape any decision. It is swappable with other natural-cycle imagery without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maya's desire "to prove that scars can sing" is stated explicitly and dramatized through her therapeutic work with Marcus: she shows him grafting, explains the coin as a graft, and identifies his scars as the site where his mother's sacrifice lives. The motivation drives her stake and tactics across multiple beats. Friction is light—no on-page obstacle tests her commitment in this encounter—but the motivation shapes her approach and the closure image ("The scars were singing"). Setup, development, and payoff are all present with clear causal linkage. Cost is conceptual (her unyielding effort against her father's legacy) rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Kelp-drift peace, the kind of calm that comes only after storms have passed" appears once mid-scene. The tone is contemplative and steady throughout, matching the therapeutic ritual. However, tone does not modulate under pressure—there is no storm within this encounter to contrast the peace—and the single mention does not return at closure to charge the final image. Setup is present; development and payoff are weak. The tone is consistent and coherent but static, functioning as atmosphere rather than a dynamic element that reweights stakes.</comment>
