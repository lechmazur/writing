<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and her professional training shapes perception effectively ("Everything speaks," he'd said, "if you know how to listen"). Her investigation choices are methodical and earned. However, the character arc leans explanatory—she arrives already competent, discovers evidence, and adapts her report without significant internal contradiction or cost that forecloses a path. The father's patch functions more as symbolic anchor than a catalyst for a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara moves from structural investigator to someone who "really heard" the warning, understanding the residents' collective foresight. The causal lens holds cleanly through discovery → comprehension → documentation with cost implied (the labyrinth remains dangerous, residents evacuated). Orientation is prompt (Porto Velho, container labyrinth, post-silence). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the collapse was atmospheric, not structural, reweighting her mission and the residents' actions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vividly particular: "rust-orange walls," "precise columns of light," wind charts pinned to metal, circular clearing with fifteen containers "like petals." Spatial choreography is clear across vertical levels. The setting constrains Mara's investigation (she follows charts deeper, finds reinforcement cables, ballast stones) and charges the closure image (the containers "hummed with contained force"). Sensory selection reflects professional priorities (atmospheric sensors, stress points, angles) filtered through her father's aviation legacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: understand the collapse cause and prevent future disasters. Pressure tightens when Mara realizes the collapse was atmospheric and readings show differential "still growing"—the convergence remains active. However, the residents have already evacuated off-page, removing immediate jeopardy. Mara's agency is observational adaptation (shifting report scope, rapid documentation) rather than a decision that forecloses options with visible cost. The escalation is cognitive rather than confrontational, fitting the investigative frame but limiting visceral stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of cultivating foresight emerges organically through the residents' wind documentation, Mara's methodical investigation, and the father's aviation wisdom. The final image—"The labyrinth had become a teacher, and she was finally learning its lessons"—offers resonant closure without overt moralizing. The concept of "singular convergence" integrates well (wind patterns, architectural geometry, collective action). Subtext operates in the residents' absence (their evacuation becomes proof of their foresight) and the patch as inheritance of attention. Minor slip: "hazy precision" is stated twice as narrative commentary rather than fully embodied in scene texture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mara's professional lens ("accident investigator specializing in structural collapse," atmospheric sensors as "afterthought"). Perceptual signature is selective: she notices stress points, angles, wind patterns. Diction stays within investigative register without slipping into purple prose. However, some lines drift toward thematic summary rather than immediacy: "clarity would come only through careful convergence of all the evidence these silent towers held" reads slightly elevated for peak investigative urgency. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and purposeful with strong momentum through discovery beats. Information density is high: each paragraph advances investigation or reweights understanding. Sentence rhythm varies appropriately. Minor scaffold detected: "hazy precision" appears twice as descriptor, once narratively and once thematically, without sufficient dramatization of the concept in action. The phrase "singular convergence" is used three times, bordering on keyword recurrence. Figurative language ("wound in the labyrinth's geometry," containers "singing their warning") is coherent and restrained. No major loops or clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The atmospheric-collapse premise offers a fresh angle on structural disaster investigation, and the residents' collective documentation is a specific, non-obvious detail. The convergence of wind geometry with improvised housing feels earned and plausible. However, the core frame—lone investigator arrives post-catastrophe, solves mystery through methodical observation—follows a familiar template. The residents' evacuation happening off-page reduces immediate dramatic risk. Mara's arc is cognitive adaptation rather than transformation under pressure, limiting the story's emotional singularity despite strong conceptual execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara's role as accident investigator shapes every beat: she photographs stress points, measures angles, follows wind charts, uses atmospheric sensors, and adapts her report scope. Her professional training (inherited from her father) enables her to recognize the atmospheric cause. However, her choices are observational and adaptive rather than decisional with cost—she discovers and documents rather than acting under pressure that forecloses options. Present throughout and causally active, but her investigation does not create a turn where she must choose between competing goods or harms.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The flight engineer's patch appears in three moments: initial description, mid-investigation touch while remembering father's teaching, and "one final time" before continuing survey. It anchors her inheritance of foresight and professional identity. However, it functions primarily as symbolic reminder rather than object that constrains choice or evolves in meaning. She touches it but does not use it, and its presence does not alter her tactics. The reprise at closure is gestural rather than causally charged.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Singular convergence" operates on multiple levels: wind focusing to one vortex point, factors converging into catastrophic event, residents' collective documentation converging toward understanding, and Mara's realization converging investigation methods. The concept shapes her investigation tactics (she follows convergence patterns, maps trajectories) and reweights the closure (the labyrinth itself was breathing, building pressure through geometric convergence). The phrase appears three times, anchoring both plot mechanism and thematic resonance. It defines the disaster's cause and Mara's methodological shift from structural to atmospheric analysis.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Rapidly adapting" is demonstrated on-page when Mara shifts her investigation scope from structural collapse to atmospheric analysis, adds meteorological analysis to her report, and recalibrates her documentation approach. The adaptation is professional and methodical rather than desperate or costly—it enables better understanding without forcing a tradeoff. The trait is visible in action (equipment pivot, report restructuring) but does not constrain or create friction. It's competence under changing circumstances rather than a characteristic that imposes cost or enables tactics at a price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The survey structures the entire narrative: Mara begins methodical documentation, discovers wind charts during survey, follows them deeper, finds the epicenter, deploys sensors, and continues surveying with "renewed urgency" after her realization. Every major turn traces to survey discoveries (charts, reinforcement cables, circular clearing, sensor readings). The action is irreplaceable—the story's logic depends on systematic investigation revealing patterns. Her survey both frames the investigation and delivers the atmospheric insight that redefines the disaster and validates the residents' foresight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Wind pattern documentation appears early (wind charts on container walls, "dozens of contributors," months of observations) and drives the investigation's pivot. The mechanics matter: handwritten papers track flow redirection, eddies, pressure buildup; calculations and architectural sketches reveal understanding of vortex geometry. The method enables Mara to reconstruct the disaster cause and recognize the residents' collective foresight. It shapes her adaptation (adding meteorological analysis) and charges the closure (she hears the wind's warning because the documentation taught her what to listen for). Present across setup, development, and payoff with causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is indispensable: its vertical geometry creates the wind tunnels, its expansion redirects airflow, its architecture focuses pressure to the vortex point. The setting provides all investigative evidence (charts pinned to walls, reinforcement cables, ballast placement, circular clearing) and supplies the atmospheric mechanism that caused collapse. Spatial properties (five thousand containers, twenty thousand residents, three levels, metal canyons) constrain Mara's movement and enable discoveries. The setting is the disaster's cause, the residents' home they tried to save, and the teacher at closure. No other setting could deliver this exact convergence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the town goes silent" frames the investigation's mystery (residents vanished three days post-accident, Mara arrives day four) and creates atmospheric eeriness. However, the silence itself is quickly resolved as evacuation, and no live ticking clock pressures Mara's choices—the sensor reading shows pressure "still growing" but does not force immediate action or deadline. The temporal frame establishes premise and guides investigation logic but does not tighten tactics or decisions. Present in setup and referenced at closure, but does not escalate pressure mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Cultivating foresight is stated as inherited teaching ("Everything speaks if you know how to listen"), dramatized through Mara's methodical observation (she begins survey without knowing what she seeks, finds charts, adapts investigation scope), and validated at closure (she finally "really heard" the containers' warning). However, the motivation is professional competence rather than personal desire under friction—she does not struggle between competing wants or face cost for pursuing foresight. The motivation enables her success without dramatized conflict between cultivation and immediate action. Thematic presence is strong; dramatized tension is mild.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Hazy precision" appears twice as descriptor: Mara documents with "hazy precision—clear enough to be useful, ambiguous enough to avoid premature conclusions," and later with "hazy precision, knowing that clarity would come only through careful convergence." The tone is partially embodied in her investigative method (selective detail, measured conclusions, atmospheric ambiguity) and sensory rendering (filtered sunlight, rust-orange, humming containers). However, the phrase functions more as stated principle than fully enacted texture. The tone modulates mildly (eerie silence → methodical survey → urgent documentation) but does not decisively charge the final image with tonal shift.</comment>
