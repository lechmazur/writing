<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior life is character-particular and embodied through her professional lens: the neutron-star metaphor shapes how she perceives collapse and transformation. Her trajectory from control to acceptance is earned through concrete observation—photographing dust patterns daily, noticing the butterfly. The final renunciation (leaving dust on her palms) carries visible cost, foreclosing her prior impulse to preprocess and sterilize. Minor weakness: the mother's cancer and control issues are told rather than dramatized, slightly softening the inheritance arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through iterative observation and pattern accumulation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Mara leaves dust on her palms. Orientation anchors cleanly by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The closure unit reconfigures her relationship to purity and control with felt cost: she relinquishes her professional impulse to strip chaos. One meaningful deepening occurs through the twenty-eight days of observation, narrowing her stance from salvage to acceptance. Causality remains coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges every choice: broken panels admit wind that redistributes dust nightly, waterlogged netting frames the butterfly wing discovery, ceiling joists host improbable tomatoes. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (crystallized salt, fine powder catching light). The final image—dust on Mara's palms—is charged by prior material and forecloses her impulse to clean/control. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across all moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Mara will continue preprocessing reality or accept transformation's mess. The stake is signaled early ("not to salvage... but to observe what remained") and tightens through daily documentation. One meaningful deepening: the impossible butterfly emergence forces her to choose humility over control. Agency is renunciation—leaving dust on her palms forecloses her prior method. The escalation is textural rather than causal, fitting the accumulative lens, but the price (relinquishing professional certainty) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—transformation need not be violent; endings contain beginnings—emerges organically from dust patterns, butterfly powder mixing with silt, and Mara's realization that neutron stars represent "something between" death and life. The final image (dust on palms, patient story on skin) answers the central question without stating a moral. Minor slip: "the beautiful mess of becoming" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic echo, though it remains grounded in prior observation and does not fully sermonize.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: Mara notices "distinct striations," "pulsar data," "mathematical models"—the lens of a physicist applied to organic decay. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction control under pressure is strong: "preprocessing reality," "needless drama," "cosmos itself" stay character-bound. The prose modulates appropriately—compressed syntax in peak observation beats, reflective rhythm when she contemplates neutron stars. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are high; information density is strong (most sentences advance character or atmosphere). Read-aloud rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (neutron-star metaphor, dust as geological record) coheres without muddle. Minor deductions: "pure function, pure essence" in paragraph five is a brief paraphrase loop; "needless drama" recurs without added pressure. The closure beat remains untouched by these slips, and no template cadence or filter-verb stacks appear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of astrophysics and greenhouse decay is specific and non-obvious; the neutron-star metaphor is extended with care rather than ornament. Transformation test passes: swapping names/places would lose the researcher's perceptual filter. Minor limitation: the "mother's control → daughter's inheritance" arc, while executed cleanly, follows a recognizable template. The dust-patterns-as-data frame and the impossible butterfly offer fresh inflection that lifts the piece above median originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's professional identity (neutron star researcher) is signaled early, shapes her perceptual lens throughout (striations, pulsar data, preprocessing), and directly informs the closure choice: she abandons the impulse to reduce phenomena to "clean equations." The attribute constrains her initial stance and enables the final renunciation. Present in setup, development (daily observation framed as research), and payoff (relinquishing mathematical control). Causal pressure: her professional method is what she must forfeit. Cost: visible in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The butterfly wing appears in beat two (discovery among wreckage), crumbles releasing powder that mixes with flood silt to create soil, and returns transformed in the final image ("dust on her palms") with reweighted meaning. Three distinct touches across setup, middle development, and payoff. The powder's function—creating new soil—drives the thematic turn. Modest limiter: the wing itself is passive; the powder does the causal work. Still, the element is irreplaceable and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Gradual change is the dominant stake and method: Mara documents shifts "over weeks," noting how "patterns never stabilized" and how transformation occurs through accumulation rather than catastrophic collapse. The concept shapes her daily choice to return and photograph, opposes her professional habit (instant mathematical reduction), and directly informs the closure: "gradual change write its patient story on her skin." Present in setup (twenty-eight days), development (nightly moisture redistribution), and payoff (the final letting-go). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Preprocesses reality" is Mara's professional method, named explicitly in paragraph five and demonstrated through her impulse to "break down cosmic phenomena into mathematical models" and eliminate "mess and contingency." It constrains her initial stance (she cannot accept the greenhouse's chaos) and the closure renounces it (leaving dust unprocessed). Setup and payoff are strong; middle development is implied rather than dramatized in a discrete beat. Swappability: a near-synonym like "reduces" could replace it with minor edits, capping the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Decay is the engine: flood damage initiates observation, butterfly wing crumbles into powder, materials break down and recombine to support new growth. The action is irreplaceable—"transformation" would lose the specificity of organic breakdown. Present in setup (shattered panels, waterlogged netting), development (seeds bursting free, sprouting in unexpected places), and payoff (Mara accepts decay as generative rather than catastrophic). Drives two major beats and charges the ending. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulated dust patterns are Mara's method: she photographs daily, documents how each material creates "distinct striations," notes how wind and moisture redistribute particles. The method shapes tactics (observation rather than salvage), appears in at least three beats (shelf study, nightly shifts, insect trails), and directly informs the closure image (dust on palms, "accumulated wisdom"). Signaled early, developed through middle observation, and paid off in the final renunciation. Strong integration with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse is indispensable: shattered panels admit wind that redistributes dust nightly, broken roof streams light onto the powder, waterlogged netting frames discoveries, ceiling joists host improbable growth. Every choice (where to kneel, what to photograph, whether to clean) is constrained by the space's altered state. Present in setup (skeletal structure), development (micro-climates enabling survival), and payoff (the space teaches through its brokenness). Removing this exact setting would collapse story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The post-flood timeframe anchors the premise and enables the gradual-change stakes: "three weeks prior" establishes distance from catastrophe, "twenty-eight days" marks the observation arc, and "each night" tracks iterative shifts. Time pressure is modest—no urgent clock—but the duration matters: transformation requires weeks, not moments. Present in setup (three weeks since flood), development (daily documentation), and payoff (tomorrow she will return). Functional but not indispensable; a similar arc could unfold in a different disaster aftermath.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to strip needless drama" is Mara's professional creed, named in paragraph five and dramatized through her impulse to reduce neutron stars to "pure function, pure essence" and eliminate "mess and contingency." It shapes her initial refusal to accept the greenhouse's chaos and creates friction when observation forces her to confront beauty in disorder. The closure choice—leaving dust unprocessed—directly renounces this desire with visible cost (professional certainty). Strong setup, development through conflict, and payoff with felt price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Kindled humility is the tonal arc: Mara begins with certainty ("preprocessing reality... clean equations") and moves toward acceptance of "the beautiful mess of becoming" and "accumulated wisdom." Tone modulates with pressure—analytical in early beats, softer and more receptive as she observes the butterfly and lets dust remain on her skin. The final image crystallizes humility without sentimentality. Coherent through all turns and charges the closure. Minor note: "humility meant accepting" in the final paragraph edges toward explication, though it remains image-anchored.</comment>
