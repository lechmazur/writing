<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent—honoring her great-grandmother's legacy—but her journey feels too smooth. The "nervously confident" trait is mentioned but never constrains a choice with visible cost; she ascends, explains, proposes, and succeeds without meaningful internal contradiction or embodied doubt acting simultaneously in scene. Dr. Yoon's shift from flat refusal to collaboration happens in a single exchange without dramatized resistance, undercutting the earned-change requirement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story follows a causal lens: Mira decodes stanzas → retrieves the nail → brings it to Yoon → they discover the formula → plan to publish coded poetry. The closure is a Decisive Change (from isolation to collaborative action) with a gesture toward reversing exile, but the cost remains abstract—"perhaps some exiles could be reversed" is hopeful speculation, not a visible price paid on the page. Orientation is clean; the station, storm, and backstory anchor quickly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The weather station is vividly sketched—"rusted sentinel," "spongey dread," reinforced windows, sound-absorbing surfaces—but it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint. The copper nail under magnification is the only moment where setting (the scope, the light) enables a key discovery; otherwise, the cliff, storm, and isolation color mood without altering tactics or the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—vindicating Dr. Voss's predictions and potentially saving routes—is signaled early and persists. The nail's revelation is a meaningful tightening that narrows options (they now have the correction factor), and Mira's counter-proposal (publish through coded stanzas) is a tactical pivot. However, the escalation lacks a felt trade-off: no resource is spent, no relationship strained, no immediate danger confronted; Yoon's hope and Mira's smile are emotional shifts without visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of overlooked legacy and reversible exile emerges organically from the nail, the coded stanzas, and the intergenerational vindication. The final image—"some exiles... could indeed be reversed"—attempts a resonant answer but remains abstract and summary-like rather than a concrete, non-literal image that reweights prior particulars. The copper nail and coded poetry are purposeful motifs, yet the ending leans toward stating the theme rather than dramatizing its cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and clean throughout, anchored to Mira's perspective with no head-hopping. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven—Yoon's flat "You shouldn't be here," Mira's inherited frustration, the exchange about the nail—and subtext operates in Yoon's trembling hands and the shift from refusal to collaboration. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply character-particular; phrases like "spongey dread" and "peculiar brightness of the professionally ostracized" are vivid yet hover near writerly observation rather than strict POV filter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong imagery: "rusted sentinel," "verdigris patina," "sky churned with colors that shouldn't exist." However, several scaffold phrases reduce density—"The pattern had become clear," "the spongey dread... intensified," "perhaps, Mira thought"—and the final paragraph loops thematic summary ("honoring bravery that had waited too long") rather than trusting the image. Sentence openings vary, but mid-story exposition about the Meridian Papers and shipwrecked journals slows momentum without immediate pressure payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—climate-change exile, coded stanzas in shipwrecked journals, a nail etched with formulae—synthesizes several speculative elements into a coherent whole. The "reversible exile" concept and the coded-poetry solution offer fresh angles, yet the emotional arc (idealistic librarian vindicates ancestor, exiled scientist finds hope) follows a familiar template without a non-obvious moral calculus or risky structural choice. The ending's hopefulness feels earned in hindsight but does not transform or subvert expectation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mira appears throughout, frames the quest, decodes the stanzas, retrieves the nail, and proposes the coded-poetry plan—three distinct beats. Her idealism drives the turn from Yoon's refusal to collaboration, but her choices are presented as smooth problem-solving rather than decisions under conflicting pressure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The copper nail is retrieved off-page per instructions, placed on Yoon's desk early, examined under magnification (revealing the correction factor), and verbally recalled at closure ("the copper nail"). It appears in three beats, enables the key discovery, and is causally indispensable—removing it would break the plot—but it does not return with reweighted emotional or symbolic meaning in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reversible exile" is named, explained (government euphemism, never actually reversed), and drives Yoon's initial skepticism and Mira's counter-proposal. The concept shapes the dialogue and thematic stakes, appearing early and at closure ("some exiles... could indeed be reversed"), but it does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost—hope is offered, not a price paid.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Nervously confident" appears twice as a label ("nervously confident footsteps," "Mira smiled, nervously confident") but never constrains or enables an action with visible tradeoff. The trait is told, not embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The act of questioning ("everything depended on asking the right question") is seeded early, drives the dialogue with Yoon ("Why the nail?" / "Can you question the exile board?"), and leads to the collaborative plan. The element recurs and is causally active, but "question" as a verb is broad—many exchanges involve inquiry—so it reads as moderately rather than uniquely indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Coded stanzas in shipwrecked journals are introduced early (Mira decodes the final stanza that morning, cross-references maritime charts), explained mid-story (nautical metaphors reveal coordinates), and return at closure as the method for future publication ("We embed the formulae in verse"). The method appears in three beats, shapes Mira's research, and becomes the tactical solution, making it causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The experimental weather station is named in the opening line, frames the scene (spiral stairs, observation deck, reinforced windows, impossible storm), and provides the magnification scope that reveals the nail's etchings. The setting enables one key discovery and charges atmosphere ("spongey dread," sound-absorbing surfaces) but does not constrain tactics or return transformed in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The jet stream's catastrophic shift "three years prior" anchors the story's premise, drives the climate chaos (impossible storms, doomed vessels), and motivates Mira's quest. The timeframe is present throughout—backstory, current storm, Voss's 2019 burial—but does not tighten decisions with a live clock or alter tactics under pressure; it is context, not constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mira's desire to honor her great-grandmother's overlooked bravery is stated early ("generations of inherited frustration"), drives her months-long research, and surfaces in dialogue ("Her bravery gets documented where it matters"). The motivation is consistent and shapes the dominant stake, but it is told more than dramatized through conflicted on-page choices with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Spongey dread" is named once mid-story, and the tone of atmospheric unease (rusted sentinel, impossible storm, wrong-direction rain, thick silence) is established early and sustained through the observation-deck scene. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure—it remains a static backdrop—and the ending shifts to hope without the dread returning to charge the final image.</comment>
