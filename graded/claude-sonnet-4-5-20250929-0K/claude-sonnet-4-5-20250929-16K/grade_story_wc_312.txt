<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is consistent and her lukewarm magic creates a clear constraint that shapes her method. The "brittle devotion" is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she persists without visible internal conflict or cost to her belief system until success arrives. Her final stance (watching, timing, ensuring rhythm) reads as competent stewardship rather than a choice that forecloses a meaningful path. Embodied emotion is present but thin; the peak moment lacks physical struggle or mistake under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Maren, viaduct, dawn, bell). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting toward Earned Stasis): water returns "one drop at a time" and Maren commits to perpetual timing, her "brittle devotion hardening into something almost like faith." Cost is conceptual (endless vigilance, no migration) but legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when the bell rings and reverses natural law, reweighting the cosmic balance stake. Escalation is modest—most pressure is backstory (weeks of prep), and the climactic swing succeeds on first attempt without on-page failure or adaptation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct is established early, grounds the action spatially, and its dew-dripping stones become the mechanism for reversal, directly shaping Maren's method and the climax. Dawn light, cobalt glow, and the dried canyon bed create vivid sensory anchors. The "dripping rate" motif ties setting to stakes and closure. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The viaduct constrains choice (she must be there at dawn) and charges the final image (she remains on the bridge, ensuring rhythm).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore the river, cosmic balance) is clear early. One tightening: Maren waits for the precise dripping-rate alignment, then swings the bell. The swing succeeds immediately without complication, adaptation, or visible alternate cost—no failed first attempt, no sacrifice of another resource. Her agency is present (months of prep, the final swing) but the climactic beat lacks friction; the "plausible impossibility" unfolds as stated reward rather than hard-won trade-off. Cost at closure is the perpetual vigilance commitment, which is conceptual and earned by prior setup but not tested on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (broken things teach wholeness; patience over force; lukewarm sufficiency) emerges from Maren's method and the dripping-rate motif without overt moralizing until the penultimate paragraph's "Sometimes the universe didn't need to be forced" edge. The final image—Maren timing drips, "brittle devotion hardening into something almost like faith"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer tied to her arc. Subtext operates in "lukewarm," "brittle," "earnestly naive," reweighting weakness as strength. Light thematic echo in "broken things could teach you how to make them whole" but it's embedded in reflection rather than dialogue, reducing penalty to minor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited. Perceptual signature is consistent (Maren notices dew patterns, timing, dripping rates). Voice has texture: "plausible impossibility," "a tone that fell upward," "dripping rate of cosmic balance seeking its center." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during bell-swing, slightly elevated during cosmic mechanism description). Filter verbs ("she had noticed," "she had spent") appear in backstory paragraphs but are voice-appropriate for reflection. No dialogue to assess. Diction occasionally elevates ("cosmic machinery," "precipitation," "molecules...remember configuration") in a way that reads slightly clinical for peak emotional beats, though it coheres with her studious character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Sentence openings show variety. Information density is high in the setup (cosmic balance, dew timing, bell history compressed efficiently). Loops present: "dripping rate" appears six times, three in close succession in one paragraph ("dripping rate of dew matched the dripping rate of memory matched the dripping rate of cosmic balance"), reading as intentional pattern but borderline churn. "Brittle devotion" and "earnestly naive" are label-repeated without fresh dramatization. Figurative language is dense in the climax ("tone that fell upward," "dew weeping upward," "clouds remembered rain") but mostly coherent. Minor scaffold: "She was what the remaining villagers called" and "The elders said...But Maren had noticed" are slightly expository. Apply −0.6 for loops and label repetition touching multiple beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The "lukewarm mage" inversion (weakness as strength) and dew-based reconstruction offer fresh angles on magical-restoration premises. The dripping-rate mechanism is specific and integrated. However, the core arc—outcast discovers overlooked solution, restores balance through patient devotion—follows a familiar template without a non-obvious moral calculus or twist; Maren's success is straightforward wish-fulfillment. Emotional specificity (her brittle faith, the earnest naivety) lifts the piece above generic execution. The "plausible impossibility" frame and sapphire viaduct image are memorable particulars. Transformation test: swap "dripping rates" for another patient rhythm and the arc holds with minimal change, suggesting mid-range originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (lukewarm mage) appears throughout. Setup: named and characterized by paragraph two. Development: her choice to rebuild the clapper (middle section) and her final swing decision. Closure: she rings the bell and commits to perpetual timing. Her choices create the central turn (ringing at the aligned moment) and the final stance (remaining to ensure rhythm). Two functional beats (rebuild decision, swing decision) plus closure participation. Causal pressure and cost (endless vigilance) are clear. Specificity high (lukewarm trait directly enables her dew-method). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure link +1.2, causal pressure +1.0, cost tie +0.4, irreplaceability +0.6 = baseline 3.0 + 4.7 = 7.7, round to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Broken ship's bell: present in opening image, explained in backstory (founders, two hundred years, cracked at harvest), rebuilt in middle section (clapper reformed), swung at climax, held in final image. Setup early, development (rebuild action), closure (ringing produces the impossible tone and water return). Three beats minimum. Its brokenness mirrors the cosmic break; its tidal memory encodes the solution; without this exact bell the story's logic fails. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure shaping +1.6, causal pressure +1.4, irreplaceability +0.7, cost connection +0.4 = 3.0 + 6.2 = 9.2, but swappability concern (any ancient ritual object could work with edits) −0.4, minor ornamental description in opening −0.2 = 8.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Brittle devotion: labeled twice ("Her devotion to this theory was brittle," final paragraph "brittle devotion hardening into something almost like faith"). It frames her internal state and the thematic question but does not constrain a specific on-page action or create visible cost during the story—she never wavers, doubts on-page, or pays a price for fragility. The concept shapes theme more than tactics. Setup present (paragraph five), lyric reprise at closure reweights meaning. Early seed +0.5, closure reprise +0.9, thematic resonance +0.4 = 3.0 + 1.8 = 4.8; label-only treatment −0.3, lacks mid-scene pressure −0.4, but closure reweight salvages to 5.8 under lyric allowance, cap at 6.3 per lyric rule, final 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Earnestly naive: label appears twice (paragraph five "earnestly naive belief," penultimate paragraph "someone earnestly naive enough to believe"). It characterizes her stance but does not demonstrably enable or constrain an on-page choice with visible cost—her naivety is told, not dramatized through a mistake, misreading, or friction. Setup mid-story (past 40% mark), late first mention −0.4. No middle development beat where naivety alters tactics. Closure: thematic echo only, no causal role. Label-only −0.3, summary-only −0.3. Baseline 3.0 −1.0 = 2.0, but thematic presence +0.3, lyric reprise +0.2 = 2.5, cap for missing middle development at 3.4, but late intro + label-only + no cost visible caps at ~4.2 given thematic weight, final 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rebuild (action): Maren rebuilds the clapper over one month (middle section), using dew, clay, and weak magic to "convince molecules to remember." Setup clear (backstory paragraph), development (entire rebuild process described), closure (the rebuilt clapper enables the bell to ring and produce the impossible tone). Without the rebuild the bell cannot ring and the climax fails. Early signal +0.6, one extended beat +0.4, closure enabling +1.5, causal necessity +1.3, irreplaceability +0.7 = 3.0 + 4.5 = 7.5. However, the rebuild itself is summary ("spent the last month learning to rebuild...Layer by layer, drip by drip") rather than a dramatized scene with on-page struggle, summary-only −0.5, but essentiality to closure offsets to 7.0 + thematic and method integration +1.3 = 8.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Understanding dripping rates (method): introduced early (paragraph four: "she had noticed...how each drop fell at measurable intervals. She had spent weeks timing them"), used to time the rebuild (paragraph seven: "each addition timed to the rate at which water wanted to fall"), and determines the climactic moment (paragraph eight: "when the dripping rate of dew matched the dripping rate of memory matched the dripping rate of cosmic balance"). Setup by paragraph four, development (timing the rebuild), closure (alignment moment triggers the swing). The method is specific, irreplaceable, and causally essential. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure shaping +1.6, causal pressure +1.4, irreplaceability +0.8 = 3.0 + 5.4 = 8.4, but repetition churn ("dripping rate" x6) is decorative in places −0.3, some explanation rather than dramatization −0.2 = 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct at dawn (setting): present in opening line, anchors spatial action throughout, provides the dew mechanism (paragraph four: "morning dew still formed on the viaduct's stones"), and frames the final image (last paragraph: "Maren stood on the sapphire viaduct"). Setup immediate, development (dew collection site, spatial constant), closure (she remains there). The viaduct's dew and position enable her method; dawn timing matters for the dripping-rate alignment. Early signal +0.8, two functional beats +0.9, closure framing +1.0, causal constraint +1.1, specificity +0.5 = 3.0 + 4.3 = 7.3. Minor: dawn is mentioned but its specific properties beyond "early light" are not dramatized as a constraint, −0.2 = 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the last fish is caught" (three months ago, river vanished within a week): established in paragraph three, sets the crisis and urgency. The timeframe is backstory context rather than a live ticking clock; the story's present action (dawn bell-ringing) is not time-pressured by an approaching deadline. Setup early, no middle development where the timeframe alters a choice, closure (restoration begins) is thematically linked but the three-month gap does not constrain the climactic beat. Early signal +0.5, thematic pressure +0.4, closure relevance +0.5 = 3.0 + 1.4 = 4.4. It frames stakes but is not a live tactical constraint; however, it defines the "after" that motivates all action, +2.0 for stake-setting = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to right a cosmic imbalance": stated explicitly (paragraph three: "cosmic balance had shattered") and drives all of Maren's actions (noticing patterns, rebuilding bell, timing the swing, committing to perpetual watch). Setup early (paragraph three), development (rebuild and timing choices), closure (balance restored, she commits to maintaining it). The motivation is consistent and generates the dominant stake. Early signal +0.7, multiple beats +1.4, closure link +1.3, causal necessity +1.2 = 3.0 + 4.6 = 7.6. Slight abstraction (cosmic balance as concept rather than personal loss) and lack of on-page friction between want and cost during the attempt, but thematic integration is strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone "plausible impossibility": named in the climax paragraph ("the plausible impossibility unfolded"), but the tone is established throughout (lukewarm magic, dew-based reconstruction, "a tone that fell upward," "dew weeping upward"). Setup implicit from paragraph two (lukewarm magic as middle-ground), modulates with rising wonder at climax, charges the final image (water returning by patient dripping, physics reversed). Coherent escalation from mundane observation to metaphysical reversal. First explicit mention late (climax paragraph) but tone effects present earlier. Closure charge strong. Late label −0.3, but tonal consistency and climax charge +1.8, closure participation +1.2, modulation under pressure +0.8 = 3.0 + 3.5 = 6.5, but pervasive tonal signals elevate to 7.3.</comment>
