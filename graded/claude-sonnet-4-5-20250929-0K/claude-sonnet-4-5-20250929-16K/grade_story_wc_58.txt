<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's occupation is articulated but her agency in this encounter is primarily observational until the late gesture with the pen. Thomas exhibits clearer internal contradiction—trembling hands that remember motion, grief versus potential—but both characters lean heavily into philosophical articulation rather than embodied struggle. The final shift ("held it like a compass") reads as asserted rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that visibly foreclose paths. Interiority occasionally drifts into therapy-speak ("cartography of a weaver's soul") at moments requiring embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure—Marina's profession and Thomas's loss accumulate through vivid catalog, then deepen via the pen-to-palm moment and the compass metaphor. Orientation is swift (garden, Marina, autumn, Thomas on bench). The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration: Thomas's grip shifts from relic to compass, Marina chooses to stay and document healing's geography—both gestures reconfigure prior material (the thread, the missed ship) with conceptual cost (deliberate isolation, redefinition of her obituary practice). One meaningful deepening occurs when Marina describes Thomas's persisting weaver's soul, narrowing his stance from loss to potential. Cost is felt but slightly abstract; the final image reweights the premise cleanly under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden anchors early and charges the final line ("lonesome and splendid, full of transformation's quiet promise"). Bronze leaves as "forgotten correspondence" and the crimson leaf spiraling like a falling thread tie setting to Thomas's craft, constraining the metaphoric vocabulary. Camphor for aching joints and the stone bench provide tactile micro-setting. The garden's "deepest corner" functions spatially to isolate the encounter. The recurring autumn-decay motif supports tone and theme, though the garden itself does not materially alter a tactical choice—it provides atmosphere and symbolic charge more than direct constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Marina seeks to understand healing's geography; Thomas faces the gap between former and current self. Pressure accumulates through Marina's catalog of other absences and her pivot from documenting endings to mapping persistence. The pen-to-palm moment and the thread's reweighting (relic → compass) constitute one meaningful deepening that narrows Thomas's options (remain frozen or accept transformation). Cost is conceptually visible—Marina's deliberate isolation, Thomas's acceptance of a new identity—but the escalation is more accretive than causal, and agency tilts toward Marina's articulation rather than Thomas's on-page decision under duress. No overt reversal; the turn is a reframing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—transformation, the geography of healing, explained absences—emerges through concrete images: the crimson thread, the spiral leaf, Marina's catalog of vanished selves. The final image (thread as compass, Marina as deliberate traveler in abandoned countries) reweights the opening's "unfinished elegies" and "last ship" without overt thesis. Subtext operates in Thomas's stillness, Marina's intimacy, and the phrase "lonesome splendor." The piece resists simple moral ("you haven't stopped weaving, only changed your loom" feels close to articulation but is spoken in scene, not narrated). Quiet ending with resonance; the thematic question is answered obliquely through image and Marina's choice to stay.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited, stable distance, POV anchored to Marina with brief tight focus on Thomas's interiority ("eyes wet," "whispered"). Diction is elevated and lyric-literary ("lonesome splendor," "camphor," "cartography of a weaver's soul"), consistent throughout and voice-motivated for Marina's profession. Dialogue feels purposeful and advances the encounter; Thomas's lines carry subtext (grief, resistance, then opening). Some phrases approach ornamental lyricism ("starlings," "vivid descriptive precision") but remain legible. Free indirect style is clean when used. Perceptual signature is Marina's: she notices thread, pattern, decay, transformation. No head-hopping; focalization is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening sentences are long and lyric, closing lines short and charged. Information density is high in the catalog passages. However, multiple phrases lean into decorative figuration without propulsion: "bronze leaves collected like forgotten correspondence," "cathedral abandoned to starlings," "geography of thread and tension." The phrase "projecting presence through her words like a medium summoning spirits" is abstract and elides the actual mechanics of Marina's method. Minor paraphrase loop: "explained absences" is restated conceptually across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. Syntax is controlled; no template cadence or grammar errors. Figurative density in several beats (garden, Thomas's hands, the leaf) does not teach a pattern early or pay off with concrete constraint at closure, reducing line-level urgency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—obituaries for the living, traveler documenting absences—offers a fresh angle. The garden encounter and Thomas's thread are specific and grounded. The transformation of "weaver" to "cartographer of healing" via Marina's reframing is thematically coherent. However, the emotional arc (Thomas moves from frozen grief to acceptance via Marina's articulation) follows a familiar counsel-and-comfort template. The risk is tonal and lyric rather than structural; no bold perspectival or causal gambit. The piece commits to its lyric mode fully, but the central dynamic—empathetic stranger helps wounded artist see persistence—is not transformed beyond its archetype. Specificity in detail (palace carpet, crimson silk, autumn decay) elevates but does not fundamentally recast the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marina is present throughout and her profession frames the encounter. She appears early, catalyzes Thomas's shift via description and the pen gesture, and her final choice to stay (missing the ship deliberately) closes the piece. However, her key action—describing Thomas's persisting weaver-soul—is primarily verbal and observational; the pen-to-palm moment is a gesture of intimacy but does not constrain a contested choice. She enables Thomas's reconfiguration but her own decisions (to write, to stay) are not tested under on-page pressure. Two beats (initial encounter, final staying) involve her choices; middle beats are her articulation. Causal role is moderate; her presence is essential but agency is more facilitative than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The crimson silk thread appears in three beats: Thomas holds it on the bench, Marina asks about its pattern (autumn garden), and Thomas's grip shifts from relic to compass in the closing lines. The thread's meaning evolves—from last vestige of lost craft to navigational tool—and its charged reprise anchors the closure image. It enables the thematic pivot (transformation vs. loss) and is irreplaceable given its specificity (palace carpet, weft, crimson). Early signal, mid-scene exploration of its pattern, and final reweighting with visible cost (Thomas's acceptance of new identity). The thread is causally active in the ending and could not be swapped without breaking the closure metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Explained absences" is introduced early ("obituaries for the living," "people who became absences in their own lives") and frames Marina's catalog of prior subjects (pianist, painter, cartographer). It shapes Marina's motivation and the story's conceptual premise. However, on-page it functions more as thematic label than tactical constraint—Marina's method of "projecting presence" is asserted rather than dramatized with mechanics that alter Thomas's options. The concept charges the theme and Marina's stance but does not create a contested choice or visible cost at closure. Present across all three thirds and shapes framing, but remains one step abstract from causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Vividly descriptive" appears as trait of Marina's obituaries ("vividly descriptive precision") and is enacted when she describes Thomas's hands and the weaver's soul. The description causes Thomas's trembling to still (mid-scene beat) and reframes his self-concept, enabling the closure shift. However, "vividly descriptive" as a labeled attribute is only mentioned once explicitly; the trait is demonstrated in Marina's speech but not tested under constraint or shown to carry tradeoff. One on-page consequence (Thomas's stillness) and closure participation (her final description maps transformation). Functional but the attribute itself is more implicit craft than explicit cost-bearing trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Intimate" is enacted in the line "settling beside him with an intimacy reserved for the dying and the disappeared. Their shoulders nearly touched." Marina's closeness enables Thomas to hear her reframing, and the pen-to-palm moment is physically intimate and pivotal. The intimacy contrasts with Marina's solitary traveler framing and charges the ending (she stays to document rather than depart). However, the action is not explicitly tested or contested; it unfolds without resistance. Present early (shoulders nearly touching), shapes the middle turn (Thomas opens up), and colors the ending (Marina's choice to remain). Causal role is clear but cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Could be replaced with "empathetic" or "close" without major structural loss, capping mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Projecting presence" is named once ("projecting presence through her words like a medium summoning spirits") but the mechanics are elided. Marina describes Thomas's hands and soul; Thomas's trembling stills and he later shifts his grip on the thread. The method's effect is visible (Thomas's transformation) but the means remain abstract. No early signal teaching how presence-projection works; it appears in the middle third as metaphor. Does not shape Marina's tactics under pressure or constrain her choices. The method enables the ending but is summary-only rather than dramatized. Late appearance, ornamental phrasing, swappable with "speaking" or "describing" without breakage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden is introduced in the opening line and returns in the final paragraph ("garden settled into night around them, lonesome and splendid, full of transformation's quiet promise"). Bronze leaves, the stone bench, and the garden's "deepest corner" provide spatial grounding. The autumn decay mirrors Thomas's loss and the garden's eternal transformation (from his carpet pattern) charges the closure. Setting does not constrain a tactical choice but supplies metaphoric and atmospheric pressure that reweights the ending image. Early signal, present across beats, and decisively shapes tone and final charge. Lyric resonance is strong; causal constraint is absent, capping below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the last ship sails" is signaled in the opening ("last ship had sailed three days ago") and returns at the end ("having missed the last ship deliberately"). The timeframe creates Marina's isolation and her choice to stay is weighted by the ship's departure. However, the ship does not create live urgency within the garden encounter; Thomas's transformation unfolds without clock pressure. The timeframe frames Marina's situation but does not tighten tactics or force trade-offs in the central scene. Present early and at closure, but middle development is absent—no mid-scene reference or escalation tied to missed departure. Two gates (setup, payoff) allow mid-band; lack of pressure caps below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marina's desire "to understand the geography of healing" is articulated mid-story ("I travel to understand the geography of healing") and drives her catalog of absences and her reframing of Thomas's loss. The motivation is told rather than dramatized in friction; Marina does not face competing wants or costs that test this desire on the page. Her final choice to stay (missing the ship deliberately) aligns with the motivation but is presented as fait accompli rather than contested decision. The motivation shapes framing and theme and participates in closure (she discovers healing's geography), but lacks on-page conflict or visible tradeoff. Functional role across beats; told-only mode and low friction cap score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is introduced explicitly ("His voice carried lonesome splendor, like a cathedral abandoned to starlings") and recurs in the final paragraph ("The garden settled into night around them, lonesome and splendid"). The tone is sustained through lyric diction, autumn decay, and Marina's solitary traveler frame throughout. Modulates subtly—opening melancholy, middle intimacy, closing resonance—without breaking coherence. The tone charges the final image and is consistent under pressure. Early signal, stable across beats, and decisive in shaping closure atmosphere. Specific phrase recurrence and tonal consistency across turns qualify for higher band; irreplaceability is strong.</comment>
