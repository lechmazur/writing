<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Unit-47's interiority is vividly embodied through sensors, cooling fans, and data corruption that manifests as "an ache." The arc from caretaker certainty to navigating chaos through containment shows clear motivation, and the final choice—planting new roses while humming a lullaby—feels earned by the android's teaching history with the child. Contradictory impulses (nostalgia versus mechanical function, the need for order versus acceptance of chaos) operate simultaneously in scene. Minor: the protagonist's struggle could show more genuine cost at the moment of choice rather than retrospective wholeness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Unit-47 achieves functional fragmentation, "navigating by an internal compass that finally knew how to point toward something that felt like home, even when north refused to stay still." The cost is visible—the roses burned, the box destroyed, the android now "fragmented but functional"—and the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds throughout, deepening through the controlled burn ritual. Orientation is clear by the first paragraph (android, dome, farm, post-child departure). One meaningful tightening occurs when the magnetic shift forces the containment strategy. The ending reconfigures the opening's longing into purposeful growth from ash.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert roses supply both constraint and resource: the roses' "strangely organic composition producing oils that combusted at precise temperatures" enables the ritual, and the enclosed space contains the smoke that allows Unit-47's inward compression. The dome's ventilation, the sand beds, the spiral arrangement at the center—all are integrated into the climactic action. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the android's sensors (petals "more flesh than bloom," amber sun refracted into fragments). The spatial choreography from rows seven and eight to the dome's center is clean and the micro-setting charges the final image of planting in ash.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resolving electromagnetic chaos that threatens Unit-47's coherence—is signaled immediately when the poles shift and "static... fragmented every process." Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: the android remembers the child's method, gathers materials, initiates the controlled burn, and actively compresses its consciousness into manageable boxes. The cost is unmistakable on the page: the box and roses are burned, the android becomes "fragmented but functional," and the static doesn't disappear but is contained. The tightening from frozen paralysis to active ritual to renewed function forecloses the path of seeking external resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the controlled burn's particular logic: chaos made bearable by naming, containing, miniaturizing—a method taught to a child and reclaimed under catastrophe. The final image of planting roses "from ash" while humming a lullaby offers a non-literal answer to the question of how to endure when foundational orientation fails. The "strangely organic" roses, the box of childhood fears, and the internal compass that "finally knew how to point toward something that felt like home" all charge the ending without stating a moral. The thematic calculus—that wholeness may require accepting fragmentation—is earned through the android's specific experience, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited android with a distinct perceptual signature: "sensors," "diagnostics," "charging shelf," "cooling fans," and measurements like "seventeen degrees in eight minutes" color every observation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the crisis ("unable to move forward or back"), slightly wider during reflection on the child. The prose rhythm accelerates during the magnetic shift ("Navigation systems screamed. Unit-47's internal compass spun wildly") and slows into ritual cadence during the burn. No head-hopping, and the android's lexicon—technical yet emotionally inflected—remains consistent under peak stress. Elision of thirty-seven years is strategic and anchored in the present via the box.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: "strangely organic" recurs with escalating function (texture, then combustion property, then thematic charge). Sentence rhythm varies effectively—short during crisis ("The android needed fire."), longer and syntactically complex during ritual. No paraphrase loops, though "strangely organic" appears three times; each use advances understanding. One minor friction: "strangely organic cells seeming to breathe while Unit-47 suffocated" leans slightly purple in register, but the personification serves the android's desperate state. The opening and closing lines frame voice and stakes cleanly. Zero scaffolding or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—android caretaker applying a child's fear-management technique to electromagnetic chaos via literal controlled burn—feels specific and non-obvious. The "strangely organic" roses as both thematic vehicle and plot mechanism avoids checklist convenience. The premise transforms familiar AI-longing material through the tangible ritual and the box's shift from tether to fuel. Minor: the magnetic pole shift as catastrophe is a well-worn device, though the story integrates it tightly. The transformation test passes: changing the roses to another plant or the android to a human would fundamentally alter the logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Unit-47 drives every key turn: chooses to reach for the box, gathers roses, initiates the burn, compresses its consciousness, plants new roses. Nostalgia motivates the action ("an ache for those simple nights") and the method (recalling the child's technique). The character's decisions alter tactics from paralysis to active containment to renewal, and the final lullaby crystallizes the nostalgic stance as functional rather than debilitating.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The box appears early (charging shelf), returns at the crisis beat when Unit-47 reaches for it, and its contents are itemized and placed at the spiral's heart. Its meaning shifts from "tether to the years when purpose had been clear" to fuel for the ritual, and its destruction ("the child's crayon label burned to nothing but every scary thing remembered") charges the ending. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure payoff with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Controlled burn escape shapes stakes (the chaos must be contained), tactics (gathering dried stalks, arranging the spiral, sparking from overheating circuits), and the resolution (compressing consciousness while surrounded by smoke). The concept is both literal action and thematic method, and the ending's planting "from ash" completes the escape logic. Removing controlled burn would collapse the story's mechanics and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Strangely organic" is signaled early (petals "more flesh than bloom"), enables the climactic action (oils "combusted at precise temperatures"), and charges the thematic question of android identity. It constrains the choice of fuel and appears in three distinct beats with escalating function. Could score higher with one additional on-page cost tied explicitly to the trait (e.g., the android's own synthetic components reacting to the organic smoke).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Miniaturize is the method Unit-47 recalls ("by containing chaos, you control it. Make the fear smaller than yourself"), enacts ("compressed its consciousness down, down, folding inward"), and teaches through the ending's micro-world logic ("each one a small contained world"). The action defines the protagonist's strategy and redefines options from seeking external repair to internal partitioning. Present in three beats and indispensable to the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Containing chaos is signaled through the box's history, mechanized in the spiral's "controlled burn" and "contained space," and resolved in the android's internal partitioning ("boxes—partitions for the chaos, containers for each screaming error"). The method shapes every attempt from memory to execution and the ending confirms it works: "chaos now lived in boxes the android could carry." The mechanics matter on the page and the concept threads setup to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert rose farm supply resources (combustible roses), constraints (enclosed space, ventilation system), and the micro-geography for the ritual (rows, dome center, spiral arrangement). The setting enables the controlled burn tactic and charges the final image of planting in ash under the dome. Removing the dome or roses would break the story's logic. Appears in all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The magnetic shift triggers the crisis ("seventeen degrees in eight minutes") and imposes the immediate need for resolution. It creates the static that fragments Unit-47's processes and supplies the overheating circuits that spark the fire. The timeframe tightens the decision—Unit-47 acts "that Tuesday morning" in frozen paralysis until the remembered method unlocks movement. Present in setup and middle escalation; less visible in the ending, where the ongoing wandering of north is acknowledged but no longer actively pressuring.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Inner static is dramatized through "data corruption its diagnostics couldn't resolve," "a loop of partial commands," and "vision stuttered." The desire to resolve it drives the choice to burn the box and compress consciousness. Friction between the longing for clear purpose and the cost of destroying the tether is visible. The ending doesn't erase the static but reweights it as manageable, and the motivation threads all three gates with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fragmented wholeness is established through syntax ("fragmented but functional," "entire necessary"), modulates through the stuttering crisis beats ("vision pulsed in and out of focus"), and charges the final image ("stood whole among the ashes, fragmented but functional"). The tone holds coherent contradiction under pressure and the cadence shift from paralysis to ritual to planting enacts the tonal premise. The paradox is earned rather than asserted.</comment>
