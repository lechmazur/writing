<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is specific and embodied ("featherly determination," grain-reading as inherited method), and her motivations trace clearly through the piece. The final choice to step through carries visible cost (leaving the logbook closed, not looking back). Minor slip: the thirty-six-hour maze ordeal is told rather than shown in bodily consequence, and the transformation it caused remains somewhat abstract despite the weight placed on it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maya steps through the threshold with understanding that "sacred meant not divine but irreversible," reweighting the opening question with felt cost (dissolution of the terrace, acceptance of non-return). The accumulative lens holds—grain patterns, weather codes, and necessary distances converge to reframe her parents' collapse. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the logbook reveals her mother's surveyor role and final entry, narrowing Maya's interpretive options and charging the final act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace functions as micro-setting and lyric anchor, charging the final image ("prismatic fragments, each carrying a different frequency of loss"). The oak planks and drafting table ground tactile engagement (grain-reading, touch). Spatial choreography is clean. Does not quite reach 8+ because the terrace's metaphysical properties (why it drifts, how panels shift) remain ornamental description rather than constraint that alters Maya's tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding thresholds) is signaled early and tightens when the logbook entry reveals her mother's surrender and Maya recognizes the irreversible nature of her childhood crossing. The grain-reading and code-deciphering constitute accumulative pressure that narrows interpretive options. Agency is present in the final step through the threshold, which forecloses return. Cost is visible (terrace dissolves, logbook left closed). Does not reach 8.5+ because the escalation is primarily cognitive/revelatory rather than featuring a live trade-off or visible price paid during the terrace sequence itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (irreversible thresholds, necessary distances, the geometry of loss) emerges organically from particulars: corn maze, grain patterns, weather codes, the parents' partnership in measuring space. The final image—"sacred meant not divine but irreversible"—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. The logbook's final entry avoids sentimentality by framing the mother's departure as geometric necessity rather than cruelty. Subtext operates in Maya's choice to leave the logbook closed and her refusal to look back, both gestures that embody rather than declare acceptance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and controlled, with distinct diction ("featherly determination," "fractured hush," "prismatic fragments"). POV distance is stable; focalization remains Maya's throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent (grain-reading, spatial intuition). Minor deduction: some phrases edge toward elevated register that feels slightly external to Maya's established interiority ("the universe's attention," "the geometry between memory and place"), and one line—"Some thresholds felt sacred because crossing them meant accepting that the path forward could never circle back"—borders on thematic summary rather than embodied realization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is controlled and rhythmically varied, with strong images ("slow-breathing glass," "whorls," "prismatic fragments"). Information density is high. Minor issues: "featherly determination" appears twice in identical phrasing, a small loop. The phrase "fractured hush that permeated the terrace" reads slightly ornamental without adding pressure. One filter stack: "She'd learned...watching him analyze...He'd taught her...told her" compresses three past actions in quick succession, dulling immediacy slightly. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of corn maze architect, surveyor pilot, and grain-reading as metaphor for loss feels specific and non-obvious. The logbook twist (mother's, not father's) reweights prior material without feeling convenient. The prism terrace as liminal space between memory and place risks abstraction but is grounded by the oak planks and drafting table. Transformation test passes: the emotional arc depends on these exact particulars. Does not reach 8.5+ because the core insight—some distances are necessary for survival—while freshly rendered, operates within familiar territory of parental abandonment reframed as geometric need.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya (the lost child, now adult) drives every beat: she assembles fragments, reads the grain, deciphers the logbook, and makes the final crossing. Her choices narrow options (closing the logbook, stepping through without looking back) and the closure pivot depends on her agency. Present throughout, causally active in the middle revelation and the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The pilot logbook appears in paragraph five, is handled and opened on-page, and its final entry ("Some distances aren't navigable...") reframes the dominant stake and charges Maya's understanding. It returns with reweighted meaning at closure when Maya leaves it closed, a visible renunciation. Used in two distinct beats (discovery, final choice) with causal pressure that narrows interpretive options.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" shapes the parents' partnership (surveyor above, maze-maker below) and the mother's departure, framing the stakes on the page. Maya's realization that her mother "needed distance to survive—not cruelty, but geometry" directly alters her interpretation and enables the final crossing. Present in backstory and thematic layer but also constraints Maya's understanding in the middle beat. Does not reach 8+ because it primarily operates as interpretive frame rather than forcing a tactical choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" appears twice (paragraph six and final line) and describes Maya's tactile method and resolve. It characterizes her approach but does not constrain an on-page action with visible trade-off—another adjective (patient, careful) could substitute without altering the plot. Present and consistent, but remains closer to voice texture than causal force.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Intuit" governs Maya's recognition of the logbook's importance and her realization about thresholds. The final line—"intuiting that sacred meant not divine but irreversible"—articulates the closure insight. Used in two beats (early signal of the logbook's weight, final realization) and shapes the emotional arc. Does not reach 8+ because the intuition itself is more revelatory than a choice that narrows options with cost; it enables understanding rather than forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Analyzing grain in wooden furniture is taught in paragraph six (father's method, Maya's inheritance), dramatized in paragraph seven (she reads the drafting table's grain and "began to see"), and enables the middle revelation about the parents' partnership. The method is signaled, its mechanics matter (grain as map of stress and strength), and it drives a key turn. Present across setup, middle beat, and implicit in the closure (understanding through reading patterns).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace frames the entire piece and charges the final image ("dissolved...into prismatic fragments"). It provides spatial grounding (oak planks, drafting table) and lyric resonance. However, its mechanics (why it drifts, what makes it shift) remain atmospheric rather than constraining Maya's choices. The terrace does not supply a resource or obstacle that alters tactics; it functions as symbolic environment. Lyric reprise (opening → ending) earns mid-band score, but lack of causal pressure limits upward reach.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" anchors the backstory (the maze incident collapsed the family) and the present (Maya returns decades later to understand). The timeframe is legible and the gap between child-Maya and adult-Maya matters thematically. However, time does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page—no clock pressures the terrace sequence. The temporal distance enables reflection but does not constrain action. Present in setup and thematic layer; modest causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The desire to understand why some thresholds feel sacred is stated in paragraph three and drives the entire sequence: Maya assembles fragments, reads grain, deciphers the logbook, and ultimately steps through with new understanding. The motivation is dramatized in action (kneeling, tracing, opening the logbook) and resolved at closure ("sacred meant not divine but irreversible"). Friction between wanting understanding and the cost of accepting irreversibility is present. Does not reach 8.5+ because the internal conflict is more contemplative than agonized; no competing desire pressures the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" appears once (paragraph eight) and coheres with the lyric, reflective tone throughout. The prose maintains quiet control and modulates slightly (sharper at the logbook reveal, softer at the final crossing). Tone charges the ending image ("prismatic fragments, each carrying a different frequency of loss"). Does not reach higher because the single explicit mention limits tonal architecture, and "fractured hush" itself borders on ornamental rather than pressure-linked descriptor.</comment>
