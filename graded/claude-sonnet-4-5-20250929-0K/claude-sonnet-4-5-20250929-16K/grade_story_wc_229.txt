<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear—reconciling with Vera after seven years—and her internal conflict between "righteous anger" and buried tenderness is dramatized. However, the epiphany about "vibrations of intent" and "screaming tenderness" tilts toward abstract label-speak rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene. The vial mechanism provides a concrete trigger, but the shift from fury to whispered apology feels more asserted than earned through on-page micro-choices that visibly cost her a defensive stance. Silas and Vera remain functionally present but underdrawn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. Orientation anchors early (lighthouse, dawn, Mara, Silas dying, Vera arriving). The vial ritual and Mara's ascent to light the beacon accumulate pressure toward the whispered apology, which crystallizes options and reconfigures the seven-year silence with felt emotional cost. One meaningful deepening (understanding Silas's lesson) tightens the stance. Minor causality slip: the scent's mechanics ("purifies intentions") are told rather than shown altering Mara's on-page choices, relying on interior assertion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, dawn light, salt-scrubbed garden, and dock are vivid and purposefully deployed. The vial's scent becomes a sensory anchor that charges the reconciliation moment. Spatial choreography is clean (base, stairs, beacon, dock). The garden's night-blooming flowers and the beacon lit at dawn subtly mirror the shift from fury to vulnerability. The setting constrains the ticking clock (supply boat arrival) and the lighthouse itself becomes a silent witness, elevating this beyond postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reconciling with Vera before Silas dies. The pressure coheres and tightens once through Mara's realization that her shouts carried fury but not truth. The whispered apology narrows options (no grand gesture, vulnerability exposed) and Vera's immediate response confirms the cost. However, the escalation is more internal realization than on-page reversal; Mara's agency at the peak is passive reception of Silas's lesson rather than a difficult choice that forecloses a live defensive path. The final embrace lands with emotional weight but minimal tactical trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme—whispers travel farther than shouts, vulnerability versus armored rage—emerges from the vial ritual, the lighthouse beacon, and the seven-year silence without overt moralizing. The ending's whispered apology and Vera's "I heard you" offer a resonant, non-literal answer. The garden's night-scent and the calcified stone in Mara's chest are effective particulars. Minor slip: "vibrations of intent" and "screaming tenderness" veer toward abstract prompt-label articulation rather than fully embodied image, slightly diluting the thematic charge in the final third.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mara. Perceptual signature (ocean moods, salt-scrubbed soil, shells rattling) is consistent. Dialogue is minimal but effective: Silas's "whispers travel farther than shouts" and the sisters' quiet exchange avoid exposition. Minor register drift: phrases like "vibrations of intent," "purifies intentions," and "screaming tenderness" feel elevated beyond Mara's established idiom (assistant keeper, concrete sensory focus). The prose modulates well under pressure, but those conceptual abstractions slightly flatten voice specificity in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor artifacts: "vibrations of intent," "purifies intentions," "screaming tenderness" are abstract labels in high-pressure beats rather than concrete images. The phrase "calcified into stone" and "fury that dressed itself up as rage" are near-paraphrases. The final paragraph's "Whispers, Mara thought, remembering Silas's words" is a slight echo of the already-landed theme. No loops or scaffold that obscure causality, but figurative density in the vial sequence approaches overwriting without full payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—estranged sisters, dying mentor, symbolic vial—is familiar, but the cobalt lighthouse, night-garden scent as purifier, and the contrast between shouts and whispers offer a fresh angle. The emotional specificity (fear of abandonment dressed as rage) avoids generic templates. However, the vial's function (scent purifies intent) is told more than transformed through on-page action, and the reconciliation follows a recognizable arc. The ending's whispered exchange is earned in hindsight but the synthesis does not feel fully inevitable; Mara's agency at closure is more passive reception than bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara (assistant lighthouse keeper) drives all beats: receives the vial, climbs the lighthouse, lights the beacon, walks to the dock, whispers the apology. Her choices (opening the vial at dawn, lighting the beacon as signal, choosing a whisper over a grand gesture) create the key turn and shape the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The vial cork appears in three beats: Mara fingers it anxiously, pulls it free at dawn, replaces it after the scent disperses. Its worn smoothness signals prior worry, and re-corking marks the ritual's completion. However, the cork itself does not constrain a choice or reweight meaning at closure; the scent does the causal work. The cork is present and functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Vibrations of intent" is named once mid-story and glossed as the difference between intention and truth. It frames Mara's realization that shouts carried fury but whispers carry deeper truth, shaping the choice to whisper rather than shout. However, the concept is told rather than dramatically tested; Mara does not face an on-page decision where volume versus quiet alters outcome. It enriches theme but does not constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Purifies intentions" is attributed to the scent and drives the vial's function, stripping away Mara's "armor" and "pretense." It enables the whispered apology by clarifying her buried truth. However, the attribute is asserted in narration ("the scent purifies intentions") rather than shown through a visible tradeoff or cost. Mara does not wrestle with what purification demands; the effect is received passively.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Beckon" occurs once when the scent "beckoned something deep in her chest." It triggers Mara's emotional shift and enables the reconciliation. However, the action is metaphorical and internalized; replacing "beckon" with "called" or "stirred" would not alter story logic. It is purposeful but not indispensable, and the major turn (whispered apology) traces more to Silas's lesson than to the beckoning itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The scent of the night-blooming garden is signaled early (jasmine, honeysuckle), used at dawn to purify Mara's intent, and lingers in the final image ("the garden's night-scent still lingering"). Its mechanics—releasing at dawn, stripping away armor—shape Mara's readiness to whisper rather than shout. The method is present across setup, middle ritual, and closure, and its specificity (night-blooming, contrasted with dawn) charges the reconciliation moment.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse at dawn anchors every beat: Mara stands at its base, climbs its stairs, lights the beacon as signal, and it stands sentinel in the final image. Dawn timing pressures the decision (boat arriving), the beacon functions as both literal signal and thematic gesture (light after darkness), and the vertical ascent mirrors Mara's emotional climb. The setting is indispensable to spatial choreography, time pressure, and symbolic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the heat wave breaks" is named in the opening line and signals relief, a turning point. Dawn's arrival times the vial ritual and the boat's approach, tightening the decision window. However, the heat wave itself does not constrain tactics or recur; its breaking is a thematic marker (old tension ending) rather than a live clock. The dawn clock is more functional than the heat-wave frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's desire to prove whispers travel farther than shouts is dramatized through Silas's dying lesson, the vial ritual, and the final whispered apology that reaches Vera across seven years. The motivation conflicts with her prior reliance on "volume" and "righteous anger," and the whisper choice forecloses the grand gesture she imagined. Friction between the old tactic (shouting) and the new cost (vulnerability) is visible, and Vera's response confirms the whisper's efficacy.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Screaming tenderness" is named once mid-story ("It was screaming tenderness, this feeling—love that hurt so much it came out as violence") and captures the paradox of Mara's fury masking care. The tone modulates from anger to vulnerability and charges the whispered ending. However, the phrase itself is an abstract label rather than sustained tonal execution; the story enacts the paradox more through plot (shouts → whisper) than through moment-to-moment prose rhythm or diction that embodies "screaming tenderness" at the line level.</comment>
