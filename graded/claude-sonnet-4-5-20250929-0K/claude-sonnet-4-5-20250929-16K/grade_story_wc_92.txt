<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's inventive nature and revolutionary commitment are established, but her interior life remains largely instrumental—we see her moving through practiced actions without contradictory impulses or embodied cost. The moments of tension (hiding from Captain Voss) lack genuine fear or doubt that would test her resolve. The ending choice to continue her patrol feels inevitable rather than earned through internal struggle, and her competence never meets meaningful friction that would reveal deeper character layers.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Situational/Accumulative hybrid—the blackout creates pressure, coded messages accumulate meaning, and the final image reweights the opening. Orientation is clear early (fort, twilight, Mira's role). However, closure lacks visible cost: Mira walks away with "winking hush" confidence, no path foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The seventy-two-hour prisoner deadline introduces high stakes but remains unresolved, making the "silent revolution has begun" feel premature rather than earned. The structural choice to end on assured triumph undercuts the situational pressure the piece built.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The luminous fort, crystalline walls, and half-painted sundial create a vivid, purposeful setting. The sundial's texture and angles constrain Mira's method and anchor the revolutionary network concretely. Spatial choreography (eastern courtyard, sundial base, gnomon hiding spot) remains clear. The blackout itself—darkness swallowing luminous stones—charges the atmosphere and enables the covert action, meeting the micro-setting test by altering tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sparking revolution via coded communication during the blackout—is signaled early and the prisoner deadline adds urgency. However, the blackout is orchestrated rather than a complication, removing external resistance. Captain Voss passes without detecting her, deflating the tension. The piece shows setup and confident execution but no meaningful tightening or on-page cost that forecloses options; Mira's path from lock sentinel to revolutionary coordinator faces no consequential friction in this window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of covert resistance and patient revolution emerges through the sundial's coded angles and the network of kitchen workers, scribes, and gardeners. The contrast between surface (locked doors, luminous walls) and hidden meaning supports the thematic question. However, the final paragraph's direct thematic statements ("written in angles only the vigilant could read, locked in codes only the patient could break") replace earned resonance with exposition. The closing image of assured success reduces ambiguity rather than deepening it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mira's perceptions. The voice carries a measured, confident texture that fits her "calmly inventive" nature: "secrets were merely puzzles waiting for the right key." Psychic distance is controlled, and Mira's selective attention (feeling texture variations others can't see) creates a distinct perceptual signature. Minor register drift in phrases like "collective breath of people who'd finally decided enough was enough" introduces a slightly elevated diction, but the voice holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with strong concrete details (bronze quill holder, gnomon, coded angles). Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing images frame the piece effectively. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "secrets were merely puzzles" echoed by "silent revolution...written in angles only the vigilant could read, locked in codes only the patient could break" in the final paragraph. The phrase "cradle of sparks" and its variants recur without added pressure. Some filter-verb stacks ("could feel," "she'd left," "she'd discovered") slightly dull immediacy in reflective passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The coded sundial angles as revolutionary communication offers a fresh synthesis of the "half-finished monument" trope. Mira's role as lock sentinel enabling access inverts the guardian archetype purposefully. However, the revolutionary-network-in-oppressive-regime frame follows familiar resistance-story beats without unexpected turns. The blackout as orchestrated success rather than complication reduces risk. The particulars (luminous stones, bronze quill holder, painted angles) ground the premise, but the emotional arc—from confident planning to assured triumph—lacks friction that would deepen originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira as vigilant lock sentinel appears throughout, her position granting access to sealed chambers and enabling covert coordination. Her rounds and key-ring chiming provide cover for retrieving messages. However, her sentinel role functions primarily as setup and tool rather than creating a meaningful turn; she never uses her lock knowledge to overcome a locked obstacle or face a choice between duty and revolution in this window.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder is introduced at the sundial, retrieved with "comfortable weight," contains rolled messages from the network, and Mira adds her own encoded note to it before replacing it. It appears in three beats (retrieval, message exchange, replacement) and its specific hiding spot behind the gnomon matters. The holder enables the coordination that drives the plot, though its bronze material and quill-holder disguise don't constrain choices beyond providing cover.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Cradle of sparks" is introduced when Mira considers the sundial and recurs in the final paragraph ("the cradle of sparks had already ignited something"). It names the revolution's origin point and reappears with reweighted meaning (potential → ignited). However, it functions more as metaphoric label than mechanism; removing the phrase would not break story logic since the sundial and network operate independently of this naming.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Calmly inventive" is stated early ("Her calmly inventive nature had never been suited to mere guardianship") and reflected in her methodical coding and patience. However, it remains largely label-level; we see calm competence but not a moment where inventiveness under pressure creates a visible tradeoff or where her calm temperament constrains an impulsive option she must resist.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Intrigue structures the entire piece: Mira's espionage role, coded sundial messages, the hidden network, the orchestrated blackout, and the prisoner rescue plan. The discovery of the Council's plan to seal the lower levels deepens the intrigue last week (backstory) and drives the seventy-two-hour deadline. However, much intrigue is recounted rather than unfolding; the blackout and message exchange proceed without friction, reducing on-page intrigue to successful execution of prior plotting.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The coded angles in the half-painted sundial are introduced early, explained in detail (thirty degrees for armory, forty-five for rotations, sixty for correspondence), and Mira reads responses by tracing angles in darkness. The method shapes her approach (kneeling, feeling texture variations, committing seventeen confirmations to memory) and its half-painted state provides cover. The mechanics matter across multiple beats and the method's specific constraints (must be felt in darkness, continuity of "restoration" work) drive tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The luminous fort at twilight opens the piece with crystalline walls catching sun, and the blackout's extinguishing of three-century-old luminous stones creates the tactical window. The eastern courtyard and sundial location anchor action. However, the setting provides opportunity more than constraint; darkness enables rather than pressures. The fort's luminous restoration by dawn appears in the final image, reweighting the surface/hidden-change theme, which lifts the score moderately.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The unexplained blackout is present throughout, swept through "in a breath," specified as orchestrated by Kael "at the exact moment," and bookends the piece (darkness → dawn power restoration). It creates the tactical window for covert action and tightens Mira's movements (hiding from Captain Voss's lantern search). The seventy-two-hour prisoner deadline adds urgency. However, elapsed time during the blackout remains untracked, and the return of power "by dawn" is stated rather than pressing choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sparking a silent revolution drives all of Mira's actions: months of planning, coding the sundial, coordinating the network, orchestrating the blackout, and encoding the prisoner-rescue next phase. The motivation is dramatized through her patient work and the seventeen confirmations. However, we see assured execution without internal friction—no moment where the cost of revolution (personal risk, betrayal of Captain Voss, potential violence) creates conflicting wants that she must navigate on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Winking hush" appears explicitly in the final paragraph ("Mira walked with a winking hush in her step") and colors the opening's "Perfect, she thought, a smile playing at her lips." The tone of covert confidence and knowing secrecy is consistent. However, it remains largely static—the same assured, playful smugness from opening to close—without modulating under the brief moment of danger (Voss's search) or deepening when she encodes the high-stakes prisoner rescue, limiting its charge at closure.</comment>
