<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's motivation to witness and respond is established through seventeen years of observation, but her interiority remains somewhat abstract—"warmly observant" is asserted more than embodied through contradictory impulses. The final whispered acknowledgment "I see you" feels earned by her accumulated stone-stacking, yet the shift from silence to voice lacks a visible internal cost or friction. Her choice to continue visits is consistent but not tested by competing pressures on the page. The ghost-keeper remains a device rather than a relational crucible that would force harder trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an accumulative/textural lens: letters and stones layer into a communion arc that reweights loneliness and guardianship. Orientation anchors quickly (Vera, lantern room, 3:47 AM lamp failure). The closure—Vera's vow to continue and the felt embrace—registers as Charged Poise: she crystallizes her role with undeniable emotional cost ("ached in her chest, radiant and painful"). One friction: the ghost's final letter arrives conveniently at the exact moment the lamp dies, a coincidence that complicates rather than resolves, acceptable under situational tolerance but borderline for causal rigor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lantern room is vividly anchored: Fresnel lens, brass fixtures, sea-weathered glass with scratched messages. The cairn-building recurs across three beats and constrains Vera's response—stones are her only tool for reply. Micro-setting (glass panels, seaward windows, spiral stairs) charges the final dawn image when pale gold light fills the space. The lamp's darkness enables discovery of hidden inscriptions, turning environment into revelation. One note: the lighthouse's automated status is told rather than shown through a missing hum or control panel detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—maintaining connection with the unseen keeper—tightens when the lamp dies and the ghost announces departure. Vera's agency is renunciation of silence (her whisper) and commitment (the written vow), foreclosing solitary delivery work for ongoing communion. Pressure accumulates through the letter series, but no on-page reversal tests her resolve: no weather, supply shortage, or bureaucratic order forces her to choose between visits and duty. The emotional cost is felt ("ached… radiant and painful"), but tactical constraints or a visible trade-off would elevate the escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—guardianship as chain of witnessing across isolation—emerges through stone cairns, ghost inscriptions, and the loop of protectors protecting protectors. The final image ("dark would never be empty again") reweights prior loneliness without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the ghost's gratitude and Vera's throat-tightening silence. One slip: "You were the thread connecting all of us who guard the edges of things" in Vera's letter edges toward thematic statement rather than trusting image and action alone. The sea glass as "small blue flame" works as purposeful metaphor, not symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; Vera's perceptual signature—noticing "what words missed"—shapes the narrative. Distance control is clean, no head-hopping. One dialogue line ("I see you") breaks her seventeen-year silence with earned weight. However, several lines drift into elevated register beyond a supply skipper's plausible idiom: "elusive sensation she'd been trying to capture since childhood," "radiant and painful as lamp oil burning clean," "luminous conversation across the border of existence." These phrases feel authorial rather than character-rooted, reducing voice specificity under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with strong imagery (sea glass "blue as forgetting," shadows moving "against the light's rotation"). Information density is high in the opening and lantern-room discovery. Several template cadences appear: "This became their language… This was how you bottled safety… The ghosts would stack… She would read…" in the final third, creating rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loop: "The air shifted, and she felt it—that elusive sensation" immediately followed by "She understood now" restates rather than advances. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") cluster in peak beats without voice motivation. Minor: "smooth stones" and "sea glass… worn smooth" repeat the descriptor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—anonymous letter chain with a ghost lighthouse keeper—transforms the haunted-lighthouse trope through the cairn-as-reply mechanic and Vera's witnessing role. The emotional specificity (reticence as attention, protectors needing protection) avoids generic loneliness templates. However, the core shape—isolated woman discovers spectral presence, offers comfort, gains purpose—follows a familiar arc without a non-obvious turn. The ghost's departure coinciding with lamp failure is convenient rather than causally earned. Vera's final vow and the embrace-as-goodbye register as earned but not surprising; the synthesis feels solid rather than inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Vera is introduced in paragraph two, frames the letter-chain setup, and drives the closure vow. Her reticence shapes her observation-first approach and delayed speech. Her decision to stack stones (first instance), build the final cairn, and write the vow are on-page choices that alter tactics. However, her role is more witness than decider under pressure—she responds to the ghost's cues rather than initiating turns. The cairn-building at closure is decisive but not tested by competing stakes (no shortage of stones, no time limit, no cost to returning weekly). Present in setup, development, and payoff; causal role in two beats; closure-linked but not indispensable (another caretaker could fulfill the role with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sea glass appears in two beats: discovered beside the final letter (mid-story) and pocketed at dawn (closure). It is "blue as forgetting," and Vera places it atop the cairn "like a small blue flame," reweighting it from abandonment to memorial. The object charges the final image and Vera's decision to carry it forward. However, it does not constrain a prior choice or enable a tactic—it is received, not used. Late first appearance (after midpoint) and ornamental initial mention lower integration. Closure linkage and symbolic reprise (flame motif) elevate but do not reach essentiality; another token (a keeper's button, a lens shard) could substitute with edits to metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The letter chain is introduced in paragraph five, structures the three-month backstory, and the final letter triggers the closure beat. The mechanic (letters tucked under cairns, Vera's stone replies) defines the relationship and Vera's only communication method. It shapes her tactics (weekly visits, stone-stacking) and the ghost's departure stakes. Present in setup (first letter flashback), development (the exchange is described), and payoff (final letter prompts Vera's written reply and vow). Drives two beats and is essential to closure—without the chain, the communion and Vera's role collapse. High causal pressure, irreplaceable specificity, and closure-definitive.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is asserted in paragraph two ("her reticence was a form of attention—she noticed what words missed") and returns at closure ("this warmly observant woman"). It enables her to perceive the ghost's presence and motivates cairn-building. However, it is told more than shown; no on-page moment demonstrates a trade-off where observation competes with speech or action under pressure. The trait does not visibly constrain a choice—she could be described as "empathetic" or "patient" with similar edits. Present in setup and closure reprise, but development is label-only. Functional but swappable; no felt cost tied to the attribute itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Protect" threads through the piece: keepers protect ships, Vera protects the ghost's memory, ghosts protect watch-keepers. Vera's vow "I'll maintain this tower and these stones and your memory" and her written promise to continue visits are protective acts that define closure. The theme—"protecting the protectors"—organizes the final paragraph. However, protection is more thematic claim than on-page action with cost. Vera does not face a threat she must counter or a sacrifice required by guarding. Present in setup (keepers' role), development (thematic reflection), and payoff (vow), but the action is abstract rather than tactical. Shapes closure meaning but could be reframed as "honor" or "witness" with modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stone-stacking is introduced early (paragraph six: "stack two stones," then "three"), used as the communication mechanic, and culminates in the tallest cairn at closure. The method constrains Vera's replies—she cannot write until the final beat—and the cairn's height and placement (lamp center, sea glass peak) are specific choices under pressure. Present in setup, development (the exchange is described), and payoff (final cairn). Drives two beats and participates in closure image. However, the mechanics are told in flashback rather than dramatized as an attempt under difficulty; we do not see Vera building the first cairns on the page. High integration but one step short of indispensability—another silent reply system (arranging tools, lighting candles) could substitute with edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lantern room is established in paragraph three, described in detail (Fresnel lens, brass, glass panels with scratched messages), and hosts all key beats: letter discovery, lamp failure, inscription reveal, cairn-building, dawn embrace. The lamp's darkness enables Vera to see hidden messages ("what the light had always obscured"), a direct environmental constraint on discovery. The room's height and spiral stairs frame access; the "seaward windows" and "eastern window" provide spatial anchors. Present in setup, development, and payoff; drives revelation and final image. The setting is indispensable—no other location offers the lamp's symbolic and physical properties. High causal pressure, specificity, and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe—"after the lamp flickered out at 3:47 AM"—opens the story and sets the discovery scene. The lamp's death is the inciting event that reveals the inscriptions and triggers the ghost's final letter. However, time does not tighten decisions after the opening: Vera has unlimited duration to build the cairn, write her letter, and witness dawn. No clock pressure (fuel running out, coast guard inspection, storm arrival) forces her to choose speed over care. Present in setup and loosely in payoff (dawn arrives), but absent in development. One beat involvement; closure-adjacent but not causally active in the ending. Functional but replaceable—"after the keeper vanished" would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The desire to "bottle the feeling of safety" is articulated late (paragraph fifteen: "This was how you bottled safety") and recurs in the final line ("bottled safety… warmly observant woman"). Vera's childhood memory of her mother's arms (paragraph fourteen) dramatizes the feeling's origin, and her cairn-building and vow are attempts to create safety for the ghost and herself. However, the motivation is told more than tested—no on-page moment forces Vera to choose between her own safety and the ghost's, or to risk isolation to maintain connection. Late first mention (second half) and summary framing lower integration. Present in payoff and thematically in development, but setup is absent. Shapes closure meaning but is not causally indispensable; "honor the lonely" would function similarly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone—"luminescent ache"—is established early through imagery: "shadows moved against the light's rotation," "sea-weathered paper and desperate handwriting," "warmth radiating from brass fixtures." It intensifies at closure: "ached in her chest, radiant and painful as lamp oil burning clean," "pale gold light," "embrace her like gratitude, like goodbye." The tone modulates from eerie discovery to elegiac communion to bittersweet resolution, coherent across turns. Diction choices (forgetting, dissolving, luminous, radiant) sustain the ache-light fusion. The final image—"dark would never be empty again"—charges the tone with closure weight. However, one line ("luminous conversation across the border of existence") makes the tone explicit rather than trusting accumulation. High coherence and closure charge; hairline over-articulation.</comment>
