<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her spiral-shell expertise is character-particular, but her interiority remains somewhat abstract—"quietly driven" is told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The descent and pattern-reading show micro-choices under pressure, but the expedition-finding beat summarizes rather than dramatizes her reaction to twelve arranged corpses. The final whistle sequence demonstrates agency, yet the cost of confronting the watchers is more atmospheric than viscerally felt through her body or specific fears.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early and maintains causal coherence under a Causal lens: whistle → shell resonance → navigation map → expedition remains → multi-whistle question. Closure lands on the page (the turtles stop, watchers turn) with a Charged Poise reconfiguration that crystallizes the city's captivity and Mira's demand for answers. The cost is conceptual—ignorance exchanged for confrontation with shepherds—but the final image makes it undeniable. One meaningful tightening (sealed gate was deliberate) narrows options and the ending reweights the entire migration premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city, brass sea, and perpetual white sun-glare establish vivid, consistent atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "brine and ancient reptile musk," "phosphorescent gases," "millions of [shells] formed the sediment of decades." The shells constrain Mira's method and the undersides of the turtles supply the navigation map, so environment shapes choice. The watchers charge the final image by moving closer when the turtles stop. Spatial choreography remains clear across descent and cavern exploration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what happened to the lost expedition—is signaled early and tightens when Mira finds evidence of deliberate gate-sealing. Pressure escalates under the Causal lens through her pattern decoding, which reveals the city's captivity and the council's complicity. The final whistle sequence narrows options: asking the question stops the turtles and summons the watchers' attention. Agency is decision-driven (gathering all whistles, playing the pattern) and the cost is visible—she has ended the city's ignorance and brought Chelone within range of its shepherds. One clear turn (expedition silenced) shapes the ending stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pattern languages and navigation symbols: knowledge as peril, captivity masked as migration, and the price of questioning authority. The expedition's spiral-arranged bodies and Mira's final multi-whistle question offer a resonant, non-literal answer to "Where are you taking us?" without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the council's deliberate welding and the watchers' equidistant stillness. The final image—turtles stopping, watchers turning—reweights the entire premise with undeniable conceptual cost, avoiding tidy resolution while charging the question with dread.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and distance is controlled; Mira's perceptual signature filters detail through her cartographic expertise ("spiral grooves," "Fibonacci progression"). Diction stays consistent and avoids unmotivated register shifts. However, two sentences approach filter-verb stacking without full immersion: "She held the whistle" and "She played the whistle" are functional but slightly externalized. The phrase "sunwashed dread" in narration feels slightly elevated compared to the concrete textures elsewhere. Narrative certainty matches Mira's knowledge throughout, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most sentences advance character, world, or pressure. However, minor scaffold appears: "The expedition had been gone for forty-three days. They had descended..." uses a distanced summary opener when a tighter integration would increase immediacy. The phrase "pattern language" recurs five times, verging on synonym loop but justified by Mira's expertise. "She played Kade's whistle" / "She played the whistle again" repeats the stem across paragraphs without added pressure. Clarity and grammar are clean, and the opening/closing images anchor stakes effectively, but the scaffold and minor loops prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of city-on-turtles, spiral-shell cartography, and pattern-based navigation is specific and internally coherent; the premise is fresh yet grounded. The whistle's Fibonacci sequence and the shells' resonant frequencies transform familiar "lost expedition" material through concrete world logic. The watchers as shepherds and Chelone as livestock offer a non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking (multi-sensory pattern language, biological navigation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final confrontation feels inevitable in hindsight, earned by the spiral grammar and undersea map.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her spiral-shell expertise shapes all key beats: reading the whistle sequence, descending through hatches, decoding undersea markings, gathering twelve whistles, playing the final pattern. Her choices (ignoring the council, descending, asking the question) create the core turns. She appears early, drives middle action (cracking shells, finding the expedition), and her final multi-whistle sequence stops the turtles and summons the watchers. The cartographer role is indispensable—no other character type could decode the pattern languages. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; removing her exact expertise would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The reed whistle is seeded early (Kade's quarters, still damp), used twice on-page (first play reveals shell resonance, second play cracks shells and releases map), and returns with reweighted meaning in the final beat (thirteen whistles, multi-voice pattern). It constrains Mira's method (Fibonacci holes guide her) and enables the closure (asking the question stops the turtles). The whistle's specificity (breath-dampness, hole sequence) matters. It drives at least three distinct beats (discovery, descent revelation, final confrontation) and is indispensable to closure. Removing it would collapse the pattern-language logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lost expedition is the inciting stake (forty-three days gone, gate rusted shut), shapes Mira's descent, supplies the middle revelation (deliberate sealing, arranged bodies, twelve whistles), and directly enables the closure (gathering their whistles completes the pattern). It is present early, drives middle beats (finding remains, reading their spiral message), and is causally active in the final image (their whistles let Mira ask the multi-voice question). The expedition's discovery—that Chelone is livestock—redefines all prior stakes. Removing it would eliminate the core conflict and the means to confront the watchers.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is mentioned once in exposition ("quietly driven by something the council ignored") and demonstrated through Mira's actions: ignoring the council, descending alone, gathering whistles, confronting the watchers. The trait enables her solo investigation and shapes her refusal to accept the council's verdict. However, it is never explicitly constraining or tested—no on-page moment where quietness costs her or where a louder approach would have changed outcomes. The trait is functional and consistent but does not carry visible tradeoff or friction. Present in setup, visible in beats, but no felt cost ties to the attribute itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Crack" is the pivotal action: shells crack in geometric sequences, releasing phosphorescent gases that reveal the navigation map on the turtles' undersides. This action redefines options (Mira learns the city is captive, the gate was sealed deliberately) and enables the final confrontation (the map shows the watchers are shepherds). It occurs mid-story, is causally active (triggered by the whistle pattern), and directly shapes closure (the map's revelation compels Mira to ask the question). Removing "crack" would eliminate the core discovery mechanism. The specificity (hairline fractures, geometric sequences, trapped gases) is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Pattern languages" is seeded early (Mira's expertise in spiral grammar, Fibonacci whistle holes), demonstrated in two distinct beats (shell resonance, cracking shells to reveal markings), and is the sole means by which Mira decodes the navigation symbols and asks the final question. The method constrains her approach (she cannot simply ask the council or use force) and shapes tactics (gathering all whistles to complete the pattern). It is causally active at closure (playing the pattern stops the turtles). The mechanics are signaled and matter throughout. Removing pattern languages would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city is present throughout: the turtles carry Chelone, their undersides hold the navigation map, and they stop moving at closure in response to Mira's question. The setting supplies the core resources (shells, sediment, undersea caverns) and constraints (gate sealed, maintenance shafts). The turtles' migration is the central mystery and their halting is the final payoff. The setting is indispensable—the story's logic (captive city, shepherded migration) depends on the gargantuan turtles. Early signal, middle beats (descent between shells), and closure participation (turtles stop) are all strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the gate rusts shut" is seeded early (forty-three days since departure, hinges fused with salt and time) and shapes the inciting problem (expedition cannot return). It constrains Mira's method (she must use emergency hatches) and charges the middle revelation (gate welded deliberately, not rusted). However, time does not actively tighten decisions after setup—no live clock pressures her descent or final confrontation. The timeframe is causally important but not a persistent source of escalating pressure. Present in setup and middle, but absent from closure tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's desire to question the watchers is seeded early (expedition's fate tied to the watchers, Mira suspects they are markers) and drives all key choices: descending, decoding the pattern, gathering whistles, playing the final sequence. The motivation is dramatized through action rather than told, and it carries friction (council declares expedition lost, gate sealed). The final beat literalizes the motivation (she asks "Where are you taking us?"). The want is coherent, shapes tactics, and is present at closure. Visible cost: she ends the city's ignorance and forces confrontation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Sunwashed dread" is established early ("harsh white light," "perpetual sea-glare," "constant, sunwashed dread") and coheres through turns: the watchers' equidistant stillness, the humid darkness between turtles, the phosphorescent gases, the desiccated bodies. Tone modulates with pressure (calm expertise → humid darkness → final confrontation) and charges the final image (watchers turn, turtles stop, "at last, to answer" carries dread). The glare and dread are specific to this setting and inseparable from the stakes. Tone is present early, sustained through beats, and intensifies at closure without becoming static.</comment>
