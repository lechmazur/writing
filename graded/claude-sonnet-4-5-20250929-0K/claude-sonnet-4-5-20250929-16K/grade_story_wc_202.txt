<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to restore her grandmother's legacy is clear and consistent, but her interiority reads as smooth competence without embodied struggle. The nocturnal research sequence lacks physical cost or contradictory impulses—she works "through the night" without fatigue affecting perception or choice. The grandmother's erasure provides backstory weight, but Mira's present choices feel more like puzzle-solving than decisions that foreclose paths with visible internal friction. The final decision to present to the Guild carries stated stakes but no on-page wavering or trade-off that would earn the transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: clues gather across paintings until the final revelation reweights the grandmother's method as recoverable technique. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Mira grasps that translation means "insisting that every voice mattered"—but the cost remains abstract; we see resolve, not a visible forfeiture or confrontation that tests it. The market-to-workshop transition is clean, and causality holds (lens fragment unlocks hidden symbols, symbols yield coordinates and method). One meaningful deepening occurs when the final painting reveals the grandmother's face and the crowd of erased translators, shifting the quest from personal to collective.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The suspended market is vivid and specific—platforms strung between spires, vendors selling "bottled starlight and crystallized memories"—and establishes a world where metaphor is literal. The workshop anchor is functional but minimal. The lighthouse lens fragment acts as micro-setting: its "elusively tangible" glass constrains Mira's method (she must hold it to each painting) and charges the final image when her grandmother's reflection appears within it. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's trained perception as a translator who "learned to see what others missed."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: recover the grandmother's erased history and method. One meaningful tightening occurs when the final painting names the grandmother and reveals the scale of erasure, raising the cost from personal vindication to institutional challenge. The presentation to the Guild Council is declared but not dramatized, so the confrontation that would test resolve remains off-page. Mira's agency is consistent—she searches, acquires, decodes—but these are puzzle moves rather than decisions under opposing pressure. No antagonist appears to complicate her research, and coincidence (the merchant's promise) delivers the key artifact without cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: translation as recovery of overlooked voices, honoring "complicated truths" over "clean narratives." The lens fragment, paintings, and hidden symbols function as concrete anchors rather than abstract claims. The final image—grandmother's reflection in the lens, "elusively tangible, like everything worth finding"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The line "translation had never been just about converting one language to another" borders on thesis statement but is earned by prior specifics. Subtext operates in the merchant's knowing smile and the Guild's preference for "clean narratives," implying institutional suppression without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with controlled access to Mira's perceptions and intentions. Diction is elevated and consistent—"elusively tangible," "anchors of intuition," "suspended in an eternal instant"—creating a lyric texture that matches the between-worlds premise. The dialogue with the merchant is functional and goal-driven, carrying subtext in "For you, translator, nothing" and the reveal of the grandmother's promise. Perceptual signature is present: Mira's trained eye for hidden details filters the market and paintings. Minor register drift: "drafted her presentation to the Guild Council" shifts into procedural language that flattens the ending beat's charge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are strong through the market and workshop sequences. Information density is high: most lines advance discovery or deepen stakes. Template cadence appears in the research paragraph: "She held... She worked... The paintings revealed..." stacks three consecutive subject-verb openers. The phrase "elusively tangible" recurs three times without meaningful variation, becoming a tic. "Suspended in an eternal instant" and "crystallized feeling where past and future collapsed" blur into synonym loops. Minor filter-verb density in "she could have sworn she saw" when "she saw" would be more immediate. Figurative language is purposeful but occasionally stacks: "anchors of intuition," "hidden layers," "layered geography of overlapping realities" compress into abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The between-worlds translator premise offers a fresh angle on archival recovery, and the method—hidden symbols visible only through a lens fragment—provides concrete ingenuity. The grandmother-as-pioneer-erased-by-institution reads as a familiar template (marginalized innovator vindicated by descendant), though the painting-as-map specificity elevates it. Emotional truth is present in Mira's determination, but the smooth execution without setback or self-doubt limits tension. The final image of the grandmother's reflection is evocative but borders on convenient sentiment. Risk-taking is modest: the story commits to its lyric register and conceptual premise but avoids bold structural choices or moral ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's role as between-worlds translator shapes her perception (seeing what others miss) and justifies her search for artifacts. Her choices—acquiring the lens, decoding the paintings, drafting the presentation—drive all key beats and the closure turn. The occupation is not merely cosmetic; it provides the interpretive method that unlocks the map. However, her decisions are puzzle-solving rather than agonized trade-offs, limiting the felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse lens fragment is introduced early (market scene), used functionally in the workshop to reveal hidden symbols across three paintings, and charges the final image when the grandmother's reflection appears within it. Its specific property—revealing "pigments that existed only at the edge of perception"—is irreplaceable and drives the middle sequence. The lens is handled on the page in multiple beats and returns with reweighted meaning at closure. Strong integration with visible causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Anchors of intuition" appears as a label in Mira's decoding work—symbols her grandmother embedded "as a map for those who would follow." The concept frames the method but does not constrain a choice with visible cost; Mira's intuition operates smoothly without false leads or doubt. The phrase recurs in exposition but lacks dramatized friction. Present and thematically coherent, but more label than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Elusively tangible" describes the lens fragment ("solid glass that somehow felt like it might dissolve into pure concept") and recurs twice more, including in the closing line. It establishes atmosphere and matches the between-worlds premise, but does not constrain an on-page action with cost—Mira handles the lens without difficulty or trade-off. The trait is ornamental texture rather than a limiting factor that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Unfasten" appears in "unfastening each hidden layer from its camouflage" and captures the decoding method that drives the middle beat. The action is specific to the premise—removing concealment rather than simple reading—and shapes Mira's approach to the paintings. Swapping it for "reveal" or "decode" would lose the tactile, labor-intensive connotation that charges the research sequence. Present in a key beat and tied to the method, though not repeated or reprised at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The method—reading hidden details in paintings through the lens fragment—is signaled early, demonstrated across the three-painting sequence, and provides the causality for the climactic discovery. The mechanics matter: different artists across a century unconsciously recorded between-world phenomena, and the lens makes those pigments visible. The method is irreplaceable and constrains Mira's approach (she cannot decode without the lens). It drives the middle beat and delivers the closure revelation. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's market is vivid in the opening—suspension bridges, platforms between spires, vendors selling conceptual goods—and establishes the world's magical-realist texture. Mira moves through it to acquire the lens fragment, but the market does not constrain her choice or pressure her tactics; the merchant gifts the artifact. After the opening, the setting shifts to the workshop and does not return. Present and atmospheric, but replaceable with another magical market without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "between childhood and now" anchors Mira's training arc in exposition and establishes her expertise. The grandmother's work occurred "thirty years ago," and the paintings span "a century," creating layered history. However, the present action unfolds without time pressure—Mira works "through the night" with no clock tightening her decisions or costs. Time is backdrop rather than constraint. Functional but does not alter tactics or escalate stakes on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to honor overlooked histories is seeded early (grandmother erased from records), dramatized through Mira's months-long search and nocturnal decoding, and drives the closure decision to present evidence to the Guild. The desire is specific and consistent, tied to familial and professional identity. The friction between wanting to restore her grandmother and the risk of challenging the Guild is stated but not tested on the page with visible cost—no Guild representative opposes her, and the confrontation remains future. Strong thematic presence; moderate dramatization of internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Eternal instant" appears in "suspended in an eternal instant, that crystallized feeling where past and future collapsed into a single point of understanding." The phrase names the lyric compression at the moment of revelation and matches the between-worlds premise where boundaries blur. Tone is contemplative and elevated throughout, modulating slightly at the market (sensory, social) and the workshop (focused, nocturnal). The final image—grandmother's reflection—attempts to echo the "eternal instant" quality but does not heighten pressure. Present and coherent, but static rather than dynamically charged by the ending.</comment>
