<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vess's motivation is clear and her expertise is embodied through scanner glove and memory work, but her emotional arc remains abstract—tears at the mural lack setup, and the decision not to sit feels unmotivated. Internal contradiction is minimal; she proceeds linearly without genuine struggle between competing impulses. The renunciation at the end ("didn't sit") forecloses a path but the cost is told rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (lore keeper, canyon, tonight deadline). The story follows a causal lens: scan waterfall → orchard → decode flake → peel paint → find door → ascend → choose not to claim. The closure is Earned Stasis (refusal to sit) with a conceptual price (remaining unclaimed "a while longer"), though the cost reads more asserted than viscerally dramatized. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ruby flake warms and the wall opens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall, orchard with circuit-bark trees, and painted walls supply vivid sensory anchors filtered through Vess's expertise. The wall's paint layers constrain her method and charge the mural discovery. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the ascent. The throne chamber at sunrise provides a resonant final image that integrates setting with closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the stairway before sunrise) is signaled early and coheres. The ruby flake warming provides escalation, and peeling paint layers tightens access. Agency at closure is renunciation with stated cost, but the decision not to sit lacks on-page friction—no competing desire or fear tests her commitment. The sunrise deadline is honored structurally but never pressures a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of bridging past and future emerges organically through circuit-trees, layered paint eras, and the lore keeper's role. The final choice—leaving the throne unclaimed to guide others—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of power versus stewardship. No overt moralizing. The ruby-flake reunion and mural motifs recur with reweighted meaning at closure without forced symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited distance. Diction is consistent and slightly elevated ("wisely adventurous steps," "curtain of living color") but edges toward stock fantasy register in peak beats ("compressed starlight and human ambition"). Perceptual signature is present through scanner glove and archive expertise. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop near-synonyms: "cataloging the memory-circuits" / "corrupted data fragments," "wisely adventurous" appears twice as filler. "Futuristic and ancient all at once" in the final line is abstract summary rather than concrete image. Minor template cadence in the ascent paragraph ("carved with names… committing each"). No clarity breaks, but figurative language occasionally stacks without payoff ("compressed starlight and human ambition").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic tech-nature fusion and paint-archaeology method offer moderate freshness, but the wise-guide-who-refuses-power frame is familiar and executed without bold subversion. Emotional specificity is present in the tears but not deeply contradictory. The sunrise closure image is apt but predictable. The piece commits to its premise without retreat, yet the overall arc could transfer to many fantasy-quest templates with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Vess is present throughout and makes key choices: stepping through the waterfall, peeling paint, ascending, refusing to sit. The refusal shapes closure directly. Early setup (three centuries cataloging), middle development (decode and peel), and payoff (renunciation) all present. Cost is conceptual (leaving it unclaimed) and felt lightly. Causal pressure across three distinct beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ruby flake introduced early with coordinates, warms as Vess nears the stairway (beat 2), and fuses into the throne at closure (beat 3). Its warmth guides her choice to peel paint, and the final reunion activates the throne. Specific properties (etched coordinates, resonance, fusion) are irreplaceable. Strong closure linkage and causal pressure across all three beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The unclaimed throne frames the quest from the opening and appears in the mural, ascent inscriptions, and final chamber. Vess's refusal to sit is the closure act. However, "unclaimed" functions more as thematic backdrop than tactical constraint—no competing claimant or immediate consequence pressures her choice. Setup, development (mural depiction), and payoff present; cost is conceptual but mild.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Wisely adventurous" appears twice as a label ("wisely adventurous steps," "sought it wisely, adventurously") but does not constrain or enable a visible tradeoff. No on-page moment where caution conflicts with boldness or where the trait shapes a tactical choice under pressure. Present in setup and payoff as descriptor only; no middle beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Sally forth" is declared in the opening line and initiates the journey, but the verb itself is ornamental—"stepped through" or "ventured" would serve identically. The action frames expectation but does not reappear or shape later beats. Setup present; no development or closure link. Swappable without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Peeling paint layers is seeded (walls "layered with centuries of paint"), enacted in a sustained beat with escalating warmth from the flake, and directly reveals the mural that opens the stairway. The method's mechanics (layer sequence, historical eras) matter and drive the middle turn. Strong causal pressure, irreplaceable specificity, and closure linkage across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The orchard and waterfall are vividly rendered and frame the setting from early on. The orchard provides the painted walls essential to the method. The waterfall is crossed once and does not constrain later choices; the orchard supplies resources (walls) but does not pressure tactics. Setup, development (walls), and implicit payoff (mural location). Moderate causal role; could be compressed to "hidden chamber" with minor loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The sunrise deadline is stated in the opening ("until sunrise") and arrives at closure ("Sunrise painted the chamber gold"), but no scene dramatizes time pressure or forces a faster/riskier choice. The clock is cosmetic. Setup and payoff present; no middle development where elapsed time alters tactics. Swappable with "by nightfall" without impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Finding the stairway is Vess's stated goal, drives her scan and paint-peeling, and succeeds on-page when the passage opens. The motivation is consistent and shapes every beat. Cost arrives at closure when she chooses not to claim the throne, though that friction (guide others vs. sit now) is mild. Setup, development (decode/peel to find door), and payoff all present with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Futuristic nostalgia" coheres in the tech-nature imagery (circuit-bark, bioluminescent stairs, memory-circuits vs. corrupted archives) and the paint-era archaeology. Tone is stable and modulates gently at the mural discovery (tears) and throne chamber (hope). The final line states the tone overtly ("futuristic and ancient all at once"), which is on-the-nose but does charge the image. Present throughout; moderate tonal control under pressure.</comment>
