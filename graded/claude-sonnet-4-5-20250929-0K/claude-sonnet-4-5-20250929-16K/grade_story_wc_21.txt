<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is concrete and particularized—"memory seized her like a fist" anchors the retrocognitive trap effectively. Her motivation deepens through embodied experience of Elijah's fear and determination, culminating in the earned shift from "solemn keeper of records" to "voice for encrypted voices." The transition from archival distance to active testimony is dramatized through her physical compulsion to arrange debris, creating visible cost. Minor slip: the epiphany language ("understood her motivation clearly now, burning like the desert sun") edges toward summary rather than staying fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph (floating library, Maya, three weeks prior). Causal lens holds: decoding triggers retrocognitive trap, which compels the final choice to complete the work and testify. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization): Maya moves from detached archivist to committed witness, with visible cost in her searing focus and loss of professional distance. The nested time structure (present frame → 1952 experience → return) remains legible, and the encrypted diary functions as both constraint and catalyst throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon charges both the retrocognitive beat and the final debris-message moment with physical specificity—"volcanic glass pooled in the desert's secret hollow" grounds the anomaly. The zeppelin library and navigation-room-turned-archives provide concrete workspace anchors. Spatial choreography remains clear across the time jump and return. The black sand functions as micro-setting in the closure, enabling Maya's message-arrangement and echoing Elijah's method. Minor limitation: the desert and sky remain somewhat generic between anchor points.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering encrypted truth—is signaled early and tightens when the diary trap closes around Maya. The retrocognitive imprisonment creates escalating pressure: she cannot escape until dawn, forcing her to witness the fragile 1952 parley with all its tension. The sheriff's conditional alliance ("I can look away") deepens moral complexity without resolving cleanly. Maya's final choice to decode everything and name the protected carries visible cost: loss of archival solemnity, transformation into active channel. The parley itself provides a meaningful turn that reweights the stakes from academic recovery to living testimony.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between encryption as protective silence and testimony as necessary voice, crystallized in "Light gets through cracks." The final image—Maya translating musical notes into testimony while the floating library drifts—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The obsidian lagoon and debris messages recur with reweighted meaning, moving from Elijah's covert organizing to Maya's commitment to disclosure. Subtext operates effectively in the sheriff's conditional offer and Elijah's acceptance of imperfect progress. The piece resists tidy resolution: the encrypted voices are freed, but the fragility of the original alliance and the incompleteness of justice remain palpable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, with clean shifts between Maya's present and Elijah's retrocognitive past signaled by paragraph breaks and explicit framing ("Maya was retrocognitively trapped"). Perceptual signature is character-specific: Maya notices archive details, Elijah registers threat and hope. Diction remains controlled and voice-consistent, though some phrases edge toward elevated register ("searing determination," "cargo of remembrance"). The dialogue in the parley scene carries subtext and advances plot through negotiation beats. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interior and observational distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong momentum and varied syntax. Information density is high: "letters...yellowed like old teeth" and "Strong hands, darker than hers, arranging fragments" do double work. Minor artifacts cluster in the reflection passages: "understood her motivation clearly now, burning like the desert sun" and "searing focus" repeat intensity without fresh embodiment. The template phrase "Maya felt X, sharp as broken glass" appears alongside "searing" modifiers in adjacent paragraphs, creating mild filter-verb stacking in peak beats. The final paragraph's "cargo of remembrance through endless sky" edges toward purple. These issues do not touch the closure beat directly but accumulate to −0.7 within the category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of retrocognitive trap, encrypted musical cipher, and beach-debris messaging offers a specific, non-obvious premise. The historical setting (1952 sharecropper organizing) grounds familiar resistance material in concrete detail: the sheriff's daughter asking unanswerable questions provides a fresh inflection on conversion narrative. The floating library as archive vessel and the obsidian lagoon as hidden meeting place both transform stock elements through physical specificity. The piece commits fully to its conceit—the encryption-as-consciousness-preservation—and follows its implications without retreat. Risk-taking in nested time structure and the diary-as-trap device heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maya's archival role frames her initial restraint and her final decision to decode everything and name the protected. Her choice to convince the captain to descend, her kneeling in the black sand, and her compulsion to arrange debris all stem from her character. The transformation from "solemn keeper" to "voice for encrypted voices" is earned causally by the retrocognitive experience and drives the closure beat where she works with "searing focus." Present in setup, middle choice (descending to the lagoon), and payoff (committing to full testimony).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon appears in the coordinate discovery, anchors the retrocognitive trap when Maya touches the black sand, and charges the final debris-message moment. Its geological specificity—"volcanic glass pooled in the desert's secret hollow"—makes it irreplaceable as both hidden meeting place and memory trigger. The black sand returns in the closure when Maya collapses and then arranges her own message. Three distinct beats; causal role in triggering the trap and enabling the final testimony gesture.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The encrypted diary drives Maya's search, triggers the retrocognitive trap through complete decoding, and shapes her final commitment to translate everything and name the protected. The substitution cipher (letters mapped to musical notes) provides specific constraint and explains why the consciousness was preserved. The diary appears in setup (letters reference it), development (decoding causes the trap), and payoff (final pages remain unfinished, prompting her testimony work). Removing it would collapse the causality; the encryption method is integral to the trap mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The retrocognitive trap confines Maya inside Elijah's consciousness from dawn to sunset, forcing her to witness the parley and absorb its stakes. The constraint is specific: "tried to pull away but remained locked," creating visible cost (terror, loss of control). It enables her transformation by making the historical struggle visceral rather than archival. Present in middle development (the trap itself) and shapes the ending (her compulsion to testify stems from the lived experience). The specificity of the mechanism—encrypted diary as consciousness vessel—makes it less swappable than a generic vision, but it arrives after the first third and functions primarily in one extended beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The parley occupies the center of the retrocognitive experience and provides the moral complexity (sheriff's conditional offer, sharecroppers' skepticism, Elijah's acceptance of partial progress) that reweights Maya's understanding of the archive's stakes. It demonstrates why Elijah encrypted the encounter and establishes the fragile alliance that makes testimony both dangerous and essential. The negotiation beats advance the thematic question about cracks in walls versus full justice. Present in development; its terms shape Maya's final commitment to name everyone. However, it remains somewhat embedded within the larger retrocognitive trap rather than creating a distinct structural turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elijah arranges driftwood and shells into "PARLEY SUNSET TERMS UNCHANGED" in the 1952 sequence, teaching the method on the page. Maya instinctively replicates the technique in the present, arranging debris into "WITNESS TESTIFY REMEMBER" after emerging from the trap. The method appears in two distinct beats and directly links past and present communication strategies, making it causally essential to the closure gesture. The specificity (beach debris as covert messaging) is irreplaceable and constrains the lagoon setting. Early signal, middle use, payoff participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The floating library frames Maya's isolation and provides her workspace, grounding her professional identity as archivist. "Navigation room converted to archives" and "pressurized cases of fragile histories" offer specific detail. The zeppelin enables the descent to the lagoon (she must convince the captain) and returns in the final image as the vessel carrying testimony "through endless sky." However, the library functions more as professional context than active constraint; Maya's choices are not meaningfully altered by the zeppelin's properties. Present in setup and closure image, but the middle action occurs at the lagoon.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "three weeks before Maya opened them" establishes delay and signals the letters' patience. The retrocognitive trap unfolds from sunset to dawn, providing a concrete duration that traps Maya and forces full witness. Her decade aboard the zeppelin anchors her expertise. The final sequence ("Back on the zeppelin, Maya opened the encrypted diary's final pages") marks a decisive after-state. Time shapes the trap's constraint but does not tighten further decisions; the historical 1952 setting matters more than the present-day clock. Present across beats but functions more as frame than escalating pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maya's desire to uncover truth is established early ("traced the coordinates," "catalogued thousands of documents") and tested by the retrocognitive trap, which transforms abstract archival distance into visceral witness. The friction between professional solemnity and the searing compulsion to testify creates genuine tension. Her final choice—to decode everything and name the protected—dramatizes the motivation through action (fingers tracing notes, writing supplementary documentation) with visible cost (loss of detachment). The phrase "truth in tension" is slightly abstract but the on-page moves ground it in conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Tone blends the cool precision of archive work ("pressurized cases of fragile histories") with the visceral intensity of the retrocognitive experience ("memory seized her like a fist"). The register modulates under pressure: clinical detail in the opening, embodied fear during the parley, and charged commitment in the closure. "Searing" recurs purposefully to mark the shift from solemn observation to burning witness. The final image—translating musical notes while the library drifts—sustains the reverie mode through concrete action rather than abstraction. Tone charges the ending effectively, though some phrases ("cargo of remembrance") edge toward elevation.</comment>
