<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to "defragment himself" and seek wisdom is clear, and the heartbeat counting establishes a concrete behavioral anchor. However, the near-death experience itself remains abstract—we get exposition about "scattered pieces" but little dramatized internal contradiction during the observatory scene. The grandmother's appearance in the ink provides emotional weight, but Marcus's response is more receptive than conflicted; the final "stopped counting" moment reads as an epiphany granted rather than a choice earned through competing impulses acting simultaneously on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (Marcus in the observatory, three hours waiting, midnight). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: heartbeat counting → ink ritual → grandmother's pattern → stopping the count. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: he stops counting, accepts "beautiful brokenness"), and the cost is legible—he relinquishes the anchor that kept him tethered post-trauma. However, the escalation is thin; most of the middle is reflection and description rather than a meaningful tightening of options. The ink-spilling beat arrives late and resolves quickly without prior friction or a narrowing choice that would deepen the stakes under accumulative pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The opal observatory, snow, moonlight, and radio telescope are vivid and atmosphere-rich. The opal floor serves as the functional surface for the ink ritual, directly enabling the climactic vision, which meets the constraint test. Sensory detail is selective and mood-consistent (cold glass, mechanical hum, ink catching light). The setting does not evolve or exert pressure on Marcus's choices—he could perform this ritual almost anywhere with a reflective floor—but the specificity and the floor's role in the final image lift this into solid mid-7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding coherence after a death-certificate error—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure, however, remains largely internal and static: Marcus waits, reflects, pours ink, watches. The ink vision provides a deepening (grandmother's life reweights his own), but it arrives as revelation rather than a choice Marcus makes under opposition. There is no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options; the protagonist is passive recipient. The cost at closure (letting go of the counting anchor) is present but not tested by prior conflict, so escalation is weak under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—life and death as ephemeral, overlapping states rather than fixed borders—emerges organically from the ink mandala, the corrected certificate, and the heartbeat ritual. The porcelain shard and ink pattern work as motifs that return with reweighted meaning at closure. However, the final paragraph edges toward over-articulation: "The correction on his death certificate hadn't been an administrative error. It had been life's rough draft..." This moment risks thematic echo, stating the insight rather than letting the image do the work. The story avoids a neat moral but flirts with summarizing its own subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Marcus; no head-hopping. The voice has a distinct lyric texture ("opal observatory sat frozen," "prayer of each beat"), and diction is elevated but consistent. Psychic distance is controlled, though the narrator occasionally drifts toward essayistic register ("Death hadn't failed him by taking him too soon, then changing its mind" reads more writerly than Marcus-specific). Free indirect style is mostly clean, but some lines ("Digital ghost, Dr. Chen had said") insert exposition that pulls away from immediate perception. The prose is polished but not quite character-particular under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and imagery is vivid ("pearl in the throat of winter," "liquid geometry"). However, several beats loop or paraphrase: the opening paragraph describes the observatory, then the second restates "waiting three hours in the midnight darkness, counting heartbeats, waiting for clarity." The reflection on defragmentation and the teacup shard as "bridge" versus "talisman of endings" recycles the same conceptual ground. Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. "Ephemeral patterns, fractals blooming and dissolving" and "mathematics of love translated into liquid geometry" stack metaphors in quick succession. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, but the cumulative paraphrase and decorative layering reduce propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The death-certificate-error premise is unusual, and combining it with an ink-scrying ritual in an observatory offers fresh specifics. However, the emotional arc—traumatized person seeks meaning through symbolic gesture and finds acceptance—follows a familiar template. The grandmother's appearance as "pattern" rather than hallucination is a nice touch, but the resolution (stop counting, accept brokenness) arrives without surprising inflection. The ink and porcelain shard feel chosen for their symbolic resonance rather than arising inevitably from Marcus's character or occupation. Mid-band: functional originality, not yet transformed into something irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Marcus (death certificate error survivor) is on the page and his backstory frames the quest for meaning. However, his choices are minimal: he decides to visit the observatory and pour ink, but these are preparatory rather than turning-point decisions. The ink vision happens to him; he receives wisdom rather than wrestling for it. Setup is early, but middle development (choice under pressure) and causal closure participation are weak. He stops counting at the end, but that choice is not shown as difficult or costly in the moment—it's presented as natural release.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The porcelain shard appears early (setup), is handled in reflection (bridge vs. talisman), and returns at closure when Marcus places it in the ink mandala, where it darkens and becomes "part of the pattern." Three beats, plus charged closure reprise. The shard's symbolic weight is clear, but its causal role is passive—it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic. The ending image reweights it from heirloom to integrated loss, which earns closure linkage. All three gates present; specificity and closure lift it above mid-band, but lack of causal pressure or visible cost tied to the shard itself caps it here.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Digital ghost" is mentioned once in dialogue/exposition ("Dr. Chen had said of the phenomenon") and the grandmother's appearance in ink arguably embodies the concept. However, the phrase itself does no causal work and is not returned to. The vision could be described as memory, pattern, or hallucination—"digital ghost" does not shape the mechanics or stakes. Present but ornamental; functional gate weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Heartbeat counting is present throughout: opening ("three hundred forty-seven, three hundred forty-eight"), middle ("four thousand and twelve beats"), and ending ("five thousand one, five thousand two" then stops). It anchors Marcus's psychology and provides the specific detail that makes his post-trauma state concrete. The counting enables no on-page choice and constrains no tactic—it's a symptom, not a lever. The ending hinges on stopping, but that moment is presented as relief rather than a trade-off with visible cost. Setup and payoff present; development (choice enabled/constrained) absent. Lyric resonance (first → last with reweighting) qualifies for mid-5s under the allowance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Defragment" appears as Marcus's stated goal ("come to defragment himself") and in the grandmother's life vision ("watched her life defragment before him") and closure ("finally defragmented"). The metaphor frames the quest and returns at the end. However, the action of defragmenting is not dramatized—Marcus does not sort pieces or make ordering choices on the page. The ink ritual is the method; "defragment" is the thematic label for what he seeks. Present across beats but more conceptual than actional; no moment where Marcus chooses how to defragment or what order to impose. Mid-band for thematic throughline without causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Spilled ink is signaled early ("bottle of black ink," "chaos magic," "to fetch wisdom from failure"), executed in the middle ("ink splashed across the polished opal, spreading in ephemeral patterns"), and shapes the climax (grandmother's face in the mandala, shard absorbing ink). The mechanics matter: ink on opal catches light, creates shifting geometry, enables the vision. Three beats; the method directly produces the closure image. Causal pressure is moderate—Marcus chooses to pour, but the vision is not earned through his struggle with the method. Strong setup, development, and closure linkage; lacks the cost or irreplaceability (salt, paint, or water might substitute) for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The opal observatory under snow is established early (opening image, "frozen under fresh snow," "dome catching moonlight," "old radio telescope") and provides the physical stage for the ink ritual (opal floor is necessary for the vision's reflective effect). The snow and cold anchor atmosphere throughout. The setting enables the ritual but does not constrain Marcus's choice or exert tactical pressure—he could wait elsewhere. Closure image ("Outside, snow continued falling") reprises the frame. Setup, development (floor enables method), and closure reprise all present; lacks the pressure or cost linkage for higher bands, but solid integration across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the radio static clears" appears in exposition ("they always said at the observatory") and again late ("After the static, always, came the song of distant stars"). The timeframe is vague: Marcus has waited three hours, and the radio crackles once, but the static clearing does not tighten decisions or tactics. The phrase frames the mood (waiting for clarity) but does not function as a live clock. Present as thematic motif; minimal causal or pressure role. Setup weak (second-hand saying), development absent, closure reprise present but passive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To fetch wisdom from failure" is stated early ("his therapist called it chaos magic. Marcus called it the only method that made sense anymore—to fetch wisdom from failure, you had to let failure teach you its language"). The grandmother's life vision delivers lessons from her failures, and Marcus's realization about the death certificate as "rough draft" arguably fulfills the goal. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicting choices. Marcus does not wrestle with competing desires or face friction between wanting wisdom and fearing what it costs. Setup clear, thematic payoff present, but no on-page friction or visible cost tied to the pursuit itself. Mid-6s for throughline without embodied conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Midnight solace" is not named, but the tone is coherent throughout: quiet, meditative, elegiac. "Midnight" appears literally ("three hours in the midnight darkness," "The midnight offered its solace"), and the closing image ("Marcus listened, finally still, finally defragmented, finally whole in his beautiful brokenness") embodies solace. Tone modulates subtly from anxious counting (opening) to receptive stillness (ending) without breaking the nocturnal, contemplative register. The final lines charge the tone with earned peace. Strong setup, consistent development, and closure resonance; tone is essential to the story's effect and would fail without this exact register.</comment>
