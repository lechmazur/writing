<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and her curiosity drives investigation, but her transformation feels rapid—going from months of silent doubt to confident confrontation in one conversation without visible struggle. Viktor's confession through tickets shows character-particular expression. Elena remains functional but thin. The final choice to "walk upstairs toward morning" reads more as collective resolution than individual cost paid on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with Situational pressure. Closure lands via Viktor's gathered confession and the trio's decision to pursue transparency, creating a before/after with felt social cost (resignation, institutional exposure). Orientation anchors quickly (Mira, forecourt, night shift). The eavesdropping discovery creates a meaningful tightening that narrows options. Cost is present but somewhat diffuse—Viktor will resign and face consequences, stated rather than viscerally dramatized in the closure beat itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt and glass chimes establish atmospheric specificity early and return at closure ("chimes sang their endless song"). The projector lens becomes a concrete investigative tool. Spatial choreography (pavilion → booth → archive stairs) remains clear. The rain-washed tiles as "scattered evidence" charges the final image purposefully. Minor: occupational systems (registrar duties, archive work) are gestured at but not pressure-tested.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: institutional truth versus complicit silence, signaled through Mira's months of suspicious inaction. The eavesdropping moment tightens pressure and Viktor's confession forces a decision. Mira's agency—choosing to speak and witness—forecloses her prior passivity with stated cost ("no more silence"). The escalation is meaningful but the final beat leans on collective intention ("together… toward accountability") rather than a single high-cost trade-off dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (transparency thaws mistrust) emerges from Viktor's cryptic honesty and Mira's parallel silence, but "Transparency thaws mistrust. No more silence" in dialogue verges on thesis statement. The ticket-as-confession motif recurs with purpose. The closing image of tiles as "scattered evidence" offers non-literal resonance. Weakness: the final paragraph's "words became unnecessary and only actions remained" reads as overt thematic wrap rather than earned from scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV (Mira) with stable distance. Voice carries atmospheric texture ("resonant hush," "translucent tiles") and perceptual bias (she finds beauty in the tickets before learning their meaning). Dialogue pursues goals and carries subtext, especially Viktor's admission. Minor slips: "ambiguously clear" appears twice as descriptor, and Elena's speech feels slightly generic. Diction remains consistent under pressure with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Weakness: "ambiguously clear" phrase recycled verbatim; "sacred silence" / "resonant hush" / "clean, rain-washed night" trend toward stock atmospheric phrases. The final paragraph's layered abstractions ("toward morning, toward accountability, toward whatever came after words became unnecessary") loop conceptually without adding concrete propulsion. No major loops or filter-verb stacks, but figurative language clusters in opening and closing without all earning fresh charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cryptic-ticket confession and institutional-fraud frame combine functional elements, but the core arc (silent observer finds evidence, confronts wrongdoer, pledges transparency) follows a familiar whistle-blower template. The "doodles as honesty" angle adds specificity. Risk is modest—no bold structural or moral ambiguity that complicates the transparency-versus-silence binary. Transformation test: the emotional shape would hold with a different institution and medium of confession.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira (quiet night registrar) drives investigation, eavesdrops, and makes the final confrontation choice. Present in setup, middle discovery, and closure. Her decision to "speak plainly" alters the outcome. Slight limitation: her observer role means Viktor's agency competes for narrative weight at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lens from projector appears twice: found beneath third ticket (clue anchor) and carried to archive to explain attendance discrepancy. Functional in middle beat but not causally indispensable—the mismatch could be discovered via any ledger. No reweighted meaning at closure; it enables Mira's realization but does not charge the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Freed by honesty" shapes stakes (Viktor's confession liberates both himself and Mira from paralysis) and is dramatized in the archive confrontation. Present thematically throughout. Mira's line "your honesty freed me from that paralysis" makes it explicit. Weakness: the concept is told more than enacted through a high-cost on-page choice at closure; the decision to act remains stated intention.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Ambiguously clear" is named twice (ticket drawings, Viktor's self-description) and thematically apt, but it functions as label rather than a trait constraining action. The doodles' dual nature (art/evidence) is described; no moment where ambiguity itself forces a visible trade-off or enables a tactic under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Eavesdropping is the inciting turn: Mira's decision to descend the stairs and push the door open converts suspicion into confrontation and drives the climax. Signaled early, used in the key middle beat, and its consequences dominate closure. Swapping it for another discovery method (e.g., intercepting a letter) would require restructuring the spatial and emotional arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through cryptic doodles on concert tickets" is signaled early (first ticket near fountain), recurs across four finds, and Viktor's explanation that "doodles are the only honest thing I can make" integrates the method into his characterization. The mechanics matter: visual symbols replace verbal confession. Present in setup, middle, and closure (he gathers them). Slight cap: the doodles enable confession but do not shape resistance or tactical adaptation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Crystal whispering forecourt after rain establishes atmosphere and bookends the story (opening description, closing chimes and tile-reflection image). The rain and tiles return as metaphor ("scattered evidence"). Does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; functions as lyric frame. Micro-setting: the archive stairs and door enable eavesdropping spatially but that work belongs to Action (9E).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" appears in opening (framing Mira's shift arrival) and closing ("after words became unnecessary and only actions remained"). Thematic reprise but no ticking clock or temporal pressure that tightens decisions. The timeframe is atmospheric descriptor, not a constraint that alters moves or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To thaw mistrust with transparency" motivates Mira's final confrontation and Viktor's confession. Desire is dramatized: Mira admits months of silent doubt, Viktor explains his ticket campaign. Friction exists (fear of judgment, institutional cover-up risk). Weakness: the resolution is collective declaration ("no more silence") rather than a single high-cost choice that tests competing wants on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" is established early ("sacred silence," "quiet night," "soft musical tones") and sustained through discovery and confrontation without melodrama. Modulates subtly: curiosity → tension → confession gravity. The closing image ("crystal chimes sang their endless song") charges the tone at closure. Coherent and purposeful throughout, supporting rather than overshadowing pressure.</comment>
