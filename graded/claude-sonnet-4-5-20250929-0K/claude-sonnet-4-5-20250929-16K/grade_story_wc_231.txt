<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margit's interior life is specific and embodied—weathered fingers, her method of "observing gaps," her lighthouse-keeper pragmatism. The borrowed memories create authentic contradictions (Swedish grandmother vs. strudel memory) that she processes through action. Ernst's arc from technical success to recognizing memories as "ghosts" carries weight, though his final gesture is more explained than earned through on-page struggle. The closing choice to release the flower shows visible cost, but Margit's shift from burden to lightness arrives quickly without friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly: Margit at the opal dock, three days post-discovery, at nautical twilight. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: each borrowed memory deepens the weight until the final release reconfigures meaning. Closure lands on-page with visible cost—Margit releases the flower and the memories leave her, replaced by her own solitude now "lighter." The causal path from discovery to investigation to understanding to release holds, though Ernst's backstory arrives via memory-dump rather than dramatized resistance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, and nautical twilight create coherent atmosphere and the lighthouse beam functions as a recurring anchor. Spatial choreography is clear: dock length, where the body floated, the water's edge. The flower's "crystalline structure" and "silicate compounds" provide plausible SF grounding for memory storage. The final image—boutonnière floating then sinking—charges the ending, making the setting micro-choice functional, though the broader Norwegian coast remains lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the stranger's final gesture—signals early and tightens through the investigation. Margit's choice to release the flower forecloses preservation, with visible cost: the borrowed memories vanish immediately. The pressure is more contemplative than agonistic, fitting the Accumulative lens, and the gaps she observes (birthday ending mid-song, proposal without answer) create meaningful friction. Ernst's weighted pockets and the pinned flower outside establish agency in his final act, and Margit's responsive release carries reciprocal weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the Edelweiss as both preservation technology and "museum of grief," memories as ghosts that "deepen isolation," the permission to let go. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing—some things aren't meant to persist—and the lighthouse beam "cutting softly, persistently" provides non-literal counterpoint. The strudel's "profound sadness" and Ernst's realization that "preserved memories weren't preservation at all" avoid abstraction by anchoring in his daughter's funeral and his research failure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Margit's POV is stable and her perceptual signature—"observing gaps," "spaces between what was said and unsaid"—remains consistent and character-specific. The prose modulates appropriately between present observation and borrowed memory. One friction: Ernst's backstory arrives in a single dense memory-block that shifts into summary mode ("He'd developed a neural interface technology…") rather than fragmented perception. The filter "felt like his life" is acceptable voice-anchoring, and psychic distance remains controlled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Information density is high: "that liminal hour when sea and sky merged" establishes time and atmosphere economically. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (memories "like waves wearing down stone") stays coherent. Minor scaffold detected: "The borrowed memories would die with the flower, and perhaps that was the point" verges on thematic summary. The closing "cutting softly, persistently through the gathering dark" balances literal and emotional registers cleanly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; clarity holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—memory-storage technology meets grief and the choice not to preserve—feels specific rather than template. The Edelweiss as silicate data-storage is a fresh SF detail, and "witnessed isolation" as Ernst's reason for this remote coast adds a non-obvious angle. The borrowed-memory mechanism risks familiarity (Black Mirror territory), but the piece transforms it through Margit's pragmatic lens and the decision to release rather than keep. The "museum of his own grief" line is strong; the final permission-to-let-go theme, while earned, trends toward safer philosophical ground.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Margit is present throughout and her choice to release the flower drives closure. Her "eccentric" quality reads as competence and method (observing gaps, twenty-seven years of lighthouse-keeping) rather than quirk. She makes two key choices: to investigate (enabling the memory discovery) and to release (the closure beat). The eccentricity itself—her way of processing the mystery—enables the investigation but could be more visibly constraining or costly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Edelweiss appears in the opening paragraph (clutched in her fingers), is handled when she presses it to her temple for memory access, recurs as the white flower "bright against his dark coat" in Ernst's memory, and is physically released in the closure beat where it floats then sinks. Its dual properties—Alpine funeral flower and crystalline data storage—drive both the mystery and the thematic weight. Removing it would collapse the story's logic and symbolic charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Borrowed memories shape every major beat: they compel Margit to investigate, they reveal Ernst's backstory and motive, and their vanishing upon release constitutes the felt cost at closure. The concept constrains tactics (she must press the flower to access memories) and changes options (understanding lets her choose release). The memories' "edges" and gaps create the investigation method. The mechanics are signaled early and remain consistent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" is applied to the memories ("softly persistent, like waves wearing down stone") and shapes Margit's sustained investigation rather than immediate reaction. The trait enables her patient decoding rather than frantic action, fitting her lighthouse-keeper temperament. It appears in one strong image and implicitly governs pacing, but does not visibly constrain a choice with cost—Margit's release is decisive, not gradual.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Investigation structures the entire middle: Margit returns to the dock, replays memories for their edges, walks the dock's length studying tide and body position, and decodes Ernst's final gesture. The action enables all major discoveries (the birthday ending abruptly, the funeral origin, Ernst's motive). Removing "investigate" would require replacing the protagonist's agency with passive receipt. The method—observing gaps—makes the investigation specific rather than generic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Observing gaps" is signaled early ("Margit approached the problem as she approached everything—by observing gaps") and demonstrated in the next paragraph: she notes what the harbor police didn't ask, what the memories omit, how the birthday ends mid-song and the proposal contains no answer. The method shapes her discovery of Ernst's motive and differentiates her from generic investigation. It appears in two distinct beats (initial framing, memory analysis) and enables the thematic insight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The opal dock is the site of discovery, the return investigation, and the final release—three functional beats. "Opal" and "mist" create specific atmosphere that supports the "witnessed isolation" tone. The dock's physical details (tide state, where the body floated, floating the flower) affect choices and anchor the closure image. Swapping it for a generic shore would diminish the gem-like, liminal quality that charges the ending, though the constraint is more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Nautical twilight—"that liminal hour when sea and sky merged"—is anchored in the opening and recurs in Ernst's memory ("twilight identical to this one"). The liminal quality supports theme (boundaries dissolving, transition) and the "gathering dark" closes the piece. Time does not create urgent pressure or tighten decisions on the page; it functions more as atmospheric frame and thematic echo than as a live clock altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation to decode Ernst's final gesture is stated early ("compelled by a need to decode this stranger's final gesture") and drives every action: returning to the dock, analyzing memory gaps, seeking the reason for the Edelweiss. The desire encounters friction in the "peculiar burden" of borrowed memories and the "profound sadness" they carry. The final release—decoding as "permission to let go"—resolves the stated motive with visible cost (loss of the memories). The want/need friction is understated but present.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Witnessed isolation" is embedded throughout: Margit alone at the dock, Ernst's choice of "this remote place specifically for its witnessed isolation—the lighthouse keeper who would find him," the "indifferent sea," and Margit's solitude feeling "lighter now." The tone modulates from the opening mist and burden through investigative focus to the quiet release, remaining coherent. The lighthouse beam "cutting softly, persistently" charges the final image with the exact tone. The modulation supports rather than disrupts pressure.</comment>
