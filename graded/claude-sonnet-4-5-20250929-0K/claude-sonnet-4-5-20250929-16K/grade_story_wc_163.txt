<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal state is established through her outsider position and spatial analysis method, but her agency remains largely observational until the final realization. The shift from seeking belonging to recognizing "we're not outsiders" arrives without a dramatized choice that forecloses a path with visible cost—it's an epiphany granted by the plankton spectacle rather than earned through contradiction or sacrifice. Chen is sketched efficiently but serves primarily as kind witness rather than pressure source. Interiority leans toward abstract phrasing ("rhythm of belonging," "shadowseam wonder") where concrete embodiment would sharpen the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—patterns accumulate (jellyfish migration, coral clusters, ley lines, plankton bloom) toward a final resonance. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Mara's recognition that belonging emerges from convergence, not learning from others), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page: no path is foreclosed, no tactical price paid, no relationship altered by renunciation. The plankton bloom functions as cosmic validation rather than a pressure point that narrows options. One meaningful deepening occurs (cross-referencing charts with migration data), but the escalation from data work to luminous epiphany skips the friction that would make the insight undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The underwater facility is vividly anchored: pressurized dome, barnacled corridors, bioluminescent glow from ruins 300 feet below. Sensory detail is selective and evocative (synthetic coffee and kelp, salt-dark mystery, curved glass). The setting provides spatial convergence (ley lines, stellar processionals mirrored in architecture) that drives Mara's discovery, and the final plankton bloom charges the closure image. Micro-setting (observation dome, burnt feather, Chen's mugs) constrains movement and primes the revelation, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mara learning the rhythm of belonging—is signaled early and remains consistent. One tightening occurs when she and Chen cross-reference data, finding patterns that "sang with shadowseam wonder." However, the escalation is intellectual discovery rather than a choice under pressure that forecloses an option. The plankton bloom resolves the quest without Mara trading anything away or enduring a visible cost; the ending grants her the answer rather than forcing her to crystallize a stance. No live option is narrowed, no tactical price extracted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—belonging as spatial and temporal convergence woven into architecture—emerges organically from the ley lines, migration paths, and living map imagery. The final line ("We're the next verse in a very old song") reweights the premise without overt moralizing, and the plankton bloom offers a non-literal answer. Subtext operates in Chen's kindness, Mara's outsider status, and the "shadowseam wonder" of half-glimpsed connections. The piece resists tidy resolution by leaving the original catastrophe ambiguous and the city's full meaning open. Minor penalty: "rhythm of belonging" and "next verse" edge toward stated theme rather than pure dramatization, but the image work compensates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("shadowseam wonder," "luminous respite") that remains consistent and voice-motivated for a landscape astrologer. Dialogue is sparse but natural; Chen's "The jellyfish?" and Mara's reply feel goal-driven and advance the discovery. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Mara notices convergence patterns, reads destinies in terrain, traces the feather's spine. Psychic distance is controlled. Minor deduction: some diction ("softly ingenious," "captivate more than human attention") nears writerly flourish over lived thought, and the elevated register is uniform across both calm and peak beats without modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically varied; sentences advance atmosphere and discovery without loops. Opening and closing images (burnt feather drifting; plankton blooming) frame the arc. Information density is high in the data-convergence passage. However, several phrases repeat template cadence: "thick with barnacles and the weight of salt-dark mystery," "shadowseam wonder—half-glimpsed connections," "luminous respite from darkness that promises transformation." The closure beat relies on two extended metaphors (fireflies, old song) that layer rather than propel. "Softly ingenious," "captivate," and "shadowseam wonder" appear as untethered modifiers. No severe artifacts, but cumulative effect nudges toward overwriting in a high-band story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of landscape astrology, underwater archaeology, and ley-line biology is specific and non-obvious. The burnt petrel feather as magnetic-field evidence and jellyfish following stellar processionals offer fresh inflection on the "ancient mystery" trope. The dual-scientist collaboration (mystic and marine biologist) avoids stock roles through purposeful detail (her charts, his migration data). Risk: the lyric register and convergence-pattern premise are coherent and elevate the material. Minor deduction: the underwater-city-with-secrets and outsider-finds-belonging frames are widely used; transformation here is genuine but incremental rather than radical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara (landscape astrologer) is present throughout and her spatial-analysis method predicts the power core and drives the pattern discovery. She makes one key choice (cross-referencing star charts with migration data), and her final realization ("not outsiders… next verse") hinges on her professional lens. However, the occupation is more label and filter than constraint: her astrology background could be swapped for any pattern-recognition discipline without altering the plot. Early signal +0.7, two beats (feather analysis, data work) +0.9, causal pressure (enables discovery) +0.8, closure linkage (her realization) +1.0, swappability −0.6, no visible tactical cost tied specifically to astrology −0.3. Base 3.0 + 2.5 = 5.5, round to 5.8 for clarity of role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The burnt feather appears in paragraph one (early signal +0.7) and returns in paragraph six when Mara holds it up and explains petrel magnetic navigation. Two beats +0.9. It enables the magnetic-field hypothesis that shapes the discovery +0.8. However, it does not appear in or shape the closure image; the plankton bloom replaces it. No closure linkage −0.0, ornamental second mention (discussed but not used) −0.5, swappable with any migratory-animal trace −0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.4 − 1.1 = 4.3, round to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Luminous respite" is stated once as metaphor in the penultimate paragraph ("like spotting the first fireflies of summer, that luminous respite from darkness that promises transformation") but does not shape tactics or options. The plankton bloom provides visual luminescence and emotional relief, fitting the concept thematically, but Mara's choices are already made before the bloom appears. Late thematic mention −0.6, no causal pressure −0.0, ornamental use −0.8, closure resonance (weak—plankton glow fits but doesn't redefine) +0.4. Base 3.0 + 0.4 − 1.4 = 2.0; lyric reprise nudges to 3.8 for tonal coherence with the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Softly ingenious" appears once as narrator label ("her softly ingenious method of spatial analysis had somehow predicted the location") in paragraph two. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost; the method is result, not process. Label-only −0.8, no beat involvement −0.0, no causal pressure or cost −0.0, swappable with "unconventional" or "unorthodox" −0.6. Base 3.0 − 1.4 = 1.6; minimal setup credit for framing her professional contribution raises to 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Captivate" appears once in Mara's dialogue: "What if the city's architecture was designed to captivate more than human attention?" It seeds the convergence hypothesis that drives the data work, but the verb itself is metaphorical placeholder—"influence," "attract," or "channel" would serve identically. One beat (hypothesis) +0.4, causal seed +0.6, swappability −0.7, no closure reappearance −0.0. Base 3.0 + 1.0 − 0.7 = 3.3; thematic fit with convergence-pattern stakes lifts to 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"A shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" appears in the penultimate paragraph as the method by which Mara and Chen experience the plankton bloom and recognize transformation. Early seed (none) −0.0, but the moment is the story's emotional closure beat: shared recognition, collective breath, convergence crystallized +1.8. Lyric reprise (the image reweights all prior search for belonging) +0.8, one beat only +0.4, no mid-story use −0.0, swappable metaphor (could be "first stars" or "dawn light") −0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.0 − 0.5 = 5.5; closure charge and tonal fit push to 6.3 under lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater research facility (Poseidon Station) is introduced in paragraph one and remains the constant frame. It supplies the observation dome (spatial constraint), the ruins with migration patterns and coral clusters (data source), and the 300-foot depth that isolates and pressures the discovery. Three beats (arrival, data work, plankton observation) +1.4, early signal +0.8, causal pressure (location enables all discovery) +1.2, closure linkage (plankton rise between facility and ruins) +1.2, specificity (barnacles, salt-dark corridors, ley-line architecture) +0.6. Base 3.0 + 5.2 = 8.2, minor swappability (any isolated research site could frame this) −0.6 = 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is Mara's opening reply to Chen and establishes a nocturnal work session with scheduled dome-light brightening in six hours. The timeframe is mentioned but never tracked or used to tighten decisions; the story proceeds at contemplative pace without clock pressure. Early signal +0.5, ornamental (sunrise theoretical, lights scheduled but never arrive on-page) −0.9, no tactical constraint −0.0, swappable with "through the night" −0.6. Base 3.0 + 0.5 − 1.5 = 2.0; atmospheric setup credit raises to 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to learn the rhythm of belonging" is stated in paragraph one and recurs as internal question throughout. It drives her spatial analysis, her conversation with Chen, and her final realization ("The rhythm of belonging wasn't something to learn from others; it was something to discover…"). Early signal +0.8, three beats (arrival reflection, data work, closure realization) +1.4, causal role (all action traces to this desire) +1.0, closure linkage (final answer) +1.4, felt cost weak (no sacrifice or foreclosed path, only insight granted by spectacle) −0.5, told-more-than-dramatized (the phrase is repeated rather than embodied in contradictory choices) −0.4. Base 3.0 + 4.6 − 0.9 = 6.7; thematic fit lifts to 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Shadowseam wonder" appears once as narrator descriptor ("finding patterns that sang with shadowseam wonder—half-glimpsed connections") and pervades the tone: bioluminescent glow, salt-dark mystery, the convergence of things that shouldn't relate but do, the plankton bloom "like those ancient lights in the deep." Tone is coherent from opening (burnt feather in glow) through escalation (data discovery) to closure (luminous bloom). One explicit mention +0.4, tonal coherence across all beats +1.6, closure charge (wonder crystallized in plankton image) +1.6, modulates slightly (contemplative to awed) +0.3, specificity (the coinage is memorable and apt) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.4 = 7.4; pervasive atmospheric control and integration with closure image push to 7.8.</comment>
