<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The potter's interiority is consistent and craft-centered, though her zen-mindedness is more asserted than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "understanding" arrives through observation rather than struggle—"she understood now with sharp gentleness"—which reads closer to epiphany than earned revelation. The motivation to understand why places resist change drives the journey but never faces a contradictory want or fear that would deepen agency. Embodied emotion is present ("she breathed slowly, centering herself") but remains calm throughout; no degradation under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (potter, oasis, evening, three-week journey complete). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: layered timelines build density through observation until the final weeks when the potter adds her own "layer of care." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (adding a timeline through tending) with conceptual cost visible in her changed understanding ("her pottery, too, would resist time…through the attention baked into every curve"). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "the oasis grew toward care itself"; the ending reweights prior material cleanly under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The oasis is anchored concretely: twelve hives, stone well, three olive trees, cracked earth. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—chimney smoke flattening, light through the lantern glass casting prismed colors—and filtered through the potter's craft-oriented perception. The lantern glass functions as micro-setting/tool, constraining her method of seeing the fractured timelines and later used to cast light across the hives. The environment charges the final image: her pottery will resist time through attention, mirroring the oasis's survival through layered care.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why places resist entropy—is signaled early and pursued through observation and tending. One meaningful tightening occurs when the potter notices the trees lean toward kindness rather than sun, shifting her tactics from passive observation to active care (clearing debris, speaking to the space, filling the lantern glass). Agency is enacted through attention and ritual rather than confrontation; by the seventh evening the thrumming grows louder, confirming her approach. The cost is conceptual and relational (leaving "something of herself behind—another timeline"), legible in the final image of walking differently and understanding her own craft anew.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: places (and objects) resist time through layered care, through being held in multiple moments of attention. The lantern glass and olive trees function as recurring images that shift meaning—first tools of perception, then agents that respond to kindness. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "her pottery, too, would resist time not through hardness but through the attention baked into every curve." One slip: "sharp gentleness, the clarity that doesn't wound" edges toward abstract philosophizing rather than staying grounded in the potter's craft-specific perception.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through the potter's craft vocabulary ("well-thrown clay," "refusing the kiln of entropy," "the wheel's rhythm"). Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping. Voice modulates purposefully—compressed observations during discovery, slower cadence during tending. One weakness: "sharp gentleness" and "clarity that doesn't wound" drift toward elevated diction that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. The perceptual signature (seeing through craft metaphors, noting light and care) is consistent and distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance understanding or action. Two frictions: "fractured timelines layered like geological strata" and "thrummed at its own frequency" lean toward stock metaphor without fresh specificity. Minor paraphrase loop: "the oasis grew toward care itself, not mere light" and later "phototropic to kindness" restate the same insight. The final paragraph's "walked differently now" and "understanding that her pottery, too, would resist time" could be tighter. No loops touch the closure beat directly, so accumulation cap applies: −0.4 total.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of craft-practice (pottery/zen), speculative element (fractured timelines), and ecological devotion (tending an oasis) is specific and non-obvious. The reversal that places resist change through care rather than strength is earned through the potter's observations. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure succeeds; the piece commits fully to its premise without retreat into convenient plotting. One mild derivative note: the "attention as preservation" theme echoes common craft-meditation narratives, but the fractured-timeline frame and phototropic-to-kindness twist provide fresh angles.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The zen-minded potter is present throughout and makes key choices: to observe through the lantern glass (day three onward), to shift from observation to active tending (day three), to stay three more weeks. These choices alter her tactics and understanding, driving the accumulative closure. Setup is immediate; middle development shows her learning the pattern and changing approach; payoff is her transformed understanding of her own craft. Causal pressure is moderate—choices are contemplative rather than urgent. Swappability is low; the zen-craft lens is specific to this character.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The faded lantern glass appears in four beats: carried from the last village, used to see fractured timelines (day one), filled with well water and set where light passes through (ongoing), and carried away at the end. It enables her perception method, constrains her understanding to specific hours, and charges the closure by being both tool and symbol of attention. Setup is early (paragraph two); middle development shows repeated, evolving use; payoff is carrying it away as a reminder of layered care. Strong irreplaceability—its faded, old quality and light-refracting properties are load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fractured timelines are introduced early (paragraph three) and shape the potter's perception: she sees beekeeper, bees, and emptiness layered at different hours. This understanding changes her tactics—she fills the lantern glass at different times to reveal patterns. The concept is paid off in the closure: "that love had fractured time itself, creating redundancies of existence," and she adds "another timeline" by tending. Setup, middle (pattern discovery), and payoff (adding a layer) are all present. Moderate causal pressure; the concept enables rather than constrains. Some abstraction—could be more tactile.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Phototropic to kindness is discovered on day three and alters her tactics immediately: she begins speaking to the trees, clearing debris gently, explaining her actions. This realization drives the middle section and underpins the closure (care creates timelines). Setup is mid-story (day three, ~40% mark); development is strong (changes approach from observation to tending); payoff is thematic (her craft will resist time through attention). Late signal and moderate swappability (could be "responsive to care" without major edits) limit the score. Visible cost is conceptual rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Thrumming appears in three beats: bees thrumming with pollen (in one timeline, early), the thrumming grows louder on the seventh evening (confirming her approach), and the oasis "thrummed, held fast" in the final image. The action is both a sign of vitality and a measure of the overlapping timelines' strength. It does not drive a major turn but charges the closure and confirms the potter's understanding. Setup (bees), development (evening intensification), payoff (final image) are present. Moderate irreplaceability; "hum" or "vibration" could substitute with minor tonal shift.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Following sun patterns is signaled in the opening (she traveled "by following sun patterns") and returns twice: she finds the timeline pattern "by following sun patterns through the faded glass at different hours" (day six), and she leaves "by following sun patterns back." The method shapes her discovery tactics (checking dawn, noon, dusk) and bookends the journey. Setup is immediate; middle development shows the method in action; payoff is the return journey. Moderate causal pressure—it's her lens but not deeply constrained or costed. Swappability is moderate (time-of-day observation could work similarly).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis is anchored in the opening and recurs in every beat: twelve hives, stone well, olive trees, paths between hives, cracked earth. It supplies the mystery (why it persists) and resources (well water, the structure to tend). The setting drives the dominant stake, enables all her actions, and charges the closure (thrumming, held fast). Setup is immediate; development shows spatial choreography (walking paths, sitting by the well, clearing debris); payoff is the final image of the oasis held by accumulated kindness. High irreplaceability and strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "as chimney smoke flattens" appears in the opening and final paragraphs, bookending the story with an image of evening. Internal time markers are present (three weeks' travel, day three discovery, seventh evening thrumming, three more weeks of tending) but do not tighten decisions—time is expansive and contemplative rather than urgent. The element frames tone but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure. Setup and payoff are present; middle development is weak (time passes without narrowing options). The phrase itself is vivid but not load-bearing; "at dusk" would function similarly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation to understand why some places resist change is stated early ("she needed to understand why") and pursued throughout: observing through the glass, testing her hypothesis by tending, arriving at an answer (layered care creates redundancies of existence). The desire drives every scene beat and is paid off in the closure (understanding her own craft anew). Setup is immediate; development shows active inquiry; payoff is the realization and changed practice. One friction: the motivation is contemplative and faces no countervailing want or cost until the very end (leaving "something of herself behind"). Moderate dramatization of internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sharp gentleness is enacted throughout: "she spoke softly to no one," "cleared debris with careful hands, explaining what she was doing," "the clarity that doesn't wound." The tone modulates with pressure—compressed observations early, slower ritual in the middle, reflective synthesis at the end—and charges the final image of walking differently with understanding. Setup is implicit in voice from the opening; development shows the tone in action (tending with patience); payoff is the synthesis ("sharp gentleness, the clarity that doesn't wound"). One slip: the phrase "sharp gentleness" is stated rather than fully embodied in a peak moment, edging toward label.</comment>
