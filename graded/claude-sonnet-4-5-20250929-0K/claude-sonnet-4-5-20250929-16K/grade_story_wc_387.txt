<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Chen's interior life is consistent and grounded in concrete practice—mending nets, studying shadow patterns, observing fireflies—with embodied patience. Her motivation to teach the girl is rooted in character (she sees hidden patterns everywhere) and the final beat returns to net-mending with quiet resolve. However, no on-page choice alters her stance or forecloses a path with visible cost; she prepares to teach tomorrow, but the story does not dramatize a moment where contradictory impulses act or a decision narrows options. The work reads as contemplation awaiting an event rather than a character under pressure making a choice that costs something now.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is prompt (philosopher on parapet, rain, fireflies, night). The piece accumulates observations and reflections that orbit the concept of hidden patterns, building toward tomorrow's teaching moment. Closure unit: a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Chen returns to net-mending "ready to make strong what had been broken"—but the cost is not legible on the page; no option is foreclosed, no tactic altered, no visible price paid in the final image. The story teaches its pattern of patient observation and promises future action rather than delivering a present tightening or deepening that changes what Chen can or will do.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The whispering parapet after rain is vivid and purposeful: slick stone, moonlight pools, firefly currents, and the harbor below create a micro-setting that charges Chen's philosophy. The bamboo whisk's asymmetry and the nets' knotwork ground her method in tactile detail. Spatial choreography is clear (parapet, village below, harbor). The setting does not constrain a present choice but it charges the final image when Chen picks up the nets again, linking place to practice. Strong sensory economy with POV filter (she notices shadow maps and firefly constellations). Qualifies for the 9+ gate by charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Chen's preparation to teach the mayor's daughter about hidden patterns. The stake is signaled early but never tested on the page; the girl arrives tomorrow, so the entire piece is setup without a present tightening or deepening. No reversal, no narrowed option, no trade-off dramatized now. The whistled exchange and firefly observation accumulate texture but do not escalate pressure or force a choice. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful cadence shift is required; the return to net-mending offers continuity but not a visible reweighting of cost or options within this window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden patterns in disciplined effort emerges clearly through Chen's net-mending, the whisk's wear, firefly light, and the girl's temple equations. The bamboo whisk as teaching tool and the final image (nets, moon paths, fireflies) offer a resonant answer to "what is philosophy?"—it is work made visible. However, the final paragraph edges toward stating the thesis ("beautiful, hidden architecture of ordinary effort") rather than trusting the image alone. Subtext operates in the whistled code and Chen's request for this particular student. The piece resists a tidy moral but hovers close to articulating its own insight rather than letting it remain implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single POV, third limited, with a consistent perceptual signature: Chen notices knotwork, shadow maps, asymmetry, chemical mysteries. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("scintillatingly somber," "whispered tune," "demure but undeniable"). Register occasionally drifts toward expository phrasing ("everything she needed to teach," "the ability to see what others missed") that reads like helpful narration rather than Chen's lived thought. No dialogue on the page (whistling is code, not speech). Psychic distance is stable. Free indirect style is clean. The prose reflects Chen's patient, pattern-seeking mind with strong rhythmic control under the Accumulative frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. The piece avoids major loops, but a few phrases trend toward ornamental repetition: "hidden patterns" appears in setup, middle, and closure without added pressure each time; "scintillatingly somber" is used twice in near-identical phrasing (moonlight pools, fireflies against night) without transformation. "Everything was knotwork and tension, invisible effort made briefly visible" summarizes rather than showing a new instance. Minor template cadence in the teaching-plan paragraph ("if she saw... if she understood... then Chen would teach"). No grammar errors. Propulsion is steady but not urgent; the pacing fits the Accumulative mode. Overall clean with small texture drag in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—philosopher as net-mender observing hidden patterns—offers a fresh synthesis of manual labor and contemplation. The bamboo whisk as teaching object and the girl's temple-defacing equations are specific, non-obvious details. However, the emotional arc and thematic trajectory follow a familiar template: wise elder prepares to teach reluctant student; manual work contains profound wisdom; fireflies and moonlight illustrate the thesis. The transformation test flags moderate derivative pressure: swap names and setting, and the arc of "patient teacher waits to reveal truth through humble objects" remains largely unchanged. The piece executes its premise with care and specificity but does not take structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes beyond the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Net-mender philosopher: Present throughout (setup, middle, closure). Chen's role shapes her perceptual signature and her decision to request the student, but no on-page choice by Chen creates a key turn; she observes, reflects, and prepares. The final beat returns to net-mending, which reinforces identity but does not dramatize a decision that alters tactics or narrows options. Functional but swappable with "philosopher who practices any manual craft." Caps: missing middle development (no choice under pressure), missing closure participation (identity present but not causally active in the final image). Two gates → cap 4.6; further limited by swappability and observation-without-decision posture.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Bamboo tea whisk: Introduced early (second paragraph), studied in moonlight (middle beat creating shadow map), and planned as teaching tool for tomorrow. Three beats: introduction with teacher backstory, shadow-map study, and the hypothetical teaching sequence. However, the whisk does not constrain or enable a present choice; it is described and contemplated but not used in action. The shadow-map moment offers purposeful early-to-middle involvement. Closure linkage is absent—the final image returns to nets, not the whisk. Two gates (setup, middle development via shadow study); missing closure participation. Lyric resonance is present but does not reweight the dominant stake in the ending. Caps: missing closure participation → 2.8; middle beat lifts to ~5.4 within allowable band for two-gate integration with one beat involvement and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Hidden patterns: Core concept introduced early (Chen "realized mending nets and mending thoughts required identical attention to hidden patterns"). Shapes her perception throughout—moon paths, firefly currents, net weave, temple equations, whisk construction. The concept frames her motivation to teach and her method ("following moon paths, the silver trails"). Final image: "beautiful, hidden architecture of ordinary effort" restates the concept and links it to the closure action (net-mending). Three gates met. Causal pressure: the concept shapes Chen's request for the student and her planned teaching method. Closure linkage: present in the final paragraph. However, the concept is more thematic lens than on-page constraint; it does not narrow a present choice or impose a felt cost. Strong thematic integration with solid beat involvement and closure presence, but the concept remains observational rather than forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Scintillatingly somber: Used twice (moonlight pools, firefly light against deep night). Both instances are descriptive atmosphere, not trait-driven action. The attribute does not constrain or enable a choice, nor does it create a visible cost. It modulates tone but does not shape tactics or the protagonist's agency. Present in setup and middle, absent from the explicit closure beat. Two gates (setup, middle); missing closure participation. Ornamental use without causal pressure. Caps: missing closure participation → 2.8; middle atmosphere touch and tonal coherence lift slightly within band, but swappability (could use "quietly luminous" or similar with minor edits) and lack of cost connection hold the score low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Whistle: Chen whistles back to the fisherman in old code ("your labor is seen"), then whistles again at the end ("I am here, working"). Two beats, both involving the action. The whistle demonstrates Chen's philosophy (hidden communication, acknowledging unseen effort) and bookends the piece. However, no turn traces to the whistle; it could be swapped with another gesture of acknowledgment (a lantern signal, a hand sign) without structural impact. The action supports theme and tone but does not redefine options or force a choice. Two gates (middle, closure); setup is implicit (father taught her). Missing setup signal → −0.3. Functional thematic support with closure presence, but swappability and lack of causal pressure limit the score. Within 5.0–6.9 band for one key thematic turn, adjusted down for replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Following moon paths: Introduced in the middle third ("This was her method: following moon paths, the silver trails that revealed themselves only when you understood that light, like meaning, traveled in patterns"). Chen studies the whisk's shadow map by moonlight, which instantiates the method once. The method does not shape a present attempt or choice; it is explained and demonstrated via shadow observation but does not constrain tactics or enable a turn. Missing setup (introduced late, past the 25% mark). One beat (shadow study). Missing closure participation (final image focuses on net-mending and fireflies, not moon paths). Late introduction → cap 4.6; one beat involvement and thematic coherence lift slightly, but lack of causal mechanics and closure absence hold the score. Swappable with "following light patterns" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Whispering parapet after rain: Introduced in the opening line, described with concrete sensory detail (slick stone, moonlight pools, fireflies), and present throughout as Chen's workspace. The setting does not constrain a present choice but it charges the final image: "here, in between, a philosopher prepared... ready to make strong what had been broken." The parapet positions Chen spatially (above village, below moon) in a way that mirrors her philosophical stance between manual and abstract work. Three gates (setup, middle, closure). The setting supplies atmosphere and thematic resonance but does not alter tactics. Strong closure linkage and purposeful spatial positioning. Micro-setting (the body, the nets, the stone) qualifies for the gate test by charging the final image. Within 5.0–6.9 for one key turn via closure reprise; specificity and closure charge lift toward the upper bound.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Firefly season: Mentioned in the opening ("firefly season's first dancers") and fireflies appear throughout, creating visual motifs (cold light, invisible currents, constellations, chemical mysteries). The timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline; it provides atmospheric context. Chen's work and preparation are not time-pressured by the season. The fireflies function thematically (hidden effort made visible) rather than as a temporal constraint. Two gates (setup, middle atmosphere); closure mentions fireflies ("fireflies pulsed around her") but the season itself does not shape the final choice. Missing closure causal role. Functional atmosphere with thematic support, but time does not alter tactics or narrow options. Swappable with another seasonal marker. Cap for missing causal closure role; thematic coherence and multi-beat presence lift within the 3.0–4.9 functional band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>To appreciate hidden effort: Motivation introduced early (Chen mends nets "with the same patience she brought to unraveling life's questions" and later philosophizes about "hidden effort" accumulating in the world's fabric). The desire shapes her request for the student and her teaching plan. Final image: "the beautiful, hidden architecture of ordinary effort" and "ready to make strong what had been broken" tie the motivation to closure. Three gates. However, the motivation is not dramatized in a conflicted present choice; it is consistent and stable throughout, with no friction between want and cost. The story orbits the motivation thematically without testing it under pressure. Solid thematic integration and closure linkage, but lack of on-page friction and the told-rather-than-tested posture hold the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Demure audacity: The tone is signaled via the mayor's daughter ("her audacity demure but undeniable, writing truths on walls because no one would listen") and implicit in Chen's choice to mend nets on a parapet rather than seek glory. The tone modulates subtly—patient observation, quiet defiance, restrained confidence—and is present in the closure image (Chen working alone, unseen). Three gates (setup via the girl, middle via Chen's stance, closure via solitary work). However, the tone remains static rather than charging under pressure; there is no moment where demureness and audacity pull against each other in a choice. Coherent and purposeful, but the tone does not shift or intensify in a way that reweights the final image beyond continuity. Within 5.0–6.9 for shaping one key turn (the teaching decision), adjusted for lack of modulation under pressure.</comment>
