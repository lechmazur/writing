<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's physical response to honesty/dishonesty provides embodied characterization (leaves drooping, unfurling), and her decision to take Kade and pursue the Archive shows agency under pressure. However, the core motivation—finding lost conversations—remains abstract rather than tied to a specific personal loss or concrete relational stake that would deepen internal contradiction. Kade's admission "I'm scared" shifts him from hollow brightness but his arc is underdeveloped; he functions primarily as witness. The transformation feels more conceptual than emotionally earned through layered contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows a clear causal chain: fragment found → map assembled → Archive discovered → decision to return and share. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira and Kade etch new truths onto plates, Mira's leaves unfurl fully, and she resolves to tell others—a crystallization of stance with felt cost (the ongoing toxic sky, the fragility of one honest conversation at a time). The drive lens is Causal with Accumulative elements (the gathering of fragments, the layering of honest moments). One meaningful tightening occurs when Kade's candor strengthens Mira, escalating her resolve to pursue the map. Cost is legible: the decision to expose vulnerability in a city built on necessary lies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under toxic rust-colored sky is vivid and pressure-laden, establishing scarcity and suffocation. The setting constrains movement (narrow studio between mushroom farms, tunnels with air recyclers) and the Archive's physical presence—zinc-etched plates lining walls—charges the final image. Micro-setting (her calligrapher's studio, the postal depot) shapes the search. However, spatial choreography during the journey through tunnels lacks concrete waypoints, and sensory detail tilts heavily visual (amber light, sepia glow) without embodying smell or touch that would reflect Mira's hybrid nature more fully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring honest conversation in a city of necessary deception—is signaled early and tightens when Kade's candor physically strengthens Mira, proving the concept can work. The Archive discovery provides the means, and the decision to return and tell others escalates commitment with visible risk (exposure in a fearful society). However, the opposition remains abstract (the toxic sky, the culture of deception) rather than personified, and no on-page voice or social force actively resists their plan, limiting the felt cost of the final choice. The escalation is one meaningful deepening rather than a reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the postal plates—unsaid truths preserved against the day when candor might return—and avoids direct moralizing until the final restored inscription, which edges close but stops short of sermon. The wilting/unfurling motif tracks Mira's response to honesty and dishonesty with concrete bodily cost. The ending offers a resonant answer: small truths as resilience against systemic fear. However, the conceptual framing ("something older and more resilient began to bloom again") leans slightly abstract, and the phrase "brave enough to listen" in the final line borders on platitude, softening an otherwise strong thematic landing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Mira's perceptual signature (her leaves as emotional barometer, her calligrapher's precision). Dialogue is spare and goal-driven: Kade's "I'm scared" carries subtext and advances plot. Diction stays consistent—lyric but grounded—and the narrative distance modulates appropriately (close during discovery, wider during exposition of the oasis's drying). However, the phrase "hollow brightness people used now" tells rather than shows the vocal pattern, and Kade's speech lacks distinct idiom, reading generically articulate. Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentences vary in rhythm and the opening anchors voice effectively ("gilded-leaf calligrapher's fingers trembled"). Information density is high in the Archive discovery sequence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the way people spoke to each other" followed by "Conversations became transactional, clipped," and "words rest when they're too true to be spoken, waiting for someone brave enough to listen" echoes the earlier setup without adding new pressure. The phrase "something older and more resilient began to bloom again" is generic metaphor. Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "watched") cluster in the middle third without voice necessity. Minor scaffold: "She said nothing, and he left uncomfortable" tells rather than shows his discomfort.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The hybrid plant-person who wilts near dishonesty is a fresh specificity, and the postal Archive of unsaid truths offers a non-obvious angle on post-collapse communication. The map-under-floorboards mechanic grounds the discovery. However, the broader frame—post-apocalyptic greenhouse city, toxic sky, rationing and fear—is a familiar template, and the emotional arc (rediscovering lost human connection through archival fragments) follows a well-worn path. The transformation comes through the calligrapher's precision and the leaf-response system, which personalizes the premise enough to lift it above purely derivative work but not into bold originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's decision to follow the map, invite Kade, and return to share the Archive drives all major turns. Her calligrapher's precision enables the map assembly, and her leaf-response system (wilting/unfurling) provides a physical constraint that validates honesty. She is on the page throughout and her choices are causally central to closure. Early signal, multiple beats, closure linkage, and causal pressure are all strong. Her specificity (gilded-leaf, calligrapher) is irreplaceable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The zinc-etched postal plate fragment appears in three beats: discovery under floorboards, nightly rereading that drives obsession, and the Archive discovery where thousands of plates reveal the system. The inscription "...where words rest when..." seeds the theme and is completed at closure, reweighting prior material. Mira and Kade etch their own plates, making the object participatory at closure. Early signal, beat involvement (three touches), closure linkage, and specificity are strong. Slight swappability: another archival medium could serve with edits, but zinc-etching fits the postal/preservation logic well.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Candor in small moments shapes on-page action: Kade's admission "I'm scared" physically strengthens Mira, proving the concept. The Archive's purpose (preserving unsaid truths) and the decision to share it with others turn candor into tactics. The concept drives the central conflict (dishonesty drains Mira; honesty restores) and appears in the closure (etching honest plates). Early signal, causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage are solid. However, the concept is thematic as well as tactical, and some beats lean more reflective than choice-constraining.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The wilting-near-dishonesty attribute appears in four beats: the opening establishes Mira has "grown thin and papery," Kade's hollow brightness makes her leaves droop, his candor makes them unfurl, and at closure they "unfurl fully" and "catch light like stained glass." The trait constrains her socially (she cannot tolerate the city's necessary lies) and enables the plot (her leaves verify truth, making the Archive meaningful). It drives the central stake, shapes her motivation, and charges the final image. Early signal, irreplaceability, closure linkage, and visible cost are exemplary.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rereading the fragment occurs in two beats: Mira "reread the postal fragment each night" (obsession anchor) and "reread the original postal fragment one final time" at closure, where the full message is restored. The action seeds the mystery and pays off thematically at the end, but it does not itself create a major turn—map assembly and the journey do that work. The action is present early and at closure but functions more as ritual than causal lever. Lyric resonance is strong; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The shredded map under floorboards is discovered early (inciting incident), assembled through weeks of calligrapher's precision (method shapes the middle), and leads directly to the Archive (payoff). The method is irreplaceable: Mira's specific skill enables the map reconstruction, and the map's deliberate concealment adds mystery. Setup, development (assembly constrains her time and attention), and closure participation (the map delivers the Archive) are all strong. The mechanics matter and are dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under toxic sky appears in every major beat: the amber light filters through panels, the sky presses against glass (constant threat), neighborhoods are former conservatories, tunnels house air recyclers, and the Archive exists in a forgotten postal depot. The setting supplies scarcity (dried oasis, rationing) that drives the cultural shift to dishonesty, creating Mira's central conflict. At closure, "the toxic sky pressed down, but inside the Archive, something older...began to bloom"—the setting charges the final image through contrast. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability are strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the oasis dried three years ago" anchors the cultural shift (loss of water and honesty) that creates Mira's wilt and the story's premise. However, the three-year gap functions as backstory rather than live pressure; no present countdown or seasonal urgency tightens decisions. The weeks Mira spends assembling the map indicate duration but not escalating time cost. The timeframe sets context and is causally relevant but does not constrain tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where lost conversations go" is established early (fragment leads her to search), dramatized through action (map assembly, journey, Archive discovery), and rewarded at closure (she finds the Archive and decides to restore candor). The desire conflicts with the city's culture of necessary lies and her physical frailty. However, the motivation is somewhat abstract—she seeks a concept (lost conversations) rather than a specific person or confession—which limits the felt interpersonal cost. Friction between want (truth) and survival (necessary lies) is legible.</comment>
