<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to rekindle the realm is clear, but her fragmented state renders her more a symbolic vehicle than a character making choices under pressure. The dissolution at the end reads as predetermined by her nature rather than a decision with visible cost—she "felt herself growing thinner" passively. Internal contradiction is absent; she never hesitates or struggles against her fate. The embodied emotion and micro-choices that would earn higher bands are replaced by atmospheric description.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of fragment-gathering that builds toward the dawn restoration, and closure arrives on-page as Elara dissolves into light—a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (bound release enacted). Orientation anchors appear early (mirror world, greenhouse, scattered consciousness). However, the cost feels thematic rather than felt: Elara's dissolution is framed as fulfillment, not sacrifice, weakening the "visible cost" requirement. The causal chain from humming to dawn-threads to blooming trees to spreading light is more associative than because/therefore, fitting the lens but reducing tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse supplies vivid, purpose-driven detail: skeletal trees, mica window layers, luminous fragments. The mica window constrains Elara's action (she must align fragments "just right") and charges the closure by resonating with her songs. Spatial choreography is clear across the greenhouse and settlements. Minor issue: the "mirror world" frame remains abstract; "where everything existed in reverse shadow" never affects a choice or tactic on the page, reading as ornamental high-concept rather than functional constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle the dying realm) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara's scattered nature nearly prevents focus, resolved by remembering the songs—but this is told summary rather than a dramatized reversal with visible alternatives foreclosed. The escalation from humming to louder singing to spreading dawn-threads reads as smooth intensification without a clear narrowing of options or a trade-off that alters tactics. Elara's agency is minimal; she enacts a pre-scripted role. The dissolution carries thematic resonance but lacks the felt cost or protagonist-driven decision that would lift this into high bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of "bound release" emerges through the lullaby lyric and Elara's final dissolution, earning credit for coherence and image-based work. The woven dawns and forgotten songs create a non-literal answer to the central question (how to heal fragmentation). However, the final paragraph edges toward summary ("found wholeness in dissolution, binding the realm by releasing herself") rather than letting the image speak. The swaddling/release motif recurs purposefully but borders on over-articulation. No overt moralizing, and the conceptual repricing (community healed through individual sacrifice) lands with some force.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited focalization on Elara. Perceptual signature is present (luminous fragments, skeletal branches) and the prose modulates appropriately as pressure builds. Diction remains within the focalizer's idiom. No dialogue to assess. Minor slip: "This was the bound release she'd always carried" in the penultimate paragraph is slightly over-articulated, where the image could have done the work. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Syntax and rhythm support the lyric-accumulative mode without becoming sluggish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally high; no major loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("luminous moths," "threads of gold and rose") is vivid and mostly coherent. Two issues lower the score: (1) "bound release" is named twice in final beats where image could replace label, edging toward thematic echo (−0.3). (2) Sentence openings in the middle third show mild template cadence: "They had been sung," "The melody was simple," "The mica window began," "The woven dawns responded" (−0.4 for template-cadence cluster). Information density is adequate; momentum is steady but not propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mirror-world premise and fragmented memory-keeper are conceptually fresh, and the "woven dawns" image is evocative. However, the emotional arc (scattered healer sacrifices self to save community) follows a familiar template without a sharp, non-obvious inflection. The "forgotten songs as binding agent" is a solid folkloric touch but not transformed by specific lived detail or moral calculus. Risk-taking in structure (fragment-consciousness POV) is present but does not fundamentally heighten stakes. The ending feels anticipated rather than inevitable-in-hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara (scattered memory keeper) is present throughout and drives the gathering/singing sequence. Setup and development gates are met. However, her "choices" read as enactments of her nature rather than decisions under pressure—she remembers the songs, hums, sings louder, drifts outward. No moment where she weighs alternatives or pays a visible cost for choosing one path over another. Closure participation is strong (she dissolves as the realm heals) but passive. Swappability: a different fragmented entity could perform the same role with minor edits. Score reflects functional but non-agentic integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mica window appears in setup (the greenhouse's heart), development (fragments orbit it, layers resonate with song frequencies), and closure (the woven dawns slip through it). It constrains Elara's action (she must align fragments "just right" to see the dawns) and is causally active in the middle turn (resonating with voice frequencies to let dawn-threads enter). The layered-sheet detail is specific and irreplaceable. Strong closure linkage: the window is the aperture through which the solution arrives. Deduction for late-middle first functional use (around 30% mark); earlier mention is descriptive only.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Woven dawns (core concept) shape the dominant stake (Elara must gather them to rekindle the realm) and are present in setup, development, and closure. They are the object of pursuit and the mechanism of resolution. The image of mornings "tangled... in a great tapestry" is vivid. However, their mechanics are abstract—they "respond" to song and "slip through" mica without clear rules that constrain tactics or force trade-offs. Causal pressure is moderate; specificity is high (gold/rose threads, wrapping buildings like swaddling hands). Cost connection is indirect (Elara dissolves as the dawns spread, but the dawns themselves impose no on-page price). Score reflects solid integration with room for sharper constraint or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Knits communities together" (attribute) is present as Elara's function and appears in setup (songs "knit communities together across distances"), development (she sings over homes to reconnect settlements), and closure (communities "knit back together"). It constrains her tactic (she must use songs, not force) and enables the resolution. However, the attribute is more thematic than dramatized—no on-page scene shows the friction or cost of knitting; people simply "emerged, blinking in wonder" and began to sing. No visible trade-off or resistance that would demonstrate constraint with price. Swappability: "unites" or "binds" could replace "knits" without structural change. Score reflects purposeful but under-dramatized integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Swaddle (action) is embedded in the lullaby's purpose ("meant to swaddle newborns"), metaphorically enacted as Elara sings and the dawn-threads "wrap around the buildings like gentle hands that swaddle infants," and thematically reprised in "bound release—about wrapping something tight so it could grow strong enough to break free." It shapes the method (song as binding agent) and charges the closure image (communities wrapped in dawn-light). Causal pressure: the swaddling motif justifies the gathering-then-releasing arc. Specificity and irreplaceability are high; the swaddling metaphor is inseparable from the bound-release theme. Minor deduction: the action is metaphorical rather than literal, reducing on-page dramatic weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Forgotten songs (method) appear in setup (Elara "remembered the forgotten songs"), drive the development (humming draws fragments together; louder singing loosens dawn-threads; spreading songs over homes), and participate in closure (songs "remained, carried now by... living throats"). The method is signaled early and its mechanics matter: songs as binding/knitting force. However, the songs' exact properties are vague—why do they work? The piece tells us they "knit communities together" but never dramatizes resistance, failed attempts, or a moment where choosing a different song would yield a different outcome. Causal pressure is moderate; cost connection is indirect (Elara's dissolution, not the songs themselves). Score reflects solid but under-specified integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse (setting) is present in setup, supplies the mica window and skeletal trees as resources, and frames the closure (impossible fruits grow again). The "shrouded in endless night" detail creates the stakes. However, the greenhouse does not constrain Elara's movement or choices—she drifts through walls without cost, and the night itself never forces a tactical adjustment on the page. The "alchemical" and "impossible fruits" details are evocative but ornamental; they do not alter options or enable a turn. Spatial choreography is clear. Score reflects functional atmospheric use without micro-setting pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"In the mirror world" (timeframe/setting frame) is present throughout but functions more as high-concept flavor than a constraint. The opening and closing lines anchor it ("In the mirror world, where everything existed in reverse shadow" / "in the mirror world, where everything existed in reverse"). However, the mirror/reverse property never shapes a choice, tactic, or cost on the page. What does "reverse shadow" mean functionally? The piece does not teach or apply the rule. The seven-year endless night creates stakes but does not tighten decisions beat-to-beat. Score reflects present-but-ornamental integration; swappability is high (remove "mirror world" and the plot is unchanged).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>To rekindle a dying realm (motivation) is Elara's clear, consistent drive from setup through closure. It is dramatized in her alignment of fragments, singing, and spreading of dawn-light. The motivation faces friction (her scattered nature makes focus "nearly impossible") and is tested in the middle turn. Closure pays off: the realm is rekindled, though at the cost of Elara's dissolution. However, the motivation is never conflicted—Elara never weighs the cost of dissolution against an alternative, never hesitates. The desire is told and enacted but not dramatized as a choice under pressure. Score reflects solid integration with limited friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Bound release (tone) is coherent and purposeful throughout: the lullaby's theme ("wrapping something tight so it could grow strong enough to break free"), Elara's gathering of fragments to enable their release, and the closure's enactment (she dissolves to bind the realm). The tone modulates appropriately—quiet gathering builds to louder singing and spreading light, then quiets again at the final image. The final line ("binding the realm by releasing herself into its light") charges the closure with the tone's central paradox. Minor issue: the phrase "bound release" is named twice in final beats, reducing subtlety. Score reflects strong tonal coherence and closure linkage with slight over-articulation.</comment>
