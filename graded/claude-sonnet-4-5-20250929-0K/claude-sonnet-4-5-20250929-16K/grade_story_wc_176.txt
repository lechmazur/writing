<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is consistently embodied through her technical work and the physicality of reading rope braids. The guilt-to-restoration arc is earned through concrete actions rather than declaration. Internal contradiction appears subtly in the tension between running from loss and building toward permanence. Minor deduction: the forgiveness framing ("gradual thaw") edges toward summary in places where micro-choices could have shown the shift more directly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of translation (rope → card → bronze) by the first third and deepens it through the aurora alignment discovery. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of hearing bells crystallizes options and reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. Cost is legible in "building something that would outlast her" and the years-long commitment. Orientation is swift (who/where/when by opening lines). One meaningful deepening occurs when light patterns make "sound visible."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum constrains choice (preserves the rope, enables aurora-light readings) and charges the final image when light shafts through punched holes. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: aurora colors, ice-cold air cooling bronze, rope texture. The ceremonial rope functions as both setting and tool, directly shaping Maren's work. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. Strong micro-setting integration elevates this into high-band territory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve forgotten names) is signaled early and tightens through the discovery that punched cards can translate sound into light—a meaningful deepening that changes tactics. Agency is clear: Maren's choice to transcribe and cast narrows her path (years of work ahead). Cost is visible in the commitment and the acknowledgment that she's "only just begun." The aurora-alignment moment provides one decisive intensification that reweights options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (memory transcribed through transformation, forgiveness as reconstruction) emerges through concrete particulars: rope braids, punched cards, bronze casting, shadow-light. The final image—hearing bells through shadow patterns—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in "snowmelt ardor" and the shift from "running from" to "building." The piece resists tidy resolution (two hundred names, years ahead) while landing clear thematic weight. No prompt-echo or diagnostic phrasing mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: Maren notices through a caster's eye (lost wax method, molten bronze, wax tablets) and reads texture (three over two, four over three). Psychic distance is stable; reflection anchors in present stimuli (aurora, rope, cards). Diction remains within her artisan lexicon with purposeful compression ("technically gentle," "snowmelt ardor"). No head-hopping. Voice modulates appropriately under pressure without template cadence or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("ribbons of green and violet," "snowmelt ardor") is integrated without overwriting. Minor deduction: a few phrases edge toward elevated diction ("transcribed in many ways," "shaped reality") that slightly exceed the artisan voice under peak stress, and "the aurora sang above her" in the final beat risks lyric overreach. No paraphrase loops or template stems. Sentence openings vary; clarity remains strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost-wax casting, ceremonial rope braids, and street-organ punched cards is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of grief into a tangible preservation method feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is present in the accumulative structure and the reliance on technical craft detail to carry emotional weight. The piece commits fully to its artisan premise without hedging. No proximity to famous lines. Emotional truth anchors the conceptual ambition, avoiding abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present by opening. Maren's caster expertise drives the translation method (lost wax, molds, bronze pouring). Her decision to transcribe names rather than retreat from guilt shapes all beats and the closure. Two gates clear; causal pressure and closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Introduced early ("punched card scrap" first third). Returns with reweighted meaning when holes align with ice crystals to make sound visible—this discovery drives the climax. Handled in at least three beats (finding, marking patterns, holding up to aurora). Closure participation clear.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Core concept shapes all tactics: reading rope phonetics, translating to punched cards, casting in bronze. The notion that "memory could be transcribed in many ways" is dramatized through action rather than told. Drives escalation and closure when light patterns spell out sounds. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" appears twice, tied to her precision with bronze wire and unweaving rope. The trait enables her work but doesn't visibly constrain a choice or create cost. Functional but not essential—a near-synonym (skilled, precise) could replace it with minor edits. Mid-band cap applies.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The act of illuminating (aurora light through punched holes revealing symbols on walls) is the story's climactic discovery. This beat redefines options: "Sound made visible. Names made luminous." Drives closure directly. Removing this exact action would collapse the ending's charge. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Method is signaled early and its mechanics matter throughout: reading braids (three over two, two under one), unweaving sections, translating rhythm to punched patterns. Shapes every middle beat and the closure image. The rope's preservation logic grounds all choices. Specificity and irreplaceability very high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sanctum provides resources (ancient rope, ice-cold air for casting) and enables the aurora-light discovery. Setting pressures the work (preserving crumbling fibers) and charges the final image when ice crystals align with holes. More than postcard; micro-setting integration strong across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "after forgiving yourself" frame structures the entire arc. Forgiveness is dramatized as transformation ("gradual thaw," finding the card, transcribing names). The timeframe tightens decision (years ahead, rope crumbling) and shapes the ending stance. Not a live clock but a clear before/after with cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Desire to preserve forgotten names is dramatized through every beat: unweaving rope, marking wax, pouring bronze. Conflicted in "running from what she'd lost" versus "building something that would outlast her." Friction between grief and restoration drives all choices. Closure participation unmistakable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" (thaw, spring coming, gradual warmth) modulates coherently from frozen guilt to active creation. Tone charges the final image ("for the first time since the fire, she heard the bells"). Not static; the warmth intensifies as pressure builds. Strong integration without forced reprise.</comment>
