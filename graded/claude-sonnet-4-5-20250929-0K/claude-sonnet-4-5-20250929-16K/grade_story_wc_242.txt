<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Iris is defined primarily through occupation and symbolic action rather than embodied interiority under pressure. The piece gestures at "cultivated estrangement as both art and service" but never dramatizes a micro-choice that reveals contradictory impulses—she moves through the routine without visible cost or friction. The woman and man callers are sketched through their confessional content, not through choices that alter tactics. No genuine internal conflict acts in scene; the protagonist executes her established method without obstacle or trade-off until the close.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The closure image ("proof that nothing truly ended") offers thematic repricing but lacks visible cost on the page—Iris ends where she began, smiling in her circle of light. The loop structure is taught early and held through, qualifying as Accumulative, but no meaningful tightening occurs: the seventh-night intervention is summarized rather than dramatized, and no choice forecloses a path. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. The piece reads as a single continuous ritual rather than a pressure-driven arc, meeting Accumulative criteria minimally but not achieving the density increase or cadence shift that would charge the final image with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The subway utility tunnel, phone booth, and glass harmonica disc anchor space and texture vividly. The disc's prismatic shadows and the tunnel's breath work as micro-setting that charges atmosphere. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Iris operates freely within her established workspace. The setting supports tone and concept but does not pressure the protagonist at a decisive beat, capping entry to the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconnecting estranged people—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Iris encounters no opposition, resource limit, or moral friction; every intervention succeeds off-stage. The "seventh night" moment summarizes her method rather than dramatizing a live choice with visible cost. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the loop perpetuates without escalation. Agency is present in her system design but not in a peak choice under pressure at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the glass harmonica, phone booth, and loop structure: second chances travel through cracks, endings contain beginnings. The final image ("proof that nothing truly ended") resonates without overt moralizing, and the grandmother's line seeds the motif effectively. However, the piece declares rather than dramatizes its thesis—"to teach endings how to begin" is stated outright, and Iris never confronts the limits or costs of her cultivated estrangements. The thematic answer is consistent but too tidy, avoiding ambiguity or counter-pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and voice is distinct: "melodically haunted," "cultivated estrangement as both art and service," rhythmic control in phrases like "night after night in her obsolete phone booth." Dialogue feels natural and advances plot efficiently. Brief filter verbs ("could hear") appear but do not flatten urgency. The perceptual signature—Iris noticing prismatic shadows, copper threads—remains consistent. No head-hopping or POV leakage. The voice is controlled and atmospheric, supporting the Accumulative lens without artifacts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean and rhythmically varied, with vivid images: "prismatic shadows," "copper thread of hello," "waters seeds." No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs mar the flow. However, passages like "collector of estrangements both deliberate and accidental" and "architect of impossible reconnections" lean toward thesaurus elevation without adding density. The phrase "cultivated estrangement as both art and service" is stated twice, verging on scaffold. Information density is moderate; several summary blocks compress action that would benefit from scene. No major artifacts obscure causality, but the line-level work does not reach the high compression or propulsion of the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The underground phone booth operator and glass harmonica offer a fresh synthesis, and the loop-as-structure integrates with the theme of second chances. However, the core emotional arc—mediating estranged relationships through gentle intervention—is familiar, and the piece does not transform it through specific lived friction or a non-obvious moral calculus. Iris's work succeeds without complication; the stakes never force her to choose between competing goods or confront the cost of her manipulation. The specificity of setting and object elevates but does not fully escape the template of the benevolent secret helper.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Iris is present throughout and her routine shapes every beat. She makes micro-choices (when to play the disc, how to phrase questions, whom to call on the seventh night) but none involve visible cost or alter her established method. The seventh-night intervention is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening causal pressure. Early setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, but swappability (any compassionate listener could perform the role with minor edits) −0.6 and summary-only key action −0.6 land the score in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The glass harmonica disc appears in the opening description, is played during two caller scenes, and returns in the final paragraph. Its "melodically haunted" notes create atmosphere and are said to reach through phone lines, but it does not constrain a choice or shift tactics under pressure. The grandmother's backstory frames its symbolic weight (music travels through cracks), and the final reprise reweights it lyrically, qualifying for lyric-resonance allowance. Early setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, but ornamental use without causal pressure −0.7 and no cost connection −0.5 yield low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Cultivated estrangement" is stated outright in paragraph four and restated in the penultimate paragraph as Iris's motivation. It frames her work thematically but does not constrain an on-page choice or create a dilemma. The piece tells us she cultivates estrangements "sometimes by delaying messages, sometimes by gentle suggestion" but never dramatizes such an intervention with visible cost or friction. Present but ornamental, with a lyric final echo that reweights meaning modestly. Setup +0.5, closure linkage (thematic) +0.7, but ornamental −0.8 and swappability −0.6 hold it under 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Melodically haunted" appears as a descriptor for the glass harmonica's notes in paragraph two and is repeated verbatim in the closing paragraph. It colors atmosphere but does not enable or constrain action—there is no trade-off or cost tied to this quality. Label-only use across two mentions without dramatized pressure. Present +0.3, closure reprise +0.5, but label-only −0.6 and no cost −0.5 land it in the low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The loop structure is introduced in "The loop had begun," reinforced through repeated caller scenes, and closes with "The loop was endless." The concept organizes the narrative and the final image derives its thematic charge from the loop's perpetuity. However, the loop does not create a reversal or tightening—it is a descriptive pattern rather than a causal mechanism that narrows options. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, but no causal pressure (the loop perpetuates without friction) −0.8 and summary-only seventh-night intervention −0.6 yield mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Wrong number" is signaled in the first caller beat ("Wrong number," Iris said gently, but she didn't hang up), recurs with the second caller and the pizzeria friends, and is verbally echoed in the penultimate beat ("Wrong number," someone said. "Right place," Iris answered). The method shapes Iris's seventh-night tactic (dialing one digit off) and is integral to the thematic closure. Early setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but the seventh-night intervention is summarized rather than dramatized −0.6 and the method's mechanics are asserted rather than shown under pressure −0.4, landing mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The subway utility tunnel is established in the opening line and its atmosphere (curved walls, single bulb, prismatic shadows, the tunnel's breath) recurs throughout. It provides a vivid spatial anchor but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—Iris operates freely within her workspace. Early setup +0.7, present across beats +0.9, closure (she remains "underground") +0.6, but ornamental use without causal pressure −0.7 and no cost tied to the setting −0.5 yield low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Between the hum of streetlamps" anchors the ritual in paragraph two and is echoed in "Above, the streetlamps hummed their evening song" near the close. The timeframe colors atmosphere but does not tighten a decision or create urgency—no clock pressures Iris's work. Setup +0.5, closure reprise +0.6, but ornamental (no tactical constraint) −0.8 and vague tracking (days pass without measurable pressure) −0.6 land it below 4.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To teach endings how to begin" is stated outright as Iris's motivation in the middle third and restated in the thematic close. It frames her purpose but is never dramatized through a conflicted choice or visible cost—every intervention succeeds off-stage, and Iris encounters no friction between her wants and the price of her work. Setup (mid-story) +0.4, closure linkage +1.0, but told-only without friction −0.8 and no on-page cost −0.5 yield high-5s.</comment>
