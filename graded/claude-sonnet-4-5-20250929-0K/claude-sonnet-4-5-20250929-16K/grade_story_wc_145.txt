<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's intellectual curiosity is embodied through concrete actions—translating symbols, tracing condensation patterns, cross-referencing charts—but her decision arc remains observational until the final paragraph's resolve to venture onto the ice. The predecessor functions more as exposition than pressure. Interior voice is consistent and professional, though the peak realization ("They don't begin. They return.") edges toward epiphany without sufficient embodied cost to anchor the transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors promptly (falcon arrival, outpost, atlas editor). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's understanding crystallizes in the final third, reweighting her mission from "where rivers begin" to "where they return," and her commitment to venture onto the ice tomorrow charges the ending with undeniable forward pressure. Cost is conceptual and felt—she inherits her predecessor's danger and isolation—but the decision to act remains one beat ahead of the page, limiting the visible price paid in the closure moment itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rusted outpost, condensation on glass, and frozen lake are purpose-driven and layered: rust-red residue links windowsill to lakeshore; condensation patterns teach her the convergence logic; ice darkness signals subsurface currents. The falcon and its canister ground the opening beat. Micro-setting (window glass, corroded frame) constrains her method of discovery and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the true river source—is signaled early and tightens through the coordinate revelation and condensation-pattern insight. The reversal (rivers return rather than begin) reweights her understanding, but the escalation is primarily cognitive; the external pressure (predecessor's disappearance, "worrying tranquility") remains atmospheric rather than forcing a traded cost on the page. Her resolve to go onto the ice tomorrow is charged but deferred, so the cost at closure is more anticipatory than paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the condensation metaphor and cyclical hydrology: origins and endings collapse into one another. The phrasebook marginalia ("They don't begin. They return.") risks thematic statement but is earned by prior pattern-work. The final lines offer resonance without moralizing, though "The distinction...might not matter" leans slightly explanatory. Subtext operates cleanly in silence, gesture, and the falcon's "ancient eyes."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable, third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is editor-specific: she reads symbols, cross-references charts, traces water paths as code. Diction is controlled and professional ("atlas editor by trade," "microscopic imperfections"). The aside "You clever bastard" injects voice texture. No head-hopping; filter verbs are sparse and apt. Dialogue is minimal and functional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor well. Clarity is high, though "singular convergence point, working in reverse" and "deep time or geography she couldn't yet map" edge toward abstract summary when concrete image would sharpen. Minor scaffold in "She lit the oil lamp, though afternoon light still filtered" (the "though" clause adds little momentum). No loops or template cadence; information density is strong in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The cyclical-hydrology premise and condensation-as-key are fresh inflections on "cartographer at remote outpost." The convergence logic (rivers ending where they begin) is non-obvious and earned through on-page deduction. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The falcon-messenger and phrasebook tropes are familiar but personalized through rust residue and marginalia. Transformation test passes: plot depends on these exact details.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara appears throughout, translates the message (~30% mark), cross-references charts (~50%), and commits to ice expedition at closure. Her dry wit ("Took your time," "You clever bastard") colors two beats. Her choices drive the accumulative discovery but the final decision is announced rather than enacted on the page, capping causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The phrasebook is retrieved early (~20%), used to translate symbols (~30%), and its dog-eared page returns with the predecessor's marginalia ("They don't begin. They return.") at ~70%, reweighting her understanding and shaping closure. Three distinct beats; the dog-ear signals prior use and inheritance. Strong setup-development-payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Singular convergence" frames her research question from paragraph two, the coordinates point to one lake center (~40%), and the seventeen-tributary convergence (~60%) forces the cyclical realization that defines closure. The concept shapes her tactics (cross-referencing, pattern-tracing) and reweights the ending image. Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Subtly confident" is attributed to the predecessor's marginalia style (~35%) but does not constrain Mara's on-page choices or recur with cost. It characterizes the absent predecessor rather than enabling a trade-off. Functional texture but swappable phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Herald" appears in the translated symbol cluster (~35%) and links to season-watching tribes, cueing the cyclical logic. Mara recognizes she must "herald this discovery" (~75%), reprising the term. Two beats; the action seeds the theme and closure insight but does not itself create a turn—translation of all symbols does that work collectively. Present and thematic but not irreplaceable as isolated action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Condensation appears early (oil lamp draws it, ~25%), Mara traces droplet paths and notes they follow imperfections (~50%), then matches the pattern to lake currents (~60%), culminating in "condensation's wisdom" at closure (~95%). The method is signaled, its mechanics matter (microscopic routes, mineral corrosion), and it is the hinge for her discovery. All three gates; high causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The outpost frames the opening, its rust-stained sill and corroded frame supply evidence (~50%), and its position as a watching-post explains the "worrying tranquility" (~65%). The frozen lake's coordinates and dark current-patches drive the convergence insight (~60%) and the ice surface is the target of tomorrow's expedition (closure). Setting shapes discovery method and charges the ending; not easily swappable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The falcon's return opens the story and the message triggers investigation, but "after" functions as a scene anchor rather than a pressure device. No countdown or urgency tied to the return itself; Mara reflects that the bird "made remarkable speed" but this does not tighten her decisions. Present in setup; minimal development or payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rivers-source question is named in paragraph two, labeled "the question that had consumed her professional life," and every investigation beat (translation, chart cross-reference, condensation tracing) pursues it. The cyclical realization reweights the question at closure and her resolve to go onto the ice dramatizes continued pursuit. Desire is consistent, on-page, and conflicted with safety (predecessor's disappearance). Strong setup-development-payoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Worrying tranquility" is named mid-story (~55%) and explained as "expectant" silence rather than peaceful, modulating tone from atmospheric to charged. The phrase returns near closure (~85%) as Mara "sat in worrying tranquility," charging the final image. Two beats; tone coheres and supports the Charged Poise ending, though the exact phrase arrives late. Solidly integrated but not indispensable to earlier beats.</comment>
