<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sara's investigator role motivates her choices throughout, with embodied emotion in the trembling hands and jaw-set moments. The inherited-memory conceit introduces contradictory impulses ("fragments that felt older, inherited"), but these never complicate her decision path—she processes them and moves forward without genuine internal conflict. The closure choice (submitting evidence) feels predetermined rather than wrestled from competing goods; no visible cost appears beyond "worth the cost of liberation," which remains abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative elements (lantern motif). Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words. The closure lands on-page (she emerges with evidence, ready to act), but the cost remains asserted rather than felt: "some investigations were worth the cost of liberation" tells us there's a price without showing forfeiture, consequence, or tactical constraint. The water-level discovery that proves pre-drowning placement provides one meaningful tightening, satisfying minimal escalation. The lens holds, but the RR lacks visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The subway tunnel is richly textured (dripping water, concrete chamber, brass lantern, silt boot prints) and constrains her investigation spatially. The lantern provides light and thematic weight but does not materially alter a tactical choice—she could work with a flashlight. Sensory detail is well-filtered through investigator priorities (scratches, fibers, water marks). The setting participates in closure (emerging into "rain-washed daylight") with tonal charge, qualifying for mid-7s despite the lantern's functional replaceability.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose Marcus's murder vs. career destruction) is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening: discovering the fabric fibers and water-level contradiction narrows her options to full exposure or complicity. However, Sara never seriously considers signing Chen's report; no on-page moment dramatizes the pull of self-preservation against truth. The cost is declared ("worth the cost") but not shown—no job loss, confrontation scene, or visible forfeiture on the page. Agency is present but the trade-off remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of inherited courage and truth-as-freedom emerges through the lantern and ancestor parallel. The final image (lantern flame holding steady, ready to let findings "reverberate") offers resonance but leans on the verb "reverberate" as thematic shorthand rather than a concrete reconfiguration. "Some investigations were worth the cost of liberation" edges toward thesis statement. The particulars (scratches, fibers, water marks) ground the investigative arc, but the ancestor memory remains ornamental—it doesn't complicate her choice, only decorates it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV, third-limited, remains stable with strong perceptual signature (investigator's eye for scratches, fibers, boot prints). Diction is mostly controlled, though "fortified vulnerability" and "entangled memories settle into clarity" drift toward elevated abstraction. The phrase "empirical observation" appears multiple times as a formal anchor consistent with her profession. No dialogue to test multi-voice. Psychic distance is consistent. Interior texture reflects her methodical mind under pressure, and the lens holds cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies well; information density is high in the evidence-gathering beats. Two paraphrase loops: "made deaths like his possible" / "preventable death" recurs without added pressure; "reverberate/reverberating" appears four times, twice in the same paragraph, creating synonym churn around the prompt keyword. Template cadence in "She found... She documented... She felt..." across adjacent paragraphs (−0.4). Figurative language is generally clear, though "entangled memories" and "fortified vulnerability" are prompt imports that feel affixed rather than organic. Artifacts do not obscure closure but accumulate to cap the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The investigator-versus-corruption frame is familiar; the lantern's inherited-freedom lineage offers a fresh emotional layer but doesn't transform the core plot. The drought-ending timeframe is underused (Marcus was placed before flooding, a good twist, but the drought's citywide stakes vanish). "Entangled memories" as psychic inheritance reads as mystical convenience rather than a risky premise followed to consequence. Solid execution of a template with one or two specific inflections (pre-flood placement, ancestor lantern) that don't fully escape the median.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sara's investigator role is present throughout and drives her evidence-gathering choices. She photographs, measures, documents—decisions that shape all middle beats and enable the closure (emerging with findings). Her professional lens filters every perception. Present in setup (paragraph 2), development (fabric fibers, water marks), and payoff (final decision to expose). The role is essential but slightly generic; any diligent investigator could perform these acts. Strong causal work and closure linkage push this into the 6.5–7.0 range.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The lantern is mentioned in the opening line, held throughout, and appears in the final sentence ("lantern's flame held steady"). It provides light and thematic resonance (ancestor's courage), but Sara never makes a tactical choice because of it—she could use a flashlight without altering any beat. Two touches (open, close) with thematic reprise, but no causal pressure or cost tied to its specific properties. Lyric-resonance allowance qualifies it for mid-5s; lack of middle-scene constraint or enabling caps it there.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Entangled memories" appear once in paragraph 3 as a reflective aside (hands clawing, water, metallic fear) but do not shape any subsequent choice or tactic. Sara processes the sensation and continues her investigation unaltered. The concept is ornamental rather than functional—removing it would not break any plot turn or closure. Present in setup (late first third), absent from development and payoff. Functional but replaceable with "empathy" or "imagination."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Watchfully calm" is described twice (paragraph 2 "watchfully calm exterior," paragraph 6 "set of her jaw, the slight tremor"). It characterizes her demeanor but does not constrain or enable a single on-page action with visible cost. She maintains composure while working—a trait that fits but could be swapped for "methodical" or "focused" without structural impact. Label-only mentions (−0.3). Present in setup and middle, but no payoff in closure image and no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Reverberate" appears four times: water dripping reverberates (paragraph 1), camera clicks reverberate (paragraph 4), sounds reverberate together (paragraph 7), ready to let findings reverberate (final line). The repetition charges the closure image and ties acoustic persistence to investigative persistence. The verb shapes the final stance (her truth will echo through power). Early signal, recurs across beats, and the closure image depends on it. Some synonym churn (−0.3), but strong closure linkage and thematic integration justify mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Empirical observation" is named three times (paragraphs 2, 4, 8) and demonstrated throughout: photographing, measuring, noting fibers, water marks, boot prints. The method shapes every middle beat and enables the closure (documented evidence). It is signaled early (paragraph 2), drives development, and appears in paragraph 8's final assembly. The phrase itself is slightly formal but consistent with her professional voice. Essential method with strong causal work and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The subway maintenance tunnel is present throughout, provides all spatial constraints (sealed panel, dripping water, silt preserving boot prints), and supplies the evidence that drives the investigation. Setting enables discovery (fabric fibers, water-level marks) and charges the closure (emerging from underground into daylight). Early signal, development (all evidence found here), and payoff (ascent to street level as liberation). The setting is indispensable to the plot and thematic movement from darkness to light.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"After the drought ends" is mentioned in the opening and provides the reveal that Marcus was placed before the tunnels flooded—a key causal turn (paragraph 6). The timeframe is essential to that discovery but does not tighten decisions or tactics elsewhere; Sara's investigation proceeds at her own pace. Present in setup, enables one major beat, and is referenced at closure (rain-washed daylight). Shapes one turn but does not create ongoing pressure. Mid-5s for single-beat causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Breaking free from Chen's controlling influence is the stated motivation (paragraph 4) and drives Sara's decision to document rather than sign off. The friction between career preservation and truth-telling is declared but not dramatized in a moment of wavering—she never considers capitulation on the page. The motivation is present in setup, implied in middle beats (continuing to work despite threat), and referenced at closure ("Chen's influence had already begun to crack"). Functional and necessary but lacks embodied conflict; the choice feels predetermined.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Fortified vulnerability" is named explicitly in paragraph 6 ("set of her jaw, the slight tremor") and threads through the piece: trembling hands with calm exterior (paragraph 2), feeling exposed yet strengthened (paragraph 6). The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure (tremor increases underground, steadies at emergence). The phrase itself is elegant but slightly abstract. Present across beats and in the final image (flame "held steady"), charging the closure. Tone integration is strong; the label feels imported rather than emergent, capping it in mid-5s.</comment>
