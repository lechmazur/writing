<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marta's interiority is concrete and character-particular: her damaged hands, her listening, her choice to hum despite management. Her motivation evolves from seeking understanding to active remembering with visible cost ("she would remain, and she would sing"). The final renunciation—staying when others fled, placing the bolt, continuing to sing—forecloses the option of leaving with her answer and carries embodied weight. Internal contradiction is present (seeking healing yet choosing to stay in oppressive silence) and her micro-choices (humming, moving corridors, placing the bolt) reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (cobalt fortress, bellhop, three months, post-accident). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story layers discoveries (bolt, ash marks, Silent Choir history) toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration where Marta's decision to remain and sing reweights the silence with visible cost (she forgoes leaving, commits to defiance). The closure is Earned Stasis with Charged Poise—her stance crystallizes around active remembering, and the cost (remaining, risking management's ire, carrying the weight) is legible in the final paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when she finds the ash marks and understands the unpardonable silence, which then drives her final commitment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, spiral staircase, and piano indentations constrain Marta's choices and charge the closure. The ash marks on the steps become the pivot that shifts her understanding and tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "four deep indentations," "slight discoloration," "snow that never seemed to melt." The stairwell itself becomes the crucible where discovery happens and where she later hums, making the micro-setting essential to the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety—is signaled early and tightens when Marta discovers the ash marks, which narrows her question to acknowledgment versus erasure. The tightening is meaningful: her humming becomes active defiance after the discovery, and management's request to stop raises the cost. Agency manifests in her decision to remain and sing despite opposition, forecloses the path of leaving, and the price (endurance, risk, isolation) is visible. One clear deepening drives the escalation under the Accumulative lens, and the final image reweights the stakes with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—the cost of safety requires forgetting, and remembering requires defiance—emerges entirely through concrete particulars: the avalanche, the conversion to hotel, the piped-in music, the ash marks, Marta's humming. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "the fortress would learn to carry sound again" reweights the entire premise without stating a moral. The piano bolt and ash marks constrain her final choice and charge the closure. Subtext operates cleanly in "seraphically mundane," "unpardonable silence," and the management's request to stop humming. No thematic echo or label-speak mars the final beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited throughout; perceptual signature is distinct (her damaged hands, the listening posture, her attention to marks and silence). Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated: "seraphically mundane," "ghost-weight," "frostbitten hope" feel organically integrated. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during the stairwell discovery, wider during historical exposition). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats. The brief exposition on the Silent Choir is anchored to her present listening and tilts her later choice to hum, satisfying BRR requirements.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally, and paragraph structure supports beats. Minor template cadence appears in the opening exposition ("Then came the avalanche. Twenty-three students buried. Twenty-three voices extinguished") but the parallelism reads purposeful and does not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn touch the closure beats. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges "remain" and "sing" with cost. A slight register elevation ("seraphically mundane," "unpardonable") fits the lyric-textural mode without violating POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-accident recovery with the Silent Choir tragedy and the choice to remain as active remembering feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of the bellhop role into a defiant witness is earned through concrete particulars (bolt, ash marks, humming). The story resists the template "haunted place" plot by focusing on the cost of erasure rather than supernatural vengeance. Emotional truth—grief, defiance, embodied healing—anchors the originality. The premise could drift generic but is saved by specificity: the ash marks, the nerve regeneration, the bolt placement. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marta's choices create key turns: staying when others fled, discovering the marks, humming despite management, placing the bolt, deciding to remain and sing. Her observation shifts to decision early and repeatedly. She is present in setup, drives middle beats (discovery, humming, placement), and anchors the closure (remain and sing). Causal pressure is high; her agency shapes the ending. Cost is visible: she forgoes leaving, risks conflict, commits to defiance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piano bench bolt appears in two distinct beats: found behind the radiator (first third) and placed on the staircase step beside the ash mark (closure). It anchors Marta's commitment and reweights the silence with physical presence. However, it does not constrain middle choices or shape tactics between discovery and placement; its role is symbolic reprise rather than causal driver. The closure linkage is strong but middle development is thin, capping the score below 7.0 despite setup and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Unpardonable silence" shapes stakes explicitly: the fortress's silence is demanding acknowledgment, management covers it, Marta defies the erasure. The concept alters tactics (her humming, moving corridors, placement of the bolt) and drives the final commitment. It appears early ("unpardonable, demanding acknowledgment"), constrains middle choices (the piped-in music is a failed attempt to cover it), and charges the closure ("she would remain, and she would sing"). Cost is visible: endurance, risk, defiance. The concept is irreplaceable; swapping it would dissolve the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Seraphically mundane" is used once to describe Marta's silence with guests and fits her character texture. However, it does not constrain an on-page action with cost; it labels her demeanor without altering tactics or stakes. The trait is consistent but passive. It appears early, contributes to tone, but lacks middle development or closure participation. The lyric resonance is present but the element remains more descriptive than causal, placing it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Remain" is the story's spine: Marta remains when staff flee, remains through winter, and the final commitment "she would remain" redefines all prior staying as active defiance rather than passive endurance. The action appears in setup, drives middle beats (carrying bags, humming, placing the bolt), and anchors the closure with visible cost (forgoing leaving, accepting isolation and conflict). Major turns trace directly to this action. Swapping it would collapse the stakes. The repetition across beats accumulates pressure and charges the final image with cost. Irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ash marks as "slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase" drive the key turn: Marta's discovery shifts her understanding and tactics. The method is signaled early (she climbs the staircase repeatedly), its mechanics matter (twenty-three marks, one per student), and it enables her final choice (placing the bolt beside the first mark). The discovery constrains her later actions (humming in the stairwell, defying management). The method is present in setup, shapes the middle beat (discovery and interpretation), and directly informs the closure. Specificity is high; the marks are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress supplies the spatial crucible: the spiral staircase where discovery and defiance occur, the radiator where the bolt is found, the corridors where she hums. Snow and isolation pressure her choice to stay. The conversion from conservatory to hotel embodies the erasure theme. The setting enables the ash marks, constrains her movements, and charges the final image (the fortress learning to carry sound). It appears in setup, shapes middle tactics (which corridors, when to hum), and is reweighted at closure. The fortress is essential but shares pressure with the staircase micro-setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Nerve regeneration frames Marta's arc: "feeling would return gradually," her hands grip the railing, and "by spring, when...sensation fully returned to her fingertips, Marta could hold the piano bench bolt without it slipping." The timeframe tightens her endurance (forty-seven days noted, through winter to spring) and the parallel between physical and moral healing is legible. However, the regeneration does not constrain middle choices with immediate cost; it provides metaphorical coherence more than tactical pressure. Setup and closure are strong; middle development is implied rather than dramatized, placing it in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To understand the cost of safety" is dramatized in every beat: the avalanche, the conversion, the piped-in music, the ash marks, Marta's choice to defy erasure. The motivation is conflicted (healing versus staying in oppression) and drives visible choices (humming, placing the bolt, remaining). Friction between want (understanding) and cost (endurance, risk) is on the page. The motivation appears early, shapes middle beats (discovery, defiance), and is reweighted at closure ("the cost of safety would be paid...but not with erasure"). It is irreplaceable and charges the final image with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Frostbitten hope" is coherent throughout: the snow that never melts, the oppressive quiet, Marta's damaged hands, the bolt as "small offerings against an unpardonable silence." Tone modulates with pressure (closer during discovery, more resigned during exposition, defiant at closure). The final image ("frostbitten hope, perhaps, but hope nonetheless") explicitly charges the ending and reweights the dominant stake. The tone is purpose-driven, consistent, and elevates the closure without becoming static. It appears in setup (winter, cold, silence), develops through middle beats (listening, discovery), and crystallizes at closure.</comment>
