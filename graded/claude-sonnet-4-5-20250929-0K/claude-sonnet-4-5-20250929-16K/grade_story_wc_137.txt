<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's arc from burned-out physician to engaged translator shows clear motivation, and her medical background embodied through "hand steady from years of surgery" grounds her character. The interiority carries diagnostic self-awareness ("courageously kind to her patients until kindness hollowed her bones") that trends toward therapy-speak, though it doesn't flatten peak beats. Internal contradiction appears weakly: her skepticism versus Amit's patterns, but the tension resolves too smoothly without genuine struggle—she moves from "sympathetic skeptic" to faithful transcriber without a visible cost that forecloses her prior stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece anchors orientation promptly (tower, clifftop, Elena) and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: whale songs → tile discovery → visions → understanding → transcription builds density toward the autumn closure. The final image—Elena remaining to transcribe, having "learned that some symphonies required belief not in magic, but in connection"—offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), but the cost is more asserted than shown on the page. The turn from flight to commitment reads as thematic claim rather than a dramatized choice that narrows options or exacts visible price, keeping this out of the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tower's "walls crumbling just enough to let the wind carry whale songs inland" and its function as "vast recording device" constrain Elena's understanding and charge the final image of her remaining. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through POV: "felt it in her teeth, in the instruments that trembled without cause." Spatial choreography stays coherent across the tile discovery, visions, and transcription beats. The micro-setting (tile, tower-as-instrument) actively shapes her choices and the ending, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elena seeking "space for reflection after the hospital burned her out"—is signaled early and tightens when the tile visions force her to confront entangled grief. One meaningful deepening occurs (tile memories → understanding Amit's project → her commitment to transcribe), but agency remains observational rather than decisional. The autumn choice to remain is a stance crystallization, yet no visible tradeoff or foreclosed path appears on the page; she gains understanding without losing skepticism's protection or facing a concrete cost that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—memory and connection as forces independent of individual minds—emerges through tile mechanics and whale migrations rather than assertion. The final image attempts resonance: "invisible mathematics binding whale to star to human heart," but drifts toward abstraction and prompt echo ("sculpting space"). Subtext operates in the tile's shifting numbers and Amit's journals. However, the closing line packages the theme too explicitly ("symphonies required belief not in magic, but in connection"), stepping toward a stated moral when a concrete image would carry more weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elena; perceptual signature shows through "dead light safer than living flesh" and medical framing. Diction is controlled and voice-particular, with purposeful compression in "not the whales themselves, but the resonance they left." No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Distance modulates appropriately under pressure. The prose rhythm supports the Accumulative design without artifacts, and the focalization of Amit's visions through the tile is clean—Elena experiences them as memories "not her own," maintaining the boundary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("Ever the sympathetic skeptic" anchors trait and stance in three words). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. Clarity and momentum remain strong throughout; figurative language ("kindness hollowed her bones," "invisible mathematics") is purposeful and doesn't muddle peak beats. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly; the final image attempts to recharge motifs. Minor register drift in "entangled memories binding ocean to cosmos" elevates diction slightly beyond the established medical-practical voice, but doesn't obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—crystalline structures as memory storage, whale songs as data—offers a fresh synthesis of migration biology and consciousness studies. Specific details (magic square tile, obsidian carving, frequencies affecting stone) ground the concept. However, the frame echoes familiar "burned-out professional flees to remote posting and finds meaning" templates without strong transformation. The tile mechanics and whale-star correspondence feel invented for thematic service rather than inevitable from established world logic. Elena's arc from skeptic to believer follows a well-worn path; the emotional truth is present but not sufficiently particularized to escape the template's shadow.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena as "sympathetic skeptic" is established early and her skepticism tests Amit's patterns, but her key turn—from doubt to transcription—occurs through passive reception of tile visions rather than active choice under pressure. She observes, understands, then commits, without a visible decision point that narrows options. Present across beats (discovery, visions, transcription, autumn choice) and shapes the ending, but the trait doesn't constrain a pivotal action with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tile appears in discovery beat, vision beat, and transcription sequence, with evolving function: fallen object → memory conduit → transcription tool. Its properties (obsidian, magic square, numbers that shift with whale songs) are specific and irreplaceable. It enables Elena's understanding and drives her autumn commitment. Closure linkage is strong—she "transcribed faithfully" with "tile still shifted beneath her fingers." Causal pressure is high; the tile's mechanics narrow her interpretive options and provide the means for her new purpose.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Entangled memories" functions as the tile's mechanism (Amit's and Elena's grief "tangled," whale consciousness persisting across time) and shapes her understanding that "memory could persist beyond individual minds." It alters her options by revealing a "library of whale consciousness" that justifies her transcription work. Present across middle and ending beats, though more as thematic lens than tactical constraint. The concept reweights the premise at closure but doesn't impose visible cost or narrow a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Courageously kind" appears as backstory label ("was courageously kind to her patients until kindness hollowed her bones") but doesn't constrain an on-page action. The trait motivates her flight and colors her reception of Amit's work ("read his notes with affection and doubt"), yet no present-tense choice tests the attribute with cost. It's told as past character summary rather than demonstrated through a tradeoff that shapes her transcription decision or autumn stance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Transcription is signaled in the title of Amit's work and becomes Elena's central action: "began to transcribe where Amit had left off," "traced the patterns as they emerged," "transcribed faithfully." The action drives the middle sequence and closure—her decision to remain and continue transcribing defines the ending. Irreplaceable: the story hinges on this specific act of translation from vibration to number to meaning. Present across three beats (understanding, nightly work, autumn commitment) with escalating significance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Forgotten patterns" appears as the tile's shifting arrangements ("sequences Amit had sketched in his final journal entries") and Elena's work translating them. The method is signaled early (Amit's journals, tile numbers rearranging) and constrains her approach—she must wait for dusk crescendos and trace emerging patterns. It shapes her attempts and provides the mechanism for understanding. Present in discovery, transcription, and ending beats, though the mechanics remain somewhat abstract; the patterns themselves don't impose a tactical cost or test.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tower is established immediately with specific function: "walls crumbling just enough to let the wind carry whale songs inland," operates as "vast recording device" turning whale songs into stone memory. It provides the resource (resonant structure) that enables the tile's function and Elena's transcription. Spatial detail is concrete (clifftop, open tower, floor tile setting) and the setting choice—isolation for reflection—motivates Elena's posting. Present in opening, middle mechanics, and closure image of Elena remaining. The tower's acoustic properties constrain what she can learn and when.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"During whale migration season" frames the story and provides the recurring pressure: "each evening" the tile shifts at dusk when "whale songs crescendoed," and "when the whales returned south in autumn" marks the closure beat. The timeframe supplies the mechanism (seasonal migrations leave traces) and creates rhythm for Elena's work. It shapes tactics by limiting transcription opportunities to migration periods and marks progression from spring storms (tile dislodged) to autumn commitment. Not a live countdown but a meaningful seasonal arc that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To sculpt space for reflection" is Elena's stated motive for choosing the posting, repeated at closure ("sculpting space for anyone else"). The desire drives her flight from the hospital and frames her autumn decision to remain as translator. However, the motivation is more asserted than dramatized—her need for reflection doesn't face concrete friction or test that forces a tradeoff. The phrase recurs as thematic bracket rather than evolving through conflicted choices. Present early and at ending, shaping her stance but not constrained by visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" functions as controlling metaphor and tonal anchor: whale songs "just beyond human perception," "symphony of species speaking across time," "some symphonies required belief." Tone modulates from clinical exhaustion (hospital burnout) through wonder (tile visions) to quiet commitment (autumn transcription), staying coherent across turns. The final image—Elena transcribing "what couldn't be heard"—charges the motif with purpose. Purposeful and present across beats, shaping atmospheric pressure without static repetition, and integral to the closure's resonance.</comment>
