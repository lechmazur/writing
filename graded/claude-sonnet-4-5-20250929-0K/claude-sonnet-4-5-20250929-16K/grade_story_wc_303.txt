<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Iris's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("mulberry ache," "perforated destiny"), and her micro-choices under pressure (sketching the blueprint, refusing easy favor) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The ferns function as a credible contradiction—she hears them but cannot always act on their simple needs—though the Director's line "The ferns say you're troubled" risks ventriloquism. Internal conflict between preservation instinct and Empire critique is embodied in her palm-pressing ritual and coffee-reading, avoiding therapy-speak. The final choice to propagate the design is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of "luxuries, unable to remember," meeting the cost requirement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture (coffee-reading frames futures, final act is motivated decision). Closure is a Decisive Change with Charged Poise overlay—Iris sketches the blueprint, knowing exile may follow but music will multiply—visible cost on the page ("exile, maybe, or worse"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (provenance researcher, velvet observatory, midsummer light). The tightening is legible: authentication demand → coffee-reading shows two futures → she chooses propagation over Empire favor, narrowing options with felt consequence. One minor seam: "Dream of anything" in Kemble's line verges on abstract stakes rather than dramatized test, but the closure decision remains grounded and causally linked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The velvet observatory, ice violin, coffee cup, and ferns anchor the single scene with selective sensory detail (purple-draped walls filtering light, cool glass of display case, coffee residue spreading like continents). The micro-setting (display case, corner desk, potted ferns) constrains Iris's tactile ritual (palm-pressing, tilting cup) and charges the final image (sketching at her desk while ferns cheer). Orientation is clear and sensory hierarchy reflects professional focus—she notices violin lattice and coffee patterns more than ambient sound. One friction: "bruised twilight that never quite resolved into clarity" is evocative but slightly ornamental; the provenance-research occupation is gestured at but not deeply proceduralized, acceptable at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: authenticate for Empire favor versus honoring the violin's intended purpose (propagation over possession). One meaningful tightening occurs when Kemble delivers the sunset deadline and "Dream of anything" promise, forcing Iris to weigh futures shown in coffee stains. Agency is clear—she chooses to sketch the blueprint and spread it underground, a renunciation of Empire favor with visible cost (exile, loss of security). The micro-turn when she shifts from backward authentication to forward-looking propagation narrows her options under causal pressure. Coincidence does not resolve; the final act is hers. Price is legible: "exile, maybe, or worse" and the closing "difficult one illuminated" confirm a path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from violin-as-ghost, coffee-stain futures, and ferns' instinctive understanding of scattering—preservation versus possession, propagation over captivity. The "perforated destiny" motif (futures with holes, possibilities leaking like light through lace) accumulates pressure and reweights the premise without stated moral. The final image—instructions spreading, ice violins multiplying in villages beyond Empire shadow—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (what does it cost to honor beauty?). One minor slip: "that mulberry ache in her chest she'd learned to recognize as the price of choosing right over easy" edges toward thematic echo, nearly stating the moral, but the surrounding particulars (ferns cheering, perforated paths closing) ground it in scene work and embodied choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close; psychic distance contracts under pressure (coffee-reading, blueprint sketching). Perceptual signature is character-specific: Iris notices threads, histories, futures, plant-whispers—professional and magical filters blend coherently. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("provenance researcher," "ice crystal harvested from the northernmost glacier," "perforated destiny"), with no register drift. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Kemble's "Dream of anything" and Iris's "What if it's not meant for them?" carry subtext and goal pursuit. One friction: "The ferns say you're troubled" risks cute omniscience, but the piece has already established plant-telepathy, so it reads as consistent world rule rather than head-hopping. No elision debt; the narrative withholds futures selectively (coffee stains shift) but reveals them when stakes demand.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift between subject-first, prepositional, and participial without template cadence. Information density is high—most lines do double duty (e.g., "ice crystal harvested from the northernmost glacier" anchors object and world rule; "ferns whispered constantly about light and water" establishes telepathy and their simplicity). One paraphrase loop: "preserved by methods its creator had taken to the grave" and "its creator had meant it to be played, not imprisoned" restate the maker's intent across paragraphs without added pressure. Minor figurative muddle: "bruised twilight that never quite resolved into clarity" and "mulberry ache" are lush but verge on ornamental in adjacent beats. No grammatical errors; spatial choreography (display case, corner desk, observatory windows) tracks cleanly. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line ("some things must be scattered to survive") closes with image and cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of ice violin + coffee-stain divination + plant telepathy + provenance research is specific and feels organic rather than checklist-driven. The transformation of "preservation vs. possession" through underground blueprint propagation avoids the stock "rebel steals artifact" plot by letting the Empire keep the original while freeing its essence—a non-obvious moral calculus. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous lines. One friction: the velvet observatory and "perforated destiny" phrase risk purple ornament, and the ferns-as-chorus device ("ferns cheered silently, understanding growth better than anyone") verges on quirky convenience. The emotional truth (weighing security against integrity) is grounded in Iris's micro-choices and the coffee-stain futures, lifting the piece above template. Risk-taking (divination method, plant-telepathy as plot driver) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting modest bonus consideration within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Provenance researcher role is established early (first paragraph) and shapes the key turn: Iris's professional skill (reading object histories) pivots to reading futures, enabling her to see the violin's intended purpose and choose propagation over authentication-only. The role constrains her choice—she's hired to authenticate, pressured by deadline and Empire favor, and must work within those limits while subverting them. Present in setup, middle (coffee-reading decision), and payoff (sketching blueprint as researcher who now frees rather than merely certifies). Cost is tied to role: exile jeopardizes her professional standing. Swappability test: another occupation (curator, historian) could work with edits, but "provenance researcher" specifically charges the tension between past-reading and future-reading, and her tactile ritual (palm-pressing) feels occupation-linked.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ice violin is present in setup (display case, first paragraph), middle (Iris presses palms to case, reaches forward into its purpose), and payoff (she sketches its blueprint to propagate). It drives two beats: the authentication demand and the propagation choice. Causal pressure: the violin's "complex silence" and desire to be copied rather than imprisoned motivate Iris's final act. Specificity matters—"carved entirely from ice crystal," "survived three centuries without melting"—this exact object, not a generic artifact, enables the thematic question (preserve vs. propagate). Visible cost: freeing the design risks exile. One friction: the violin itself remains static (it doesn't melt, shatter, or sound); Iris handles it via the case, and the plot centers on her choice about it rather than physical interaction with it, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Perforated destiny is signaled early ("lately, they had begun showing her what was coming") and named explicitly ("Perforated destiny, she had come to call it—futures riddled with holes, possibilities leaking through like light through lace"). It shapes middle choice: coffee-reading shows two paths (shattered violin vs. blooming music; herself in luxuries vs. exile with multiplying violins), and Iris picks the "difficult one illuminated." The concept constrains tactics—she chooses knowing the holes, the costs. Present in setup, middle decision, and payoff ("The perforated destiny closed around one path"). Cost is tied to accepting one future over another. One friction: the phrase risks ornamental poeticism and is stated rather than fully dramatized—readers see the consequences described but not enacted on the page. Still, it reweights the premise (divination shows options, not certainties) and alters Iris's tactics, qualifying for mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plant telepathy is introduced early (first paragraph: "she could hear the thoughts of the potted ferns") and appears in three beats: ferns whisper about light/water, worry about Iris's hydration via Kemble's relay, and cheer her blueprint decision. It enables one tactical moment—Kemble's "The ferns say you're troubled" confirms her distress and pressures her choice—and charges the final image ("The plants whispered encouragement, knowing instinctively what she had learned"). Cost is conceptual: the ferns' simple needs contrast her complex moral calculus, underscoring what she risks. Swappability test: the telepathy could be replaced with another magical trait (object-reading alone, precognition without plants) with moderate edits; the ferns function more as thematic accent (growth, scattering) than causal necessity. Present in all three gates but not indispensable to plot structure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Propagate is the story's causal hinge: Iris's final act is to sketch the violin's blueprint and spread it underground, directly opposing the Empire's desire to "silence" and possess the artifact. Setup: authentication demand implies one-owner control. Middle: coffee stains show propagation outcome (music multiplying, villages beyond Empire). Payoff: she works through the afternoon, "instructions spreading through underground networks." The action redefines options—authenticate alone vs. authenticate and propagate—and is the decisive change with visible cost (exile). Irreplaceability: swapping "propagate" for "steal" or "destroy" would require structural overhaul; the thematic question (possession vs. scattering) depends on this exact verb. Cost and closure both trace to this action. Appears in all three gates, drives two beats, and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Coffee-stain divination is signaled in setup (second paragraph: "lately, they had begun showing her what was coming") and used in the middle beat: Iris tilts her cup, sees two futures (violin shattered vs. music blooming; herself in luxuries vs. exile), and again after Kemble's ultimatum (stains show her older, unable to remember why she cared). The method shapes her attempt—she uses divination to weigh consequences before choosing propagation. Present in setup, middle decision, and implied in payoff (she's seen the cost and acts anyway). One friction: the mechanics are gestured at ("tilting the cup," "stains shifted, forming patterns") but not deeply proceduralized—how reliable is it? does it drain her?—leaving the method slightly ornamental. Still, it constrains her choice (she acts knowing the price) and charges two beats, qualifying for mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Velvet observatory is named in the opening line and anchors the single scene: "purple-draped walls filtering midsummer light," "potted ferns lining the observatory windows," display case and corner desk. It supplies the violin and coffee cup (resources) and isolates Iris for the authentication task. The setting subtly mirrors the thematic question—suspended "between earth and sky," filtering light into "bruised twilight that never quite resolved"—charging tone. Midsummer light is noted but does not tighten the timeline or alter tactics. The observatory constrains Iris's choice spatially (she's hired to work here, the deadline is sunset) but does not supply a tool or obstacle that directly changes her final move. Present in setup and throughout, but mostly atmospheric rather than causally pressuring. Micro-setting (desk, cup, ferns) does more tactical work than the observatory itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "before the promise loses its glow" is invoked once in Iris's reflection: "The promise she'd made to herself was losing its glow—to never let the Empire own something beautiful without understanding what it would cost." It frames her motivation but does not function as a live clock. The actual deadline is sunset ("The Emperor expects your report by sunset"), which does tighten decisions—Iris works "through the velvet afternoon" to finish. Setup: promise mentioned. Middle: sunset deadline pressures her. Payoff: she completes the work by sunset. The "losing its glow" phrase is more thematic echo than temporal constraint; the sunset deadline does the causal work. Swappability: "before the promise loses its glow" could be cut without structural change; the sunset suffices. Present in setup and middle, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation "to weigh a dream against an empire" is dramatized in Kemble's ultimatum ("You're weighing a dream against an empire. Choose carefully.") and in Iris's coffee-reading (futures split: luxuries vs. exile with music). The desire is conflicted on the page—she wants Empire favor ("secured the Empire's favor for life") but also wants to honor the violin's purpose ("what if it's not meant for them?"). Setup: authentication task implies favor. Middle: Kemble frames the choice explicitly, Iris sees both paths. Payoff: she chooses propagation, accepting exile. Friction between wants (security, beauty's integrity) and costs (exile, loss of dream) is embodied in her palm-pressing ritual and the "mulberry ache" as she sketches. Cost is visible. The phrasing "dream against an empire" is stated by Kemble, slightly reducing subtextual credit, but the choice itself is dramatized with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tone "mulberry ache" is established early ("bruised twilight," "purple-draped walls filtering midsummer light") and named explicitly late ("that mulberry ache in her chest she'd learned to recognize as the price of choosing right over easy"). The tone coheres through turns—wistful, elegiac, pressured—and modulates with rising stakes: the observatory's suspended twilight, coffee stains spreading like continents, the violin's "complex silence," ferns' urgent whispers, and the closing "difficult one illuminated." The final image is charged by tone: "ice violins appearing in villages where the Empire's shadow never reached" carries the ache (loss, exile) and the beauty (propagation, survival). One friction: naming the tone in the penultimate paragraph ("mulberry ache") risks over-articulation, but the surrounding particulars (velvet afternoon, plants scattering) ground it in scene work. Tone supports the concept and modulates with pressure, qualifying for mid-7s.</comment>
