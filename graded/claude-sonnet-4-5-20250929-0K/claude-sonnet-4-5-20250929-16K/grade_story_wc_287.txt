<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to "stop hiding" is declared but never dramatized through interior contradiction or embodied struggle. The grandmother's locksmith legacy provides a concrete anchor, but the metaphor (locks as puzzles, light as keys) remains abstract rather than constraining actual choices under pressure. The children are present but generic; their individual reactions and resistance are absent, flattening the relational crucible. Mira's final choice to illuminate the lighthouse feels predetermined rather than earned through on-page conflict between competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: collecting children, lights, boats, then illuminating the lighthouse. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the lit lighthouse crystallizes Mira's public emergence—but the cost is declared rather than shown ("tomorrow there would be questions, maybe consequences"). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The escalation from garden tending to public spectacle is legible but lacks a pressure point that forces Mira to weigh visible trade-offs; the moves feel sequential rather than tightening options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The fire escape garden, harbor, boathouse, and lighthouse are vividly anchored with sensory detail (moonlight, water, rusted railings). The lighthouse windows and flashlight angles provide micro-setting that enables the climax. Spatial choreography across multiple locations (apartment, dock, water, lighthouse) remains clear. The brass tooth is handled twice (pocket, then shown to children) and charges the thematic frame, qualifying as object-as-setting that constrains the lesson Mira teaches.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mira's promise to "stop hiding" after the rose dies—is signaled early. The move from private gardening to public lighthouse illumination provides one meaningful deepening, but no on-page reversal or trade-off narrows her options. The children never resist or question; the fisherman's boats are conveniently available; no logistical or emotional friction complicates the plan. Cost is asserted for tomorrow rather than paid in the scene. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as additive (gather, row, light) without a pressure point that forces Mira to sacrifice or endure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—transformation through persistence, light as agency, unlocking the world—emerges organically from the locksmith metaphor and the lighthouse image. The final illumination offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "stop hiding" without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the brass tooth, the rose's surrender, and the children as "shadows." Minor deduction: the lighthouse lesson ("sometimes you don't need a key… be light itself") edges toward thematic statement rather than purely embodied discovery, and "locksmiths of a different kind" in the penultimate paragraph restates the theme rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance is controlled. Voice is distinctive—lyric, compressed, with purposeful metaphor density ("moon-washed," "luminous harbor," "protected vulnerability"). Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices plants, mechanisms, light, and the children's faces. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the locksmith lesson carries subtext. Minor filter-verb presence ("she watched," "she showed") does not harm immediacy. No head-hopping or register drift. The prose occasionally leans into elevated diction ("wistfully pragmatic acceptance," "quivering hush") but remains voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the opening (rose, grandmother, diagnosis, locksmith trade, brass tooth). Clarity is strong; no loops or synonym churn. Minor scaffold: "The building behind her held its breath—or perhaps she did" is a hedged metaphor that dilutes rather than sharpens. "Protected vulnerability" and "quivering hush" appear as label-insertions rather than emerging from embodied perception. Figurative language is purposeful and mostly coherent, though "vulnerable to the tides" inside the boathouse slightly strains spatial logic (the text implies tides threaten the structure, yet the children wait safely inside).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The fire-escape gardener and lighthouse-as-beacon premise are familiar but executed with specific detail (locksmith's bitting gauge, borrowed boats, flashlight angles). The locksmith metaphor (keys as answers, light slipping through gaps) is fresh in its application to collective action. Risk: teaching children at night, public illumination with declared consequences. The emotional truth—grief channeled into mentorship—feels earned. Minor deduction: the children remain abstractions without individual voices or resistance, and the fisherman's convenient loan and the absence of any logistical friction soften the originality of the central choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira shapes the opening stake (stop hiding), gathers the children, leads the boats, distributes flashlights, and orchestrates the lighthouse illumination. She is causally active across setup, development, and payoff. Her decisions drive all major turns. Deduction: the children and fisherman offer no friction, so Mira's choices feel unopposed rather than tested under constraint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The brass tooth appears in two beats: Mira carries it (setup) and shows it to the children during the locksmith lesson (development). It primes the metaphor (locks, keys, precision) that frames the lighthouse action. It does not return at closure or constrain a choice under pressure. Swappability: another keepsake could serve the same thematic function with minor edits. Present by first third, involved in one key beat, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Quivering hush" appears once as atmospheric description ("the quivering hush that settled over the city's edges at midnight"). It does not shape stakes, constrain tactics, or change options. It is poetic but ornamental. No setup, development, or closure participation beyond mood-setting. Static mention; easily removable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Wistfully pragmatic" is applied to Mira's acceptance of the rose's death in the opening line. It colors her stance but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in a choice. Setup present; no development or payoff. Label-only use; swappable with a similar descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Instill" is used twice: Mira's footsteps "instilling barely a whisper" and her statement "That's how you instill change—not by forcing locks but by moving forward with persistence." The word charges the thematic frame (steady insertion of light/change) and is echoed in the rowing cadence. Setup and development present; the final illumination enacts the concept. Deduction: the verb does not uniquely constrain the mechanics of the climax; "create" or "bring" could substitute with minor tonal loss. Not indispensable but purposefully recurrent.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rowing rhythm is introduced as method ("dipping and rising, dipping and rising, establishing a cadence"), practiced across the boats in synchrony, and sustained through the return journey ("oars moving in perfect rhythm"). It embodies "instill" (gradual, persistent insertion) and provides the physical vehicle for the children's collective action. Setup, development, and payoff all present. The rhythm shapes the emotional texture of the climax. Deduction: the mechanics (how rowing enables the lighthouse approach) are assumed rather than tested; no obstacle requires them to adapt the rhythm.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The harbor is anchored early ("luminous under the full moon"), frames the journey (rowing distance, waterborne approach), and charges the final image ("luminous harbor," "trails of moonlight"). The moonlight enables the visual effect (flashlights inside the dark lighthouse become visible from the city). Setup and payoff present; middle development is scenic rather than tactical. The setting does not impose a constraint that alters Mira's choices (e.g., tide, weather, patrol). Purposeful but not indispensable; the boats could reach any structure at night.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled in the opening beat ("when the final petal dropped, she would stop hiding"), anchors the entire sequence (the petal falls, Mira descends that evening, the action occurs "at midnight"), and governs the emotional stakes. Setup, development, and payoff all hinge on this trigger. Removing it would eliminate the causal impetus for the night's action. The rose's death is the irreplaceable clock that starts the story.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira's desire to "reflect light into dark corners" is articulated to the children and enacted through the flashlight lesson and lighthouse illumination. Setup (the promise to stop hiding), development (teaching and gathering light), and payoff (the lighthouse blaze) all trace to this motive. Deduction: the desire is told in exposition rather than dramatized through friction between wants and costs. Mira never weighs the risk of exposure against an alternative; the motivation drives action but is not visibly conflicted on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is declared in the penultimate paragraph ("in this protected vulnerability") and loosely evoked by the boathouse (sheltered but tide-threatened) and the children's status (hidden yet gathering). The tone modulates from private grief (rose, grandmother) to collective exposure (lighthouse blaze) without breaking coherence. Deduction: the phrase is told rather than sustained through tonal texture across the piece; the ending feels triumphant rather than precarious. Setup and payoff gestures present; middle development is implied rather than charged through sentence rhythm or imagery that embodies both protection and risk simultaneously.</comment>
