<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Iris's motivations are clear and consistent—finding "the one cut" that expresses flight or longing—but her interior life relies heavily on abstract artistic language rather than embodied contradiction. The slide revelation triggers contemplation rather than a difficult choice with visible cost; she studies, understands, and acts without meaningful internal resistance. The final sculpture decision feels like natural extension rather than a path foreclosed. Emotional progression is smooth and cerebral, lacking the irrational layering or flawed micro-choices that would earn higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (Iris, archway, storm) within the opening and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered slide revelations, culminating in a methodology shift. However, the closure unit—Iris beginning her sculpture with the slide as compass—offers Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page. The line "a compass pointing toward connection rather than destination" articulates theme but does not show a visible forfeiture or altered tactic with immediate pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs (slide reveals → navigation methodology), satisfying minimum escalation, but the cost remains oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway constrains Iris's initial choice (shelter) and the slide discovery there charges the closure image through the coordinate system and spiral driftwood patterns. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "turbine-hum of wind," "storm-light," and the physical handling of the slide anchor perception in the present. Spatial choreography remains clear across the archway, van, and final beach. The archway's structural logic (curve redirecting weight) mirrors the thematic scaffold, integrating setting into the conceptual frame without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the design breakthrough for her commission—is signaled early and narrows through the slide's layered revelations. One meaningful tightening occurs when Iris reimagines the installation as "living architecture" rather than static form, deepening her approach. However, no live option is visibly foreclosed; she gains methodology without evident trade-off. The storm forces the archway encounter but does not resolve the design problem—the slide does—creating slight convenience pressure. Agency is present (she chooses to abandon GPS, read landscape, place driftwood) but the cost of these choices remains conceptual rather than immediate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—complexity scaffolded by simplicity, timewoven alliance between past and present artisans—emerges through concrete particulars: the archway's curve, the spiral driftwood patterns, the slide's coordinate system. The final image (sculpture standing until the next storm reimagines it) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the penultimate paragraph's summary ("all of it held together by a spirited understanding that some things cannot be mapped—only known") edges toward overt thematic articulation. The slide as recurring motif accumulates meaning across beats, reweighting prior material at closure, but the alliance remains more asserted than dramatized through friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable throughout with a consistent perceptual signature: Iris notices structural elegance, artistic methodology, and the relationship between form and meaning. Diction remains within her artist's lexicon ("scaffold complexity with simplicity," "perpetually learning") without register drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the slide revelations, moving from immediate observation to meditative reverie without head-hopping. The phrase "turbine-hum" recurs as a voice-motivated textural anchor. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression in the final third ("When the storm cleared...") accelerates toward closure without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentence variety and rhythm support the contemplative tone, and information density is generally high. However, several lines carry scaffold or near-paraphrase: "That was her perpetual quest too, what kept her learning" immediately restates the prior sentence's idea; "through layered meanings, through patience, through scaffold of simple observations" uses template parallelism without additive pressure; "Complexity scaffolded by simplicity, meanings layered across centuries" in the final paragraph loops thematic vocabulary seen earlier. The phrase "timewoven alliance" appears three times, twice in proximity, risking decorative recurrence. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in non-closure beats, triggering −0.6 cumulative in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The magic-lantern-slide-as-teaching-device and the archway-as-structural-metaphor are familiar tropes; the piece executes them competently but does not transform through unexpected synthesis. The storm-forces-revelation setup and the artist-discovers-ancient-wisdom arc follow recognizable templates. Specificity in driftwood sculpture and navigation-by-landmarks offers some freshness, but the emotional arc (confusion → epiphany → inspired creation) could transfer to other media and settings with minor edits. The "timewoven alliance" concept is articulated more than it is embodied through conflicting pressures or non-obvious moral calculus, placing the piece in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Iris is present throughout, and her sculptor identity shapes her perception (archway's curve, driftwood patterns). She makes two key choices: studying the slide rather than sheltering passively, and abandoning GPS to navigate by the slide's landmarks. The final beat—beginning the sculpture—directly ties to her spirited commitment. However, her decisions face minimal resistance; the slide offers methodology without forcing a trade-off between competing artistic paths. Early signal (opening), two beats (slide study, final sculpture), closure linkage present. Subtract −0.4 for limited cost connection and −0.3 for slight swappability (another artist archetype could serve similarly). 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The slide is discovered, handled and studied mid-story, and kept as a compass at closure, appearing in at least three distinct beats. Its layered images (robed figures, Iris herself, coordinates) drive the reimagining action and provide the navigation methodology. The closure line ("a compass pointing toward connection rather than destination") reweights its meaning. Early signal ~30%, causal pressure (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.2), specificity (+0.5). Subtract −0.3 for slight ornamental quality in the final metaphor (the slide's physical properties matter less than its symbolic charge). 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The phrase "timewoven alliance" appears three times, signaling intent, but the concept functions primarily as thematic label rather than stake-altering force. The alliance is between past artisans and Iris, mediated by the slide, but it does not constrain her choices—she adopts the methodology without friction or competing loyalty. Present by midpoint, shapes one beat (the reimagining), touches closure via the summary sentence. Functional but largely ornamental. Setup (+0.5), one beat (+0.4), closure mention (+0.3). Subtract −0.6 for label-only use and −0.4 for swappability (any historical legacy could serve). 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The attribute is invoked twice: "her perpetual quest...what kept her learning after twenty years" and "perpetual learning of those who listen" in the final paragraph. It motivates her openness to the slide's lesson but does not constrain an action or impose cost—learning is portrayed as purely additive. Present early, touches closure, but remains label-heavy. Setup (+0.5), one beat (slide study, +0.4), closure mention (+0.3). Subtract −0.5 for label-only articulation and −0.3 for no visible tradeoff. 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Reimagining occurs explicitly at the story's turn: Iris "began to reimagine everything...a living architecture, pieces that would shift." This action redefines her commission approach and leads directly to the final sculpture. Present at ~60%, drives the major turn, shapes closure. One-beat causal driver (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.0), specificity (+0.4). Subtract −0.3 for slight tell-heavy execution (the reimagining is announced rather than shown through embodied discovery). 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled through the slide's three layers of meaning and explicitly invoked in the final sculpture approach: "read the landscape...through layered meanings, through patience, through scaffold of simple observations." It shapes her navigation tactic and the sculpture's conceptual design. Present by midpoint, enables two beats (reading the slide, finding the beach), touches closure. Setup (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), closure mention (+0.5). Subtract −0.5 for summary-only articulation at closure and slight template phrasing. 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archway forces Iris off the road, provides shelter for the slide discovery, and its structural logic (curve redirecting weight) directly models her artistic breakthrough. The coordinates carved into its representation guide her to the final beach. Present from opening, constrains initial choice, supplies the slide, and its image charges closure. Setup (+0.8), two beats (shelter, coordinate source, +0.9), causal pressure (+1.0), closure linkage (+1.2), specificity (+0.6). Subtract −0.3 for the archway's metaphorical role slightly overshadowing its physical constraint at closure. 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe is established in the opening ("when Iris's phone finally gave up, the GPS dissolving") and bookends the closure ("When the storm cleared, she didn't restart her GPS"). It constrains her navigation method, forcing reliance on the slide's landmarks. However, time is not tracked within the archway reverie; the storm's duration and clearing are vague. Setup (+0.7), constrains one choice (navigation, +0.5), closure callback (+0.4). Subtract −0.5 for untracked middle duration and −0.3 for the GPS failure serving as setup convenience rather than persistent pressure. 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The desire is articulated early ("finding the one cut that would let a twisted branch express flight or longing") and drives her entire commission struggle. The slide offers the scaffold-complexity insight she seeks, and the final sculpture embodies this motivation. Present from opening, drives the slide interpretation and final design. Setup (+0.8), two beats (slide study, sculpture design, +0.9), closure linkage (+1.0). Subtract −0.5 for told-only articulation without on-page friction between competing wants and −0.4 for the resolution feeling additive rather than a choice with visible cost. 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The tone is established via "turbine-hum of wind" and "meditative drone" early, sustained through the reverie beats ("fell into reverie," "studied"), and invoked at closure ("turbine-hum of wind and the perpetual learning"). It modulates appropriately during the storm (urgency) and contemplation (calm), and the final image maintains the meditative register. Setup (+0.6), coherent through turns (+0.5), closure charge (+0.7). Subtract −0.4 for static mood in the middle (reverie does not deepen or tension) and −0.3 for the "turbine-hum" becoming a repeated label rather than an evolving sensory anchor. 6.3.</comment>
