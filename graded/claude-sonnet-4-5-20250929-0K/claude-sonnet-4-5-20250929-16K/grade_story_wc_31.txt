<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority shows clear motivation (discovering his mother's journals) and embodied emotion (throat tightening, trembling hands). However, the peak moment—seeing the "ribbon of gold-green-violet"—slides into convenient epiphany without sustained internal contradiction. The final decision to return to lamps feels declared rather than earned through a visible choice that forecloses another path. Minor slip: "unsure if he'd discovered the color of sound or merely seen what grief wanted him to see" reads as tidy self-awareness that no one has mid-crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (pier lamplighter, harbor, tonight). Drive lens reads Causal: Marcus's months of preparation enable the dive, the dive yields the journals, the journals' revelation shifts his stance. Closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "some mysteries aren't meant to be solved, only witnessed" crystallizes his stance with conceptual cost (renouncing full understanding). The cost is felt but oblique—he returns to lamps with "new reverence" rather than a decisive act that forecloses a live option, keeping this in the high 7s rather than 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken *Meridian* as "cathedral of rust and barnacles" and the waterproof cases create vivid micro-setting that constrains Marcus's dive choices. The sky lanterns create atmospheric pressure ("meteor hush") that charges the opening and closure. The hotel key tag functions as recurring object that reweights meaning at the ending ("lighting each one with new reverence"). Spatial choreography (pier→dock→water→wreck→surface) tracks cleanly. Minor opportunity: the library's brine-suspension could have imposed a physical constraint during retrieval rather than simply housing intact journals.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering mother's journals and the color of sound) is signaled early and tightens once: Marcus's dive, discovery, and the wreck's settling groan. The escalation is linear rather than multiple reversals; the single turn (finding the final entry) deepens understanding but doesn't narrow options in a way that forces a trade-off. Agency at closure is renunciation ("mysteries aren't meant to be solved") with conceptual cost, but the cost feels declared rather than viscerally paid—he simply returns to lamps without visible sacrifice of a live alternative pursuit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (the intersection of perception, grief, and faith) emerges organically from the synesthesia motif and Marcus's inherited fragments of his mother's gift. The final image—"watching how flame and sound painted the night in colors only the faithful could perceive"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The luminous vows escaping the wreck function as charged ambiguity (real or grief-induced vision). Minor slip: "some mysteries aren't meant to be solved, only witnessed" edges toward thematic statement rather than pure implication, though it's embedded in Marcus's stance shift rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with Marcus; psychic distance is controlled and sensory detail reflects his partial synesthesia ("foghorn blasts sparked crimson," "boat bells chimed in violet"). Diction stays character-appropriate with nautical and lamplighter idiom. The prose modulates well under pressure: short sentences during the dive, longer reflection with the journals. Minor slip: "The truth he hid behind was simple enough: he was documenting pier architecture" reads slightly too self-aware for mid-action interiority, edging toward authorial explanation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "Sky lanterns rose like slow-burning stars, their reflected light dancing across the black water where the *Meridian* had sunk forty years ago" anchors event, setting, and backstory). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor friction: "mnemonic system she'd explained once: 'Every sound needs an address, darling, a room number where it lives'" is functional exposition but slightly scaffolds the hotel-key logic rather than letting it emerge through action. Figurative language (cathedral of rust, meteor hush) is controlled and legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthesia, diving archaeology, and grief creates a specific premise. The mother's experiment to translate vows into "chromatic sound" offers a fresh angle on the familiar territory of parental loss and inherited gifts. However, the core arc (descendant seeks artifact from parent's fatal project, gains understanding, returns changed) follows a recognizable template. The "color of sound" conceit is vivid but doesn't transform its trope through lived complication—Marcus's partial synesthesia shapes perception but doesn't create on-page friction or cost that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus (lamplighter) drives all key beats: secures lamps, dives, retrieves journals, surfaces, returns to lamps with altered stance. Present throughout; his choices create the dive turn and the renunciation at closure. His occupation (lighting lamps) charges the final image. Loses points because the ending choice (return to lamps with "new reverence") is more stance declaration than a decision that narrows options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Hotel key tag (*Room 217*) appears early (first paragraph), is handled during dive preparation, explains the mnemonic system ("Every sound needs an address"), and returns implicitly in the final image (lighting lamps, "watching how flame and sound painted the night"). However, it's not physically used in a second distinct beat—it's described, explained, then thematically echoed. Swappable with any keyed mnemonic device without altering story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Luminous vows" drive the mother's fatal experiment, Marcus's search motive, and the climactic vision ("ribbon of gold-green-violet...her luminous vows finally escaping"). The concept shapes stakes (discovering what his mother attempted) and charges the closure (faith that perception can transcend ordinary bounds). The vows are dramatized in the mother's journal entry and the underwater apparition, making the concept tactile rather than merely thematic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Hides behind truth" is present: Marcus disguises archive research as "historical lamplighting practices" to hide his true search for the *Meridian*. This enables his months of preparation without suspicion. However, it's summary-told in one paragraph, never tested or complicated on the page, and doesn't constrain a later choice. The trait could be removed (he simply researches openly) without altering any other beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Signify" appears in the mother's journal: "a frequency that would signify the intersection of all senses." This defines her experiment's goal and Marcus's discovery, shaping his final stance ("some mysteries...only witnessed"). The word is used precisely and thematically charged. However, it's embedded in exposition rather than enacted—Marcus doesn't attempt to signify anything himself, limiting its causal role to framing the inherited question.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Wandering purposefully" is signaled early ("spent months wandering purposefully through maritime records") and describes Marcus's covert research method. It characterizes his approach and enables the dive. However, the mechanics don't constrain a later choice or differentiate from straightforward research—removing "purposefully" or the wandering frame wouldn't alter any beat. Present in setup and thematically reprised ("watching...with new reverence") but functionally replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside the sunken *Meridian* is essential: it houses the mother's journals, drives Marcus's dive, and supplies the waterproof cases that make retrieval possible. The wreck's "groan" (settling hull) creates the climactic vision of escaping luminous vows. The library's brine suspension and brass-fitted door are specific to this setting. Removing it breaks the story's central quest and the closure image. Slight loss: the library could have imposed a physical constraint (time, air, access) during retrieval to raise causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The sky lantern festival creates "meteor hush" (distraction enabling Marcus's dive), atmospheric charge throughout, and frames the opening and closure. The "unusually calm tide" is mentioned as enabling condition. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions—Marcus completes his dive without a visible clock or urgency tied to the festival's duration. The lanterns are more tonal backdrop than tactical constraint, though they do shape the final image (lanterns above, Marcus's lamps below).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To discover the color of sound" drives every beat: inherited from his mother, it motivates months of research, the dive, journal retrieval, and the final vision. The desire is dramatized through Marcus's partial synesthesia, the mother's detailed experiment, and the climactic moment ("he witnessed its voice in shimmering amber"). Friction between wanting full understanding and accepting mystery creates the closure choice. Slight loss: Marcus's own synesthetic experiences could have created on-page conflict (distraction, overwhelming input) to raise the cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" ("that peculiar silence when everyone watches heaven instead of earth") is established early, sustained through the dive's quiet intensity, and charges the final image where Marcus lights lamps "watching how flame and sound painted the night." Tone modulates appropriately: reverent during dive, urgent during the wreck's groan, contemplative at closure. The hush functions as both cover (tactical) and thematic container (quiet mysteries). Coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
