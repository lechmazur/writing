<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and tied to craft ("elegant swoops of script still wet"). The partner's off-stage accusations drive internal conflict, but Marcus's "uncommonly serene" state throughout weakens the contradictory impulses needed for higher scores. The drunk's transformation feels more dramatized than Marcus's own arc, which resolves through reflection rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but the therapeutic framing ("faith: that uncertainty could be a gift") edges toward label-speak at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through the performance and the drunk's epiphany reconfigures Marcus's understanding of his work. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by opening paragraphs). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Marcus's realization about ethical storytelling reweights the premise), but the cost feels implied rather than sharply legible on the page—no tactical choice is foreclosed. The drunk's intervention provides the key turn, though Marcus remains largely passive, receiving insight rather than driving it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is established early with strong sensory detail ("curved walls," "concrete shell," "peculiar half-darkness"). The campfire story stick functions as micro-setting, handled physically across beats and charging the final image when the drunk returns it. Spatial choreography is clean (stage, audience, back row). The setting subtly mirrors theme (old military structure repurposed for subversive art) and the dome's acoustic properties affect the argument's echo, constraining Marcus's emotional state.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical storytelling validated) is signaled early but remains abstract until the drunk's epiphany provides one meaningful tightening. The pressure comes from the partner's off-stage accusations rather than on-page escalation. The drunk's moment ("I can't remember why I was right") narrows Marcus's understanding, but Marcus himself makes no choice that forecloses a path—he observes transformation rather than driving it. Cost is present but oblique: the partnership conflict remains unresolved with only a plan to call tomorrow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the puppet show's method and the drunk's half-formed insight. "Productive uncertainty" and "questions could be more ethical than answers" arise from dramatized events rather than assertion. The final paragraph edges toward explicit thesis ("uncertainty could be a gift") but the image of patrons carrying "half-lit epiphanies like candles cupped against the wind" salvages resonance. The radar dome as container for experimentation and the campfire stick as bridge between oral tradition and experimental theater provide non-literal thematic scaffolding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited through Marcus with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is craft-focused ("elegant swoops," "practiced grace"). The drunk's dialogue ("This is bullshit... No, wait") carries natural rhythm and subtext. Minor filter-verb stack in opening beats ("thought she understood," "accusations still echoing") slightly dulls immediacy but voice remains controlled. Diction stays within Marcus's contemplative register throughout, and the narrative certainty matches what he can know.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high in performance beats. Template cadence surfaces in the partner-conflict exposition: "thought she understood," "accusations still echoing," "words stung because" creates a mild filter-verb stack that slightly dulls the opening. The "meteor hush" metaphor appears twice with slightly different framing ("meteor's silent streak across the sky—all awe, no thunder"), which reads as intentional echo but borders on paraphrase. Propulsion remains strong through the performance sequence with no major loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise (ethical storytelling through subversive puppet shows) transforms familiar artist-validation material through specificity: calligraphy, radar dome venue, campfire story stick, rust-belt seedy bars. The drunk's interruption—stealing the prop then experiencing clarity—offers a fresh turn. The "reverse a moral" frame and "walk it backward" method provide conceptual specificity. Risk-taking in the passive protagonist structure (Marcus as witness to his own validation) is bold but costs some agency. The synthesis of oral tradition, experimental theater, and ethical philosophy feels earned rather than assembled.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus is established early with craft detail (calligraphy brush, puppet preparation). His decision to let the show "end without resolution" and to pack puppets with "uncommonly serene movements" are on-page choices, and the plan to call his partner tomorrow alters tactics. However, the drunk drives the key turn while Marcus observes. Present across setup, middle reflection, and ending with some causal work but not driving the major reversal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The campfire story stick appears in setup (Marcus reaches for it, grandmother's history established), transforms through performance (walking cane, weapon, bridge), the drunk handles it at the turn, and it's returned to stage at closure. Handled physically in at least three distinct beats with meaning reweighted each time. The object's carved symbols and oral-tradition provenance matter to theme. Strong integration but just short of indispensable—another prop could theoretically serve the same function with rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Half-lit epiphanies" shapes the story's stakes directly: the drunk experiences one on-page ("I can't remember why I was right"), audience members share "fragmentary revelations," and the closing image shows patrons "carrying their half-lit epiphanies like candles." The concept drives Marcus's realization about "productive uncertainty" and justifies the method. Present in setup (implied), dramatized at the turn, and charges the final image. Strong thematic integration with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene" is mentioned twice: opening ("remained uncommonly serene despite the argument") and ending ("uncommonly serene movements"). It's labeled rather than constraining choice—Marcus's serenity doesn't prevent or enable any specific action with cost. The trait colors his manner but doesn't create friction or tradeoff. Setup and payoff present but ornamental, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Reverse" appears in the puppet show's question ("When we take the lesson we learned as children and walk it backward?") and structures Marcus's realization about reversing assumptions. The action is more conceptual than physical. It shapes the performance's method and the thematic turn, but could be rephrased as "question" or "invert" without major structural change. Present across beats with thematic weight but moderate causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Subversive puppet shows in seedy bars are established early (three years of performing, rust belt venues), the radar-dome-converted-to-bar setting is detailed, the performance occupies the middle section with puppet manipulation and hand-lettered signs, and Marcus's final insight validates the method ("laboratories," "permission structures"). The method shapes his partner's critique, his defense, and the closure realization. Present in setup, dramatized in development, essential to theme. Strong integration with visible cost tied to partnership friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is established in the opening, provides acoustic properties (argument "echoing off the dome's curved walls"), houses the performance with spatial detail (stage, mismatched furniture, shadow audience), and the "curved embrace" returns in the closing paragraph. Setting enables the performance and mirrors theme (military tech repurposed for art). Setup, development detail, and closure reprise present. Solid integration but not indispensable—another unusual venue could serve with edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The "hush left behind by a heated argument" frames the opening (partner "stormed out twenty minutes ago"), creates the emotional atmosphere, recurs in the audience's "meteor hush," and the "peculiar quiet" after the performance. Time pressure is mild—Marcus prepares across twenty minutes, performs, then reflects. The timeframe colors tone and stakes but doesn't tighten decisions urgently. Present in setup and atmospherically throughout, with moderate contribution to closure mood.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation to explore ethical storytelling is established early (three years of work, partner's critique), drives the performance content ("reverse a moral"), generates the central conflict (partner accuses him of hiding), and resolves in Marcus's epiphany about "spaces where people could revers their assumptions safely." The want creates friction with the partner's opposing view and is tested on-page through the drunk's response. Setup, conflict, and closure all hinge on this motivation with visible relational cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears explicitly twice: the drunk's pause creates "meteor hush" and the audience sits in "that peculiar quiet, the kind that follows a meteor's silent streak across the sky—all awe, no thunder." The tone of contemplative, charged quiet pervades the opening argument aftermath, the "peculiar half-darkness" of performance, and the closing image. Coherent through turns, modulates with pressure (argument intensity → performance focus → reflective ending), and charges the final image. Strong tonal control with purposeful recurrence.</comment>
