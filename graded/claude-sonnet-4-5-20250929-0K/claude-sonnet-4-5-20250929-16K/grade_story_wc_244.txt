<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is vivid and contradictory—"desperately jocular" manifests in embodied choices and voice modulation. The young man's arrival catalyzes genuine vulnerability, but his motivation arrives through dialogue exposition rather than embodied struggle. The final shift from masked performance to unmasked connection is earned, though the young man's naming of her loneliness ("shouting into a void") reads slightly convenient. Micro-choices under pressure (setting down the phone, picking up the moon rock) track cleanly with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly: who (Vera), where (railway station), what (logistics crisis) by the satellite phone opener. The structure follows a single continuous scene with one meaningful deepening: Vera's jocular mask falls when the young man names her loneliness, shifting her approach from performance to genuine presence. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final moment crystallizes her realization that connection, not logistics, addresses loneliness, with the cost legible in her unmasked vulnerability. Causal lens holds; the young man's question ("Why are you...the one who cares") motivates the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The disused railway station with ivy is signaled early and returns in the final line ("ivy rustling"), creating a charged frame. The vine-strangled bench, rusted cart, and overturned bucket provide micro-setting that grounds action. However, the station functions primarily as atmospheric container rather than constraining choice—Vera could conduct this work anywhere with phone and laptop. Sensory detail (ivy as "curious parishioners," "rails led nowhere") is vivid but ornamental at key beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Vera's loneliness masked by frantic logistics) is signaled early and tightens when the young man's question forces confrontation. The Budapest-Bratislava supply crisis demonstrates competence but remains a secondary problem that resolves off-page. One meaningful turn occurs: Vera drops the jocular mask and makes calls "without the jokes, without the mask," forecloses her prior coping strategy. Cost is visible (vulnerability, presence) but the young man's patient waiting resolves too easily—no friction between his need and her emotional risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (connection vs. transactional reciprocity) emerges through concrete action: the moon rock economy, rumor-chain logistics, and the shift from masked performance to genuine presence. The final image ("didn't feel quite so far from home") offers non-literal answer without stated moral. However, the young man's thematic articulation ("shouting into a void") borders on Thematic Echo, explicitly naming what the narrative already demonstrates. The metaphor of logistics-as-cure-for-loneliness is legible through particulars, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: Vera's "bright, brittle" jocularity, compressed directives, and shifting psychic distance when the mask falls. Dialogue carries subtext (the young man's question pursues genuine connection beneath logistical need) and advances plot. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Minor slip: "This was how Vera operated" and "they called her" read as expository scaffolding rather than filtered perception. Diction remains character-bound; no register drift under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high in the logistics beats. Minor loop: "The beautiful anarchy of it—polite, structured, yet completely subverting every official channel" restates what prior action already showed. "Cathedral of controlled chaos" and "crept through cracked windows like curious parishioners" stack metaphors in the opener without later payoff. Sentence-level propulsion is strong in dialogue exchanges but slows in reflective blocks ("This stranger had just named the thing she'd been trying to fix"). No major artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The combination of logistician + moon rock + reciprocity economy + railway-station setting is specific and non-generic. The rumor-chain method and "desperately jocular" voice offer fresh angles. However, the emotional arc (workaholic realizes connection > transaction) follows a familiar template, and the young man's role as catalyst-who-names-the-problem is structurally convenient. The moon rock's origin (astronaut payment) and use as "silent witness" is vivid but its function in this scene is largely symbolic rather than tactically constraining.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's choices drive both beats: the logistics rumor-chain solution and the decision to drop her mask and make calls "without the jokes." She is present throughout and her dual identity (elusive myth + lonely operator) creates the core tension. Removing her profession would collapse the reciprocity economy and the logistics frame that embodies her avoidance strategy.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The moon rock appears in three beats: introduction with backstory, the young man's "appropriate reverence," and Vera picking it up ("felt its impossible weight") when confronting loneliness. It anchors the reciprocity economy conceptually and returns with reweighted meaning (witness to debts → reminder of her own isolation). However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; its function is largely symbolic witness rather than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Reciprocity shapes the logistics backstory (astronaut payment, pay-forward rule) and is explicitly named mid-scene ("reciprocity...couldn't cure the thing she actually suffered from"). It frames Vera's method but does not narrow options or create on-page friction in this scene—the young man does not invoke the reciprocity rule, and Vera helps him without negotiating terms. Present in setup and thematic reflection; absent from the pivotal choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Desperately jocular" is embodied in dialogue ("Magnificent. Absolutely magnificent") and narration ("bright, brittle sound"), constrains her initial interaction, and its removal at the turn ("without the jokes, without the mask") marks visible cost. The trait enables her coping strategy and its foreclosure shapes the ending. Signaled early and active in two key beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Catalyze" appears twice: Vera's line "I can catalyze the help you need" and the final realization "she felt something catalyze—not a supply chain, but a genuine connection." The term frames both the logistical method and the emotional shift, charging the closure image. However, the action itself (making calls, spreading rumors) could be described many ways; "catalyze" functions more as thematic label than irreplaceable mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rumor-chain method is demonstrated on-page in the Budapest-Vienna-Bratislava solution, shapes Vera's tactical identity ("worked through improbable rumor chains"), and contrasts with the unmediated conversation at the end. It appears in setup, middle demonstration, and is implicitly abandoned at closure ("without the jokes, without the mask" suggests direct rather than indirect communication). Method specificity is high and drives two beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The railway station is signaled early, provides concrete micro-setting (luggage cart, overturned bucket, vine-strangled bench), and returns in the final line ("ivy rustling"). However, it does not constrain choice—Vera's work is phone-based and location-independent. The station functions as atmospheric frame and thematic mirror (disused, overgrown, "rails led nowhere") but does not alter tactics or supply resources that affect outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"When the story changes" is gestured at in the title moment ("this was when the story always changed") but no time pressure tightens decisions. The scene unfolds in continuous present with no clock, deadline, or temporal constraint that alters moves. The phrase marks narrative self-awareness rather than diegetic timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Loneliness is dramatized through Vera's frantic logistics, the mask of jocularity, and the realization that "she'd been looking for the cure for loneliness in logistics." It drives her choices (helping others to feel connected) and the final shift (dropping the mask to accept genuine presence). The young man's naming of the void feels slightly expository, but the want-versus-cost friction is visible: vulnerability required to address loneliness conflicts with her elusiveness. Present in all three gates with embodied cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Polite anarchy" is embodied in Vera's method ("polite, structured, yet completely subverting every official channel"), her voice ("desperately jocular"), and the contrast between formal logistics and guerrilla tactics. Tone modulates at the turn ("the desperate jocularity fell away") and charges the quieter ending. The phrase is explicitly stated mid-scene, reducing subtext, but the tonal coherence across beats and modulation under pressure is legible.</comment>
