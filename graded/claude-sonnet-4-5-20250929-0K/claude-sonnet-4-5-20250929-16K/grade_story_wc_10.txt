<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's interiority is concrete and her micro-choices around the tuning fork and sensor setup show agency under pressure. The motivation to transform silence into music is embodied through her work with the conservatory plants and the prototype device. However, the capsizing backstory remains largely summarized rather than inflecting present perception with contradictory impulses, and Claire's character exists primarily to validate Marina's project rather than apply independent pressure. The final self-mapping choice feels slightly tidy rather than revealing a genuine internal contradiction forced by the scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through winterglass imagery, the tuning fork ritual, Claire's thermal mapping, and culminates in Marina mapping her own contentment—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that crystallizes her stance with felt cost (the irreversible trade of hearing for this new art). Orientation is clean within the first 120 words. The escalation is a single deepening (external validation → self-application) rather than a tightening of options, which fits the lens but keeps pressure modest. Cost is legible in the final image: she has accepted transformation over rectification.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is vividly specific (frost patterns that never melt, perpetual winter roses) and functions as both literal workspace and thematic mirror. The conservatory's eternal winter aesthetic directly charges the "unshaken marvels" motif and the final light-refraction beat. The tuning fork, tablet, and sensors are handled tactilely across multiple beats, and Marina's selective attention (mathematical frost spirals, fern curls) filters setting through her new perceptual lens. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout the single-location scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and drives Marina's prototype demonstration with Claire. The scene deepens when Marina moves from external validation (Claire's "It's perfect") to self-application, narrowing her stance from proving the system works to claiming it as her own contentment. However, this is more a lyric intensification than a tightening of options; no live opposition or trade-off forecloses a path. The cost (hearing loss as permanent transformation) is established in backstory rather than tested on the page, keeping agency modest within this single scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the winterglass-as-eternal-aesthetic, the tuning fork ritual, and the heat-map translations: some transformations cannot be rectified, only repurposed. The ending image—Marina mapping her own face to see what music contentment makes—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. "Unshaken marvels" recurs with shifted meaning (first the conservatory's beauty, then emotional cartography). No overt thesis statements mar the final paragraph; the light refraction across plants and Marina's curiosity carry thematic weight through image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (Marina notices frost spirals' "mathematical perfection," fern curls' "precise" architecture). Diction remains controlled and character-appropriate; no filter-verb stacks or register drift. Claire's brief dialogue ("It's perfect") is rendered via mouthing and thermal capture, maintaining the silent-world frame. Minor slip: "impossible to hear" and similar filter phrases appear frequently in the opening, slightly dulling immediacy, but the voice recovers and the final paragraph sustains texture under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Unshaken Marvels" names the project and introduces theme in one beat). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. However, several phrases edge toward stock lyricism: "frozen cathedral," "invisible symphonies," "topographical map of heat signatures" are vivid but slightly familiar. The capsizing summary in paragraph two uses passive nominalizations ("the sudden pressure change rupturing something irreparable") where active syntax would sharpen. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the final paragraph lands without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The heat-mapping emotions system is a specific, non-obvious synthesis of thermal imaging and musical notation, and the winterglass conservatory provides a memorable setting. However, the core emotional arc—trauma survivor finds new purpose through invented art form—follows a recognizable template (loss → compensatory creation → self-acceptance). The piece transforms this through Marina's silence and the conservatory's perpetual winter, but the final beat (contentment self-mapped) resolves into a tidy affirmation without a non-obvious moral calculus or risky ambiguity. Freshness rests more in setting detail than in the transformation's stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marina (capsize survivor) is present throughout and her choices—opening the tuning fork case, positioning sensors on Claire, deciding to map her own face—create key turns. The capsizing is established early and primes her motivation, but the trauma itself does not constrain a present choice or force a trade-off within this scene; it enables her project rather than complicating it. Two gates (setup, closure self-mapping) plus one middle beat (Claire test) lift the score, but the survivor status functions more as backstory credential than live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tuning fork case appears in three beats: opened on the workbench (paragraph 4), held "like a talisman" and struck (paragraph 11), and implicitly present as Marina returns to it before the ending. Its vibration-without-sound motif charges the theme of transformation. However, the case itself is static; the tuning fork does the thematic work. "Ornate," "tarnished silver," "velvet" are vivid but the object does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Early signal and thematic reprise support mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Unshaken marvels" is named explicitly (paragraph 5) and defines Marina's project: beauty beyond sound that trauma cannot diminish. The concept drives her choice to stay in the conservatory rather than "rectify" via therapy, and it reappears in the final image (mapping contentment as a marvel). It shapes the dominant stake (translating silence) and the ending reconfigures it from external wonders to internal emotion. Three gates (setup, middle justification, closure charge) and clear causal linkage to tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Silently expressive" is demonstrated through Marina's "hands conducting invisible symphonies" (paragraph 2) and her gestural communication with Claire (paragraph 6: "Marina gestured for Claire to watch"). It enables the scene's mechanics and constrains her world (she cannot hear). However, it does not force a visible trade-off or cost within this scene; the silence is accepted rather than tested. Early signal and beat involvement, but minimal pressure or closure participation beyond label.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Rectify" appears twice: other survivors "determined to rectify their trauma through therapy" (paragraph 2) and Marina realizes "some things couldn't be rectified, only transformed" (paragraph 12). It articulates the thematic question but does not create a major turn; Marina has already chosen transformation before the scene opens. The word recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, qualifying for lyric reprise, but it is easily swappable ("heal," "fix") and does not drive on-page tactics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions is signaled early (paragraph 4: "refined it, calibrated it specifically for microexpressions"), demonstrated in the middle (Claire's memory mapped to D minor with "unexpected major lifts"), and its logic shapes the entire scene's mechanics. The method constrains Marina's approach (she must position sensors, process thermal data, read notation) and enables the final choice (mapping her own contentment). The system's specificity—thermal → musical notation—is irreplaceable and drives at least three distinct beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is established in the opening line and anchors every beat: frost patterns that never melt, perpetual winter roses, the "precise temperate zone," and the spectrum-band light refraction at closure. It supplies the exotic plants Marina tends and provides the "silent sanctuary" that justifies her work. The conservatory's eternal-winter aesthetic mirrors the theme and charges the final image (light across plants as Marina maps herself). Three gates, thematic linkage, and closure participation, though it functions more as resonant backdrop than active constraint on choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After noise becomes impossible" is anchored by "Three years had passed since...the icy water...stolen...her hearing" (paragraph 1) and recurs implicitly throughout (Marina feels the tuning fork's vibration "though hearing nothing"). The timeframe enables the project (two years to develop the system, paragraph 4) and justifies her stance (she has had time to choose transformation over rectification). However, it does not tighten present decisions; the scene is post-acceptance rather than a live negotiation with silence's pressure. Early signal and thematic consistency, but modest causal force.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation—"to translate silence into music, to give voice to a world that had become impossible to hear"—is stated by Claire (paragraph 6) and dramatized through Marina's sensor setup, Claire's test, and the final self-mapping. It drives the dominant stake and shapes every choice on the page. The friction between Marina's lost hearing and her new compositional method creates the scene's core tension. However, the motivation is accepted rather than conflicted within this scene; no competing want or fear complicates it. Three gates and clear causal pressure, but the cost is historical rather than live.</comment>
